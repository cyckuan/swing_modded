CONTENDER PROVES NO MATCH FOR JONES
</HEADLINE>
   (n) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Roy Jones Jr. did his civic dutyfor his
hometown crowd here at the Pensacola Civic Center on Saturday
night. Unfortunately it involved battering a police officer - an
overmatched 39-year-old New York City policeman named Richard
Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (39-1) stopped Frazier (8-4-1) at 2 minutes 59 seconds of
the second round, after crashing a left hook to Frazier's temple
and then catching him with a right blast as he headed for the
canvas. Frazier got up at the count of eight, but his legs were
unsteady. Referee Armando Garcia mercifully stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-featured bout of the evening Shane Mosley (31-0)
retained his International Boxing Federation lightweight
championship by stopping Golden Johnson (15-3-2) at 2:59 of the
seventh round. It was also a mismatch. In a 4-minute span between
the fifth and sixth round, Johnson didn't land a punch. He didn't
land a punch at all in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very satisfying,'' Jones said of his stoppage of
Frazier. ``I'm sorry the fight got stopped early. But I don't stop
them. I just fight. I don't pick the guys. He was the No.1
contender. It's not my job to tell those people what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was referring to the World Boxing Council and the World
Boxing Association. He holds the light heavyweight titles for both
organizations and they were sanctioning this fight. It was a fight
that no one wanted to be associated with.
</P>
<P>
   ``This the kind of fight that the boxing organizations has
mandated,'' said Kery Davis, the director of programming for HBO,
which broadcast the bouts. ``The question is how does this guy
belong in the ring with Roy Jones? I'm sure he gave it his all. But
he had no business being in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was the WBC mandatory opponent for Jones and the bout
was Exhibit A in what is wrong with the sanctioning organizations
of boxing. Frazier definitely didn't belong in the ring against
Jones, who is arguably the best boxer in the sport today, fighting
for a world title. But he was rated the No. 1 contender thanks in
large part to the diligence of his manager, Grant Phillips, and his
promoter, Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, who earned $350,000 for the fight, landed just four of
29 punches during the two rounds, according to CompuBox punch
statistics. Jones, who earned $3.6 million, landed 39 of 92
punches.
</P>
<P>
   Jones could be faced with another odorous match in his next bout
in order to satisfy the WBA title requirement. Although it
sanctioned the bout against Frazier, the WBA did not consider Jones
having satisfied its mandatory requirement. The WBA's No.1
contender is Dario Matteoni and the WBA may insist that Jones fight
Matteoni in order to keep the title.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Di Bella, senior vice president of programming for HBO and
TVKO, said the Frazier fight was forced on the cable network. Di
Bella said he is not inclined to broadcast another mismatch like
the Frazier bout. He said the network might be more inclined to put
up the money for a Jones-Reggie Johnson bout, even if that means
Jones would be stripped of the WBA title. Johnson holds the
International Boxing Federation light heavyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boxing organizations are hurting the sport by pushing
for fights that are mismatches,'' Di Bella said. ``They're running
the risk that a fighter could get hurt in a bout where he is
overmatched.''

PHOENIX BOYS CHOIR TO BE GETTING MAJOR NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Half a millennium of musical tradition meets 50 years of
innovation July 1, when Georg Stangelberger arrives from the Vienna
Boys Choir to become the next artistic director of the Phoenix Boys
Choir.
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger, a Vienna Boys Choir conductor since 1986 and
currently its deputy artistic director, will replace Harvey Smith,
Phoenix Boys Choir artistic director since 1960. The Vienna Boys
Choir, the most prestigious name in the field, was founded in 1496.
The Phoenix Boys Choir is in the middle of its 50th anniversary
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that the choir will be guided to the next level
by someone with the knowledge, experience and compassion of Georg
Stangelberger,'' said Smith, who will step down after a boys choir
tour of Australia and New Zealand this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger's appointment is the third major change of Valley
artistic leadership in as many years. The Phoenix Symphony named
German-born Hermann Michael music director in 1997, and Arizona
Opera last year appointed Canadian David Speers general director.
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger, 38, speaks fluent English as well as German and
French. The son of a diplomat, the Austrian native attended the
Vienna Musikhochschule where he studied conducting and piano. He
has conducted major scores by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner and
Britten with the Vienna Boys Choir and as conductor of the church
choir of St. Paul, Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been with the Vienna Boys Choir for 13 years and for
me, personally, it is a time for change and for new impressions,''
Stangelberger said by phone from Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Boys Choir came highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two friends in Europe and many colleagues in America told me
of the fine reputation of the Phoenix Boys Choir and Harvey Smith.
When I came for my interview in December, I heard them and was
quite impressed with their volume and their pitch. Especially in
the Biltmore hotel, where they sang, the acoustics were not that
good, but they managed to stay in tune and that was quite an
achievement,'' Stangelberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger said that during his December visit an event
happened that made him feel certain he was receiving special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It snowed, just like in Austria. It was nice of Arizona to
make me feel at home with the snow,'' Stangelberger said with a
chuckle. ``But no more will be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger said his decision to leave the Vienna Boys Choir
had nothing to do with the recent, widely publicized resignation of
that choir's artistic director, Agnes Grossmann. Grossmann resigned
in November, objecting to what she said were emotional and physical
burdens put on the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grossmann's complaints were with the board of directors, and a
couple of her points were ones I respect. But my decision to leave
was made long before that. I have been in touch with Phoenix since
last spring,'' Stangelberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger admitted that various artistic and administrative
differences between the two choirs will pose some challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change for me has to do with different cultures. I
am very much looking forward to working with boys from different
backgrounds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, Vienna Boys Choir is a boarding school, where the boys
live together and rehearse every day. Phoenix Boys Choir is not a
boarding school,'' requiring different rehearsal schedules and
practice techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single artistic difference, he says, is one of
sound:
</P>
<P>
   ``Vienna has been known throughout the years to have a
dark-bodied touch. There is a lot of chest voice, which is why we
have those profound altos here. Phoenix is a more elegant, lighter
sound. But the common thing between us is the most important, and
that is seeking the best quality in performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Stangelberger will relocate to Phoenix with his wife, Aurelia, a
musician and teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to this very much. We have a lot of
travel guides,'' he said.  &QL;

   Houston Waltrip star boasts undeniable talent but unbelievable
transcript &QL; 
 &QL; 
By DANNY ROBBINS &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOUSTON _ At the end of last summer, a handful of college
basketball coaches closely studied the transcript of Antonio Falu,
the point guard from Puerto Rico who had entered Waltrip High
School as a junior the previous fall and had helped the Rams win
the 1998 Class 4A state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find that Falu had the grades to match his game, which
turned heads during Waltrip's title run and in the summer
tournaments and camps that followed, the coaches were not
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport populated by marginal students and unstable
characters, Falu's transcript was the shorthand version of a
rousing success story, the kind any coach would quickly embrace.
</P>
<P>
   A rousing success story, that is, had it been true.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Falu's background by the Chronicle reveals
that much of what has been presented as fact about the player,
including the transcript sent to college coaches in his name, is
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, Falu has gone from virtual obscurity as a
college basketball prospect to a spot among the upper echelon of
high school seniors.
</P>
<P>
   When he enrolled at Waltrip as a junior in the summer of 1997,
he was unknown even to those who immerse themselves in the minutiae
of college basketball recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he was named the Chronicle's 1998-99 preseason
Player of the Year and was ranked 37th on The Sporting News' list
of the top 100 high school seniors in the nation. In November, he
signed with the University of Houston, one of three players in
Clyde Drexler's first recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his past, Falu has described how, having
outgrown the basketball programs in Puerto Rico, he decided to move
to Houston to get the exposure he would need to obtain a college
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   That story is supported by his transcript. According to the
document, obtained recently by the Chronicle, Falu spent his ninth-
and 10th-grade years, 1995-96 and 1996-97, at a Puerto Rican
school, Defensores Academy, before entering Waltrip as a junior in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews and other documents show he has traveled a far
different path, one that took him to prep schools in Florida and
Virginia before his arrival in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   During much of 1995-96 and 1996-97, the years Falu purportedly
was in Puerto Rico as a ninth- and 10th-grader, he was in fact
enrolled at Florida Air Academy in Melbourne, Fla., and Oak Hill
Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And interviews with the men who coached him at those schools
indicate that 1995-96 and 1996-97 were actually his 10th- and
11th-grade years.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dunne, the former basketball coach and athletic director
at Florida Air Academy, said Falu was a sophomore when he attended
the school during the 1995-96 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Smith, the basketball coach and athletic
director at Oak Hill, Falu was a junior when he was enrolled at the
Virginia school during the 1996 fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario described by Dunne and Smith would mean that Falu
should have been classified as a senior when he entered Waltrip in
1997 and has been playing for the Rams as a senior this season
when, in fact, his high school eligibility ran out last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio Falu should be a freshman in college, unless he just
totally sat out a year or whatever,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes at Texas public high schools are subject to the
University Interscholastic League's so-called ``four-year'' rule.
Under the rule, a student's high school eligibility is limited to
four consecutive years, starting at the time the student enters the
ninth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The UIL grants waivers to give students additional years of high
school eligibility, usually as a result of illness or other
extenuating circumstances. Such a waiver was not sought by Falu,
according to Sam Harper, the UIL's waiver officer.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip coach Fred Smith declined to make Falu available for an
interview with the Chronicle last week. Smith said Houston
Independent School District policy required him to refer all
questions from the media to HISD press secretary Terry Abbott.
Citing the same policy, Smith also declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said Falu was attending Defensores Academy when he sought
a transfer to Waltrip. He said a transcript was faxed to Waltrip
from Puerto Rico on July 26, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Falu transferred, Abbott said, his transcript showed
he had the credits to be classified as a junior academically.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said he had no other information regarding Falu's
background or academic history.
</P>
<P>
   Under HISD guidelines, Waltrip would only have been required to
request a transcript from the last school Falu had attended.
</P>
<P>
   UIL athletic director Charles Breithaupt said a student found to
be competing improperly in a fifth year would be ruled ineligible.
He said such a ruling also could cause the student's school to
forfeit its wins from that season.
</P>
<P>
   Additional sanctions could be imposed on the school if there was
reason to believe coaches or administrators were aware of the
deception, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Falu averaging 30 points a game, Waltrip has compiled a
12-5 record this season.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, who returned to his alma mater as coach last year after
a 15-year NBA career, said he knew only that Falu had come to
Houston from Puerto Rico. He said he had no idea Falu had attended
Florida Air Academy or Oak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen Falu's transcript, Drexler said, he had no reason to
think the player had been anywhere other than Puerto Rico and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the discrepancy caused him to be concerned about
bringing Falu into the UH program, Drexler said: ``I only want him
if his character is good. I consider this (job) to be a volunteer
position, and I don't need any headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other NCAA Division I schools contacted by the Chronicle
acknowledged receiving an unofficial transcript for Falu that made
no mention of his having attended Florida Air Academy or Oak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial transcripts are used by college coaches and
administrators during the recruiting process to gauge whether
prospective student-athletes have done the kind of work that would
allow them to meet NCAA initial-eligibility standards. The NCAA
bases initial eligibility on a formula that includes a student's
grade-point average in certain high school ``core'' courses and
standardized-test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial transcripts are typically faxed or mailed to colleges
by high school administrative personnel or coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a student-athlete's initial eligibility must be
determined by the NCAA's initial-eligibility clearinghouse. Among
the information required by the clearinghouse is an official
transcript from each high school attended by the student-athlete.
To be considered official, a transcript must include a raised seal
and must be sent by mail directly from the student's high school.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bob Oliver, a director of membership services at
the NCAA, the clearinghouse must scrutinize a transcript from every
high school attended by a prospective student-athlete because
courses often vary from school to school and misinterpretation can
result when a transcript prepared by one school includes courses
from another.
</P>
<P>
   He said the clearinghouse would have no way of knowing what
schools a prospective student-athlete had previously attended
unless those schools were listed by the student-athlete on his
clearinghouse registration form or were identified on his final
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to gain college eligibility for a prospective
student-athlete using a transcript that does not reflect the
student-athlete's true academic record could be considered academic
fraud, Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   If a prospective student-athlete were knowingly involved in such
a scheme, he said, the student-athlete could be cited by the NCAA
for unethical conduct, a finding that could result in the
student-athlete losing all or a portion of his college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   When Falu first surfaced in Houston in 1997, his name had not
made it onto the radar of college basketball recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Falu played that summer for the Houston Jaguars, a
Nike-sponsored all-star team. Another Jaguars player at the time
was forward Cedric Taylor, then entering his senior year at
Waltrip. At the end of the summer, Falu joined Taylor at Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Falu and the 6-7 Taylor, the Rams won the Class 4A state
championship _ the first state basketball title in 10 years for an
HISD team _ and finished the season 33-3. Falu averaged 22.1
points, 8.7 assists, 6.1 rebounds and 3.3 steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not heard of him before then (last year),'' said David
Benezra, a Los Angeles-based college basketball recruiting analyst
who publishes a newsletter on the subject, Recruiting USA. ``Then,
all of a sudden, boom, it was just out there how good this kid
was.''
</P>
<P>
   By playing well last season and in tournaments and camps last
summer, Benezra said, Falu was able to enter the current season
with the kind of reputation that would make college coaches take a
closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (recruiting) is a very insecure process if a kid doesn't
have a rep going already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falu made a verbal commitment to attend the University of
Alabama last January, but switched to UH in August following the
dismissal of David Hobbs as Alabama's head coach and UH's hiring of
Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his commitment to UH, Falu continued to solicit interest
from other schools _ including Louisville, Oregon State and Florida
International University _ before signing with the Cougars during
the November signing period.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Eaves, the Louisville assistant coach who recruited Falu,
said he first encountered Falu during a scouting trip to the
Caribbean for the New Jersey Nets in the mid-'90s and found a
``little bitty skinny kid'' who desperately wanted to leave Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was trying to go to school somewhere in the
States,'' Eaves said.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves said he was surprised to find Falu in Houston last spring.
Checking on Falu's background, he said, he learned from Smith, the
Waltrip coach, that Falu had been involved in some way with Oak
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I started recruiting him, I asked about where he'd been,
what he'd been doing,'' Eaves said. ``The coach (Smith) said, `I
think he was going to do something with Oak Hill, didn't do it,
came down here, played AAU (summer basketball), and I ended up
getting him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eaves said he had no idea Falu had been at Oak Hill for an
entire semester. Told that Falu had also spent a season at Florida
Air Academy, Eaves expressed shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! I never heard that,'' he said. ``That's a new one on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos, an assistant coach at Florida International, said
Falu's connection to Oak Hill had come up in conversations with
other coaches.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fact that Oak Hill did not appear on Falu's
transcript was one of several issues that raised questions about
the player and caused Florida International, a Sun Belt Conference
school located in Miami, to lose interest in recruiting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got in there (recruiting Falu) because we need a guy like
him desperately,'' he said. ``But once you get in there and really
research everything, sometimes it's really not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Falu had attended Florida Air Academy as well, Ramos
said: ``Oh, I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In two separate interviews with Chronicle reporters last fall,
Falu gave varying accounts of why he moved to Houston and what his
living arrangements were. In both interviews, he volunteered no
information about his past other than the fact he had grown up in
Puerto Rico and had played basketball there.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the interviews, he said he came to Houston to play for
the Houston Jaguars on the recommendation of Taylor and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me to play on their AAU team,'' he said. ``I guess
they heard I was scoring 35 points a night (in Puerto Rico). Cedric
said, `Why don't you play here (for the Jaguars) and you could play
at Waltrip?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a higher level. Everybody in Puerto Rico
said I could play at a higher level, even the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Falu said he lived with an uncle during his first year in
Houston and that his mother remained in Puerto Rico until she moved
to Houston last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the other interview, he said he came to Houston initially to
live with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (his aunt) told me, `Come here, stay for a week. If you
like it, we'll find you an AAU team or something like that,''' he
said. ``So they told me to play with the Jaguars.''
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, he indicated his mother lives in Puerto Rico
but had visited him twice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked during the interview if he had played high school
basketball in Puerto Rico and on what level, he responded: ``Yeah,
I played my 11th, my 10th and 11th grade. In Puerto Rico, I played
my 10th grade, yeah. It was like I was scoring 50, 55 points (a
game). I said, `Damn, I don't see any colleges coming down here to
see me play,' so I had to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizer of the Houston Jaguars, Elaine Jones, said she
heard about Falu from Waltrip's Smith after the player had moved to
Houston. She said she knew little about Falu's background other
than he had spent some time at Oak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio, from my understanding, was already in the United
States when he came here (Houston),'' she said. ``He went to Oak
Hill. We had nothing to do with that (his move to Houston). Because
of some misunderstandings or whatever, problems that he had there
(Oak Hill), he decided to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The copy of Falu's transcript obtained by the Chronicle shows he
was in ninth grade during the 1995-96 academic year at Defensores
Academy, a school in Bayamon, Puerto Rico; 10th grade in 1996-97 at
the same Puerto Rican school, and 11th grade at Waltrip in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, however, Falu's academic career has followed a more
circuitous route.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Dunne, the former Florida Air Academy coach and athletic
director, was emphatic in saying Falu spent all but the final month
of the 1995-96 academic year at the school as a 10th-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see Florida Air Academy (on Falu's transcript) as
the 10th grade,'' he said, ``unless the transcript was altered.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunne, who spent five years at Florida Air Academy before
becoming headmaster at a private elementary school near Orlando
last year, said he is certain 1995-96 was Falu's sophomore year
because the player had spent the previous year at a Puerto Rican
school, Bayamon Military Academy, as a ninth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be frank with you, if it had been possible for him to have
been a freshman at our school, I'm sure he would have been placed
as a freshman at our school, because of the language difference and
all that,'' he said. ``But he had a transcript that said he was a
freshman at Bayamon Military, and so he was placed as a sophomore
(at Florida Air Academy).''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995-96 edition of the Florida Air Academy yearbook, the
Falcon, Falu's photograph appears with the Class of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A private boarding school with an enrollment of 400 on Florida's
east coast, Florida Air Academy attracts numerous students from
Puerto Rico and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said Falu was among a group of Puerto Rican basketball and
baseball players who entered Florida Air Academy at roughly the
same time. One of the students in Falu's class, he said, was
Antonio Latimer, a forward from Puerto Rico who signed with DePaul
in November 1997 and currently is attending Independence (Kan.)
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Latimer, Florida Air Academy was 21-4 in 1995-96, winning
its district title and ending the season with a loss in the Class
4A regional quarterfinals. Falu filled a backup role on that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had basically an eight-man rotation, and he was right there
in it,'' Dunne said. ``In our district championship game, he hit a
key 3(-pointer) with about two minutes to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Falu appeared in 14 games for Florida Air Academy during the
1995-96 season and averaged 8.6 points, according to box scores
published during that season in Florida Today, the major daily
newspaper in the Melbourne area.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said he taught world history and had Falu in his class,
but such a course does not appear on Falu's transcript that was
sent to the colleges recruiting him.
</P>
<P>
   That transcript also shows no record of Falu having taken
aerospace science, a mandatory class each year at Florida Air
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne remembered Falu as a good student and highly motivated
player, almost fanatically so. He described Falu as being
``obsessed'' with Latimer, his more-publicized Puerto Rican
teammate, and unable to accept the fact Latimer had a bigger role
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said Falu, upset over his lack of playing time and other
issues, left Florida Air Academy with a month or so remaining in
the 1996 spring semester and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from a family situation where the father isn't around,''
Dunne said. ``I don't know what happened, but he was very driven to
succeed and make a good life for his mother and show his father.
Anybody who stood in his way be damned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would stay until you turned the lights out in the gym. He
would go into the weight room. He was always asking, `Can I take
(diet) supplements? What can I do to get stronger?' I'd say, `Falu,
with your body type, you're just never going to be a big, bulky
guy.' If I had told him, `Eat three dozen raw eggs every day,' he
would have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his whole thing is very individualized _ to make himself
better. His whole thing is for himself, and I think the team is
kind of secondary. He and I had more than a few confrontations.''
</P>
<P>
   The following fall, the beginning of the 1996-97 school year,
Falu moved on to Oak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny prep school of 140 students in southwest Virginia, Oak
Hill is nationally known as a sort of finishing school for elite
high school basketball players. Its list of graduates reads like a
Who's Who of college and NBA players, including Jerry Stackhouse,
the former North Carolina star now with the Detroit Pistons, and
Ron Mercer, the ex-Kentucky star currently with the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith, Oak Hill's basketball coach and athletic director,
said Falu was enrolled at the school for the 1996 fall semester and
was ``definitely'' a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that semester should show up on Falu's transcript
``unless he, for some reason, didn't want it. He definitely
finished the semester. He definitely got credits.''
</P>
<P>
   Falu was included in the Oak Hill team picture taken before the
opening of the 1996-97 season. When the photo was published by two
local newspapers, the Galax (Va.) Gazette and The Declaration in
Independence, Va., he was identified as Tony Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Falu was known as ``Tony'' Falu among Oak Hill
players and coaches but was identified as Antonio Falu Allende on
school records.
</P>
<P>
   Falu's name appears as Antonio Falu on his Waltrip transcript.
The document lists his mother's name as Gracie Allende Andrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here called him Tony _ Tony Falu,'' Smith said.
``But I thought Tony Allende was his real name.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Falu was held out of Oak Hill's games during the fall
of 1996 because of poor grades, but his playing time would have
been limited under any circumstances. Oak Hill's senior class that
season included two point guards then rated among the country's
premier recruits, William Avery and Jermaine Medley. Avery is now
starting as a sophomore at Duke; Medley is a sophomore at
Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Falu became discouraged and left Oak Hill at the
semester break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing behind William Avery and Jermaine Medley,''
Smith said. ``He was like a third-string guard, so he wasn't going
to play much. That affected his attitude. He wasn't making good
grades. He wasn't going to wait his turn and wait for the next
year. So we just kind of parted ways at Christmas after the first
semester.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Smith, the most memorable thing about Falu's stay
at Oak Hill was the persistence he showed in getting there. While
most players are directed to the school by coaches or others with
ties to basketball, Smith said, Falu had no advocate other than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I remember correctly, he just called me personally,'' Smith
said. ``I answered the phone, and it was this guy Antonio Falu. He
kept calling. I didn't really pursue it. He just kept calling and
calling, wanting to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he made a point of telling Falu about the players
already on the Oak Hill roster and the high cost of attending the
school, but those things didn't deter him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole thing was, `I've got to get out of Puerto Rico to
play Division I basketball,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he lost touch with Falu until last spring, when the
player called to say he would be attending the Nike All-America
Camp in July. The camp, held annually in Indianapolis, is a
recruiting showcase for high school players entering their senior
seasons or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was surprised by the call because he assumed Falu
had concluded his high school career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he said he was going to Nike, I said, `Well,
you should have been a senior this year (1998), right?''' Smith
said, ``and he said something like, `Well, I repeated (a year),
because when I left Oak Hill, I didn't finish the year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he got another surprise when, on the first day of the
camp, the team he was coaching played a team that included Falu.
The day after facing Smith's team, Falu, citing a family emergency,
left the camp.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Smith said he saw enough of Falu's game to be
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he'd improved as much as he had,'' he said,
``because he really didn't work hard (at Oak Hill). Kids like that
usually don't get better, but he had definitely improved from when
I saw him last.''
</P>
<P>
   A less charitable opinion of Falu's progress was offered by
Kevin Dunne, the former Florida Air Academy coach.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unsettling to Dunne was seeing Falu as the
Chronicle's preseason Player of the Year for the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he comes from a tough family situation,'' he said. ``He
had to cope with a lot of issues at our place, things going on with
his family back home and so forth. I know he has made some
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're good enough, you'll get a chance to play. You
make it. I just have a tough time with him being Player of the Year
when he should be a freshman in college.''

BOY, A WITNESS IN MURDER CASE, AND MOTHER SLAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Conn.) 
(nk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An 8-year-old boy who was a witness in a pending murder case was
found shot to death on Friday, along with his mother, in their
Bridgeport, Conn., home, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Leroy Browne Jr., and his mother, Karen Clarke, 30,
were found after Ms. Clarke's co-workers became concerned that she
had not shown up for work, said Lt. Mathew Cuminotto Jr. of the
Bridgeport police detective bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy, whose nickname was B.J., was a third-grader at Read
School in Bridgeport. His mother sometimes brought him to her job
at a U-Haul dealer in Orange, Conn., where she had worked for six
years in the traffic department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an outgoing kid,'' said Ann, a co-worker of Ms.
Clarke's who declined to give her last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved his mama,'' she said. ``She loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy was a witness in the state's case against Russell Peeler,
26, who is charged with murder in the May 29 killing of Rudolph
Snead Jr., 28, The Connecticut Post, citing unnamed law enforcement
officials, reported Saturday. The boy apparently had witnessed a
previous attempt by Peeler to kill Snead, the law enforcement
officials told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler is free on $900,000 bail, but Cuminotto said that the
police had not questioned him about the double homicide. ``At this
point he's not tied into this case,'' the lieutenant said of
Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was no sign of a robbery or other
indications of a motive at the scene, and the police found no
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyer, Gary N. Mastronardi, told The Connecticut Post
that his client wears a security bracelet so his whereabouts can be
monitored daily. Neither Mastronardi nor the Fairfield County
state's attorney, which is prosecuting the case against Peeler,
could be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Connecticut Post reported that Snead was shot eight times in
the legs, left arm and back while he was at a barber shop, and he
identified Peeler as his killer before he died at Bridgeport
Hospital. At the time of the slaying, Peeler was free while
awaiting trial on a charge of attempted murder in the previous
attack on Snead, the paper said. The paper did not explain the
circumstances of the first attack, or how Leroy had come to be a
witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Clarke and Leroy might have been neighbors of Snead.
Until his death, Snead had lived on Garfield Avenue, the newspaper
said. Saturday, neighbors of Ms. Clarke said that she and her son
had recently moved to Earl Avenue from Garfield Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   A judge recently ordered prosecutors to turn over statements and
other information about the boy, including his current address, to
Mastronardi, according to the newspaper's account.
</P>
<P>
   Mastronardi told the newspaper that he had not shared any of
that information with his client, adding that Peeler had known the
boy's address for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was going to kill him, he had plenty of time to do it
before now,'' The Post quoted Mastronardi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Clarke, a reliable worker, did not show up at work on
Friday, and did not call, five colleagues became concerned, said
Ann, the co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   She said they called another U-Haul employee who knew Ms.
Clarke, and he went to her home on Earl Avenue. A two-family
cedar-shingled home on a short street in a working-class
neighborhood, it abuts a patch of woods.
</P>
<P>
   He found the door unlocked, and inside he found Ms. Clarke and
her son.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy was dead on the floor outside a bedroom, and his mother
was dead on the bedroom floor, Cuminotto said Saturday. Groceries
were spilled over the floor, suggesting they had just returned from
shopping, he said, adding that both had been shot at least once.
</P>
<P>
   The man called the police, Cuminotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, has had its share of
trouble with crime. With a population of 137,000, the city reported
35 murders in 1997 _ down significantly from a high of 63 in 1991,
yet still giving the city a homicide rate more than double that of
New York City, according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the city put up 38 concrete barriers on its east side
to cut off access to notorious drug dealing areas. The barriers
were removed last year after community protests.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Clarke's multiracial, blue-collar neighborhood was
quiet, neighbors said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll hear a gunshot, but it will be off in the
Terrace,'' said Norman Williams, 73, a retired General Electric
employee who lives across the street from where the killings took
place. The Terrace is a nearby public housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Tatiana Bholanath, 17, who lives a few blocks away, said B.J.
was friends with her little sister and cousin. ``He was nice,'' she
said. ``They would ride bikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clarke was a ``good person, trying hard,'' her co-worker Ann
said. ``She'll be sadly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Ms. Clarke's white Honda Accord was still parked in
her driveway, next to a basketball hoop. Planted in the front yard
was a sign reading ``24 Hour Protection One Alarm Service'' with a
phone number: (800) GET-HELP.

PENSION FUNDS PUT $88 MILLION IN SPECULATIVE LAND DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valley land speculators have borrowed millions of dollars from
government worker pension funds in deals that involve potentially
high risks.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Arizona Republic'' &UR; review of public records shows that
three retirement funds currently have more than $88 million
invested in real estate ventures.
</P>
<P>
   And at least two of the many loans involve developers who helped
wipe out Arizona thrifts a decade ago when the land market
nose-dived.
</P>
<P>
   All told, pension real estate deals account for just 2 percent
of a $5 billion pool, and there is no evidence that the retirement
plans are in financial danger. Managers, in fact, boast of the high
return on pension-fund investments.
</P>
<P>
   But loan records raise questions about a conflict of interest in
one transaction and resurrect a decade-old controversy about the
use of public trust money for land investments.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one loan went to a developer who was indicted
nearly eight years ago for bribery and left a trail of bankrupt
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another involves a notorious Buckeye project and a borrower
working with Wm. Robert Burns, whose record is littered with bad
debts, failed projects and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The cash comes from more than 21,000 government workers,
retirees and employers who have contributed to the Public Safety
Personnel Retirement Fund, the Corrections Officer Retirement Plan
and the Elected Official Retirement Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cross, administrator for all three funds, said real estate
investments are carefully secured and have proved extremely
profitable over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the $88 million in property investments, Cross
added, ``These are very, very small amounts. . . . I don't think
they (retirees) should be concerned. I think we're taking the
proper precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Lieberman, an attorney for the pensions, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's possible for us to lose money on these
deals,'' he said, adding that only one pension loan has gone into
default, and the retirement funds lost no money on that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not uncommon for retirement plans to invest in
real estate, financial analysts said vacant land deals are so risky
that most Arizona banks and credit unions no longer issue such
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and politicians have created a furor in the past by
trying to get at the state's largest pension plan for similar
investments. But the $20 billion Arizona Retirement System, which
serves teachers and other government workers, shuns undeveloped
property deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raw land is a higher risk investment,'' explained LeRoy
Gilbertson, who oversees the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The pension loans in question net about 20 percent return on
real estate investments, compared with stock and bond portfolios,
which have a 15 percent annual average return.
</P>
<P>
   Investment experts say the hefty return rates on land deals
suggest that developers cannot get money elsewhere, either because
the deals are questionable or the borrowers are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a $1.6 million loan issued to DMS Holding Co. Inc.,
which lists Donald M. Switzenberg as president, chief executive and
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a federal grand jury indicted Switzenberg for fraud and
conspiracy in connection with real estate loans from Sentinel
Savings &AMP; Loan Association. Switzenberg reputedly made payoffs to
officials at the thrift, which subsequently failed.
</P>
<P>
   A loan officer pleaded guilty. Sentinel's president died while
charges were pending. Federal court records on Switzenberg, who did
not return phone calls, were sealed in 1994 before a scheduled
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hart, an attorney for Switzenberg, said that his client
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor tax charge, and that the sentencing
was secret because Switzenberg agreed to cooperate with
authorities. The file was unsealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``'' In 1992, the Resolution Trust Corporation, a federal agency
created to clean up America's failed thrifts, sued Switzenberg and
others for fraud and racketeering in connection with loans from
Western Savings and Loan. That case was settled. Taxpayers lost an
estimated $2 billion when Western folded.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Switzenberg has been listed as the principal in at
least five Arizona corporations or partnerships that filed for
bankruptcy protection. Among them was DMS Investment Group Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, DMS Holding was able to obtain more than $1
million from the retirement systems this year to finance 41
undeveloped acres at Cooper and Pecos roads in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a shock to me,'' said Steve Barnes, president of
an association representing Maricopa County sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Gerberry, secretary treasurer of another deputies
association, praised Cross' management of pension funds but said
borrowers should be carefully scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that money's being loaned to people whose
integrity is in question,'' Gerberry added. ``I'm retired. It's
important that the funds stay healthy.'' &QL; 
HOW IT WORKS
</P>
<P>
   Cross, pension fund administrator for 11 years, said he did not
know about Switzenberg's past when the loan was approved.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that all pension investments are safe because of
the way each deal is structured.
</P>
<P>
   Cross said that overall retirement assets exceed the amount
needed for pension payouts by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, he added, the three retirement accounts have
performed among the top 4 percent of large, public pension plans
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've added a billion dollars to these funds,'' Cross said.
``I'm pretty proud of what we've done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirement system investment policies are set by a five-member
board of fund managers, with appointments by the governor and
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The board has capped real estate financing at 10 percent of the
total fund. To date, Cross said, 98 percent of the money is
invested in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Cross approves loans based on recommendations from Bridge
Financial Services Inc., a private firm that has an exclusive
agreement with the pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge finds borrowers, screens them, researches the collateral,
puts up 20 percent of the loan, and stands to be the first loser if
a default occurs.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical one-year loan, the retirement plans earn a 17
percent profit while Bridge gets a 23 percent return. That includes
an instant share of fees _ $212,800, for example _ on one loan of
$3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the deals involve short-term financing of six
months to three years. Loan amounts are kept at least one-third
below the appraised value of property that serves as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Cross said that strategy insulates the pension funds from
losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona's land market has a roller-coaster history. Some
property values dropped by more than half during the real estate
crash a decade ago, failing in part due to dishonest borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sargent, president of Bridge, said he is scrupulous in
checking out loan proposals and borrower backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``We're very careful on the deals we get into,'' Sargent added.
</P>
<P>
   As for Switzenberg's checkered past, he said, ``I think there's
another side to that story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sargent said dozens of legitimate developers and financial
institutions failed when Arizona real estate values collapsed in
the late 1980s. He said it is unfair to judge retirement-fund
investments based on that catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the era's key players continue doing land deals,
including Conley Wolfswinkel, who was convicted of felonies, and
Burns, who was sued for thrift fraud by the Resolution Trust Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sargent said, Wolfswinkel and Burns have courted the
pension funds for cash, only to be denied. &QL; 
Burns again
</P>
<P>
   But there is a Burns connection to one loan.
</P>
<P>
   Records show nearly $3 million in retirement funds went to
Spurlock Land LLC, which is working with Burns to develop 13,000
acres along Sun Valley Parkway in Buckeye.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Michael Tiffany set up that loan and did the
paperwork. Tiffany represents Bridge Financial, the lender. He also
represents Spurlock Land, the borrower, and has an ownership
interest in the Sun Valley project.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could be on both sides of the deal, Tiffany said,
``You've found things that would really cause you to be concerned
and suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tiffany, the conflict was resolved when
representatives of Bridge Financial and Spurlock Land signed a
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurlocks hired a separate lawyer to handle the loan.
Tiffany said he was not obliged to inform retirement system
administrators of the conflict, although they put up most of the
money, because Bridge Financial was the official lender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pension fund is not really involved in any loan,'' he
asserted. ``They're just purchasing an undivided interest. We don't
involve them in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross and Lieberman, who oversee the retirement fund, said they
were unaware of Tiffany's entanglement with the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   After discovering that loan papers contain a disclosure of
Tiffany's conflict, Lieberman said he simply forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Pension administrators also said they were unaware of Burns'
role in the Sun Valley project _ a ``joint effort'' with Spurlock
Land that includes shared planning fees and legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany said the relationship was irrelevant because Burns did
not obtain any pension money.  &QL; 
SUN VALLEY SAGA
</P>
<P>
   Burns was among the original developers of Sun Valley, one of
the biggest land boondoggles in recent Arizona history.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, he acquired thousands of acres in a
controversial transaction with Canadian land speculator Huddie
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 investors poured money into the planned community.
When the deal crashed, they were left with about $83 million in
bond debts for construction of Sun Valley Parkway, dubbed the
``Road to Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who declined to comment for this story, was among the
defendants in three RTC lawsuits seeking more than $1 billion. The
federal agency also issued a criminal referral in 1993 for fraud,
forgery, theft, false statements and money laundering. Prosecutors
declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources confirmed this month that attorneys for the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which now pursues RTC debtors, are
continuing to investigate Burns in connection with millions of
dollars in unpaid judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye officials said Burns represents about 10,000 acres in
Sun Valley through an entity known as Phoenix Holdings. Burns has
previously denied control of that company. In November, a Maricopa
County Superior Court judge fined Burns $25,000 for lying under
oath about a trust that controls Phoenix Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the pension fund lawyer, said, ``If we had known
Robert Burns was involved, we probably wouldn't have written that
loan.'' &QL; 
`REALLY BOTHERING ME'
</P>
<P>
   The labyrinth of connections goes deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Among the investors in Burns' development is SunChase Holdings
Inc., which has a 10 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   SunChase is the major shareholder in New Mexico and Arizona Land
Co., which owns Bridge Financial, which set up the pension fund
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent, Bridge's president, said he was not familiar with
SunChase's involvement with Burns.
</P>
<P>
   William Pope, chief executive at SunChase, said he didn't know
that Bridge Financial had retirement loans to Spurlock land.
</P>
<P>
   Both men said the loans were issued before Bridge Financial
became linked with SunChase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really bothering me,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some of the real estate deals appear too complex to unravel
using public records.
</P>
<P>
   Among those: a $12.5 million loan issued last year for 6,530
acres of vacant land known as Lake Pleasant Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The Peoria property was acquired by a network of companies
involving Bell, the Canadian land speculator. Pension funds went to
Group Three Properties, represented by Noranda Properties Inc.
Collateral includes first and second liens and an ``unsecured
guarantee'' from Noranda Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Torjhelm, who signed for the loan as president of Noranda
Properties, did not return phone calls. His financial statement
contains this warning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Prepared without audit. . . . Few of the assets are readily
convertible to cash and, therefore, under distressed sale
conditions there is no assurance that the asset values referenced
herein could be realized.''
</P>
<P>
   One month later, a loan of $3.8 million was issued with pension
funds to W.P. Properties LLC for 3,285 acres of vacant land near
Lake Pleasant. This deal also involved Noranda Properties. The
collateral includes a second lien and another unsecured guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sargent declined to explain the borrower relationships or
details of the collateral. But everyone says they are confident the
loans are secure. &QL;

SENATORS FEELING WEIGHT OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing can prepare senators for the immense,
conflicting pressures they face in convening the first presidential
impeachment trial of their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the weight of history on each of them.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only their oath to render ``impartial justice.''
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't merely political pressure, although there is plenty
of that.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is the combination of all of these powerful forces
that makes this moment almost unique in history and at the same
time so politically volatile.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggled to lay the ground rules for President
Clinton's trial last week, senators sensed that their collective
reputations were riding on how well they could reconcile these
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an awful lot at stake as an institution,'' said Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   And there may be no safe middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   How, for example, do Republicans balance what they consider
their constitutional duty to hold a complete trial against the
wishes of many Americans to get it all over with as quickly as
possible? How do lawmakers keep their objectivity in judging a
president whom many of the Republicans have scorned and many of the
Democrats have reflexively defended?
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved two articles of impeachment accusing
Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with
his concealing a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Senators
were sworn in as jurors last week, and the trial is expected to get
under way on Thursday. A two-thirds Senate majority is required to
oust a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., considers the proceedings momentous
enough that he has begun keeping a daily diary ``for my
grandchildren.'' Excerpts will appear in ``The'' ``Arizona
Republic'' beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the occasion was evident Friday during a rare,
private meeting of all 100 senators ``that just dripped with
history,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, to decide upon trial rules, was convened in the old
Senate chamber, where statesman Daniel Webster had once cried,
``Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, noted that Webster
``had said from this desk that he spoke not as a New Englander, but
as an American,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Leahy said that got Ted Kennedy all dewy-eyed,'' Kyl said.
Leahy is a Democrat from Vermont and Kennedy is a Massachusetts
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   To further illustrate the high stakes, Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., told his colleagues during the meeting of the fate that
befell three greedy men in Geoffrey Chaucer's ``The Canterbury
Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Pardoner's Tale,'' three men come upon a pot of gold
and must decide how to divide it. One decides to poison the others'
wine and keep the bounty for himself. Unaware of the plot, the
other two kill him and then drink the poisoned wine and die. ``O
gluttony, lechery and hazardry!'' Chaucer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd hoped the cautionary tale would help Democrats and
Republicans unite in common purpose. More so than the House, the
Senate has a historic mandate to be civil. With passions running
high, one of the body's most daunting challenges during the trial
will simply be to keep its members cool-headed, as the framers of
the Constitution envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's House impeachment debate was marked by bitterness
and angry words from both sides. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said
the impeachment effort was characterized by ``unbridled hatred and
meanness.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the founding fathers believed the Senate would be
more detached because they face the voters every six years,
compared with every two years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Many veteran senators, including Byrd, pride themselves on their
knowledge of _ and deference to _ Senate rules and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took an oath to do impartial justice,'' Thompson said in an
interview after the swearing-in, ``and we all take that very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the particular problems in this country has to do with
the way people view their government institutions,'' Thompson said.
``We have an opportunity to do something positive with regard to
that if we conduct ourselves in an appropriate manner.''
</P>
<P>
   But senators are not just jurors, they are politicians. And
political pressures are certain to blend with the constitutional
ones, complicating senators' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a gut level, not very many Republicans in Congress really
like Bill Clinton as president very much,'' Kyl said. ``And, of
course, most Democrats in Congress, while they may not necessarily
like him much as a person, have an inclination to defend him as
their president because he supports what they're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl also described ``a second level of politics'' he expects to
be at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that drives the desire to have a trial that
ends very quickly, and doesn't become a circus, is, frankly, the
political realization that the American people don't want that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, says
many senators will be able to act and vote impartially _ but still
vote largely along party lines. That is because, he said, Democrats
and Republicans tend to see the world quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you an example,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (state) judges swear they are impartial, and they believe
that they are. There's just one problem: You can almost completely
distinguish between the decisions of Republican judges and
Democratic judges. They're reflecting their values.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of senators, Kyl among them, are up for re-election in
2000.

MAPLE LEAFS TURN OUT LIGHTS ON BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAFS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Well, what did you expect?
</P>
<P>
   As long shots go, this one might have stacked up at 25 to 1, if
you're an optimist. Yes, we know. On any given night any team can
beat any other team, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, with seven regular players out of their lineup,
including their best defenseman _ Ray Bourque _ and several others
battling the flu, the Bruins were vulnerable to a pretty
significant beating and that's just what they received Saturday
night as they fell to the Maple Leafs, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he had a two-tiered strategy heading into
Saturday night's contest, the final one for Boston in Maple Leaf
Gardens. One was to pray, the other to try to bore the Maple Leafs
into such a state of catatonia that the Bruins would be able to
sneak in a few goals.
</P>
<P>
   Good survival tactic perhaps, but the only team that appeared to
be sleeping in the early going was the Bruins, who surrendered
three goals on three shots in the first 10:17. When it ballooned to
4-0 at the 14-minute mark and the Leafs were getting one odd-man
rush after another, Burns pulled goalie Byron Dafoe in favor of Rob
Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which was worse,'' said Dafoe, ``my save
percentage or my goals against, seven shots and four goals or four
goals in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which had its win streak snapped at three, hasn't had a
great deal of success here in recent years. The last win for the
Bruins in Toronto was Jan. 22, 1992. In their final six visits to
the old barn, they were 0-3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was a big-time train wreck for the Bruins. Just
1:19 in, Todd Warriner, in the right circle, dished the puck down
to Derek King, who redirected it past Dafoe. Only 33 seconds later,
shot No. 2 became goal No. 2. With the Bruins running around in
their own end, Igor Korolev got the puck in front on a pass from
Garry Valk. Dafoe, trying to stop Valk, left a wide-open net and
Korolev had time to switch from forehand to backhand and easily pop
the puck home at 1:52. Burns called a timeout and the bleeding
stopped, momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Bruins squandered a two-on-one chance with Ken
Baumgartner missing the net wide, the Maple Leafs made it a
three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valk blocked a wrist shot by Hal Gill (who was on the ice for
all four goals during the barrage) and then took off up the ice. He
teed up a slapper that sailed under the glove of Dafoe. At 14
minutes even, Sergei Berezin made it a four-goal bulge on a goal
the Bruins disputed. With Dafoe well out of the net, a shot from
the point bounced off Berezin and then Dafoe and popped high in the
air, sailing over the goalie and into the net. The Bruins argued
that Berezin interfered with Dafoe and although there was
incidental contact, it occurred when Dafoe was several feet in
front of the crease with the puck already in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas came in and Dafoe, who went into the game with three
straight wins and a stingy 1.00 goals against average in that span,
headed to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fought the good fight and managed to chip away with
Shawn Bates scoring his third of the year at 15:33 to make it 4-1.
Bates, who was calling for the puck in the right circle, took a
pass from Steve Heinze and snapped a shot past Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made a game of it in the middle period and Joseph was
nothing short of outstanding as the Leafs' defense completely
collapsed. Bruins rookie Andre Savage, playing only his second NHL
game, had four shots in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Boston outshot Toronto, 12-7, in the period and 25-14 in the
first 40 minutes and climbed to within two at 17:53 on Joe
Thornton's seventh of the season, on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   But a shorthanded strike by Mike Johnson at 7:48 of the third
and another Johnson tally on the power play at 14:14 proved to be
lights out. Boston's Kyle McLaren ended the scoring with a
power-play tally at 17:32 on assists from Dmitri Khristich and
Steve Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this Leafs team was going to come at us (after losing,
2-1, to the Bruins Thursday night). In this league, 2-0 in the
first five minutes of a game you can forget it,'' said Burns.
``It's really tough to come back. I thought we had a chance maybe
to come back at the end of the second period, in all honesty I
thought we could have been tied with them, but that first Johnson
goal, that cut us off at the knees.''

JONES FOUGHT LAW, AND WON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ HBO premiered a new documentary Saturday
night. It was called ``Anatomy of a Mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first bell to the final 10-count, Golden Johnson and
Ricky Frazier no more belonged in a boxing ring with ``Sugar''
Shane Mosley and Roy Jones than did Magic Johnson and Walt Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither encounter was much to watch, but by far the worse was
Jones's battering of the 39-year-old New York City police officer
in less than two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier entered the ring at the Pensacola Civic Center in full
police garb, including service revolver. With him were a bevy of
cornermen wearing NYPD windbreakers. The only thing missing from
the station house look was a box of donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier would have been wise to have kept the revolver with him
after the bell sounded because with it he might have gone the
distance with the World Boxing Council-World Boxing Association
light heavyweight champion. Without it he went to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That first happened from two right hands and a sweeping left
hook late in the first round. None landed flush but none had to.
Frazier (18-4-1) got up but had no chance to survive this onslaught
unless he was taken into protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   That was not an option to him because the WBC had mandated this
fight after naming Frazier its No. 1 contender, so he had no choice
but to come out for the second round. Mercifully, it was his last.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (39-1, 33 knockouts) stalked Frazier and finally dropped
him with a left hand to the temple that sent him into a squat and a
following right that knocked him to the floor. When he got up,
Frazier was on wobbly legs and referee Armando Garcia stepped in
and made a citizen's arrest, ending the bout at 2:59 of the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very satisfying,'' Jones admitted. ``I don't pick
these guys. He was the No. 1 contender. It's not my job to tell
these people what to do. I just fight.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Mosley, unfortunately for Golden Johnson, who stayed
around a lot longer but with the same result when he went down for
the fourth time late in the seventh round and refused to rise until
referee Tommy Kimmons counted him out. Frankly, it was the smartest
thing he did all night.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley first dropped Johnson with two left hooks to the body in
the third round that sent him to his knees. When he got up, Mosley
methodically stalked him until, with only seconds left in the
round, the champion landed another perfect left to the ribs that
sent Johnson down again on one knee. It would become a familiar
position.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Johnson did what he could to fight back, but for
the most part Mosley was paying far too much attention to his
business, all at his challenger's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised he fought back the way he did, but
this was a championship fight and he wanted the belt,'' Mosley
said. ``He was swinging with desperation shots. He let me know he
was trying to win. He's a durable, strong kid with a hard head.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that his ribs had been as hard because after carrying
Johnson for several more rounds, Mosley (31-0, 29) went back to
work in the seventh and hurt his challenger with a sweeping right
hook, followed by two more blistering punches that sent him down
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   This was now becoming a habit but not something Johnson found
habit forming. Just a round earlier, Johnson (15-3-2) did not land
a single punch, according to CompuBox. Although this limited his
opportunity for victory, it also kept him upright for a round,
something that soon would not be the case again after a fierce
flurry by Mosley ended with a left to the body that sent Johnson to
one knee for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   As he stared directly at his cornermen, Johnson squatted as if
he were waiting to have a team picture taken with his basketball
buddies. His arms were across his knee as Kimmons counted him out,
his cornermen not encouraging him to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't injured at all,'' Johnson admitted. ``Those body
shots just took a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Fights like Saturday night's do, too, on anyone who has to watch
them.

KYL RECORDS HISTORY IN MAKING
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SEN. JON KYL 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
Following are excerpts from Sen. Jon Kyl's personal diary of the
impeachment trial of President William Jefferson Clinton. Kyl, an
Arizona Republican, is keeping the diary for his grandchildren. The
excepts will appear in The Arizona Republic. 
 Tuesday, Jan. 5, 1999
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, an opportunity to discuss the impeachment case with
colleagues face to face. It's not been easy by phone over the
holidays; though I've been impressed that everyone with whom I've
spoken has obviously been giving the matter serious thought.
</P>
<P>
   First is a meeting with Majority Leader Trent Lott and eight
other Republican senators with extensive legal backgrounds.
Everyone has thought through some preliminary positions, and all
are thoughtfully presented. The Gorton-Lieberman proposal is
obviously dead, though elements of it may still be embodied in
procedural agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is whether it is possible to reach any
bipartisan agreement with Democrats about the way the trial is to
be conducted. The Senate Rules on Impeachment control, but they are
fairly general and do not lay out a day-to-day process. So, for
example, will the Senate permit witnesses to be called? Will we
limit the time of the trial?
</P>
<P>
   When will it start? What procedural motions should we expect?
Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The leader (Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.) notes that the
House managers believe they need to call a few witnesses. All agree
that a reasonable request of the White House lawyers to call
witnesses in the president's defense could not be denied. Which, to
most, seems to answer the first question as well. But all agree the
Senate has the right to put constraints on the trial (number of
witnesses, time,
</P>
<P>
   etc.), and that we should try to keep it as short as possible,
consistent with fairness and justice. &QL; 
 &UR; Wednesday, Jan. 6, 1999
</P>
<P>
   The full GOP Senate Conference convenes at 9:30 a.m., recesses
at noon to swear in newly elected senators and reconvenes at 3 p.m.
Senate lawyers review the Constitutional provisions and applicable
rules. The special rules for impeachment do not spell out in detail
how to proceed, and most of the discussion centers on how to
establish procedures for completing the trial quickly, but with due
regard for the needs of the House and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The concern expressed by some is that Senate Democrats appear
unanimous in support of the president's position that there should
be no witnesses. Since the Senate (under the rules) has to vote to
hear each witness, it is obvious there could be a series of
party-line votes; and that could lead to charges that the process
is not bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Most strongly desire (for both institutional and political
reasons) to try to reach bipartisan consensus. But at what cost?
Undercutting the House's equally strong desire to present its case
as its managers deem necessary? Most hope for a middle ground _
limiting the witnesses and procedural motions to the bare minimum
through a bipartisan consensus. Even that may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma is how to prevent the ``process'' from becoming the
issue, while doing justice to the House, the president and the
Constitutional imperatives. While I totally agree that the time
issue is extremely important, I express the view that it is even
more important to do it right, even if it takes a few days longer.
History will remember what we did in impeachment, but not what we
do in the two weeks following the impeachment proceedings. I
conclude by saying that we should take the long view, not the
expedient.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the leader will meet with three senior
members from both parties, the minority leader and the House
managers to try to work out a process _ at least for beginning the
trial. He presents a notional plan to us, with time frames and
dates certain for each aspect of the trial, ending around Feb. 5
unless witnesses are called. It would require the case to be
presented on the record, after which the Senate could decide
whether to call any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that we will better know at that point whether
they are needed. It finesses the witness issue in order to get an
agreement. Some argue it sets up a presumption against having
witnesses. Probably. Others say it makes it more likely the
president's lawyers would not contest some facts (and maybe even
would stipulate to certain things) to avoid having witnesses
called.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive discussion and numerous suggestions, it is
agreed by most that the leader should refine the plan and present
it to the House leadership and thereafter to the Senate Democrats. &QL; 
 &UR; Thursday, Jan. 7, 1999
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial of President Clinton begins at 10 a.m.
with the escort of the House managers, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, to
the well of the Senate. With no fanfare, Hyde reads the two
impeachment counts approved by the House, the managers retire and
the Senate stands in recess until 1 p.m. for the administration of
the impeachment oaths. Though I have read both counts, I am struck
by the implications, especially of the second count, as I hear it
read.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the charges and the seriousness of the event
linger after President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond gavels us to
recess _ and most senators linger as well. In twos and threes, and
larger groups, Democrats and Republicans remain in the Senate
chamber, most discussing the subject that will consume the day _
how to proceed with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats support the president's position that the House
managers should not be able to call any witnesses at the trial.
Most Republicans believe it would be unfair to both sides to
determine in advance that no witnesses can be called under any
circumstances. But the informal discussions reveal potential ways
to bridge the differences, and I leave optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Our hopes are dashed by a report of the Republican leader at our
11 a.m. conference. He reports that the Democratic leader
instructed the three Democratic members of the bipartisan team
(which had been working to devise a process for the trial) to cease
their participation; and that Sen. (Tom) Daschle had publicly said,
``All bets are off,'' unless the Republicans agree to preclude the
House from calling any witnesses. Yet, Lott and others perceive
that many rank-and-file Democrats may be willing to consider a
bipartisan agreement on how the trial should proceed, and the
majority leader instructs Senators (Phil) Gramm and (Slade) Gorton
(who asks me to join the effort) to draft a compromise proposal. We
draft until just before the Senate reconvenes at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the proposal is an idea the leader had surfaced
yesterday, that ` `splits the baby'' by forcing the House to make
its case on the record (i.e. the public material the House had
considered) and then, if it still felt it necessary to call
witnesses, to make specific requests to the Senate, which would
then vote on each one requested. In the meantime, to satisfy one of
the Democrats' desires, the president's lawyers could move to
dismiss the case before any ruling on witnesses. (The president's
lawyers would be bound by the same rules in the presentation of
their case and requesting any witnesses.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, is
escorted into the Senate chamber at 1:20 p.m. and immediately takes
his oath, after which we all rise and he administers the oath (to
do `` impartial'' justice) to the Senate as a group. Then the
formal signing of the impeachment register by each senator in turn.
When I return to my desk, I write a short note on my copy of the
Impeachment Resolution with the pen I used to sign the register.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:40 p.m., after the official Proclamation of Impeachment is
read by the Sergeant-at-Arms, the majority leader asks the chief
Justice to recess subject to the call of the chair (there being no
agreement yet on how to proceed).
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour I continue meetings with Lott, Gorton and
others refining our proposal.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:50 p.m. the GOP Conference reconvenes, with Lott announcing
that Daschle has rejected any agreement, any further negotiations
and even a proposed bipartisan conference _ that he proposed to
Lott that each side move its suggested procedure with a vote on
each (but no debate) at 5 p.m. Unfortunately, that would mean that
the very first act of the impeachment trial would be a partisan
vote. Bad!
</P>
<P>
   After description and discussion of the specifics of our
proposal,the Republican Conference asks Lott to try one more time
to get Daschle and the other Democrats to attend a bipartisan
conference.
</P>
<P>
   I join Gorton and Gramm reworking the proposal in the cloakroom
and do a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   When the Conference reconvenes at 5:50 p.m. Lott announces
Daschle has agreed to meet, and the entire Senate will convene in
the old Senate chambers for a joint conference at 9:30 a.m. This
will be historic, since I am unaware of the two parties ever
meeting in joint conference; but, then, we are not just senators
now, we are also serving under a separate oath as impeachment
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   This news is leavened by a warning that some House managers have
indicated they intended to use the entire time allotted for the
making of their case, to argue for the calling of witnesses. That
would be a huge mistake _ as irresponsible as some White House
threats to delay the case for months if the House is allowed to
call any witnesses. There is obviously a need for cooler heads to
prevail, hopefully at tomorrow's conference, and later, when we
reconvene as the impeachment jury at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the office for an HBO interview on my Internet gambling
legislation. I'm done at 7:45 p.m., and at 8 p.m. head for home for
dinner with two of our grandchildren, who quickly distract me from
today's momentous events. &QL;

   There is an old saying that first impressions matter. If the
very first vote in the impeachment trial is partisan, it will not
only be hard to change public perception, but it will also be hard
to reverse the momentum of partisanship in the trial itself. So
today's meeting of all senators in a closed-door conference is
critical. It will determine for all of history whether Republicans
and Democrats could agree on a procedure for the conduct of the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The setting of the conference will help. It is the old Senate
chambers, steeped with history and tradition, some of which was
recalled in presentations this morning.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:50 a.m., Senator Lott calls on Danny Akaka, D-Hawaii, for
an opening prayer. Its simple message of love, by a colleague loved
by all, seems to get the conference started off on a positive note.
Lott and Daschle follow with gracious and constructive remarks. And
then a tour de force by the Senate's pre-eminent orator, Robert
Byrd, D-W.V., who emphasizes the importance of bipartisanship to
establish credibility for the proceedings and dignity for the
institution of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers who follow each argue for either the Democratic
position that there should be no witnesses allowed in the trial or
the Republican position that the Senate should not preclude either
side from requesting witnesses (they still must each be approved by
majority vote under the Senate rules). While each speaker stresses
the desirability of working together (and one senses a
psychological tug toward a bipartisan solution), no practical
resolution is offered.
</P>
<P>
   And time is running out. If we cannot agree, the parties' two
resolutions will be voted on at 1 p.m., and the votes are likely to
be along mostly partisan lines. I can see the majority leader
getting very nervous as the last speaker, Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
speaks. But his is the home run in the bottom of the ninth!
</P>
<P>
   His argument is simple. Republicans, he says, are not holding
out for the possibility of witnesses at the urging of our House
Republican colleagues, as Democrats have thought, but, rather,
because of our view of the oath we took to do impartial justice.
(This is certainly my approach, and I'm glad someone is finally
saying it.) He concludes by stating the obvious: If the president
wanted to call some witnesses in his defense, every Senator would
agree to let him. Impartial justice requires that we accord the
other side the same right. Or, at least, that we not absolutely
deny the possibility that the House managers could call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the simple logic of Gramm's short statement or
his quotation of Daniel Webster (``I speak not as a New Englander
but as an American''), Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., was ready to meet
Gramm halfway. He urged that, while we may not have a plan to cover
all the bases, let's get to first base and second base together and
try to work out the rest of the trial as we go. In other words, get
the trial started as Republicans had suggested and leave the issue
of witnesses to be worked out under the Senate rules. Thus was born
the Gramm-Kennedy compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott seized on the offer; and with almost no time to
spare,it was agreed that we would proceed in that bipartisan way.
Drafters were appointed to write the resolution we would vote on
after the trial commenced at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible moment. Partisans being influenced by the
setting, history, each others' words and, I believe, a genuine
sense of duty to the Constitution and the institution. The Senate
is a bit like a boisterous family that has its internal fights; but
on historic occasions, can pull together in unity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing is easy in the Senate. So, instead of a vote
at 1 p.m. (which might have allowed Caryll and me to get back to
Phoenix for the Governor's Ball), there turned out to be some
devils in the details; and the final language was not ready for a
vote until 4:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Leader Lott had asked a delegation of four of
us to communicate with the House managers to inform them of the
proposal and discuss how they intended to proceed so that we could
begin laying the groundwork for a final resolution of the witness
issue before we have to face it in a couple of weeks. We met with
Chairman Hyde and his managers team until about 4 p.m., all of us
conscious of the limitations imposed by our respective roles, but
concluding that the communication was constructive.
</P>
<P>
   The formal trial session with the chief justice seems almost
anti-climactic after the day's events. A roll call vote, all 100
senators voting ``aye'' on the proposal put forth by the Republican
and Democratic leaders. And then we stood in recess until next
week, when the first phases of the trial begin, perhaps with
motions on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After all of the media stories about confusion and partisanship,
I wonder how the media will play this bipartisan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many interviews in my office I observe that this
was not a ``win or loss'' for either side; but one side did give up
a partisan advantage it could have had. I give credit to Democrats
who could have forced partisan votes and made the Republican
majority look bad. That they did not is a good sign that the Senate
proceedings, at least for now, will be less partisan than the House
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As I leave the office and reflect back on the week, I feel
better about the future of the country. But I am under no illusions
that anything will be easy about this trial. And, boy, do I have a
heavy briefcase of ``homework'' for the weekend. &QL;

MOLESTER A LEAD IN CASE OF MISSING MESA GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Police are hoping one Mesa girl's terrifying
Christmas Day ordeal will help crack the disappearance of
11-year-old Mikelle Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are checking for a link between Mikelle's Jan. 2
disappearance and the attempted molestation eight days earlier of
another 11-year-old girl less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa police released a composite sketch Saturday of a man they
say lured the girl behind an apartment complex in the 600 block of
South Stapley Drive and tried to force her to perform oral sex on
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly feel it's a lead,'' said Detective Jose Martinez,
a Mesa police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The girl escaped without performing the act on the man, who was
grimy and appeared to be a transient, police said. The incident
took place at 4 p.m. Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Police interviewed several witnesses who said they saw the man
in the complex several times before the attack, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   They have not seen the man since.
</P>
<P>
   Mikelle disappeared about 6 p.m. on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not connected the two cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of things that concern us. The
geographical location, the victims, the act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described the man as a 5-foot, 10-inch White male in
his 40s, weighing about 140 pounds. He has blond hair and brown
eyes, acne scars on his face and badly decayed front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   He was riding a blue mountain bike, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, police set up six roadblocks near Mikelle's home to
interview people who were driving through the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just trying to duplicate last Saturday night,''
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities found nothing after searching a mound of earth 15
miles north of Saguaro Lake.  &QL;

DIONNE HELPS HONOR ROBITAILLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ A dozen years ago, when Luc Robitaille was a
20-year-old rookie, he lived in the home of the Kings' top player
at the time, Marcel Dionne.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Dionne was in attendance when Robitaille was
honored for scoring the 500th goal of his NHL career two nights
earlier. Dionne is third on the NHL goal-scoring list with 731.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same young man I saw many years ago,'' said Dionne,
47, who owns a sports-marketing firm near Buffalo. ``He comes to
play every night, he's very enthusiastic, he loves the game and
he's a good family man. He's good for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robitaille was approaching the 500-goal mark, Kings general
manager Dave Taylor called Dionne and asked him if he would attend
ceremonies that would be held after the historic goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of snow and I had a lot of commitments,''
Dionne said. ``When he scored, I woke up everybody and said, `Well,
I guess I'm going to California.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of Robitaille's accomplishment, Dionne said: ``In order to score
500 goals, you've got to stay healthy. He's had a few nagging
injuries but nothing serious. He showed right off the bat he had
the ability. He hasn't looked back since.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's spoils: Robitaille received a sport-utility vehicle
from the Kings' organization, a big-screen television from his
teammates and a Tiffany trophy from the league, which was presented
to him by Dionne.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief ceremony after the first period, Kings television
announcer Bob Miller read congratulatory letters from fellow
500-goal scorers Mario Lemieux and Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard.
Robitaille was joined during the ceremony by his wife, two sons and
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Early meeting: Knowing the game would be delayed by the
Robitaille ceremony and fearing the effect of a distraction, coach
Larry Robinson met with his players in the morning rather than
early in the evening to go over the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played Edmonton a couple of days ago,'' Robinson said,
referring to Tuesday night's 4-3 overtime victory. ``There wasn't a
lot to go over. We just wanted to go over a few things we went over
in Edmonton. In Edmonton, I think we sat back too much. They're one
of the fastest teams in the league. If you give them too much room
to skate, it makes things doubly worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor not gloating: General manager Dave Taylor stayed patient
when the Kings were struggling earlier in the season, resisting
calls for a major move to boost the team. But even though the Kings
have played better recently, Taylor isn't crowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the start of camp, we felt we had a good team, but
we hadn't seen the team on the ice (until recently),'' Taylor said.
``We felt disappointed more than anything.... I don't think there
was ever any pressure (to make a deal). If the right hockey deal is
out there, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility of a trade now that the Kings would
be dealing from a stronger position, Taylor said: ``It's been quiet
lately. We're always looking to improve the team, especially with a
couple of guys (ailing forwards Glen Murray and Ray Ferraro) going
down who are going to be down for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Defenseman Doug Bodger missed his fifth game
because of the cervical strain and bruised shoulder he suffered
when checked from behind by Dallas Drake of Phoenix nearly two
weeks ago. By missing his fifth game, Bodger has missed more games
than Drake did for inflicting the damage with a dirty hit that
earned him a four-game suspension from the NHL.... Individual
tickets to Tip-A-King '99, the team's annual charity event, go on
sale Wednesday at the Forum and at all TicketMaster outlets. The
event will be held from 6 to 9:30 p.m. on Feb. 7 at The Hangar at
Merv Griffin Productions in Santa Monica. All proceeds benefit the
Kings Care Foundation. General admission tickets, priced at $75,
include food and drinks. VIP packages range from $2,500-$5,000. For
more information, call (213) 996-0118.

MICROSCOPE MAKER SAVORING CONTRACT WITH UCLA INSTITUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was the medical contract of the year for McBain
Instruments, maybe of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   After months of planning, presentations and negotiations, the
microscope maker and distributor based in suburban Chatsworth was
chosen last year by the University of California, Los Angeles, to
stock and service a new, state-of-the-art imaging center at the
college's prestigious Brain Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   When fully operational, the center will give campus scientists
access to dozens of sophisticated machines that, among other
things, use laser light to image individual cells as they work,
without damaging the tissue. The applications range from AIDS
research to the study of brain tumors and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the center's price tag that made the project so
attractive to McBain. Over five years the project will bring
several hundred thousand dollars in sales to the firm, but McBain
already provides more than $20 million worth of equipment to the
electronics and biomedicine sectors annually.
</P>
<P>
   The real draw was the chance to create a high-profile showcase
for McBain's razzle-dazzle products and, in the process, cozy up to
the UCLA name.
</P>
<P>
   McBain is not losing money on the deal, but ``we gave them
extremely advantageous pricing and are basically treating them like
a long-lost cousin,'' said Michael Crump, the company's director of
sales who served as point man in talks with the school.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling appears to be mutual. In getting top-notch equipment
and round-the-clock service at a bargain-basement price, UCLA
officials say they've struck a rare balance between serving the
needs of academia and industry.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the center, which last month opened as the Carol
Moss Spivak Imaging Core Facility, came in early 1997 when Dr.
Anthony Campagnoni, associate director of the brain institute,
realized that the facility's single confocal microscope was serving
the entirety of UCLA's neuroscience staff _ a crew of more than 200
researchers from 25 different departments.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was demand on the high-powered machine heavy, but the
microscope itself was, year by year, falling further behind the
technological curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a mechanism to bring us up to state of the
art, or at least of the commercial art, and it was my idea ... that
we could have a competition,'' Campagnoni said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end microscope market is controlled by four firms from
two countries: Japan's Olympus and Nikon; and Germany's Carl Zeiss
and Leica Microsystems. U.S. companies once ranked equally high,
but names like American Optical and Bausch &AMP; Lomb were, over the
years, acquired by or merged with larger players.
</P>
<P>
   After the better part of a year arranging funding for the center
and establishing competitive ground rules, Campagnoni sought out
local distributors of the Big Four, asking each to provide its
vision of what shape such a university-industry collaboration would
take.
</P>
<P>
   Campagnoni said he wanted the firms to fight for the right to
become ``the sole supplier of the best equipment they had to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brutal,'' said Crump, whose company represents Leica.
McBain, whose founder, Carl McBain, is coincidentally a UCLA
graduate, put hundreds of hours into preparing its three-hour
presentation, going so far as to fly in extra help from out of
state.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, in September 1997, went without a hitch. But
then the questions began. What warranties can you offer? How about
pricing? And, after all, what's so great about your machines?
</P>
<P>
   What little consolation McBain could take from the ordeal came
from the knowledge that the firm's three competitors were facing
the same onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Campagnoni and his advisers eventually winnowed the field down
to McBain and a firm representing Zeiss, and each was asked to
bring in its equipment for a series of test drives. Given that
Zeiss and Leica are ``the equivalent of Mercedes and a Lexus,''
however, Campagnoni said it was support and service that proved the
deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of computer chips in the 1960s and '70s,
high-end microscopes left the realm of free-standing machines and
became highly modulized devices, with pricey peripherals mixed and
matched to achieve the desired technique.
</P>
<P>
   In managing the dozens of modules a center like UCLA's brain
institute would need, ``We hadn't realized how important having a
local supplier would be,'' Campagnoni said. Having access to
technicians familiar with all the parts and located just a few
miles away became crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Though open less than a month and not yet stocked with its
centerpiece _ a $200,000-plus multiphoton scanning microscope that
can study cells deep within a tissue sample _ the imaging center
already is starting to pay marketing dividends, Crump said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making the center available to potential McBain
clients for real-world demonstrations, UCLA officials say students
who leave to start their own businesses often buy the same brand of
equipment on which they were trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to use the publicity as much as we can, using the
name of UCLA and of the core facility ... and we're seeing some
coattails,'' Crump said.

JONES FOUGHT LAW, AND WON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ HBO premiered a new documentary Saturday
night. It was called ``Anatomy of a Mismatch.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first bell to the final 10-count, Golden Johnson and
Ricky Frazier no more belonged in a boxing ring with ``Sugar''
Shane Mosley and Roy Jones than did Magic Johnson and Walt Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Neither encounter was much to watch, but by far the worse was
Jones's battering of the 39-year-old New York City police officer
in less than two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier entered the ring at the Pensacola Civic Center in full
police garb, including service revolver. With him were a bevy of
cornermen wearing NYPD windbreakers. The only thing missing from
the station house look was a box of donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier would have been wise to have kept the revolver with him
after the bell sounded because with it he might have gone the
distance with the World Boxing Council-World Boxing Association
light heavyweight champion. Without it he went to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That first happened from two right hands and a sweeping left
hook late in the first round. None landed flush but none had to.
Frazier (18-4-1) got up but had no chance to survive this onslaught
unless he was taken into protective custody.
</P>
<P>
   That was not an option to him because the WBC had mandated this
fight after naming Frazier its No. 1 contender, so he had no choice
but to come out for the second round. Mercifully, it was his last.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (39-1, 33 knockouts) stalked Frazier and finally dropped
him with a left hand to the temple that sent him into a squat and a
following right that knocked him to the floor. When he got up,
Frazier was on wobbly legs and referee Armando Garcia stepped in
and made a citizen's arrest, ending the bout at 2:59 of the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very satisfying,'' Jones admitted. ``I don't pick
these guys. He was the No. 1 contender. It's not my job to tell
these people what to do. I just fight.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Mosley, unfortunately for Golden Johnson, who stayed
around a lot longer but with the same result when he went down for
the fourth time late in the seventh round and refused to rise until
referee Tommy Kimmons counted him out. Frankly, it was the smartest
thing he did all night.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley first dropped Johnson with two left hooks to the body in
the third round that sent him to his knees. When he got up, Mosley
methodically stalked him until, with only seconds left in the
round, the champion landed another perfect left to the ribs that
sent Johnson down again on one knee. It would become a familiar
position.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Johnson did what he could to fight back, but for
the most part Mosley was paying far too much attention to his
business, all at his challenger's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised he fought back the way he did, but
this was a championship fight and he wanted the belt,'' Mosley
said. ``He was swinging with desperation shots. He let me know he
was trying to win. He's a durable, strong kid with a hard head.''
</P>
<P>
   Would that his ribs had been as hard because after carrying
Johnson for several more rounds, Mosley (31-0, 29) went back to
work in the seventh and hurt his challenger with a sweeping right
hook, followed by two more blistering punches that sent him down
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   This was now becoming a habit but not something Johnson found
habit forming. Just a round earlier, Johnson (15-3-2) did not land
a single punch, according to CompuBox. Although this limited his
opportunity for victory, it also kept him upright for a round,
something that soon would not be the case again after a fierce
flurry by Mosley ended with a left to the body that sent Johnson to
one knee for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   As he stared directly at his cornermen, Johnson squatted as if
he were waiting to have a team picture taken with his basketball
buddies. His arms were across his knee as Kimmons counted him out,
his cornermen not encouraging him to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't injured at all,'' Johnson admitted. ``Those body
shots just took a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Fights like Saturday night's do, too, on anyone who has to watch
them.

MAPLE LEAFS TURN OUT LIGHTS ON BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAFS-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Well, what did you expect?
</P>
<P>
   As long shots go, this one might have stacked up at 25 to 1, if
you're an optimist. Yes, we know. On any given night any team can
beat any other team, blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, with seven regular players out of their lineup,
including their best defenseman _ Ray Bourque _ and several others
battling the flu, the Bruins were vulnerable to a pretty
significant beating and that's just what they received Saturday
night as they fell to the Maple Leafs, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he had a two-tiered strategy heading into
Saturday night's contest, the final one for Boston in Maple Leaf
Gardens. One was to pray, the other to try to bore the Maple Leafs
into such a state of catatonia that the Bruins would be able to
sneak in a few goals.
</P>
<P>
   Good survival tactic perhaps, but the only team that appeared to
be sleeping in the early going was the Bruins, who surrendered
three goals on three shots in the first 10:17. When it ballooned to
4-0 at the 14-minute mark and the Leafs were getting one odd-man
rush after another, Burns pulled goalie Byron Dafoe in favor of Rob
Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which was worse,'' said Dafoe, ``my save
percentage or my goals against, seven shots and four goals or four
goals in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which had its win streak snapped at three, hasn't had a
great deal of success here in recent years. The last win for the
Bruins in Toronto was Jan. 22, 1992. In their final six visits to
the old barn, they were 0-3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was a big-time train wreck for the Bruins. Just
1:19 in, Todd Warriner, in the right circle, dished the puck down
to Derek King, who redirected it past Dafoe. Only 33 seconds later,
shot No. 2 became goal No. 2. With the Bruins running around in
their own end, Igor Korolev got the puck in front on a pass from
Garry Valk. Dafoe, trying to stop Valk, left a wide-open net and
Korolev had time to switch from forehand to backhand and easily pop
the puck home at 1:52. Burns called a timeout and the bleeding
stopped, momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Bruins squandered a two-on-one chance with Ken
Baumgartner missing the net wide, the Maple Leafs made it a
three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Valk blocked a wrist shot by Hal Gill (who was on the ice for
all four goals during the barrage) and then took off up the ice. He
teed up a slapper that sailed under the glove of Dafoe. At 14
minutes even, Sergei Berezin made it a four-goal bulge on a goal
the Bruins disputed. With Dafoe well out of the net, a shot from
the point bounced off Berezin and then Dafoe and popped high in the
air, sailing over the goalie and into the net. The Bruins argued
that Berezin interfered with Dafoe and although there was
incidental contact, it occurred when Dafoe was several feet in
front of the crease with the puck already in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas came in and Dafoe, who went into the game with three
straight wins and a stingy 1.00 goals against average in that span,
headed to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins fought the good fight and managed to chip away with
Shawn Bates scoring his third of the year at 15:33 to make it 4-1.
Bates, who was calling for the puck in the right circle, took a
pass from Steve Heinze and snapped a shot past Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins made a game of it in the middle period and Joseph was
nothing short of outstanding as the Leafs' defense completely
collapsed. Bruins rookie Andre Savage, playing only his second NHL
game, had four shots in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Boston outshot Toronto, 12-7, in the period and 25-14 in the
first 40 minutes and climbed to within two at 17:53 on Joe
Thornton's seventh of the season, on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   But a shorthanded strike by Mike Johnson at 7:48 of the third
and another Johnson tally on the power play at 14:14 proved to be
lights out. Boston's Kyle McLaren ended the scoring with a
power-play tally at 17:32 on assists from Dmitri Khristich and
Steve Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this Leafs team was going to come at us (after losing,
2-1, to the Bruins Thursday night). In this league, 2-0 in the
first five minutes of a game you can forget it,'' said Burns.
``It's really tough to come back. I thought we had a chance maybe
to come back at the end of the second period, in all honesty I
thought we could have been tied with them, but that first Johnson
goal, that cut us off at the knees.''

LATEST DVD OFFERING A REAL BLAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The burgeoning digital versatile disc format has
reached another milestone, giving viewers a chance to feel as if
they're in midst of an atomic bomb test.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming they want to.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD version of ``Trinity and Beyond'' will go on sale next
month for $29.95, two years after the 95-minute video from Visual
Concept Engineering first hit store shelves. Goldhill Home Media
International, of Thousand Oaks in neighboring Ventura County, sold
a respectable 50,000 copies of the documentary; it will ship
between 2,500 and 5,000 copies of the DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of going to DVD was to make you feel as if you
were actually part of it and take it out of the realm of stock
footage,'' said Peter Kuran, producer and director of the
documentary on nuclear weapons development and testing that
occurred between 1945 and 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of the sequences, the shock wave goes by and knocks
over the trees,'' he said. ``They've made it feel like the wave
went past you by using all six speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The DVD will carry a warning label about the ``extreme dynamic
range'' of some of the footage. That means playing ``Trinity and
Beyond'' at top volume could blow out speakers, an event that
occurred at AIX Media Group's Los Angeles studio during the
``authoring'' phase of production.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Kuran began collecting and restoring
declassified footage of U.S. nuclear tests, newsreels,
informational videos and rarely seen footage of Chinese and Russian
tests. The original video included narration by actor William
Shatner and music by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Kuran, whose Visual Concept Engineering, based in suburban
Slymar, also creates special effects, said he began working on the
DVD due to fan demand and his desire to make more material from the
days of the arms race available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting e-mail all along since `Trinity' came out
from people who wanted a laserdisc or DVD version,'' he said. ``We
went out to the Nevada test site and we found a lot of footage that
had been shot with two cameras together, so you get to see houses
blowing up in 3-D.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD, first introduced in March 1997, offers digital-quality
video and surround sound plus five hours of playback. Sales of DVD
players recently topped 1 million, and one analyst has forecast
that more than 19 million U.S. homes will own at least one DVD
player within five years.
</P>
<P>
   For the ``Trinity'' DVD, new features besides 3-D footage
include Dolby 5.1 surround sound, a slide show of photos from the
atomic testing era, Kuran's commentary, a database listing of U.S.
tests and motion graphics menus. The DVD version was made from a
new master print of the original.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Trinity' has done quite well considering there's no major
studio behind it,'' Kuran said. ``It's not going to be in the same
part of the store as `Titanic,' but at least it's in there. And the
DVD is a real improvement on the VHS because it maintains the
integrity of the original footage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Goldman, president of Goldhill, said: `` `Trinity' is the
kind of project that we look for to differentiate ourselves in the
marketplace. What Peter Kuran and AIX have done is take very unique
historical footage, digitize and enhance it and take it to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his next project, Kuran is working on ``Atomic
Journeys,'' focusing on tests where nearby residents weren't aware
of the effects of the explosions _ three of them in Alaska, two in
Mississippi and 900 in Nevada.

UCLA BEATS OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Expect to see the black headband again. Very
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore one my freshman year in high school, and I might have
to do it again,'' said guard Baron Davis, whose headband matched
UCLA's black uniforms Saturday at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the way I shot against Oregon State, I needed some kind
of good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   He had just enough, matching a career-high with 22 points and
leading UCLA to a 65-63 victory before 9,087 at rowdy McArthur
Court _ a victory that was as important as it was surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed by 12 points early, rallied late in the first
half and, with Davis in charge, led for most of the second. The
winning basket was a tip-in by freshman center Dan Gadzuric with
1:28 left, as the Ducks failed to score on their last four
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In winning at Mac Court for the second time in six years, the
Bruins (11-3, 3-1) secured the weekend split essential for keeping
pace in the Pac-10. They just did it in unexpected fashion. No one
loses at Oregon State and wins at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one makes two 3-point shots in 0.8 seconds,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects the entire conference,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin
said. ``Look at the scores thus far. None of it makes any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Like UCLA panicking in the quiet of Oregon State's Gill Coliseum
and, two days later, playing with supreme poise in the din of Mac
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Or forcing shots against OSU's passive zone defense and playing
with patience against the Ducks' pressure man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   Or committing silly fouls against OSU's punchless attack and
playing sound defense against Oregon's arsenal of scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it wasn't the headbands. Maybe it was their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game at Oregon State was ridiculous,'' Davis said as he
munched on pizza and iced his surgically repaired left knee. ``It's
good we put Oregon State behind us and prepared for this game.
Instead of being 0-2, we go home with a split, and that's what we
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night, we looked for the first open shot and thought
it was a good shot. But it wasn't. It was bait. As the point guard,
I have to run the club.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA defeated Oregon by the same score it lost to Oregon State.
Otherwise, there were no similarities. The Bruins shots 28 percent
Thursday and 45.5 percent Saturday. They had 14 turnovers Thursday
and nine Saturday, a season low. They committed 29 fouls Thursday
and 14 fouls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Oregon State was one of the Bruins' worst losses in recent
memory, then Oregon was one of their most spirited victories in
years. A few weeks from now _ after they've run the upcoming
Cal-Stanford-USC-Louisville gauntlet _ they may look back on
Saturday as a breakthrough victory. Certainly, they recaptured the
competitive edge gained against Arizona and lost at Oregon State.
Chances are, the Ducks will not lose many in Mac Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the poorest games Oregon has played,'' Lavin
said. ``We may have had something to do with that. But they didn't
have their usual aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially satisfying for Davis, considering he
committed two turnovers in the final 30 seconds at Oregon State. He
started slowly Saturday, as well, with several early mistakes. But
as the evening unfurled and the pressure mounted, he found his
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron Davis took over as far as his toughness and intensity,''
Ducks coach Ernie Kent said. ``At one point, he dribbled through
our entire team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks jumped to a 27-15 lead before Davis and sophomore
guard Ryan Bailey led a 20-4 surge that gave the Bruins a
four-point halftime advantage. They led for all but four minutes of
the second half and took their final lead when Gadzuric tipped in
Jerome Moiso's miss with 1:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Alex Scales missed a 3-pointer with 7.5 seconds left,
and JaRon Rush grabbed the last of his game-high 12 rebounds. He
missed the ensuing free throw, but Gadzuric tipped the ball to
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding the ball, Davis tried to kill the clock by
lobbing it into midair near UCLA's basket. His ploy failed,
however, as Scales tried to gain control on the right side. Before
he could attempt a desperation shot, Earl Watson knocked the ball
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared coach to death,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, a ho-hum weekend on the Oregon Trail.

NORTHRIDGE LOSES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scratch the idea of winning the Big Sky
Conference. Forget the postseason all together.
</P>
<P>
   Put the rise of Cal State Northridge on hold. For a while. A
long while.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only thing keeping the Matadors from last place in
the conference is a team with a 29-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is entrenched in the depths of the conference, a point
hammered home by Eastern Washington on Saturday. The Eagles beat
CSUN 85-79 for their first road win this season.
</P>
<P>
   The impact sent CSUN coach Bobby Braswell and his assistant to
their offices for some late-night flim work. Players weren't
available to the media afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone to go home and we'll give them (today) off
because we have to try to figure our way out, and find our way
out,'' Braswell said. ``I think they're struggling because we
expected to be doing a little better. We're playing cautious right
now and we have to get that cautiousness away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 72-hour span the Matadors (9-7, 1-3 Big Sky) were beaten on
their home court by Eastern Washington and Portland State, teams
that had combined for one road win prior to this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Higgins scored a career-high 26 points and Rico Harris
added a career-high 22 points and 10 rebounds, but inconsistency
cost the Matadors on offense. The rest of the Matadors scored just
31 points and limped through a 10 of 32 shooting night. Sophomore
forward Brian Heinle continued his skid with two points, 10 below
his average.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that CSUN shot a miserable 17 of 34 from the free
throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot 17 of 34 and lose by six, that hurts,'' Braswell
said. ``They took 34 free throws and made 24. That's six points.
It's the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's lofty aspirations of its first Big Sky title and an NCAA
Tournament bid have given way to grave disappointment that will
send CSUN on a road trip to the Montanas searching for their souls,
and a way to resurrect the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the overtime losses to Northern Arizona and Portland
State, there was no energetic comeback against Eastern Washington.
No furious flurry that offset 30 minutes of indecision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 10 minutes of suffocating defense that allowed
CSUN to fight back in those games, all the Matadors could muster
against Eastern Washington (5-8, 2-1) were whimpers quickly quieted
by easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great win for us, a great road win for us,'' said Eastern
Washington coach Steve Aggers, a former Pepperdine assistant. ``I
think we did a good job defending the 3-pointers (CSUN was 6 of
25). I thought our defense was really huge and I thought we
answered what they did very well.''
</P>
<P>
   During a two-minute spurt midway through the second half the
Eagles countered each CSUN score with a layup or dunk as the
Matadors failed to get back on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles native Deon Williams, a Verbum Dei High graduate,
had a lot to do with that. He led the Eagles with 25 points and was
instrumental in Eastern Washington maintaining a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to define as a coach,'' Braswell said. ``I think
there's some doubting. They wanted to get it going and couldn't get
it going. The tough loss the other night against Portland State and
the (overtime) loss at (Northern Arizona) has taken away some
confidence.''

FISET RETURNS, GIVES KINGS A TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was a night to commemorate Luc Robitaille's 500th
goal, but also a night for a different hero. This time, Stephane
Fiset was the key to the Kings' success, or at least to their
absence of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Back in goal for the first time in nearly a month after
recovering from his latest groin strain, Fiset made 32 saves and
for much of the night kept the Kings in the game in what ended a
1-1 tie with the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night before a crowd
of 14,936 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second overtime game of the week between the Oilers
and Kings, who had recorded a 4-3 victory four nights earlier in
Edmonton on a goal by Craig Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake scored for the Kings, and Ryan Smyth for the Oilers,
who got strong goaltending from Bob Essensa (29 saves). The
strangest moment of the night came in the third period, when
5-foot-8 Kings winger Donald Audette fought 6-2 Oilers wing Bill
Guerin to a draw. Both received fighting majors, and Audette
departed for the night with a game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (15-21-4) extended their unbeaten streak to six, and
are 7-1-1 in their last nine games. They are 2-0-1 against the
Oilers (16-18-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took an early lead on Blake's third goal this season,
20 fewer than he scored a year ago when he led NHL defensemen in
goal scoring and won the Norris Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Blake - who missed 15 games with a broken foot and another three
when suspended for a slashing incident - scored on an early power
play, beating Essensa with a 35-foot one-timer from the slot off a
pass from Audette.
</P>
<P>
   But though the Kings held the lead, they weren't able to control
the flow of play. And 6:22 into the second period, the Oilers got
the opportunity they needed to even the score when Kings center
Jozef Stumpel received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking
Mike Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one minute later, the Kings left Smyth alone in front
of their net, and Guerin passed him the puck. Fiset sprawled to
make the initial save, but Smyth tucked the rebound into a
wide-open net.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings escaped the second period without allowing another
goal, even surviving a couple of shifts in which they tried and
failed several times to clear the puck out of their zone. Each
time, the Oilers would regain possession and apply pressure, but
they couldn't get the puck past Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   In the final moments of the second period, with the Kings
shorthanded, they got a rare scoring chance of their own, but a
20-foot shot from the slot by Vladimir Tsyplakov deflected
harmlessly off the crossbar. The Oilers then created a similar
chance of their own, but Fiset smothered Boris Mironov's 35-footer.
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, the Oilers continued to have the better of
play, but Fiset continued to keep the Kings in the game, never more
so than when he stopped a point-blank chance by George Laraque less
than five minutes into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Kings' got a good shorthanded scoring chance,
with Essensa stopping Ian Laperriere on a breakaway with 8:30
remaining. A subsequent holding-the-stick penalty on Todd Marchant
followed, as did more chances but no goals for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   With 2:32 left, Mark Visheau took a slashing penalty in
retaliation for one missed by referee Rob Shick, but the Kings
survived, and overtime ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset made the best stop of the extra period, a glove save on
Marchant, who fired a 40-footer from the right boards after
entering the zone with speed with 1:16 to go. Blake blocked a shot
in the closing seconds to preserve the tie.

`MR. BEIGE' USES UNDERDOG ROLE AS MOTIVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Unlike the Cardinals' owner, he never was a
waterboy. Unlike his quarterback, he doesn't quote from ``The
Waterboy''.
</P>
<P>
   But as his team continues to shock the world, Mr. Beige is
becoming a master motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are a lot of smiles in Minnesota right now,''
Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin told the team seconds after their
first-round playoff victory over Dallas eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to play San Francisco or Green Bay. They get
to play the lowly Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Few think the ``lowly'' Cardinals, 16-point underdogs, have a
chance to upset the Minnesota Vikings today in an NFC second-round
playoff game at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   A Minneapolis newspaper said the Cardinals are as dangerous as a
``ball of lint.'' A St. Paul, Minn., newspaper already is talking
about the Vikings' ``March to Miami'' and Super Bowl XXXIII. A Twin
Cities radio station asked its listeners Friday whom they thought
the Vikings will play in the Super Bowl, Denver or the New York
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   None of that fazes Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer, who keeps
repeating a line from the movie ``Waterboy''.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do it,'' Plummer said. ``We can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one team did beat the Vikings, who were an NFL best 15-1 in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers stunned them, 27-24, on Nov. 1 at
Tampa's Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa scored first and trailed only once. Mike Alstott rushed
for 128 yards in that game, and Warrick Dunn added 115. The
Cardinals haven't had two 100-yard rushers in a game all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be successful running the ball,'' said the
Cardinals' Adrian Murrell, their 1,000-yard rusher.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have the NFL's top passer in Randall Cunningham.
Rookie Randy Moss had a league-high 17 touchdown catches. John
Randle led all defensive tackles in sacks with 10{.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive end Simeon Rice said Vikings offensive
tackles Todd Steussie and Korey Stringer are the best duo he has
seen all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can't do is fall behind early,'' Buccaneers
Coach Tony Dungy said. ``The first time we played them, we got
behind, 21-0, and lost, 31-7. When we beat them, we were one of the
few teams still in the game in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings set an NFL scoring record with 556 points, and their
past seven opponents have been beaten by 10 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team that has so many ways to beat you,'' Dungy said.
``Everyone says you don't want to give up the big play early, and
then Moss catches a 60-yard touchdown on you. They have a back
(Robert Smith) who averages 5 yards a carry and another one (Leroy
Hoard) who comes in the game and runs over people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they're going to make their share of plays. You know
they're going to score. You just hope to make them go six plays to
get down the field instead of three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals know they can't get into a shootout with
Minnesota. They also don't think the Vikings are going to dominate
a Cardinals defense that shut out Dallas a week ago until the final
four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our offense is going to have to go out and score
45 to 70 points,'' Cardinals wide receiver Frank Sanders said. ``I
mean, this is not a (Brigham Young)-San Diego State game. We
believe our defense can shut them down. We really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Few agree with Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings were unbeaten at home this season and won those
games by an average of more than 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   They have nine players who will be in the Pro Bowl. The
Cardinals' only representative is Aeneas Williams, the only
cornerback on the team Moss thinks is better than average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a tremendous amount of pressure on them,''
Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown said. ``Compiling a 15-1
record and all the offensive records they broke, anything short of
a Super Bowl for them is a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Dennis Green thinks there is no chance his team
will overlook the Cardinals, who needed field goals from Chris
Jacke on the final plays of their last three regular-season games
to qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the same people that say we're the favorites were the
same people who picked us fourth in the NFC Central Division,''
Green said. ``It was only five months ago that they said Green Bay
would win it, Tampa Bay would be second, Detroit third and
Minnesota fourth. We saw ourselves as the Central Division champion
then and we see ourselves as that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been privy to what people think conventional
wisdom is. We're playing just as hard as we have for the previous
16 games and doing everything we can to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cardinals victory today would be one of the biggest upsets in
NFL playoff history. It would put former waterboy Bill Bidwill's
franchise, which hadn't won a playoff game in 51 years until a week
ago, one step away from the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive back J.J. McCleskey said he doesn't think an
upset would be shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the NBA championship,'' McCleskey said. ``It's not
the best four out of seven. It's whoever shows up that day. We're
good enough to show up (today).''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in this locker room feels we're going to lose,'' Jamir
Miller said. ``Cinderella was a girl who had a fairy godmother who
came to give her something. Nothing was given to us, and I want
people to understand that. There's no Cinderella to this, there's
no mystery to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the games we needed to win to get where we are. So
that's what it boils down to _ we worked hard to get it, and we got
it.'' &QL;

CUNNINGHAM'S DUE FOR A PICK OR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ They have one shot, a puncher's chance. And while
they're playing with house money now, their pockets are bulging
with the currency of belief.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, bless their optimism, are inhaling the
impossible, ignoring the scent of logic.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it smells like 45-20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to test Aeneas (Williams), we're going to test the
rookie (Corey Chavous), we're going to test their safeties,`'
Minnesota Vikings receiver Cris Carter said. ``Because that's what
we do. We know we're going to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Vikings didn't win 15 games by accident. They are
nearly unbeatable at home, an explosive team on turf, as nasty as
they are quick. They have nine Pro Bowlers, a fortress of an
offensive line, the most productive attack in the history of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Reed is returning to the lineup, completing what could be
the best trio of receivers since the invention of goal posts. The
Metrodome is a noose of noise, a place where overmatched meets
overwhelmed. Add it all up, and you have what passes for bored
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   A team and a town waiting to celebrate today's final score and
move on to a worthy opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember myself being a young Jake Plummer, where you just
go out, have fun and win games,'' Vikings quarterback Randall
Cunningham said. ``We're different. We have a rhythm, a basic style
that we stay with and don't change. We're kind of like a machine,
where you turn it on, it's got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be as much of a veiled insult as you're going to find
entering this game. Not that the Vikings can't talk smack. They
just don't see the point.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as the Cardinals arrived at their hotel, the lobby
was full of screaming fans, the kind that believe No. 16 can carry
a 16-point underdog into the winner's circle. In truth, the
Cardinals need an improbable trifecta: They need to dominate time
of possession, turn every opportunity into touchdowns and limit the
Vikings to field goals.
</P>
<P>
   A puncher's chance _ if they can stop the Vikings' offense
before it gets started. And it all starts with Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was retired, cutting marble and granite for
kitchen counters. He is 35 years old, serene as a statue, convinced
that God really cares which team wins a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my selfish ways, I didn't want to play football anymore,''
Cunningham said. ``But I heard so many people ask when I was coming
back that I started thinking spiritually. I just went and prayed,
'God, if you're speaking through people to tell me to come back and
play football, I really need a clear sign. Have teams call me up.'
After I prayed that prayer, teams started calling. I took that as a
sign that God was answering my prayers. So that's what I did. I
accepted it.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of reincarnation, Cunningham can be wildly
unpredictable. For all the MVP consideration, he is ultimately the
beneficiary of a stocked arsenal. He threw 14 touchdown passes
before his first pick. If the Cardinals' secondary can somehow
cloud his vision, keep red in the vicinity of purple, there is a
four-interception game lurking in his arm. He's due, and if it
happens today, the Cardinals have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wonderful if the Cardinals are game enough to make
it a game, unleashing the vacuum of pressure on the hosts. For as
sleek and skillful as the Vikings are, they are starting to get
bloated with self-infatuation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should. Maybe they are that good. And in all
probability, logic will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Mike Ditka's Chicago Bears upset the Redskins in
Washington. They caught the fever of belief, just like the
Cardinals. And when the San Francisco 49ers were listed as 20-point
favorites the following week, Ditka bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian army couldn't beat us by 20 points,'' Ditka said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Soviets couldn't, but the 49ers did. Twenty-three to
zip.
</P>
<P>
   The following season, the Bears won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that. Because in the end, the most important thing
about today is where it leads tomorrow.

BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE, BUT THEY'LL PLAY INDOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ What's the coldest you've ever been?
</P>
<P>
   For me, it had to be the Winter Olympics in Norway (holy fjords,
it was cjold) or any day in Minneapolis the week of Super Bowl
minus XXVI.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane descended on the eve of today's Cardinals-Vikings
game and the bleak winter scene appeared below, the memory of that
January week seven years ago came back to me with a shiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was your trip?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I still can see his face.
</P>
<P>
   A robust-looking man with snowy hair and sparking blue eyes
identified himself as a member of the Super Bowl XXVI volunteer
task force. His task was to greet arriving visitors at the airport
and present them with a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have a hand warmer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Winter smiled. ``Where you from?''
</P>
<P>
   When told it was Arizona, the greeter laughed. ``Here, have
another!'' He pressed a second mini-heater into my hand. ``Don't
mean to scare you,'' he said cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals had to play outdoors today, they wouldn't stand
a chance. Most people think they don't anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesotans are hearty folk. They're accustomed to deep-freeze
weather. (Saturday's high hit one degree.) Their blood thick as
syrup, they can withstand temperatures most humans can't, and they
did, when the Vikings played their home games in old Metropolitan
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it wasn't cold,'' Carl Eller recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Eller played for the Vikings the last time the Cards came here
for a playoff game in 1974. The Cards lost, 30-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't cold because Bud Grant ``told'' me it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant was the Minnesota coach, and every season, as winter
approached, Bud told his team the dog story.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings, he said, were like a dog. As it gets colder, a
dog's coat grows longer. Grant told his players that by practicing
outdoors, regardless of how bitter the cold, their skin would
become thicker and their tolerance for the elements would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota built the Metrodome in 1982. The Vikings scratched the
door, and barked with joy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Cardinals will play in a controlled climate (``I
hear they keep it pretty warm in there,'' Jake Plummer said) may be
the one positive going into the game they are expected to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Our lads don't have to play on a frozen field or worry whether
they brought the right type of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   They have to worry about Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Until kickoff, the Cardinals' primary objective will be to
survive. So far no one has suffered hypothermia or frostbite. As of
press time Jake had all his fingers. I counted.
</P>
<P>
   But it is c-c-old outside. The weather brought to mind another
Winter Olympics, in Calgary. The day of the opening ceremonies a
message flashed on the giant electronic board outside the stadium.
``Watch for frostbite warnings. White waxy skin, and a Smurf-like
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between the singing of ``O Canada'' and the pigeon
release I felt myself shrinking and turning a bluish tint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stinger, eh?'' a bareheaded Canadian photographer said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stinger, all right.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals would do well to follow the same routine Cotton
Fitzsimmons did when he coached the Suns and the team went to
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   When the team plane landed, Cotton had a bus waiting on the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran from the plane to the bus,'' Fitzsimmons recalled. ``And
I always made sure the bus was heated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bus arrived outside the hotel, Cotton placed his gloved
hands over his ears and sprinted to the lobby. ``About 15 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got to his room, he turned up the thermostat. For dinner
he called room service. In the evening he watched TV. ``I saw every
movie the hotel had when I was there,'' Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   When time came to go to the game, Cotton bundled up and raced
from the lobby to the bus, which drove directly into the Target
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there many times, but that's all I know about
Minnesota,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``It's a nice place, they tell
me.'' &QL;

DITKA ISN'T A FAN OF THE METRODOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka used to refer to the
Metrodome in Minneapolis as the ``roller dome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So one year we get six boxes of in-line skates addressed to
Mike, and he's skating around our offices at Halas Hall,'' said
Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, who was linebackers
coach for the Bears before he joined Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin's
staff three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings got even. When the Bears took the field for pre-game
warm-ups, Vikings cheerleaders were wearing sunglasses, skates and
Jim McMahon headbands in honor of the Bears quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka outdid himself before the game in Minnesota the next year
(1990). He called the place ``a barn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They got 40 huge plastic animals around the (Metrodome) field
and decorated the place with hay,'' McGinnis said. ``We come out of
our locker room and there's a plastic bull, sticking its (hind end)
in our face as we came out of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ditka comes on the field and they're playing, Old MacDonald
Had a Farm. He gets into it. He's waving his finger over his head,
egging the fans on.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be calmer at the Metrodome today when the Cardinals
play the Vikings in an NFC second-round playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have played a playoff game in Minnesota once
before, in 1974 at frigid Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been much too cold for roller skating or farm
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure we took everything,'' Cardinals trainer John
Omohundro said. ``We brought tennis shoes, Canadian broom ball
shoes and cleats.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quick turnaround &QL; 
 &QL; 
If the Cardinals lose today, they will have 24 hours to decide
which five players they will leave unprotected in next month's
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the final four teams in the playoffs, each club has
to give its protected list to the Cleveland Browns by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won't say who will be unprotected, but it's a good
bet that defensive tackle Jerry Drake, who is in jail because of
two driving-under-the-influence convictions, will be made
available.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities are cornerback Ty Howard and linebacker
Terry Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, a native of Columbus, Ohio, hopes he's not on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals drafted me,'' said Howard, a 1997 third-round
pick. ``I would like nothing more than to play here. But I
understand it's a business. If it happens, I'll just make the best
of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a player from a team is picked, the team can pull back one
unprotected player. The most players any team can lose is two.
</P>
<P>
   Only one player of 10 or more years of experience can be exposed
and no kickers or punters can be left unprotected. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Food fest &QL; 
 &QL; 
Billionaire Paul Allen didn't just throw a lot of money at Coach
Mike Holmgren. He lured him away from the Green Bay Packers to the
Seattle Seahawks by serving him an extravagant feast last Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Allen served Holmgren, his wife, daughter and agent a
seven-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food was described in French, so I'm not sure what we had,
but it was good,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   It helped when Allen, the third-richest man in America, offered
Holmgren an eight-year deal worth $40 million. He will make nearly
twice as much as as the next-highest paid coach in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the NBA lockout, I wasn't in midseason form with these
agents,'' said Seahawks President Bob Whitsitt, who also runs the
NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. ``I got worn down a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   They also gave Holmgren a lot of power and a fancy title _
executive vice president of football operations/general manager and
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my time and how I divide up my time is going to be
absolutely critical,'' Holmgren said. ``I think the key to that is
hiring good people around me. And we will do that. And then I have
to learn to delegate a little bit more because the time factor is
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my No. 1 focus is and will always be coaching that
football team on Sunday. I think I'm pretty good at that, and the
other part, I will grow into.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short memories &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Packers replace Holmgren with former Philadelphia coach
Ray Rhodes, they will have to forget Rhodes' parting remarks from
Green Bay six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes resigned as the Packers' defensive coordinator because he
didn't think Green Bay was a good place for African-Americans to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Packers officials were furious with Rhodes' remarks. They were
trying to overcome that image in attracting free agents.
</P>
<P>
   If Rhodes doesn't get the job, Jacksonville defensive
coordinator Dick Jauron, another former Packers assistant, will be
a strong contender.
</P>
<P>
   Packers General Manager Ron Wolf said he would like to find
someone who's offense is compatible to the ``West Coast'' style
used by Holmgren, but he wouldn't rule out hiring a defensive
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defensive back coach has got to know offenses as much as
anybody,'' a Packers source said of Rhodes and Jauron.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's offensive coordinator, Sherman Lewis, is not expected
to get much consideration. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Student of history &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carolina aggressively went after George Seifert and got him
before the other teams with coaching vacancies could make their
moves.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring has been endorsed by former Washington Redskins Coach
Joe Gibbs and Seifert's old boss in San Francisco, Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really envy him,'' said Walsh, 67. ``I wish I was 10 years
younger. If I was, I'd try to out-interview George for the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is one of the great coaches in the game today. His
won-loss record (108-35) is obviously superb. He's organized,
strong, demanding, fair, direct, honest and hard-working.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert, who has the best winning percentage (.755) in NFL
history, is anxious to return to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the exact saying, but Teddy Roosevelt was
talking about competing and not competing and living in the gray
twilight that knows not victory or defeat,'' Seifert said. ``The
last couple of years, I've been living in a gray twilight. There's
an empty feeling.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde enters today's playoff game
against Jacksonville with an 0-6 record against the Jaguars.
``Unfortunately, no matter what happens in these playoffs, if Vinny
makes a mistake, that's all people are going to be talking about,''
former Giants quarterback Phil Simms said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the past 18 head-coaching hirings in the NFL, none has gone
to an African-American. &QL;

DIXON FINDS LIFE AT GUARD  
 EX-ASU DEFENDER BLOCKS FOR VIKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not so much that it was surprising to hear Arizona
Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis praising Minnesota
Vikings offensive right guard David Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   The shock was that McGinnis _ or any NFL coach, for that matter
_ even knows who David Dixon is today.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon is the former rugby player from New Zealand who showed up
at tiny Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, in 1988 and decided to
play football on a whim. He was so green, he says, teammates taught
him how to put the pads inside his pants.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to Arizona State in 1990, started seven games as
a 6-foot-6, 296-pound defensive tackle for Cardinals secondary
coach Larry Marmie, then became a full-time starter as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   So what's this man doing starting at offensive guard for a team
that plays football at the highest level and owns the best 1998
record on the planet?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who gets overlooked on that line,'' McGinnis said.
``Randall McDaniel and Todd Steussie (perennial All-Pros) get all
of the publicity, and rightly so, but David Dixon has been very,
very, very stable for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a load to move around in the middle. A load. I can say
nothing bad about David Dixon. You can't have an offense as good as
theirs is without a good line. It doesn't get a lot of credit
because they have so many big-name skilled players, but when you
sit down in a dark room and start cranking up the videotape, it's
very clear where it all starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy, three ``verys'' and two ``loads.'' High praise for a man
who is as surprised to be where he is today as anyone. Dixon was
New England's ninth-round pick in the 1991 draft and was promptly
released in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota picked me up and put me on the other side of the
ball,'' said Dixon, now a svelte 352 pounds. ``Being new to the
game, it took me three years just to get everything down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get the playbook down and learn the system. I had to
learn how to use my feet properly, as well as all the techniques.
It's a totally different mind-set from playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he's learned. Dixon made his first start against the
Cardinals last season in a 20-19 win at Sun Devil Stadium against
Eric Swann and since has started 28 consecutive games. Only ex-Sun
Devil McDaniel has a longer streak at 154 games. The Vikings are
31-10 (.756) in games that Dixon has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offense is harder to play than defense,'' Dixon said. ``You
have to maintain a sense of timing and direction to know where to
be at a certain time. On defense you react, and your assignment
moves and can change in a split second. You have to be much more
disciplined on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've become a starter, Randall has spent more time
helping me, showing me how and where to attack players. Of course
I'm surprised to be where I am now. I'm fortunate Minnesota had
patience and let me develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Marmie said he and his ASU staff gave brief thought to moving
Dixon to offense at ASU, but didn't because of his lack of football
background and brief period of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier for him to learn defense than it was to learn
all the blocking schemes and such,'' Marmie said. ``But David
always ran well for a big man. He was big and powerful and we
played a gap-control, so it was easier for him to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cardinals fans are banking on the Vikings to overlook the
upstart Cardinals, Dixon said they will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the mind-set that we're going to have two hard games
to get where we want (Super Bowl),'' he said. ``Rashod Swinger is a
good, solid player. Their entire front four is solid all around.
They beat a good team to get to us, so why would we take them
lightly?'' &QL;

`WE MATCH UP FINE'  
 MCGINNIS SAYS CARDS UP TO TASK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Whether the Minnesota Vikings have the best
offense of all time is debatable. What is certain is that no team
ever scored more points in a season than the Vikings just did.
</P>
<P>
   Their lowest scoring games were 24 points, twice, en route to an
NFL-record 556.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't stop them,'' said Dave McGinnis, the Cardinals
defensive coordinator, who is rumored to be the leading candidate
for the Chicago Bears' head coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   But McGinnis is being asked to slow them enough to give the
Cardinals' offense a chance to score more when they meet in the
second round of the NFL playoffs at the Metrodome today .
</P>
<P>
   One statistic lost in the hoopla over the high-scoring Vikings
is that the Cardinals' defense, the youngest overall in the NFL,
has surrendered only one touchdown in each of its past three games
and only five in its past four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone out and made our mark,'' said outside linebacker
Jamir Miller. ``We've shown that we can play with anybody. We've
gotten stronger and stronger at the most important time. That shows
the character of this team. We're composed of winners, not
quitters. Minnesota has a great offense, but we've got a great
defense, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller made 12 tackles and had two sacks last week in a 20-7
drubbing of the Dallas Cowboys. Five-time Pro Bowl cornerback
Aeneas Williams intercepted two passes. Rookie corner Corey Chavous
knocked down five passes. Ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth and
tackle Mark Smith controlled the run and pressured Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are younger and more athletic than the Cowboys, but
even McGinnis said, ``We match up fine.'' He came up with a scheme
that all but smothered the Cowboys in the playoff opener, losing a
shutout with 3:33 remaining only after a long punt return left the
Cowboys a short field to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week is gone,'' McGinnis said. ``We've got to get a game
plan together for this week, and we've done that. I was in the NFC
Central for 10 years. I've been in the Metrodome a lot. It is a
loud place. The way you take the crowd out of the game is to play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring a way to take Randall Cunningham, the NFL's top-rated
passer at 106.0 points, out of the game is a more complex issue.
Even at age 35, Cunningham is mobile. Pro Bowl receivers Cris
Carter and Randy Moss enabled Cunningham to fire 34 touchdown
passes, second only to 36 by Steve Young of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we have a real challenge out there this week with
the receivers and the offense that we're playing,'' said Larry
Marmie, the Cardinals defensive backs coach. ``I don't know whether
it's an acid test. Aeneas Williams has played against a lot of
great receivers over the years. Certainly Randy Moss is a very
talented guy, but Aeneas takes anybody he goes against as a
challenge. It doesn't matter who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   As Coach Vince Tobin points out, the Vikings also have made big
plays rushing, too, with Robert Smith gaining for 1,187 yards,
fifth in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you stop a team such as that,'' Tobin said.
``You can control it, keep it from getting big plays. They've got
an awful lot of them by running, throwing it both short and deep,
throwing screens that have gone long. They've got a lot of
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But so do the Cardinals defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude the whole year has been `We've got to have it,'
'' said safety Tommy Bennett. ``You've got to play the same every
game, every down. That's the reason we are where we are. That's
part of our maturity. Two years ago we had the talent, but we
didn't have the maturity. Same last year, when we couldn't finish
all those close games. This year we finally came together, and
we're still a young team. That youthful energy has been a plus for
us this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a really good game plan for these guys. We can compete
with them.'' &QL;

DEFENDING THE STAGE  
 ASU TURNS NAIL BITER INTO ROUT AT WELLS FARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State found itself in a close, hard-fought basketball
game with Washington State at Wells Fargo Arena on Saturday, until
all sorts of things began to happen _ none of them good for the
visiting Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   A four-point ASU lead with 9:58 remaining ballooned to 16 over
the next six minutes. Then it really got crazy for Washington State
as the Sun Devils ended up winning, 91-63, to even their Pac-10
record at 2-2 heading into Thursday's home game against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:17 to go, Cougars guard Kab Kazadi was called for an
intentional foul against Bobby Lazor and was ejected. Washington
State Coach Kevin Eastman walked onto the court for an explanation
and got hit with technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a timeout, Eastman said something else to the
officials, and was sent to the the principal _ literally. Official
Steve Wilson, the principal at Sahuaro High School in Tucson,
whistled Eastman for his second technical, which resulted in
Eastman's automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Eastman has been tossed as Cougars coach.
This is his fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   That much we know. As for anything else . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk about the game, because I guess the Pac-10 has a
rule about talking about the other stuff,'' Eastman said. ``And
believe me, I'd love to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU (10-6) made 5 of the 6 free throws that resulted, and a
three-point basket by Alton Mason gave the Sun Devils essentially
an eight-point possession. That helped explain the lopsided result.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the only reason. The Sun Devils overcame a
sluggish start _ ASU Coach Rob Evans had to call a 20-second
timeout four minutes into the game after the Cougars took an 8-2
lead _ and buckled down on defense. Washington State shot 34.5
percent for the game, the lowest by an ASU opponent in nearly three
years, making just 7 of 27 shots in the second half, and had 20
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cougars (7-7, 1-2) were without guard Jan-Michael
Thomas, who had eight three-point baskets and scored 34 points
Thursday against Arizona. Thomas became sick with a stomach virus
late Friday night and spent several hours at St. Luke's Hospital in
Tempe early Saturday morning. He was in no condition to play, and
watched the game from behind the bench, wearing warm-ups and a
hooded sweat shirt.
</P>
<P>
   That threw a hood over Washington State's outside game. Thomas
is one of the best long-range shooters in the league. He had three
three-pointers in a 19-second span against the Wildcats. Without
him, the Cougars were 1 of 13 from three-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also is a solid ballhandler, which would have helped
against ASU's pressure. Guard Blake Pengelly said his team missed
Thomas ``a lot, especially the way the game turned out. The guys on
the court were capable of shooting the ball, but tonight we weren't
hitting the open shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman, who has one year remaining on his contract but is under
fire from fans and boosters, also lost forward Eddie Miller for a
key stretch in the second half. Miller, who finished with 12
points, apparently strained a groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ASU took advantage of all of the Cougars' problems, basically
with two big runs sparked by its defense. In the first half,
Washington State led, 22-15, but ASU scored 19 of the next 23
points to go up by eight. Then, in the second half, it was a 16-4
run.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said his team might have been cocky coming in, but that
didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our size kind of wore them down in the end, and I
think our pressure defense wore on them a little bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lazy in the beginning of the game,'' said forward Mike
Batiste, who had 17 points and 14 rebounds. ``We weren't executing
or being patient.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this year, ASU had five players score in
double figures. Lazor, whose torn jersey reflected how hard the
teams played, had 21 points. Guard Eddie House had 20, 18 in the
second half after shooting 1 for 7 in the first. Mason had 13
points, and freshman Kenny Crandall scored a season best 12. &QL;

JEFFERSON'S BASKET AT BUZZER SAVES WILDCATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - If there someday is a Richard Jefferson highlight reel,
like the one run for Steve Kerr's jersey retirement ceremony on
Saturday, it can start with the basket that beat Washington at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   There will be prettier ones for sure, but Jefferson again looked
like that third money guy the Wildcats need to support seniors
Jason Terry and A.J. Bramlett.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 86, eighth-ranked Arizona (11-1, 3-1
Pac-10) went to the senior duo in the waning seconds with a high
give-and-go screen that backfired. Terry wound up taking a
desperate, off-balance three-point shot that fell a foot short.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson elevated for the ball, turned 180 degrees in the air
and released the winner with one-tenth of a second to go for an
88-86 victory that ran the McKale Center win streak to 24.
</P>
<P>
   This was heroics of a different variety for Jefferson. At Moon
Valley High School last year, he led his teammates in blowing teams
out or was the shooter by design in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting, but anybody could've been there and taken
that shot,'' said Jefferson, who has been hounded to hit the
offensive glass because of his immense potential. ``I have taken a
few last-second shots, but nothing like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's pattern was familiar, though. The Wildcats have played
poorly in the first half of every Pac-10 game. This time, the
stumble was nearly too much as Washington (7-6, 0-3) took a 31-17
lead even though its go-to guy, 7-foot Todd MacCulloch, scored only
two points on a put back.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats flipped the energy switch and scrambled back to
trail, 47-45, at halftime, the third halftime deficit it has had in
four conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got young guys who don't know how to mentally
prepare to play,'' Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. ``Freshmen don't
understand how intense games are going to be. We have to shore up
what we're doing defensively. When we make it intense, we make it
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramlett never lacked defensive focus, asserting himself again
as a premier player guarding the post. MacCulloch, averaging 18
points a game, took five shots and two were follows. The last was a
bricked post shot with the game tied in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Terry took care of the offensive end, dishing nine assists and
scoring a career-high 30 points with a McKale record 12 of 12 free
throw shooting. He got Arizona back into the game by hitting three
three-pointers to score 11 in the first half's final three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was Washington week for the Seattle native who
scored 27 Thursday against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the game of my life every time I play against
them,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-minute dry spell still had Arizona trailing, 80-74, with
3:50 to play, but freshman Ruben Douglas hit a three-pointer and
Arizona hit nine of 10 free throws before Jefferson's game winner.
The Wildcats made 32 of 38 from the line on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable under the kind of pressure we were
facing,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies got a team-high 19 points from freshman point guard
Senque Carey in his second start, but it was no moral victory for
Washington. Ranked 14th in the preseason, the Huskies are 0-3 in
the Pac-10, were swept in Arizona for the ninth time in 11 years
and still have not beaten a top-10 team in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just tired of everything,'' said MacCulloch,
who played only 23 minutes because he was benched with two fouls in
the first half and three in the second. ``We're mostly tired of
being embarrassed. This weekend hurts a lot.''

KERR PROVIDES LAUGHS AT JERSEY RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona's own ``Opie,'' fan favorite and star mid-1980s
guard Steve Kerr became the second Wildcats basketball player to
have his number (25) retired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So let's just get to the Kerr punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would've told me my jersey would be hanging up here
when I first came, I would've been a little afraid,'' Kerr said in
a post-game ceremony at a packed McKale Center. ``I would've
thought the only way my jersey would be hanging from the rafters
was if I was still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Kerr, a guy remembered as much for rejuvenating the
program to a 1988 Final Four trip as he is for cracking that the
team was concerned about Coach Lute Olson's heroin problem at a
Final Four press teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   Olson gave the unrecruited kid his last scholarship in 1983.
Kerr said even Olson's wife, Bobbi, was the first to say he
couldn't play.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerr became a second-team All-America as a senior, when he
led the team to the Final Four averaging less than one turnover per
game in his first year at point guard. He was given the Most
Courageous Player national award for enduring reconstructive knee
surgery and the assassination of his father, Malcolm, an American
University president shot in the streets of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona waived a requirement that players had to be national
players of the year, like ceremony attendee Sean Elliott, to have
their number retired.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion even brought public address announcer Roger
Sedlmayr out of a two-year retirement for one last ``Steeeeeeeeeeve
Kerr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has heart,'' Olson said of Kerr. ``It shows in
everything he did. He's one of the guys that epitomizes what
teamwork is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson tried jokes, but Kerr turned on the charm as always.
</P>
<P>
   On a highlight reel shown to the fans: ``After watching that, I
would've preferred my shorts be retired.''
</P>
<P>
   On his freshman year: ``I wasn't a very good basketball player.
. . . Please everybody don't disagree at once.''
</P>
<P>
   On Olson: ``I can call him Lute now. Me and Sean Elliott are the
only ones who can.''
</P>
<P>
   On a basketball career that now includes three NBA rings: ``I
feel like Forrest Gump.'' &QL;

FISET HELPS KINGS EARN 1-1 TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It was a night to commemorate Luc Robitaille's 500th
goal, but also a night for a different hero. This time, Stephane
Fiset was the key to the Kings' success, or at least to their
absence of failure.
</P>
<P>
   In goal for the first time in nearly a month after recovering
from his latest groin strain, Fiset made 32 saves, allowing the
Kings to steal a 1-1 tie with the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday night
before a Forum crowd of 14,936.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good,'' Fiset said. ``I was surprised. I felt
like I didn't miss any games. The only thing I was nervous about
was my groin. It was on my mind the entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said: ``I thought he was steady. I
thought he really absorbed the puck well. He's worked hard and is
always prepared, so I didn't worry too much about him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second overtime game of the week between the Oilers
and Kings, who had recorded a 4-3 victory four nights earlier in
Edmonton on a goal by Craig Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake scored for the Kings and Ryan Smyth scored for the
Oilers, who themselves got strong goaltending from Bob Essensa (29
saves). The strangest moment of the night came in the third period
when 5-foot-8 Kings winger Donald Audette fought 6-foot-2 Oilers
wing Bill Guerin to a draw. Both received fighting majors, and
Audette departed with an automatic game misconduct for not having
his jersey tied down.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (15-21-4) are 7-1-1 in their last nine games, extended
their unbeaten streak to six and were happy to escape with the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost enough games we didn't deserve to lose,'' Robinson
said, ``so we'll take a point when we didn't deserve any better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took an early lead on Blake's third goal this season,
20 fewer than he scored a year ago when he led NHL defensemen in
goal scoring and won the Norris Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Blake _ who missed 15 games earlier in the season with a broken
foot and another three when suspended for a slashing incident _
scored on an early power play, beating Essensa with a 35-foot
one-timer from the slot off a pass from Audette.
</P>
<P>
   But though the Kings held the lead, the Oilers (16-18-5)
controlled the flow of play. And 6:22 into the second period, the
Oilers got the opportunity they needed to even the score when Kings
center Jozef Stumpel received a double-minor penalty for
high-sticking Mike Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one minute later, the Kings left Smyth alone in front
of their net, and Guerin passed him the puck. Fiset sprawled to
make the initial save, but Smyth slipped the rebound past him.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings escaped the second period without allowing another
goal, even surviving a shift in which the line of Ian Laperriere,
Matt Johnson and Eric Lacroix tried and failed several times to
clear the puck out of their zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Robinson said. ``The guys out on that
shift are guys who want more ice time. We keep talking about
working on little things and those were little things. You have to
be able to work on all situations. You've got to be dependable, and
able to get the puck out of the zone. Otherwise, you don't get to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final moments of the second period, with the Kings
shorthanded, they got a scoring chance of their own, but a 20-foot
shot from the slot by Vladimir Tsyplakov deflected harmlessly off
the crossbar. The Oilers then created a similar chance, but Fiset
smothered Boris Mironov's 35-footer and didn't allow a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's like the puck sticks on you and doesn't come
out,'' Fiset said. ``Some other nights, the puck is all over the
place. I've been working on that in practice. When you work on
things in practice, good things happen in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset made the best stop of the extra period, a glove save on
Todd Marchant with 1:16 to go.

TYSON'S TOUGHEST FOE: HIS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has passed out turkeys, kissed babies, signed autographs,
cracked jokes with Charles Barkley, played Santa Claus, talked
tough to juvenile inmates and marched from tent to cell alongside
Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the parade always has included the media, an
electronic chain gang linked by cameras and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight spin? Or the new Mike Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess. Tyson, himself, has always been tough to
figure. Humble one second, hostile the next. As a fighter by trade,
he has learned to rely on the feint as a fundamental, instinctive
skill. In the ring, the fake can set up a punch. Out of the ring,
the artful dodge is virtual reality. These days, perception is the
punch.
</P>
<P>
   Since the former heavyweight champion arrived in the Phoenix
area three months ago, there have been carefully orchestrated
``photo ops'' and repeated comments that suggest he is here to
resurrect himself in the mythical manner of the bird after which
the city is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is where I'm starting over because this is where I
feel relaxed and under control,'' Tyson said Friday as he broke
camp at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden gym and left for Las Vegas,
where he will fight Frans Botha on Saturday in his first bout since
June 1997. ``Anymore, when I go back to New York, I feel like I'm
on another planet, or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest heavyweight champion in this planet's history has
often behaved as though he were living in some other universe.
</P>
<P>
   By now, everybody knows the rap sheet. There was the infamous
incident in which he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during his last
fight 19 months ago. There was his obscene tirade in an abortive
attempt to get a boxing license in New Jersey. There was a prison
sentence for sexual assault. There's more. With Tyson, there always
is.
</P>
<P>
   Pound for pound, he might be the P.R. business' toughest
challenge. He even summed up the monumental task last week in a
flash of anger at the end of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy with my credibility is shot,'' said Tyson, who won the
heavyweight title 12 years ago as a 20-year old. ``If the sleaziest
girl in the world says Mike Tyson grabbed her, society will believe
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Mitch Green, a known crackhead who uses heroin and
angel dust, is believed by a court of law. . . . He's still walking
the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a former Tyson sparring partner who was awarded $45,000
after suing Tyson for injuries suffered during a 1988 street fight,
has had several brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's angry remark was enough to send Tyson's new adviser,
Shelly Finkel, out into the Phoenix streets in search of more free
turkeys. Of course, Finkel has heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, Mike is too honest,'' Finkel said during a rambling
Tyson interview last month. ``He doesn't know how to censor
himself.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; `Crisis P.R.' &QL;  &QL; 
Nevertheless, there's the suggestion that Tyson is learning how to
control the temper that always seems coiled and ready to strike.
That suggestion, at least, has been planted by a media campaign
since his move to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turkeys, the toys . . . they are going down every avenue
they can,'' said Chris Ryan, whose Tempe firm, Ryan &AMP; Associates,
specializes in what he calls ``crisis P.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's clients have included people whose legal problems have
been the subject of media coverage. He tries to alter a perspective
cast in a negative light by the media. He recognizes the tactics
employed in the Tyson campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategy you normally take when you have somebody
with a damaged reputation,'' said Ryan, who has appeared on
national talk shows on several television networks. ``You
strategically plant ways to win people over. What are the ways we
can tug at the heartstrings? That sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign can work, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time,'' Ryan said. ``Time is the key. You're dealing with
the new reputation. Over time, the old reputation hopefully gets
lost in the memory banks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson can make that old reputation hard to forget.
After last week's outburst, respected boxing writer Michael Katz of
the ``New York Daily'' ``News'' wrote that good public relations do
not ``change the bully's stripes.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; Foreman was angry, too &QL;  &QL; 
But fighters have been known to change. And, in the Tyson case,
there is an intriguing, if not striking, precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, George Foreman was not today's gentle,
wisecracking pitchman with a muffler for every car and a
cheeseburger for every meal. During the past 10 years, he's been
the genial warrior who made aging boomers feel good as he
reluctantly knocked out fighters half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Foreman was his generation's version of
Tyson. He was an angry, surly young man whose humiliation was
brought on by Muhammad Ali in the famous ``Rope-A-Dope,'' Ali's
victory at Zaire in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Foreman's hero was Sonny Liston, the star-crossed
and troubled heavyweight who was said to have had mob connections
before a mysterious death because of an alleged heroin overdose.
Tyson often speaks of his admiration for Liston. A question about
Liston precipitated his outburst last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Foreman grew out of his lousy reputation and on to
happy middle age. Foreman's transformation from lousy to lovable is
remarkable enough for even Tyson to take notice. At least, longtime
promoter, ring announcer and public relations man Bill Caplan sees
Tyson borrowing from the Foreman experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson appears to be have discovered a sense of humor. He's
cracking jokes at his own expense in a style that has the tone of
Foreman's self-deprecating remarks about his cheeseburger-built
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really taking a page out of George Foreman's book,'' said
Caplan, who began working as an adviser to Foreman the year before
he won a 1968 Olympic gold medal and danced around the Mexico City
ring with a tiny American flag stuck into a hand the size of a bear
claw. ``When George made his comeback in 1987, everybody starting
saying he was too fat. So George started making fat jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan noticed the Foreman parallel in Los Angeles last month at
a news conference during which the Tyson-Botha bout was announced.
Tyson cracked jokes about parole officers. He's still on parole
through March and could return to jail after he is sentenced Feb. 5
on a misdemeanor assault charge. That charge was filed following an
altercation after an auto accident in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been quick to mock himself for biting Holyfield's
ears. There's a widely published photo of him biting onto the
T-shirt of a crying child during an autograph session at the
downtown Phoenix gym. The shot was spontaneous, but, on second
glance, Tyson seemed to pose as though he had planned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Tyson in Los Angeles, I was thinking at the time:
`He's finally wising up,' '' said Caplan, who has worked as a
publicist for Top Rank promoter Bob Arum and Tyson's former
promoter, Don King. ``He was doing a little bit of what has made
George so successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's never going to be George Foreman. But he's on the
right trail. It seems to be working.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; Where's the money? &QL;  &QL; 
The re-working of Tyson's tattered image actually began last
spring, when he jettisoned King along with advisers John Horne and
Rory Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caplan signed on for a few months. It was Caplan's job to
tell the media how much was allegedly taken from Tyson, who has
earned $140 million since 1995 and yet has a tax debt of $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is suing King for $100 million. King has filed a
countersuit. Nevertheless, the numbers paint a stark picture and
plant an inevitable question: What happened to Tyson's money?
</P>
<P>
   In part, Tyson looks as though he was an unwitting victim
surrounded by a bad crowd. By mere reflection, that almost makes
him a sympathetic figure. The crowd has changed, and those changes
were one of the consistent themes throughout Tyson's Phoenix
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But has ``he''?
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, there will be an answer Saturday at the MGM
Grand against Botha, a credible opponent. Botha is known for his
willingness to fight. If Botha can last beyond the initial moments
of a scheduled 10-rounder and land some telling blows in the
process, will Tyson revert to the wild man who went berserk against
Holyfield? If he does, all the well-intentioned P.R. will be
undone.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term, there's Tyson out of the ring. He has to stay
out of trouble, and there are plenty of people who are betting he
can't do it. He even hinted at it last week when a reporter,
identifying himself as a former prison inmate, asked whether it was
possible to steer clear of trouble for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's stayed out of trouble of any kind for 20
years,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, slightly cynical, side to this P.R. business.
In boxing, too much good can be very harmful. Tyson isn't the
game's biggest draw because he's Mother Teresa. He's big box-office
because he possesses a dark, destructive side. At his licensing
hearing in Las Vegas, he responded to questions about his
psychiatric report by saying he felt like Norman Bates, the slasher
in ``Psycho.'' The film wasn't popular because it was ``The Sound
Of'' ``Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to turn the lion into a kitten,'' said
Valley public relations man David Hans Schmidt, who has represented
Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be much chance of that. Again, just listen
to Tyson, himself, when asked last week about the fascination that
people continue to have for him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they hate me more than anyone else. Maybe they want to
see my demise.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson's demise would mark the end of boxing's biggest
moneymaker. He'll receive at least $20 million, not counting a
percentage of pay-per-view receipts, for the Botha bout, according
to sources within in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   P.R. people can count, too. There's plenty of incentive to keep
Tyson near the edge of a demise that few people ever see for
themselves. The dangerous balance between fame and infamy accounts
for the fascination. Even Tyson admits he had lost his balance. The
task now is to at least portray him as man attempting a comeback,
which is always the good fight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his Phoenix training camp, there was a vigilant
effort to eliminate any potential that he might be nudged too close
to the edge of another fall. The parking lot near the rundown gym
on West Van Buren Street was surrounded by a chain-link fence that
was covered with tarps. Bodyguards checked the identity of those
allowed in and out of the gym.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Tyson was scheduled to play Santa, an expectant crowd
had gathered to watch his every move. There was one strange guy
with a movie camera. He wore a jacket that was spray-painted with
several obscene words directed at the police.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel couldn't miss him. Concerned, Finkel spoke to Tyson's
chief of security, James Anderson, a former New Jersey cop whose
son is Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson. The man in the
jacket soon vanished.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson ever saw him, he didn't acknowledge it. Tyson just went
about his business. A line of kids, a tableful of toys and the
cameras were waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   So was an old foe.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation might be his toughest opponent of all. &QL;  &QL;

SUNS BENEFIT FROM EARLY TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fax machine starting humming at 2:55 p.m. Friday in the
Suns' offices, and by 3:01 p.m. General Manager Bryan Colangelo was
on the phone, where he'll spend much of his time for at least the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that surprised even its own team executives, the NBA
released clubs to begin contacting the agents for free-agent
players, negotiate contracts and talk about deals with other NBA
teams.
</P>
<P>
   There are some restrictions, including a ban on actually
contacting the players, but it cleared the way for teams to begin
putting their clubs together for the Jan. 18 start of training
camps.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge break for the Suns, who have five players under
contract, hope to sign a major free agent and face a battle to keep
their key free agent, Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to do a lot of advance preparations, what
I would call a grace period, before the flood gates open,'' said
Colangelo, who would not comment on who he has contacted. ``It
allows us to get a feel for what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's especially beneficial to teams that are under the cap
(as the Suns are) and have a number of decisions to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the league &QL; 
 &QL; 
McDyess is one of the hottest properties on the free-agent market,
and rumors are running rampant about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have expressed their desire to keep the 6-foot-9 power
forward, and they have the advantage of his Larry Bird exception to
give him a contract that begins at $9 million. The Suns can give
him a deal as long as seven years, while other clubs can give him
only six. And the Suns can give him larger raises than other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely an advantage,'' said his agent, &UR; Tony Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   Houston reportedly has been the primary suitor for McDyess, and
the Rockets are much like the Suns in that they have some space
below the salary cap. The Rockets can clear about $10.5 million,
but to do it they would have to renounce the rights to Charles
Barkley or re-sign him to a minimum contract. &QL; 
 &QL; 
New direction? &QL; 
 &QL; 
There are indications around the league that the Rockets may go
hard for Chicago forward &UR; Scottie Pippen and hope that Pippen wants
out of the Bulls organization badly enough to take less from the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those in the Rockets organization that would
prefer the club pursue Wizards free-agent point guard Rod
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, who is close to Rockets forward &UR; Roy Rogers, who played
collegiately with him at Alabama, has indicated that Phoenix,
Houston, Denver and Chicago are the teams he will consider.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Chicago. If Michael Jordan returns, the Bulls won't have
money. If he doesn't, why go?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the lowly Nuggets may wind up being the biggest
threat to the Suns' ability to keep McDyess, not Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, McDyess played in Denver and liked living there.
His problems were with former coach/GM &UR; Allan Bristow, who has been
fired. He apparently has a good relationship with Dan Issel, who
left his job as a radio analyst to take the job of GM and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Second, McDyess fired his first agent, &UR; Arn Tellem, during the
off-season and hired Houston-based Dutt. That move fueled
speculation about Houston, but perhaps it should have added to the
Denver fire instead.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dutt's clients is guard Nick Van Exel of the Nuggets.
McDyess and Van Exel apparently have struck up a friendship this
off-season, and Van Exel joked to reporters in Houston that ``He's
going to Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a joke, although Van Exel is in the final year of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets also have plenty of money under the cap, and
LaPhonso Ellis is another friend of McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get $9 million (the first year) wherever he
goes,'' Dutt said. ``The big things is that he's happy. He really
likes Phoenix. It's a tough process, no question.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

COYOTES BREAK TIES WITH VEGAS IN IHL 
</HEADLINE>
 VEGAS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coyotes, winless in their past four games, have some serious
headaches in the minor leagues, too.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the team terminated its partial affiliation
agreement with the Las Vegas Thunder of the International Hockey
League with half the season still left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, the Coyotes have been seething over the treatment and
public criticism that a few of their players and prospects have
been receiving from the Thunder coaching staff and management.
</P>
<P>
   Two players under contract with Phoenix, forwards Andrei
Vasilyev and J.F. Jomphe, recently were assigned elsewhere after
being vilified by Vegas Coach Bob Bourne and General Manager Bob
Strumm for supposed poor attitudes and lackluster work ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past few weeks, we've worked to determine a route that
would work for both teams, and what we decided was that it was in
the best interest to terminate the affiliation for the year,'' said
Taylor Burke, the Coyotes assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a termination agreement Saturday morning, Burke
said two of the three remaining players in Las Vegas under contract
with the Coyotes were moved to other franchises in the IHL. Scott
Langkow, the No. 3 goalie in the organization, was loaned to the
Utah Grizzlies. Veteran Louie DeBrusk, a physical left wing, was
sent to the Long Beach Ice Dogs, where fellow Coyote Jocelyn
Lemieux resides.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Michel Petit will also be moved elsewhere
once he recovers from a concussion and is cleared to play.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Bourne and Strumm were unsuccessful Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the unflattering comments were not the sole reason
the Coyotes decided to end their relationship with the IHL team
after 2{ seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not happy with the comments made (last week) by the
coach about J.F.,'' Burke said. ``But at the same time, it's not
like we're yanking all our players out of there because they came
out and said something about one of our players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the overall picture here. We felt in order to
have an affiliation there, we needed our players part of a winning
environment and part of a healthy environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is in last place in the IHL with a 9-23-5 record, 30
points behind first-place Chicago in the Western Conference. &QL;

ROBITAILLE REACHES MAGICAL 500 MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congratulations to Luc Robitaille, who snared his 500th NHL goal
last week against Buffalo, thus becoming the 27th player to reach
the milestone, and just the sixth left winger to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a gangly kid whom everybody said probably wouldn't
make it in this league as the 171st overall pick in the 1984 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever didn't believe in me, well, screw them today,''
Robitaille said.
</P>
<P>
   The only left wingers with more goals than Lucky Luc: Bobby Hull
(610), John Bucyk (556), Michel Goulet (548), Frank Mahovlich (533)
and Dave Andreychuk (528).
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, 32, already has 22 goals this season _ six more than
he finished with last year. He credits his turnaround to a
rededication to a fitness program this summer, in which he hauled
weight machines around with him and his family during a month-long
tour across the U.S. in a motor home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little embarrassing at some of the campgrounds,''
Robitaille said. ``People were coming in with their tents and they
were looking at me with this big motor home and my big squat rack
outside. A few people would come up to me. They thought it was some
kind of jack to lift the motor home. They didn't know what the heck
it was. It was kind of funny, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   His 500th goal wasn't funny. Not to rookie Pavel Rosa, who
assisted on the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my hero growing up,'' said Rosa, a native of the Czech
Republic. ``Sure, I was watching Wayne Gretzky and Jaromir Jagr,
but I had Luc's picture on the wall.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Conspiracy theory &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it in Chicago? So bad that now Blackhawks first-year
Coach Dirk Graham is pulling a Bobby Knight and charging that NHL
referees have it in for his team _ as if they were on the take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be the same thing every game, either we're the
dirtiest team which ever has played the game or there's something
else going on,'' Graham said, among other things. ``I don't think
we're that dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they are among the most-penalized teams in the league at
an average of about 24 minutes a game. Graham, though, barked
enough after recent losses that Bryan Lewis, the NHL's director of
officials, and Colin Campbell, the league's executive vice
president in charge of hockey operations, have personally checked
into the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious accusations,'' Campbell said. ``It's serious
to (the Blackhawks) and it's serious to the referees when they get
questioned. . . . I'm going to stand behind my officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a former ref, seriously doubts Graham's speculation that
officials have something against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for anyone who has that impression,'' he said.
``I can only address it as someone who wore a striped shirt for
over 10 years and did over 1,000 games on the ice. In all that
time, I've never heard any language from an official along the
lines of `Let's get them' or `Let's get any particular player.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stupid remark &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a game last week against San Jose, New Jersey's Scott
Stevens allegedly told the Sharks' Brent Myhres, who recently
underwent treatment for alcohol abuse, to ``have another beer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit (Jeff) Friesen and I said, `Why don't you pick on
somebody bigger?' '' Myhres said. ``He came back with a comment on
alcohol. That's pretty classy when you've got your buddy two seats
down (Ken Daneyko) who has the same problem. But that's the
mentality of Scott Stevens. An idiot. What comes around goes
around. I think we play them one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens didn't deny making the remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the heat of the battle, sometimes you say things you don't
want to,'' he said. ``Sometimes, you say things you regret.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Eight is enough &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Fred Brathwaite started in goal Friday night for the
Calgary Flames, he became the eighth different goalie to put on a
Flames jersey this season and the seventh one to actually dress for
a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I've talked to in the past three or four days tells
me the same thing. Nobody's ever seen a situation like this,''
General Manager Al Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames, in order, have lost Ken Wregget (back injury), Tyler
Moss (groin), Jean-Sebastien Giguere (hamstring), and Andrei
Trefilov (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing,'' Coach Brian Sutter said. ``I've
stopped losing sleep over this.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a bright spot, though. Brathwaite pitched a 1-0
shutout over the league-leading Dallas Stars a day after being
signed off the Canadian national team.
</P>
<P>
   Any day now &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect the Vancouver Canucks to finally jettison themselves from
the Russian Rocket. Crybaby holdout Pavel Bure, sitting out despite
the guarantee of earning $8.5 million this season, will be dealt in
a major trade this week.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so says Canucks General Manager Brian Burke, who's lied
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at any pull-the-trigger stage, but it's definitely
coming to a boil,'' Burke was quoted as saying Thursday. ``I don't
think it's unrealistic to think this might happen over the weekend
or early next week. There are concrete offers on the table for
players and draft picks.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers, Los Angeles Kings and Florida Panthers
have all made offers to Burke for the former 76-goal scorer.
Chicago supposedly entered the talks late.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizard of Ozo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, what do you know? The Colorado Avalanche wised up and
decided to end the nonsense involving unsigned defenseman Sandis
Ozolinsh. He agreed to a two-year deal worth $6.7 million _ $2.9
million this year and $3.8 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's pro-rated, Ozolinsh will earn $1.6 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with that,'' Ozolinsh said. ``I didn't count
how much money I lost. I just thought this was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozolinsh, who had been in Latvia since the summer, was looking
forward to making his debut this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in pretty good shape,'' he said. ``I played a lot of golf.
Hey, that's a sport. They show it on TV.''

PIED PIPER OF PUNCH LINES  
 OLBERMANN LEADS SPORTSCASTING'S COMIC REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been almost 20 years since Keith Olbermann hit his head
on the subway _ insert your own punch line here _ and television
sports reporting hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a gag-filled ride from ESPN to MSNBC and now to Fox
Sports Net, where his presence could be the final piece of the
puzzle for the network in its bid to surpass ESPN in ratings and
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann, who started his Fox career with a three-day workweek,
which included a three-part series on the NBA lockout, begins his
regular Sunday-Thursday shift tonight. He will be seen from 11 p.m.
to midnight in the Phoenix market on Fox Sports Arizona, teamed
with Kevin Frazier. They follow Van Earl Wright and Chris Meyers,
another ESPN alum, giving Fox Sports Net a strong one-two punch.
</P>
<P>
   He came up with one of the best one-liners ever while at ESPN.
Talking about an injured player's status, he said, ``He's listed as
day to day _ but then, aren't we all?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably my most meaningful line,'' he said.
``It's both funny and meaningful. It's like when George Karl said
he never wanted to be on a non-stop plane.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he got tired of muttering another one of his signature
lines to himself: ``From way downtown . . . bang!''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann played a big part in turning sportscasters nationwide
into would-be comics. A major difference is that Olbermann's humor
is not forced or corny. While at ESPN, he was one of America's
premier sports TV figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the style I have carries over well here, and I expect
it will,'' Olbermann said. ``Humor has become a staple with
everybody in the business now. What I will try to force are those
opportunities to be a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two elements here. With Dan Patrick (his partner on
ESPN's ``SportsCente''r), the humor sticks in your mind, and it was
replicated throughout ESPN, Fox and CNN/SI. But it can only be used
when it's there. You can reach about arm's length for a joke, and
if you go any further, you'll fall flat on your face. And I'm going
to try to do news analyses, story breaking and story chasing.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his three-part series, ```Who Shot the NBA?'' last
week, Olbermann proved adept in moving into other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   When Olbermann left ESPN in the summer of 1997, it was on good
terms. But when he MSNBC wanted to name his show ``The Big Show,''
which he and Patrick used, it caused some ripples.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN got very upset about it,'' Olbermann said. ``I thought it
was so small. They had actually tried to discourage Dan and I from
calling it that. All of a sudden, that hit me in a way I can't
rationally explain, and I made some negative comments, and that
didn't need to happen. But I did a radio commentary, and I
apologized for all the sour stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann found that the longer he stayed away from sports, the
more he missed it. It was Fox's aggressive style that lured
Olbermann back into sports. He said he sees a shift of power in the
industry, noting that when Fox says it wants to be competitive, it
means it wants to dominate an area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident they want to take this ballgame away from ESPN,''
he said. ``When I left ESPN, it was not an open question (on
dominant sports network) . . . It ain't that way anymore. My
responsibility is to make sure it stays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann said the time came while he was at ESPN when he
realized the sports news shows on both networks were ``dead even.''
He said he realized that Fox's format of tying the sports reports
to a local event ``would eventually have to win.'' As an example,
he said when ``SportsCenter'' followed a Sunday night football
game, ratings would be five to six times higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The executive vice president for programming and production for
Fox Sports Net, Arthur Smith, called Olbermann ``the sports
television personality of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lewellan, vice president/media relations for Fox Sports
Net, said Olbermann had been on the Fox wish list for a long time.
He said Olbermann also would get the opportunity to work with some
of the other Fox talent as the network seeks the right chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Back to that subway thing. When Olbermann banged his head, it
affected his depth perception. As a result, he can't drive because,
while he's in motion, it takes him five to six seconds to realize
where other cars are, or where the curb is; which, he said, makes
him worse than only about 60 percent of the drivers out there. &QL;

TYSON'S TOUGHEST FOE: HIS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has passed out turkeys, kissed babies, signed autographs,
cracked jokes with Charles Barkley, played Santa Claus, talked
tough to juvenile inmates and marched from tent to cell alongside
Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the parade always has included the media, an
electronic chain gang linked by cameras and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight spin? Or the new Mike Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess. Tyson, himself, has always been tough to
figure. Humble one second, hostile the next. As a fighter by trade,
he has learned to rely on the feint as a fundamental, instinctive
skill. In the ring, the fake can set up a punch. Out of the ring,
the artful dodge is virtual reality. These days, perception is the
punch.
</P>
<P>
   Since the former heavyweight champion arrived in the Phoenix
area three months ago, there have been carefully orchestrated
``photo ops'' and repeated comments that suggest he is here to
resurrect himself in the mythical manner of the bird after which
the city is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is where I'm starting over because this is where I
feel relaxed and under control,'' Tyson said Friday as he broke
camp at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden gym and left for Las Vegas,
where he will fight Frans Botha on Saturday in his first bout since
June 1997. ``Anymore, when I go back to New York, I feel like I'm
on another planet, or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest heavyweight champion in this planet's history has
often behaved as though he were living in some other universe.
</P>
<P>
   By now, everybody knows the rap sheet. There was the infamous
incident in which he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during his last
fight 19 months ago. There was his obscene tirade in an abortive
attempt to get a boxing license in New Jersey. There was a prison
sentence for sexual assault. There's more. With Tyson, there always
is.
</P>
<P>
   Pound for pound, he might be the P.R. business' toughest
challenge. He even summed up the monumental task last week in a
flash of anger at the end of an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy with my credibility is shot,'' said Tyson, who won the
heavyweight title 12 years ago as a 20-year old. ``If the sleaziest
girl in the world says Mike Tyson grabbed her, society will believe
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Mitch Green, a known crackhead who uses heroin and
angel dust, is believed by a court of law. . . . He's still walking
the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a former Tyson sparring partner who was awarded $45,000
after suing Tyson for injuries suffered during a 1988 street fight,
has had several brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's angry remark was enough to send Tyson's new adviser,
Shelly Finkel, out into the Phoenix streets in search of more free
turkeys. Of course, Finkel has heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, Mike is too honest,'' Finkel said during a rambling
Tyson interview last month. ``He doesn't know how to censor
himself.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; `Crisis P.R.' &QL;  &QL; 
Nevertheless, there's the suggestion that Tyson is learning how to
control the temper that always seems coiled and ready to strike.
That suggestion, at least, has been planted by a media campaign
since his move to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turkeys, the toys . . . they are going down every avenue
they can,'' said Chris Ryan, whose Tempe firm, Ryan &AMP; Associates,
specializes in what he calls ``crisis P.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's clients have included people whose legal problems have
been the subject of media coverage. He tries to alter a perspective
cast in a negative light by the media. He recognizes the tactics
employed in the Tyson campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategy you normally take when you have somebody
with a damaged reputation,'' said Ryan, who has appeared on
national talk shows on several television networks. ``You
strategically plant ways to win people over. What are the ways we
can tug at the heartstrings? That sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign can work, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time,'' Ryan said. ``Time is the key. You're dealing with
the new reputation. Over time, the old reputation hopefully gets
lost in the memory banks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson can make that old reputation hard to forget.
After last week's outburst, respected boxing writer Michael Katz of
the ``New York Daily'' ``News'' wrote that good public relations do
not ``change the bully's stripes.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; Foreman was angry, too &QL;  &QL; 
But fighters have been known to change. And, in the Tyson case,
there is an intriguing, if not striking, precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, George Foreman was not today's gentle,
wisecracking pitchman with a muffler for every car and a
cheeseburger for every meal. During the past 10 years, he's been
the genial warrior who made aging boomers feel good as he
reluctantly knocked out fighters half his age.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Foreman was his generation's version of
Tyson. He was an angry, surly young man whose humiliation was
brought on by Muhammad Ali in the famous ``Rope-A-Dope,'' Ali's
victory at Zaire in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Foreman's hero was Sonny Liston, the star-crossed
and troubled heavyweight who was said to have had mob connections
before a mysterious death because of an alleged heroin overdose.
Tyson often speaks of his admiration for Liston. A question about
Liston precipitated his outburst last week.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Foreman grew out of his lousy reputation and on to
happy middle age. Foreman's transformation from lousy to lovable is
remarkable enough for even Tyson to take notice. At least, longtime
promoter, ring announcer and public relations man Bill Caplan sees
Tyson borrowing from the Foreman experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson appears to be have discovered a sense of humor. He's
cracking jokes at his own expense in a style that has the tone of
Foreman's self-deprecating remarks about his cheeseburger-built
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really taking a page out of George Foreman's book,'' said
Caplan, who began working as an adviser to Foreman the year before
he won a 1968 Olympic gold medal and danced around the Mexico City
ring with a tiny American flag stuck into a hand the size of a bear
claw. ``When George made his comeback in 1987, everybody starting
saying he was too fat. So George started making fat jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan noticed the Foreman parallel in Los Angeles last month at
a news conference during which the Tyson-Botha bout was announced.
Tyson cracked jokes about parole officers. He's still on parole
through March and could return to jail after he is sentenced Feb. 5
on a misdemeanor assault charge. That charge was filed following an
altercation after an auto accident in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been quick to mock himself for biting Holyfield's
ears. There's a widely published photo of him biting onto the
T-shirt of a crying child during an autograph session at the
downtown Phoenix gym. The shot was spontaneous, but, on second
glance, Tyson seemed to pose as though he had planned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Tyson in Los Angeles, I was thinking at the time:
`He's finally wising up,' '' said Caplan, who has worked as a
publicist for Top Rank promoter Bob Arum and Tyson's former
promoter, Don King. ``He was doing a little bit of what has made
George so successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's never going to be George Foreman. But he's on the
right trail. It seems to be working.'' &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; Where's the money? &QL;  &QL; 
The re-working of Tyson's tattered image actually began last
spring, when he jettisoned King along with advisers John Horne and
Rory Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Then Caplan signed on for a few months. It was Caplan's job to
tell the media how much was allegedly taken from Tyson, who has
earned $140 million since 1995 and yet has a tax debt of $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is suing King for $100 million. King has filed a
countersuit. Nevertheless, the numbers paint a stark picture and
plant an inevitable question: What happened to Tyson's money?
</P>
<P>
   In part, Tyson looks as though he was an unwitting victim
surrounded by a bad crowd. By mere reflection, that almost makes
him a sympathetic figure. The crowd has changed, and those changes
were one of the consistent themes throughout Tyson's Phoenix
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But has ``he''?
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, there will be an answer Saturday at the MGM
Grand against Botha, a credible opponent. Botha is known for his
willingness to fight. If Botha can last beyond the initial moments
of a scheduled 10-rounder and land some telling blows in the
process, will Tyson revert to the wild man who went berserk against
Holyfield? If he does, all the well-intentioned P.R. will be
undone.
</P>
<P>
   For the long term, there's Tyson out of the ring. He has to stay
out of trouble, and there are plenty of people who are betting he
can't do it. He even hinted at it last week when a reporter,
identifying himself as a former prison inmate, asked whether it was
possible to steer clear of trouble for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's stayed out of trouble of any kind for 20
years,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, slightly cynical, side to this P.R. business.
In boxing, too much good can be very harmful. Tyson isn't the
game's biggest draw because he's Mother Teresa. He's big box-office
because he possesses a dark, destructive side. At his licensing
hearing in Las Vegas, he responded to questions about his
psychiatric report by saying he felt like Norman Bates, the slasher
in ``Psycho.'' The film wasn't popular because it was ``The Sound
Of'' ``Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to turn the lion into a kitten,'' said
Valley public relations man David Hans Schmidt, who has represented
Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be much chance of that. Again, just listen
to Tyson, himself, when asked last week about the fascination that
people continue to have for him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they hate me more than anyone else. Maybe they want to
see my demise.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson's demise would mark the end of boxing's biggest
moneymaker. He'll receive at least $20 million, not counting a
percentage of pay-per-view receipts, for the Botha bout, according
to sources within in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   P.R. people can count, too. There's plenty of incentive to keep
Tyson near the edge of a demise that few people ever see for
themselves. The dangerous balance between fame and infamy accounts
for the fascination. Even Tyson admits he had lost his balance. The
task now is to at least portray him as man attempting a comeback,
which is always the good fight.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his Phoenix training camp, there was a vigilant
effort to eliminate any potential that he might be nudged too close
to the edge of another fall. The parking lot near the rundown gym
on West Van Buren Street was surrounded by a chain-link fence that
was covered with tarps. Bodyguards checked the identity of those
allowed in and out of the gym.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Tyson was scheduled to play Santa, an expectant crowd
had gathered to watch his every move. There was one strange guy
with a movie camera. He wore a jacket that was spray-painted with
several obscene words directed at the police.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel couldn't miss him. Concerned, Finkel spoke to Tyson's
chief of security, James Anderson, a former New Jersey cop whose
son is Atlanta Falcons running back Jamal Anderson. The man in the
jacket soon vanished.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson ever saw him, he didn't acknowledge it. Tyson just went
about his business. A line of kids, a tableful of toys and the
cameras were waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   So was an old foe.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation might be his toughest opponent of all. &QL;  &QL;

GOOD SKI YEAR? IT JUST ISN'T SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're hankering for a great skiing trip, you'd better look
at Colorado, where some slopes have 12 feet of snow or more.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't an option, you can settle for skiing in Arizona.
Conditions aren't great for either downhill or cross-country this
season, and operators are worried they can't last long without
significant snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Snowbowl near Flagstaff opened Saturday on a limited
basis with a 26-inch base on the north runs. Manager John Murray
said his crews moved several thousand tons of snow to the north
slopes so that skiers could make it all the way to the chair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's pretty good skiing,'' he said Saturday. ``We're
about 25 percent open. It's pretty cold up here, and the runs
facing north, out of the sun, have enough snow to keep us going.
Under current conditions, I think it'll last a week or more.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the worst start for Snowbowl. During the drought in
1995-96, the slopes opened on Feb. 6 and closed again in Feb. 9.
Thanks to a late-winter storm, they opened again Feb. 29 and stayed
open until March 20.
</P>
<P>
   The White Mountain Apache's Sunrise Ski Resort between Pinetop
and Springerville is closed, according to Robert Howard, director
of mountain operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been enough natural snowfall,'' Howard said. ``We
have limited snow-making equipment. This pretty much has me in a
state of panic. We're usually in operation for the rest of the
winter at about Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get a couple of inches of snow, then it'll get warm. We
can't get an accumulation of snow. We could move snow from other
areas, but we still wouldn't have enough to open.''
</P>
<P>
   An answering machine was the only contact with the skiing area
on Bill Williams Mountain near Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say when we'll open,'' the tape said. ``But we're
ready. We'll open as soon as Mother Nature provides.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the skiing area on Mount Lemmon near Tucson received
no answer _ not even a message.
</P>
<P>
   At Snowbowl, the Mount Agassiz lift and lodge are the only
facilities open. As a result, there will be no children's or
beginners' ski areas. The slopes available on Agassiz are for
experienced skiers and snowboarders. Private lessons will be
available on a limited basis
</P>
<P>
   Lift tickets will be reduced to $25 for adults and $15 for
juniors (8 to 12).
</P>
<P>
   The number of lift tickets each day will be limited to 1,000,
according to Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we're not overcrowded,'' he said. ``We
want to have quality skiing, and we don't want all the snow skied
off.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that each skier, who spends the day, displaces a
ton of snow downhill. It happens when they make their turns. Each
night, crews groom the slopes by pushing the snow back up the
mountain. The sun, of course, has a lot to do with the demise of
snow on a slope.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he didn't think Snowbowl would get 1,000 skiers on
Saturday. ``It doesn't look like it now,'' he said. ``People got
the news, and we'll probably be a little under 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cross-country (Nordic) skiing, things are even
more bleak.
</P>
<P>
   There is skiing at Hannagan Meadows on the eastern side of the
state, but even the operators don't recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quality skiing,'' said Mike Baumann, who said he is a
cook at the lodge. ``It seems like it gets warmer and warmer every
day. During the day, the snow gets pretty slushy. What we really
need is a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flagstaff Nordic Center and the Forest Lakes Touring Center
near Heber don't have enough snow to ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will be a late winter,'' said Tim Grier at Forest
Lakes. ``The jet stream just isn't in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   For up-to-date information, Sunrise's toll-free number is (888)
617-6704. Snowbowl has a Phoenix number to get snow reports. It's
957-0404. &QL;

NBA TERMS WILL AFFECT ALL PRO SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What really went on in that all-nighter that Commissioner David
Stern and Players Association Executive Director Billy Hunter
pulled to save the NBA season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny you should ask that question,'' said Gene Upshaw,
executive director of the NFL's players union. ``I was just talking
to (baseball's union executive director) Donald Fehr, and we were
having that same discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably only eight other people who understand what
it's like to be in that room _ the four commissioners and the four
executive directors from baseball, hockey, football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is, it doesn't matter how they got there,
they've got an agreement and now they all have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, so will other professional athletes and their
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Each time a labor agreement is reached in pro sports, the others
are watching closely to see how the new system works, whether the
same rules could help or hurt their own league or players, who
benefits and who doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it takes years to find out.
</P>
<P>
   And the agreement reached between the NBA and its players is
unprecedented. It includes, for the first time, a maximum amount
players can be paid for at least the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each sport is always looking to better itself,'' said Shawn
Hunter, Coyotes president, who worked in the NBA for seven years.
``I'm sure it will be studied closely by both the players and the
management sides in other sports, and if there are pieces of it
that make sense, I'm sure they'll be discussed by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he had not had an opportunity to see the agreement
and wouldn't comment on the specifics, but he said every league is
trying to find ways to contain costs and grow while keeping its
players happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to (control costs),'' Hunter said.
``Because the ultimate loser is the fans. Without the everyday fan,
we're dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm glad they reached an agreement. It's good for
professional sports in general when there is labor peace, and I
happen to be a basketball fan. I was surprised it went so long. I
worked in the NBA, and I never thought I would see even one game
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Major League Baseball figure to be especially
interested in seeing the new agreement when it's put into writing.
The current labor agreement in baseball is up in 2000, but the
players have the option to extend it to 2001, which is likely.
</P>
<P>
   And baseball has some serious problems that must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have the advantage of having a managing general
partner, Jerry Colangelo, who was involved in the NBA talks as
president of the Suns and a member of the NBA's Labor Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're busy now, but sometime soon I want to sit down
with Jerry and (Suns General Manager) Bryan (Colangelo) and go
through it,'' said Joe Garagiola Jr., general manager of the
Diamondbacks. ``There are some ground-breaking things that went
into that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maximum salary is something that's unprecedented in
professional sports, but it's too early to say what the
implications of that might be. We're fortunate to have somebody who
was involved in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior Colangelo has taken some heat for being part of a
league that was seeking ``cost certainty'' in a labor agreement, as
the NBA did, while at the same time spending millions to sign free
agents for his baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   But, Colangelo said it's a matter of working within the rules
that exist to put the best possible product on the court or
diamond. And just because he believes a system may have flaws
doesn't mean he isn't going to work within that system.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, Colangelo hopes, will learn from the NBA deal, which
he believes will close the gap between small-market teams and
large-market teams. That will create competitive and financial
parity, which restricts player movement, which lends itself to
continuity and fan loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to speak to (Baseball Commissioner) Bud Selig,
he'd tell you there is nothing more important on his plate than
this whole area of creating parity,'' Colangelo said. ``There are
only two ways to close the gap: On the expense side, you put a lid
on of some type. And on the revenue side, you share as much as
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not socialism because there are quite a few variables.
But it's easier said than done. Any economic system that does not
have some kind of limitation at the top, and does not have
substantial revenue sharing, is going to have more than its share
of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This closes the gap in our league. What it will do is
absolutely stabilize the league, and if you buy into the theory
that  stable league is good for the players and owners, then it's
in everybody's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, there is a real division from the haves and
have-nots, just tremendous disparity on the revenue side from those
at the bottom and those at the top. You want every team to at least
have a shot at being competitive. There's something wrong when
teams can only break even by cutting salaries to the minimum, then
waiting for a big check in revenue sharing from the haves. It's not
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Selig and executive vice president Sandy Alderson were
not returned late last week, and many people involved in the
different league management and union teams were not willing to
discuss the deal until they had time to study it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our collective bargaining agreement is in place until 2004,''
said Frank Brown, a spokesman for the NHL. ``We're locked in. We'll
certainly study it when pen is actually put to paper, but it really
has no importance to us until our negotiations come up in the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe that for a minute. NHL owners will be studying it
closely by next week, and so will the league's players union.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw said he already has seen a rough version of the
agreement, and apparently so has NFL management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the NBA has taken some steps to maintain and
strengthen the competitive balance of their league,'' said Greg
Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL, who returned a call left for the
league's senior vice president for labor relations, Peter Ruocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to have a system that will promote equality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did some things that we did in our most recent contract
extension, which was increasing minimums for veteran players to
help the middle class, and some of the things they did with their
drug program. It appears they've got a very good, balanced
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   One might expect a different viewpoint from the players. After
all, many pundits have declared a major victory for the NBA's
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But Upshaw isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've looked at the preliminary agreement, and it's amazing to
me the players were able to get as much as they did with virtually
no leverage,'' Upshaw said. ``Everybody is saying the owners won,
but I think they ended up with a compromise that's not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are some limits, but there also were some
significant increases in the minimums for the players. And many of
the NBA's stars are grandfathered into the agreement. I think
Michael Jordan can survive on a 5 percent raise from his $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we made our deal in 1993, everybody said it
was the worst deal in sports, and the owners would laugh all the
way to the bank. But we've negotiated two extensions already, and
it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got labor peace until 2004, the players are happy, the
owners are happy and the Arizona Cardinals are in the playoffs.
Something must be working right.'' &QL;

   IMPEACH-TALK _ WASHINGTON _ The rosy bipartisan glow surrounding
the Senate's bipartisan agreement on rules for an impeachment trial
faded a bit Sunday. Sharp differences emerged as Democratic and
Republican senators appearing on TV interview shows wrestled with
controversial subjects their agreement had deferred, such as
whether there should be witnesses. (Malone, Cox News Service)

   GALEGIS-PREVIEW _ ATLANTA _ It's the first day of the 1999
legislative session. A new governor and lieutenant governor will be
sworn in, as will several constitutional officers and the entire
Legislature. The day's festivities start with a 7:45 a.m. church
service and conclude with the governor's ball. (Pruitt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

<P>
   PEACE-CORPS _ ATLANTA _ Who are the people attracted to the
Peace Corps, and what does it take to be accepted? We attend the
first in a series of metro Atlanta recruitment drives, this one at
the Auburn Avenue Library. Two interesting angles: Why would people
want to work hard for almost no pay in the middle of the best
economy in world history, and is there concern about safety in the
wake of the murder last month of an Atlanta Peace Corps worker in
Gabon, West Africa? (Smith, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; VIRGIL THOMSON: COMPOSER ON THE AISLE &LR;  By Anthony Tommasini.
Norton, $18. A music critic for The New York Times portrays Thomson
as both a vivacious Midwesterner affected by the hymns and band
concerts of his childhood, and a man capable of baffling cruelty.
In 1997 the Times reviewer Nicholas Fox Weber said this biography
``evokes the composer's critical ear and describes his music with
words that bring us right into the concert hall.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHARMING BILLY &LR;  By Alice McDermott. Delta, $12.95. In a New
York bar where the friends and family of a dreamy, hard-drinking
Irish-American named Billy Lynch gather after his funeral, a
corrosive 40-year-old lie about a woman tragically lost and
presumed dead is gradually unraveled. This novel, which won a
National Book Award in 1998, is about the power of romantic
mythmaking and the way a person's life can be shaped by the
expectations of others. Last year in The New York Times Book
Review, Alida Becker called it an ``eloquent and unsettling'' tale
that ``like its title character ... works on our sympathies with an
insistent sadness and an ingratiating charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued McDermott's earlier novels,
including  &UR; THAT NIGHT &LR;  ($12.95), which centers on a battle that
breaks out in a New York suburb when the parents of a pregnant
teen-ager try to keep her from her hoodlum boyfriend. In 1987 the
reviewer David Leavitt admired the ``almost baroque richness of
McDermott's sentences, the intellectual complexity of her moral
vision and the explicit emotion of her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; A BIGAMIST'S DAUGHTER &LR;  ($12.95), a young woman working at a
vanity press becomes involved with a novelist whose
work-in-progress about a bigamist stirs troubling memories of her
own elusive father. In 1982 Anne Tyler wrote, ``McDermott ...
writes with assurance and skill, and she has created a
fascinatingly prismatic story.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HISTORY OF DOGS IN THE EARLY AMERICAS &LR;  By Marion Schwartz.
Selected drawings by Susan Hochgraf. Yale University, $15. A
physical anthropologist reveals how man's best friend was many
things to many peoples before the Europeans arrived in the Americas
in the 1500s. In some places dogs were revered as deities, in
others eaten as dinner. In 1997 the reviewer Timothy Foote called
this ``a fascinating, scholarly mishmash, with extraordinary
drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EMINENT DOGS, DANGEROUS MEN &LR;  By Donald McCaig. Lyons, $14.95. A
chronicle of the author's difficult search through Scotland for the
perfect border collie to herd sheep on his Virginia farm. This
``lively travelogue-history'' is ``rich in dog lore and by no means
poor as a study of human behavior,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt
wrote in The New York Times in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BURDEN OF DESIRE &LR;  By Robert MacNeil. Harvest/Harcourt Brace,
$14. After a French freighter explodes and destroys part of
Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1917, a clergyman stumbles onto a woman's
passionate diary, falls in love with its author and enlists a
friend to help track her down. In 1992 the reviewer Susan Fromberg
Schaeffer called this ``a novel filled with riches and alight with
understanding of the small events that lead to the huge upheavals
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAPPED IN THE NET: THE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF
COMPUTERIZATION &LR;  By Gene I. Rochlin. Princeton University, $17.95.
Focusing on the current and expected effects of computers and
networking on everything from air travel to the financial markets,
the author argues that automation is making it nearly impossible
for people to make modest mistakes and learn from them. In 1997,
Lawrence Hunter called this ``an insightful and painstakingly
documented book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRYSTAL FIRE: THE INVENTION OF THE TRANSISTOR AND THE BIRTH OF
THE INFORMATION AGE &LR;  By Michael Riordan and Lillian Hoddeson.
Norton, $15. This traces the careers of three American physicists
whose work paved the way for today's microprocessor chips.
``Riordan and Hoddeson reconstruct the birth of the transistor with
considerable aplomb,'' John Durant wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FELIX IN THE UNDERWORLD &LR;  By John Mortimer. Penguin, $12.95.
This British author's 27th book is a comic romp about a feckless
novelist who gets caught up in paternity-suit blackmail and murder
during a nightmarish book tour. In 1997 Christopher Buckley called
this a ``witty work, reminiscent of other late-period novels like
Kingsley Amis' `Russian Girl' and Peter De Vries' `Peckham's
Marbles.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DREAM STATE: STORIES &LR;  By Moira Crone. University Press of
Mississippi, $14.95. Many of the vaguely confused characters in
these tales are transplanted Northerners adrift in New Orleans and
southern Louisiana but unable to move on. ```Dream State'
successfully presents a fresh version of the Deep South, one that
is exotic without being either grotesque or romanticized,'' Gary
Krist wrote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WITH CHATWIN: PORTRAIT OF A WRITER &LR;  By Susannah Clapp. Penguin,
$12.95. The enigmatic Bruce Chatwin, who died of AIDS at the age of
48, is portrayed by his first editor as a brilliant travel writer
and novelist, and an immensely talented art dealer. This is an
``adoring memoir'' by an observer ``graced with a special vantage
on his life and work,'' William Ferguson wrote in 1997.

'99 PROBLEM TRIPS UP FEW COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Mass., Wash.) 
(mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world apparently sailed through the first days of 1999 with
only scattered mistakes by computers confused by the approaching
Year 2000 _ an outcome that added to growing optimism about the
chances of avoiding widespread disruptions 51 weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions to new years are always a bug-ridden time for
information managers, because some devices and programs do not
automatically adjust calendars. But computer users had feared that
the advent of this year might be rougher than usual because many
computer programs look a full 52 weeks ahead and so would be
encountering dates in 2000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports filtered in about mixups with taxi meters, with
accounting software that spewed out faulty bills or _
alternatively, failed to issue valid ones _ and similar glitches.
But the disruptions seemed to be isolated, quickly handled and in
some cases not really linked to the 2000 date at all. Year 2000
experts were especially impressed that the financial sector had
fared so well, despite having also committed huge computing
resources to the introduction of the euro, the new European
currency that began trading last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points to the likelihood of a few hellish days rather than
big failures next year,'' said Ian Hayes, president of Clarity
Consulting, who advises large multinational clients from his base
in South Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime use of just two
digits to refer to the year, and the inability of some computers to
recognize 00 as 2000. Some computers mistake 00 for 1900 while
others, programmed to expect steadily higher numbers in their
two-digit year data, cannot read 00 at all and shut down or revert
to some earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty last week was whether some computers using
two-digit dates might be tripped up by programs that had used the
digits 99 to mean ``end of file,'' ``shut down'' or some other
message having nothing to do with dates. That practice was used as
a shortcut by an unknown number of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the 99 problem is a serious threat. For
one thing, the use of two or more 9s as an end-of-file signifier
within date programs is relatively rare. And even where it does
exist, it is typically easy to locate. In any case, although some
had warned that this last week was also a danger zone, Sept. 9,
1999, is seen as the most likely minefield of 9s.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most widely reported glitches last week turned
out to be 99 problems, not failures to handle 2000. Taxis in
Singapore, for example, were unable to run their meters for several
hours on Jan. 1. And some in Stockholm _ to the delight of Swedes
out celebrating the New Year _ were unable to switch to higher
fares authorized for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler Corp. discovered on Jan. 1 that a program in its
regional data centers that helps run auto production had a 99
problem that could be fixed by the same patch the company was
planning to install later this quarter to deal with a Year 2000
defect. So Chrysler rushed the patching job through, and no
disruptions were suffered, according to Roger Buck, head of the
company's Year 2000 project.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said it encountered four minor glitches,
including a commodities accounting program that would not allow it
to schedule a metals payment in the Year 2000. It turned out that
all four defects had been identified by Goldman's code scanners and
would have been scheduled to be eliminated anyway by program fixes
set for this spring. ``I feel good about that, but it doesn't mean
we are going to cut back on our contingency planning or other Year
2000 work,'' said Leslie Tortora, the firm's chief technology
officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As expected, government computers in Washington and in several
states were unable to sign people up for unemployment benefits
using standard forms, which set a date one year ahead as the end of
the benefits. But, as previously planned, those agencies continued
to sign people up for the benefits last week by plugging in Dec.
31, 1999, as the ending dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create a nightmare of paperwork to rework these if it
goes on for long, but most systems should be ready for Year 2000
dates by the end of this quarter,'' said Howard Waddell, a Labor
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, said the unemployment benefit scramble underscored
the need to plan for breakdowns well in advance. He said he was
worried that last week's calm might encourage local governments and
small businesses to settle on ``wait until it breaks'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems Products in Bohemia, N.Y., was one company
that paid a price for not paying attention in time. One of three
companies that supplies automobile emission-testing equipment for
use in New York state, Environmental Systems was surprised to
discover that equipment it had been phasing out could not produce a
00 windshield sticker for drivers whose vehicles had passed
inspection. Stickers in New York use two digits for the month and
two digits for the year to indicate the expiration date for an
emissions validation.
</P>
<P>
   The 00 sticker should have started appearing Dec. 22 because New
York motorists get a grace period of eight days for their one-year
validations. But the older Environmental Systems equipment printed
out stickers saying 91 instead, and many inspection stations simply
put them on car windows. Parking agents promptly began ticketing
the apparently out-of-date cars.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems quickly reported the problem to the state
and procedures were set up to quash the tickets, but the crash
effort to complete the transition to newer equipment that issues 00
stickers was not completed until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost a lot of money,'' said James Richardson, the company's
director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, the consultant, cautions ``there are a hundred problems
for every one reported.'' And he and others also warn that
companies with a faulty program creating bad data may not realize
it yet. Nevertheless, after this first week of the Year 2000
shakedown cruise, Hayes said it was hard not to see the results as
good news.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Monday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-ECON (Havana) _How people are managing in an embargoed
economy. 1800 words. By James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GULF-OIL-PRICES (Kuwait City) _ A sustained decline in world oil
prices has left the gulf states with a growing sense of
vulnerability. 1400 words. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-VILLAGE (San Vicente Del Caguan) _ In the streets, the
campesinos of San Vicente del Caguan dared a quiet pride and even
hope, seeing luminaries from the nation's capital and around Latin
America descend on their town for a giant party to begin talks with
leftist rebels this week. ``Laboratory for peace,'' said banners
strung across the airport and around the square, where the
government and leftist rebels have opened talks toward peace. The
signs did not refer so much to the national feelers to end the
fighting that has claimed 35,000 lives over the last decade, as to
this town's novel attempts to find a peace of its won with the
rebels in recent months. 1300 words. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-RDP (Cairo, Egypt) _ After more than a month of rising
defiance, the Iraqi government on Sunday inexplicably postponed a
vote in which its Parliament had appeared ready to take further
steps along a collision course with its Western foes. Instead, the
Parliament issued only a mild statement critical of last month's
American-led air strikes against Iraq; on Saturday, there had been
calls from some members of Parliament for measures that would have
been a direct challenge to the United Nations. 1000 words. By
Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-POLITICS (Hong Kong) _ Eight months after it scored a
resounding victory in legislative elections here, Hong Kong's
pro-democracy movement is divided over whether the Democratic Party
should abandon elective politics and take its cause to the streets.
1000 words. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-VOTE (Lagos) _ Officials monitoring Nigeria's statewide
elections said on Sunday that they had been generally peaceful and
well-organized, describing them as an improvement over last month's
local elections and another positive step toward next month's
presidential contest. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   KAZAKHSTAN-VOTE (Almaty) _ President Nursultan Nazarbayev ran
for a fresh seven-year term on Sunday against three virtual
unknowns. The official turnout in this Central Asian nation, which
has been courted by the west because of its large energy reserves,
was 86 percent. Official vote results were expected Monday. By
Steve LeVine.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-VATICAN (Ottawa) _ The second-ranking Vatican diplomat in
Canada is accused of stalking a former employee. 600 words. By
Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-MURAL (Johannesburg) _ A mural in the center of
Johannesburg honoring the apartheid struggle contains not the faces
of Mandela or Tutu or Biko, but those of actors from the afternoon
soaps. 1000 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w' code)
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-RDP (Washington) _ Lede-all on the impeachment issue. By
Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLITICS (Washington) _ The question now is whether
Congress and the Clinton administration can work together to deal
with the full plate of issues facing the country. Both parties have
powerful motivations to prove that they have not been consumed by
impeachment. But the challenge of getting on with the people's
business will be complicated not just by impeachment-induced
bitterness and distrust, but by the host of differing agendas in
play, from Gephardt and Gore to the conservative right. By Richard
W. Stevenson and John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SENATE (Washington) _ In setting a detailed schedule to
resume the Clinton impeachment trial but putting off the vexing
issue of whether witnesses will be heard, the Senate demonstrated
to many lawyers and others just how different an impeachment trial
is from any other legal proceeding. By Neil Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-HISTORY (Washington) _ With a contemporary
constitutional drama going on just a few miles away, historians
flocked to the nation's capital last week to discuss topics like
the dilemma of the South Asian intellectual and acoustics in early
America. And maybe something else, too. By David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   RENO-RECORD (Washington) _ On Monday, Janet Reno becomes the
longest serving attorney general of this century, breaking a record
held by Homer Cummings, an attorney general in the Roosevelt
administration who held the post from March 4, 1933, to Jan. 2,
1939. Reno, who took over in 1993, is highly unlikely to break the
all-time service record held by William Wirt, who served for 11
years from November 1817 to March 1829. By David Johnston.

Washington. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   PRISON-STUDY (Undated) _ The recent wave of get-tough-on-crime
sentencing laws has succeeded in making criminals serve longer
prison sentences and slowed the release of prison inmates; but it
has also helped increase the nation's record prison population even
as crime has dropped in the 1990s, according to the first
comprehensive study of the new laws released by the Justice
Department. By Fox Butterfield.

TRYING TO WIN RESPECT FOR NEW YORK'S SOFTWARE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Calif., Mass.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bruce Bernstein is a frustrated man. The proprietor
of Main Street Partners, a database application developer based in
New York, he is also a tireless promoter of the city's software
developers as president of the New York Software Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   What frustrates Bernstein is that New York's software industry
is almost entirely overlooked except when it is related to new
media, the industry that has grown up around the Internet. The
problem with fusing the identities of the two industries, he says,
is that excitement over the evolution of the Internet into a mass
medium eclipses his industry and undermines its value. In short,
New York City is known for its content, not its code.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the software industry is lumped into new media, it hurts,''
Bernstein said. ``It hurts when people want to make investments
here or locate their company here. It hurts when the best
programmers don't want to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, New York City, unlike Silicon Valley or Boston's Route
128, is not recognized as a center for software development. It is
not the first place venture capitalists look to invest in
technology or programmers look for jobs. Citing perhaps the most
obvious flaw in the common perception, Bernstein said, ``People
forget that New York City was the home of IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Fish, a partner in the New York City office of the venture
capital arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, agrees that the popular
perception is a problem. ``Traditionally, venture capitalists have
invested in proprietary technology, something which will have an
ongoing life,'' he said. ``They need to know that the software
industry is here and thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Fish said, ``the software industry has played
second fiddle to the hype of new media.'' But software development,
he added, is a true technology industry, ``while new media falls
more along the lines of entertainment and publishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, part of the identity problem is that the edges of the two
industries blur on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software may not be the best term now for our industry, with
all the issues of convergence,'' Bernstein said. ``We like to think
of it as software and information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein also contends that many new-media companies are really
software developers in disguise. For example, in his mind,
Doubleclick, an online advertising agency that places clients'
banners across the Internet and is one of the most successful
companies in Silicon Alley, is a software developer. ``The engine
of its success is software technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion is understandable. Historically, software came in
a box and was purchased at computer stores. It was easy to
recognize. ``Packaged software is not delivered in a package
anymore,'' Bernstein said. ``It's delivered over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be software developed for use on the Internet. Comet
Systems, for instance, has developed a software tool for creating
customized cursors at Web sites. While a user is visiting a Disney
site, the cursor might be mouse ears, while at the NFL site it
might be a football. Software? New media? New-media software?
</P>
<P>
   According to the association's definition, software companies
fall into four categories, divided by product or service: packaged
software, custom software, systems integrators or
information-technology management consulting. In addition, the
association recognizes in-house software groups, academic computer
science centers and freelance programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, if a primary part of a company's revenue comes
from writing code, we consider it a software company,'' Bernstein
said. ``Of course, the holy grail is to design your own package.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's software industry has had very little in the way of
hard numbers to promote itself. And despite Fish's concerns, even
PricewaterhouseCoopers' own research categorizes software and new
media together. When Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, now merged into
PricewaterhouseCoopers, published its much-cited survey of
new-media companies in New York City in the fall of 1996, it did
not distinguish software companies from more media-oriented
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Web site of the PricewaterhouseCoopers venture
capital survey, figures on financing for Internet companies and
software companies are listed together. A quick glance at the
survey's findings for the last three years, however, shows that
nearly half the companies in the New York metropolitan area that
won financing were software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The association will soon have a better set of numbers to fall
back on. The New York City comptroller's office is nearing the end
of a study on the software industry, and its report will be
released Jan. 21 at the New York Software Summit and East Coast
Summit for Java Technology at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
The New York City Comptroller, Alan Hevesi, will present it when he
delivers the event's keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to have good data,'' David Neustadt, a
spokesman for Hevesi's office, said. ``If you want to help an
industry, you have to know what they have and what they need. We
want to help get people to take the industry more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city that brims with industrial variety and that is the
world center of several businesses, including broadcasting,
finance, publishing and fashion, Bernstein's battle for identity
may be a tough one, and it may be that the software industry will
never attract the recognition and influence it deserves. But it
will probably be distinguishable from new media in one major way
for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the software companies are financing themselves out of
revenue,'' Bernstein said. ``They make money.''

FALLOWS JOINS MICROSOFT  
 GOLDEN BOOKS HORROR STORY  
 MEHTA INDIGNANT

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Fallows, former editor of U.S. News and World Report and
author of ``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American
Democracy,'' is well known as a critic of what journalists write.
But he has also been an armchair critic of the computer software
that they use to write with.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fallows, 49, who was replaced last June as editor of U.S.
News, has an opportunity to influence the software. He joined
Microsoft Corp. last week as a member of the product development
team for Word, the leading word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   When Fallows was a writer for The Atlantic Monthly, his editors
indulged his nerdish inclinations by allowing him to write
occasional computer columns. He was an outspoken member of that
quixotic minority that tried to resist the Microsoft tide, writing
articles that extolled the virtues of IBM's OS/2 operating system
over Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Talking last fall with Steven Ballmer, a fellow alumnus of the
Harvard Crimson and the president of Microsoft, about going to work
for the software industry's standard setter, Fallows said he felt
``like some French diplomat finally admitting that most of the
world speaks English.''
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, Fallows has had a penchant for public policy.
But as a new Microsoft employee, he is reticent when the
conversation turns to the company's confrontation with the Justice
Department. ``On the antitrust issue,'' he said, ``reasonable
people can come to different conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows says he wants to make Word more helpful and less
irritating to use for people who do in-depth research and writing,
like academics, journalists and authors. His boss, Jon DeVaan, a
Microsoft vice president, said Fallows brought an author's
perspective, creativity and a genuine enthusiasm for technology to
the software design team.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows says he intends to work at Microsoft for six months or
so and then return to writing magazine articles and books.

   Golden Books Misses Out on Happily Ever After
</P>
<P>
   If Golden Books Family Entertainment ever chose to publish its
own recent history, it would belong in the category of horror
stories. Stock in the troubled children's publisher closed at a
mere 34.375 cents a share on Friday, after trading as high as
$11.875 a share on Feb. 2, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though figures for the fourth quarter _ traditionally the year's
best _ are not out yet, there seems to be so little hope for a
turnaround that Ariel Capital Management, an investment firm that
once owned 20 percent of Golden Books stock, dumped its entire
holding last fall. Though Richard Snyder, the chairman of Golden
Books, has continually promised improvement, the company's
performance has deteriorated so badly that John Miller of Ariel
said in an interview last week, ``We kept hearing that fundamentals
were improving, but it turned out they were deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deteriorating'' is an understatement. In the first nine months
of 1998, current liabilities ballooned to $267 million because the
company failed to meet interest payments on $149 million in senior
preferred notes that had been carried as long-term debt. Those
notes immediately became current liabilities, dwarfing current
assets of $144.6 million. The company is trying to renegotiate with
bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flow, meanwhile, was a negative $70 million, nearly twice
the $38 million loss a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter of 1998, the company lost $18.9 million, or
71 cents a share, compared with $17.9 million, or 76 cents a share,
in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Golden Books said
higher sales of its children's books were offset by a drop in its
adult book business.
</P>
<P>
   Two board members, Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks, and
Linda Janklow, wife of the publishing agent Morton Janklow, have
resigned. Last week, John Ferrara, the chief financial officer,
left, and the company could be dropped from listing on the Nasdaq
stock exchange, Golden Books acknowledged in its most recent
quarterly statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stock has been trading below $5 a share, it has
failed to meet some Nasdaq requirements. A Golden Books spokesman
said the company was negotiating with Nasdaq, and that a rule that
would require the stock to trade at more than $1 a share for 10
business days out of the next 90 calendar days or lose its listing
was not yet applicable.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's current strategy for solving Golden Books' problems
remains unclear. But as each month passes, it seems the strategy
will have to be ever more imaginative.

<P>
   Writer Finds No Room at the Library
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Yorker's move to the Conde Nast building in
Times Square, planned for the summer, has ignited a feud between
unlikely opponents: a prolific author and the New York Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Ved Mehta, the author of 22 books and a staff writer at The New
Yorker from 1961 to 1994, has long used the library as a research
site, despite his blindness; he has assistants who read to him in
his private office at The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed to keep the office even though he was no longer
an employee of the magazine (he likes to say he was ``terminated''
by Tina Brown in 1994). But he will not get office space in The New
Yorker's new, smaller quarters in the Times Square building. A
spokeswoman for the magazine, Perri Dorset, said there would be
room only for regular contributors to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   When Mehta heard that the library, as part of its renovation,
was creating 15 private rooms for scholars, he was curious about
the new spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to apply for an office, and the answer came back no,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Oyama, manager of public relations for the library,
said the private rooms were apportioned out by the Center for
Scholars and Writers, a new program that has been endowed by a $15
million grant from Dorothy and Lewis Cullman. The space is open
only to scholars who apply for specific study projects and is
available during the course of an academic year, Ms. Oyama said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta, who is the recipient of a MacArthur grant and two
Guggenheim fellowships, said last week that he had met with Paul
LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library. LeClerc, he
said, was ``sympathetic,'' but the meeting had little result. Mehta
said he believed that other writers of his stature had received
adequate work space when they asked for it, and he had not.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta said he would sue the library _ if it did not provide him
with ``proper facilities'' _ for discriminating against him as a
blind person.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oyama said the library was not acting illegally by denying
Mehta a private office.
</P>
<P>
   LeClerc said there were semiprivate accommodations for writers
who had pending book contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as we go through the rest of the renovation process, we
will be sure to accommodate visually impaired writers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is unswayed in his mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written 22 books, I was a staff writer at the New Yorker
from 1961 to 1994, I've never had a sabbatical and I've worked
seven days a week,'' he said. ``I don't understand the priorities
of this civilization.''

MOVIE CASTS CORPORATIONS AS BAD GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Mass., Calif., N.J.) 
(js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ What's it worth to a company to get its soft drink
or athletic shoe prominently displayed in a big movie? Tommy
Hilfiger , the hip young clothing line, spent $10 million on a
promotion campaign for ``The Faculty,'' a Miramax/Dimension film
for Disney about high school students (dressed in Hilfiger) who
battle alien invaders.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a new Disney film, ``A Civil Action,'' may be the
ultimate in reverse product placement.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare movie industry moment, two giant corporations get
prominent on-screen exposure as the major villains in the real-life
story of the pollution of a New England town's water supply and the
labyrinthine lawsuit by eight families accusing the companies of
dumping chemicals that caused leukemia and led to eight deaths,
including those of several children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies, W.R. Grace, reacted strongly to the film,
kicking off a behind-the-scenes struggle over its portrayal during
the making of the movie, even setting up its own Web site in
November, www.civil-action.com. The other, Beatrice Foods, was
largely broken up in the 1980s, and its subsidiaries were sold off.
But at one point in the film, John Travolta, the star, lists some
former Beatrice brands that are commonplace in millions of U.S.
households: Peter Pan peanut butter, Tropicana orange juice,
Rosarita Mexican food, Swiss Miss cocoa, Samsonite luggage, Playtex
bras and Culligan water systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the film was being made, W.R. Grace was sending letters
and faxes to Disney lawyers expressing concern that the movie would
repeat what Grace said were inaccuracies in the best-selling book
by Jonathan Harr on which the film was based. The movie, like the
book, is set in the 1980s and focuses on the obsessive legal
efforts of a personal-injury lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann (Travolta),
on behalf of eight families in Woburn, Mass., against the two
corporations. Schlichtmann loses virtually all he has in defending
the families.
</P>
<P>
   The film opened last month in New York and Los Angeles to
generally positive reviews and reached theaters around the nation
on Friday. It was No. 1 at the box office and took in an estimated
$15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the exchanges, said one person involved in the
making of the film, was Grace's hope to apply enough pressure on
Disney to fictionalize the name of the company in the movie. Disney
refused to make any changes.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has conceded making errors in its handling of the Woburn
case, but it points proudly to its environmental record in recent
years. Harr and the studio said they had never heard from anyone
associated with Beatrice Foods or any of its components. Tropicana
Products, for example, was sold last August to Pepsico, for $3.3
billion. The seller was Seagram Co., which purchased Tropicana 11
years ago for $1.2 billion from Beatrice.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gutsche, Tropicana's vice president for public relations,
said it was far-fetched to link the company with the tragedy in
Woburn. ``Tropicana has an excellent environmental record,''
Gutsche said. Referring to the film, he said, ``I think people are
very smart and realize it has nothing to do with us.''
</P>
<P>
   What has surprised executives and producers in Hollywood is that
Disney, one of the more conservative and traditional studios,
agreed with apparent little question to follow the book and name
Beatrice and Grace. Movie studios, mostly owned by conglomerates
like Disney, Time Warner and Viacom, generally shy away from
controversial subjects and certainly avoid criticizing major
corporations and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unusual, I guess, for a big corporation to do this,''
acknowledged Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. ``Maybe I
shouldn't say this, but you don't want to throw bricks if you live
in a glass house. As a corporation, the more public you are, the
more vulnerable you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The film adheres to the book in its allegations against Grace
and Beatrice, which was involved through a subsidiary, a tannery
run by a cantankerous Woburn resident named John Riley.
Specifically, Grace and the Beatrice subsidiary were charged with
dumping a substance called TCE, for tricholorethylene, on the
grounds near their Woburn plants, allowing it to seep into a well
that supplied drinking water. The families charged that the
contaminated water ultimately led to the leukemia deaths.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Disney did not waver or seek to mute the bleak
story by creating fictitious names for the corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the book was purchased by Disney in 1995, one of
the producers, Rachel Pfeffer, who took the project to the company,
thought briefly about changing the names of the giant corporations
negatively depicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it for five minutes,'' Ms. Pfeffer said.
``But then we never gave it a whole lot of thought after that. If
you change names, you have to start changing history. To be able to
say this was based on a true story was important to the filmmakers
and the studio.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Steven Zaillian, the director and screenwriter of ``A Civil
Action,'' who won an Academy Award for his adaptation of
``Schindler's List,'' said that altering the names ``never crossed
my mind.'' He added: ``I knew there'd come a time when Disney would
decide whether they would allow me to use real names. It was their
decision, finally. And my feeling was, even if they decided to
change the names, everyone would know anyway. It would have been
written about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer, Zaillian and another producer, Scott Rudin, said
the studio's major concern was the so-called crawl, the text that
appeared on the screen at the end of the film. Two Disney lawyers,
Jack Yellin and Steve Bardwil, spent days working on the crawl and
took into account letters sent by Grace to Disney about the
depiction of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were numerous faxes back and forth; I'm not exactly sure
why,'' Zaillian said. ``They wanted the wording to be very precise.
They'd ask me what I wanted to say, I sent it to them. They'd
review it, and sometimes they'd say it's fine, and sometimes they
wanted a word or two changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The crawl begins by saying that a U.S. District Court judge,
Walter J. Skinner (played by John Lithgow), had found that John
Riley, who ran the Beatrice-owned tannery, had deliberately
concealed evidence at the trial. The tannery was torn down in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It also says:
</P>
<P>
   ``W.R. Grace was indicted by the grand jury for making false
statements to the EPA regarding its use of the chemicals TCE,
acetone and toluene. The company pleaded no contest to the acetone
charge. Its Woburn plant was closed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faced with the prospect of returning to court, the two
companies agreed to pay their share of the $69.4 million in cleanup
costs _ the largest, most expensive project of its kind in New
England history.''
</P>
<P>
   The crawl goes on to say that Schlichtmann settled his debts,
got married and is now practicing environmental law, currently
representing 60 families in Toms River, N.J., in another
contaminated-water case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer said W.R. Grace had ``waged somewhat of a campaign
with the studio.'' She said the company had asked in vain to read
Zaillian's script as well as to view the film early. The company
itself had taken issue with some of the details in Harr's book.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Grace set up the Web site, offering details of the
company's cleanup efforts in Woburn, and said that Harr ``was
something of a partisan'' for Schlichtmann. In a letter to the news
media on Dec. 17, Paul J. Norris, president and chief executive of
Grace, said that ``the pain and personal loss sustained by the
Woburn families saddens us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Looking back, we realize we made mistakes in how
we addressed the concerns of the Woburn community and the
government agencies regarding our past waste disposal practices. We
have spent the last 12 years working with the community and the
environmental agencies to restore their confidence and trust. We've
made significant progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Harr, the author, spoke evenly about Grace. ``This existed 12,
13 years ago,'' he said. ``Today they're being confronted with past
misdeeds in this juggernaut of publicity that comes with a
Hollywood movie.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I honestly don't know much about Grace today. I
thought their Web site was pretty temperate and pretty fair-minded.
It's undoubtedly true that Grace is more conscious of environmental
concern as a result of two things: the case I wrote about and
simply changing times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudin suggested that there was a personal dimension for Roth,
the studio chairman, in the film, one reason the studio was so
supportive. Roth's parents were old-line New York leftists who
triggered a landmark case, Engle vs. Vitale, in which the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1962 outlawed prayer in public schools. The family
was harassed for years on Long Island by hate mail, cross burnings
and even a bomb in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the Jan Schlichtmann character can change
something at a great personal price sort of rang true to me,'' Roth
said. ``Actually the film was kind of personal.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co.,
was not involved in the decision making about the film and left it
in the hands of the studio. ``I didn't feel any pressure within the
company,'' Roth said. ``But if it hadn't been a best-selling book
adapted by an Academy Award-winning screenwriter _ who knows?''

 &HT;    Peace Corps recruting campaign comes to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A stint in the Peace Corps has been called, ``the
toughest job you'll ever love,'' and current recruiting materials
ask,''How far will you go to make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   To some on the outside, the organization that John F. Kennedy
founded in 1961, with its altruistic, wide-eyed image, is something
of an anachromism. Why, in the best U.S. economy in memory, would
someone sweat for 27 months for grunt wages ($6,075 paid in a lump
sum at the end), in places with no running water or modern
amenities?
</P>
<P>
   Why risk one's life, especially when war or revolution can break
out _ and often does _ in developing nations where the Peace Corps
typically places its people?
</P>
<P>
   To answer these and myriad other questions, the Peace Corps is
making a recruiting push in Georgia this month. As part of its plan
to add 4,000 new volunteers nationwide by the year 2000, three
get-to-know-us sessions have been scheduled in Atlanta, and one in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to an 8 percent budget increase, we will be adding a
ton of volunteers to teach English as a second language,''
recruiter Stephanie Greene said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among those present and hoping to probe behind the Peace Corps
image was Bob Zwald, 70, of Cumming, who has spent the past two
summers in China with the Amity Foundation, teaching English to
middle-school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in giving something back to the world,'' said Zwald,
who hopes his grandchildren will grow beyond ``this basically
selfish society we live in.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``giving back'' sometimes comes at a price. The murder of
Atlanta Peace Corps worker Karen Phillips in Gabon last month
saddened several returning volunteers who attended the session.
Still, they said, the dangers abroad are really no greater than
those faced every day in big U.S. cities, and for most volunteers
who live with a foreign host family in a close-knit village, the
dangers are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security measures are a major part of the training, and we
have escape plans for our people, as well as radios and beepers for
them to wear in areas where there are no phones,'' said Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If war or civil unrest could endanger our people, we send out
the message 'Susie is having a baby,' which means 'Get out of the
country NOW,' `` she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lea Clinton, who served in Honduras, and Latanya Mapp, who
served in Lesotoh, said they were trained to handle a variety of
situations. Mapp learned, and subsequently taught others, how to
walk safely in the streets at night. Now, she says, she sees how
careless American children are in traffic, and it bothers her
``that they wear black at night, and get run over.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``My village had a self-defense training course,
which was good because many Third-World countries are
male-dominated, and women are considered fair prey. But in the end,
it's the volunteer's responsibility to take care of herself and be
aware of what is going on around her, just like it is here at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a positive contribution eventually eclipsed daily safety
and comfort concerns, the volunteers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn patience, despite yourself, and you come back a
better person for it,'' said Clark Efaw, who taught small business
development in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to draw your water from a well and boil it. There's
no phone, so you take a day to go to another village to talk to
someone, and if he's not there, you have to come back home and try
again tomorrow,'' Efaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My metabolic rate is half what it was before I went into the
Peace Corps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New volunteer Kevin Robinson, scheduled to leave Atlanta on Jan.
19, listened closely at Thursday's session. He was a Georgia State
University grad when he found himself tending bar at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized one day, this is not at all what I had planned for
my life,'' Robinson said. ``I'd rather spend the next 27 months
building schools in Gabon than mixing cocktails, while I think
about the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   And he promised to write ``a long letter'' when he gets there.

`DAUGHTER OF THE RIVER': A STARK AWAKENING ON THE BANKS OF THE
YANGTZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This raw and powerful memoir by Hong Ying, a 38-year-old writer
of short stories and novels from China, seems at first glance to be
similar to other recent autobiographical excursions into the
political trauma and psychic damage of Maoist and post-Maoist
Chinese history. It is in this sense part of a recently emerged
Chinese genre among whose best other examples are ``Life and Death
in Shanghai'' by Nien Cheng, ``Wild Swans'' by Jung Chang and ``A
Single Tear'' by Wu Ningkun.
</P>
<P>
   Like these other books, Ms. Hong's ``Daughter of the River''
evokes a harshness, an everyday brutality about life in China that
had largely been concealed by government propaganda and Western
ignorance. But Ms. Hong's ``Daughter of the River,'' a book
published in Taiwan but not in mainland China, is also different
from recent Chinese memoirs. It is more private and less overtly
political and more confessional than other accounts from China.
</P>
<P>
   Unerringly translated by Howard Goldblatt, Ms. Hong's book deals
with a later time than other accounts of life in China, with the
1970s and '80s when the worst of recent Chinese history, especially
the Maoist political campaigns, was supposedly over.
</P>
<P>
   Her book is a rigorously honest, sometimes cruelly frank
portrayal of a young woman's mind and body subjected both to a poor
and to a loveless world. In essence, Ms. Hong tells the story of
herself as she reached her 18th birthday living in poverty and
afflicted by an intense spiritual solitude. Ms. Hong, who now lives
in London, grew up in an area of Chongqing, the hilly and, to
outsiders, picturesque Sichuanese city overlooking the confluence
of the Jialing and Yangtze Rivers. Tourists to China know this
place as the exotic starting point for the riverboats that take
passengers through the famous Three Gorges, downstream on the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hong's Chongqing is not the city that the foreigners see.
She grew up in its South Bank district, a place of ``dark,
misshapen courtyards off twisting little lanes'' where ``there are
hardly any sewers or garbage-collecting facilities, so the
accumulated filth spills out into roadside ditches and runs down
the hills,'' producing ``an astonishing mixture of strange odors.''
The district is where the river laborers live, including Ms. Hong's
unforgettably surly mother, a woman dried out by hardship and hard
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hong's opening lines quickly summon up her principle theme,
the absence of love. Nobody, she says, has remembered her birthday
for 18 years. Then, just as quickly, she gets to a secret that
haunts her existence. She describes herself crossing the potholed
street outside the gate of her school and shivering with the
realization that somebody is watching her. ``At some point as I was
growing up, these shivers became a regular occurrence in my life,
always caused by a pair of staring eyes,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   From there the story unfolds in hard and spare vignettes as she
blends China's recent political history, its poverty, and the
operations of its Kafkaesque bureaucracy with the private mysteries
that surround Ms. Hong's life. Most conspicuous among the mysteries
is the person who is stalking her, a person to whom Ms. Hong is
later introduced in a scene that she describes with chilly, cruel
acuity. There are other matters as well: a cloying belief that she
is what she calls a ``superfluous'' person, someone who does not
belong, not even to the family that raised her.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Hong excavates the family history, she experiences the
birth of eroticism, prompted by her infatuation with her high
school history teacher, who seems to represent for her both a tiny
island of integrity in a profoundly dishonest society and also the
tragic fate of those who occupy that island.
</P>
<P>
   As her account nears its end, several events of savage impact
take place, leaving Ms. Hong in a state of defiant nonfeeling. She
describes her own emotions, or lack of them, unapologetically, with
matter-of-fact, clinical precision: ``My mother never once kissed
me on the face; my father neither. Or my brothers and sisters.
Whenever I was kissed in a dream, I woke up screaming. . . . I
secretly indulged in dream kisses, proving that I was abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hong's book shares some of the sensibility of books by
Western women, from Marguerite Duras to Kathleen Harrison, that
have discussed taboo subjects. Her description of her first sexual
experience, and the longing that preceded it, perfectly capture the
intensity, the wonderment and the anguish of sex in a society that
has turned sensuality in general into a dark secret.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers hearing about a novel called ``The Heart of a
Girl'' that made its way into Chongqing and was swiftly deemed ``a
poisonous weed'' by the authorities. ``I just hope,'' she writes,
``there is a record kept somewhere of how many people went to
prison or were executed because of this book.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own book, a kind of echo of that other one, reminds us that
poverty is not only a lack of certain things but an overabundance
of them as well: of rats, smells, disease, of a perpetual
insecurity that gives a poisonous edge to human relations. Ms. Hong
writes unforgettable passages about the discomfort and humiliation
of a women's communal toilet; she talks about parasites, about
dwelling within a permanent urban ecological disaster area, about
an abortion clinic whose staff shows all the human sympathy of auto
mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the very end does one sense that the pain has
diminished. Ms. Hong becomes a writer, managing to escape from the
South Bank. The healing of her wounds is not so much a matter of
redemption, however, as it is a coming to terms, and it leaves
behind a residue of bitterness that seems to explain something
important about the inner lives of an entire generation of
educated, urban Chinese, the ones who mounted the vast
demonstrations at Tiananmen Square a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   As you read Ms. Hong's lacerating story, you feel that you have
entered into the deepest truths of a tormented psyche, and into the
truths as well of a bruised generation otherwise almost impossible
for us to know.

PUBLISHERS ROOT FOR MICHAEL JORDAN'S RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Ill.) 
(mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Michael Jordan retires from basketball sometime before the
lockout-shortened season begins, the fans will weep and the
networks will gnash their teeth in despair.
</P>
<P>
   But one sector of the population will cheer: Book publishers
will roll up their tweedy sleeves and shout with joy. Because while
the TNT and TBS networks, owned by Time Warner, sank $890 million
into a four-year contract to broadcast the National Basketball
Association's games and General Electric's NBC paid $1.75 billion,
and the fans waited patiently for the doors of Madison Square
Garden in New York to swing open, and the vendors and concession
workers and radio announcers stood by across the country, the book
publishing industry was waiting like an eager undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are especially high at the Random House unit of
Bertelsmann AG, which has invested heavily in two books: Jordan's
own book, ``For the Love of the Game: My Story,'' a lavish
coffee-table volume published by the Crown Books division last
fall, and David Halberstam's ``Playing for Keeps,'' which Random
House will publish on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Martin, associate publisher of Crown Books, said that if
Jordan retired, it would be the book-publishing equivalent of the
most thrilling buzzer-beater ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``His retirement will bump up sales,'' Martin said, ``and
combined with the season coming back, well, there's this great
second hit coming. There's a whole new selling picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin pointed out several places in ``For the Love of the
Game'' where Jordan discusses the possibility of retirement. The
book, Martin added, is ``his final word about his pleasure and love
for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vancil, the outside editor of the book and the president of
Rare Air Inc., a Chicago publishing company described on the jacket
of ``For the Love of the Game'' as ``the exclusive provider of
Michael Jordan publishing properties,'' said there was no doubt
that Jordan's retirement was a factor the publishers had considered
and, in fact, counted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea from early on was that we were not going to release
this book until he was retiring,'' Vancil said. ``When we sat down
and decided whether or not to make this a fall book, I sat down
with Michael and explained the reality of it to him. I said, `This
is the situation. This is your career retrospective.' And he said,
`Go ahead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's retirement and any subsequent sales jump would be
important news for Crown, which printed 700,000 copies of the book,
which sells for $50. Despite the book's short-lived best-seller
status, Barnes &AMP; Noble has reported that ``For the Love of the
Game'' has still not sold according to Crown's high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the six-month NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all expecting their season to go ahead, and there was
this lockout, this strike,'' Martin said. ``At first, we weren't as
concerned because the book was larger than life. Then, as things
waned and we got into December, everybody was thinking, `Darn.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was the nagging problem of publicity. During the lockout,
Jordan did not promote the book, or as Martin put it, ``He hasn't
said boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Another financial drain for Crown is the cost of producing the
book: It was printed on specially created paper (``100(NU) rare air
gloss text'') and manufactured in the United States by the same
printers who print brochures for Rolls-Royce. (Shipping finished
books from overseas, where glossy American books are usually
printed because of cheaper prices, would have meant transporting
them by freighter, so they would not have been available for the
start of the season.)
</P>
<P>
   But expectations are also high at Random House for Halberstam's
``Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made.''
Halberstam finished work on the manuscript in December. His editor,
Scott Moyers, said Random House wanted to publish the book ``sooner
than later.'' In fact, there was not even time to print the
traditional bound galleys for reviewers; they received bound
manuscripts instead.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perry, director of publicity for the Random House imprint,
said Random House chose to publish quickly, ``knowing that Jordan
would likely have this decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's books about sports _ ``The Summer of '49,''
``October 1964,'' ``The Breaks of the Game'' and ``The Amateurs'' _
have all been best sellers and have outsold his other books, like
``The Powers That Be,'' with which he made his reputation as an
author.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he had thought carefully about the timing of the book
and Jordan's possible retirement. ``If he plays, it's only because
it's a short season,'' Perry said. ``It's not like he's going to
keep going. It's almost happenstance. The career, as wonderful as
it is, is pretty much done.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam _ who will tour the country for a month promoting the
book, starting with an appearance on ``The Today Show'' _ said he
would personally prefer to see Jordan play another season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is an industry in his own, and he coins side
industries, and book publishing is certainly one of them,''
Halberstam said, adding that Jordan's retirement was not the reason
he wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, in my early teens, there was no NBA,'' he
said. ``The significant heroes in sports were white baseball
players. The idea that later in my life, the single most celebrated
athlete in America, a man who went to a college that he could not
have gone to when I was a reporter in Vietnam, who is the best
salesman in this country and in the world _ that's the equation you
would want to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the retirement I am utterly immune to. You really can't
worry. What will the strike do? What will retirement do? Does it
help, or hurt? I just can't care.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world apparently sailed through the first days of 1999 with
only scattered mistakes by computers confused by the approaching
Year 2000 _ an outcome that added to growing optimism about the
chances of avoiding widespread disruptions 51 weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions to new years are always a bug-ridden time for
information managers, because some devices and programs do not
automatically adjust calendars. But computer users had feared that
the advent of this year might be rougher than usual because many
computer programs look a full 52 weeks ahead and so would be
encountering dates in 2000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports filtered in about mixups with taxi meters, with
accounting software that spewed out faulty bills or _
alternatively, failed to issue valid ones _ and similar glitches.
But the disruptions seemed to be isolated, quickly handled and in
some cases not really linked to the 2000 date at all. Year 2000
experts were especially impressed that the financial sector had
fared so well, despite having also committed huge computing
resources to the introduction of the euro, the new European
currency that began trading last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points to the likelihood of a few hellish days rather than
big failures next year,'' said Ian Hayes, president of Clarity
Consulting, who advises large multinational clients from his base
in South Hamilton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the longtime use of just two
digits to refer to the year, and the inability of some computers to
recognize 00 as 2000. Some computers mistake 00 for 1900 while
others, programmed to expect steadily higher numbers in their
two-digit year data, cannot read 00 at all and shut down or revert
to some earlier date.
</P>
<P>
   Another uncertainty last week was whether some computers using
two-digit dates might be tripped up by programs that had used the
digits 99 to mean ``end of file,'' ``shut down'' or some other
message having nothing to do with dates. That practice was used as
a shortcut by an unknown number of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the 99 problem is a serious threat. For
one thing, the use of two or more 9s as an end-of-file signifier
within date programs is relatively rare. And even where it does
exist, it is typically easy to locate. In any case, although some
had warned that this last week was also a danger zone, Sept. 9,
1999, is seen as the most likely minefield of 9s.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most widely reported glitches last week turned
out to be 99 problems, not failures to handle 2000. Taxis in
Singapore, for example, were unable to run their meters for several
hours on Jan. 1. And some in Stockholm _ to the delight of Swedes
out celebrating the New Year _ were unable to switch to higher
fares authorized for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler Corp. discovered on Jan. 1 that a program in its
regional data centers that helps run auto production had a 99
problem that could be fixed by the same patch the company was
planning to install later this quarter to deal with a Year 2000
defect. So Chrysler rushed the patching job through, and no
disruptions were suffered, according to Roger Buck, head of the
company's Year 2000 project.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said it encountered four minor glitches,
including a commodities accounting program that would not allow it
to schedule a metals payment in the Year 2000. It turned out that
all four defects had been identified by Goldman's code scanners and
would have been scheduled to be eliminated anyway by program fixes
set for this spring. ``I feel good about that, but it doesn't mean
we are going to cut back on our contingency planning or other Year
2000 work,'' said Leslie Tortora, the firm's chief technology
officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As expected, government computers in Washington and in several
states were unable to sign people up for unemployment benefits
using standard forms, which set a date one year ahead as the end of
the benefits. But, as previously planned, those agencies continued
to sign people up for the benefits last week by plugging in Dec.
31, 1999, as the ending dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create a nightmare of paperwork to rework these if it
goes on for long, but most systems should be ready for Year 2000
dates by the end of this quarter,'' said Howard Waddell, a Labor
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year
2000 Conversion, said the unemployment benefit scramble underscored
the need to plan for breakdowns well in advance. He said he was
worried that last week's calm might encourage local governments and
small businesses to settle on ``wait until it breaks'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems Products in Bohemia, N.Y., was one company
that paid a price for not paying attention in time. One of three
companies that supplies automobile emission-testing equipment for
use in New York state, Environmental Systems was surprised to
discover that equipment it had been phasing out could not produce a
00 windshield sticker for drivers whose vehicles had passed
inspection. Stickers in New York use two digits for the month and
two digits for the year to indicate the expiration date for an
emissions validation.
</P>
<P>
   The 00 sticker should have started appearing Dec. 22 because New
York motorists get a grace period of eight days for their one-year
validations. But the older Environmental Systems equipment printed
out stickers saying 91 instead, and many inspection stations simply
put them on car windows. Parking agents promptly began ticketing
the apparently out-of-date cars.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Systems quickly reported the problem to the state
and procedures were set up to quash the tickets, but the crash
effort to complete the transition to newer equipment that issues 00
stickers was not completed until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost a lot of money,'' said James Richardson, the company's
director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, the consultant, cautions ``there are a hundred problems
for every one reported.'' And he and others also warn that
companies with a faulty program creating bad data may not realize
it yet. Nevertheless, after this first week of the Year 2000
shakedown cruise, Hayes said it was hard not to see the results as
good news.

<P>
   Other than the stamp, about the only thing a letter has over an
e-mail message is the idiosyncratic swirls of the sender's John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   This fact was not lost on H. Lee Browne, a venture capitalist
turned entrepreneur, who was determined to find a way to attach a
personal signature to an e-mail message. With his new service,
Signature-mail.com, visitors to his World Wide Web site can request
a form, which they use to fax Browne as many as 25 versions of
their penmanship. Minutes later, they receive their writing back in
digital form, for easy inclusion in e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in e-mail is we all love it and think it's
great, but the fact is, it's eventually going to look a lot more
like paper mail,'' said Browne, who is offering the
signature-digitalization service free. ``We can't go on with it
looking all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the inherent danger is that someone might take
somebody else's digital signature and use it inappropriately. But
Browne stressed the security of his company's computer system, and
the fact that, ``just like if I find your signature in a trash can,
I can't use it to legally bind a document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing legally binding about this sort of
signature,'' he continued. ``This is definitely not
authentication.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Browne said, he had received expressions of interest from
banks and others about possible commercial applications of his
software.

   Intel and Compaq Dispute One Year 2000 Bug Theory
</P>
<P>
   Moving to debunk theories of a supposed Year 2000-related bug
known as the Crouch-Echlin effect, Intel and Compaq Computer, two
of the computer world's heavyweights, said last week that their own
extensive tests had found no evidence of such a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could dampen fears that were first stirred in 1997
by Internet postings from Jace Crouch, a history professor in
Michigan, and Michael Echlin, a Canadian programmer, who reported
that the clocks on some computers could jump randomly forward or
backward in time after the year 2000. The jumps occurred at the
instant the computers were turned on, but not on every occasion,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The purported problem, also known as time dilation, received new
currency last summer after a manager at Compaq's Year 2000
Expertise Center in Albany, N.Y., said that testing there had
confirmed it. Time dilation was said to affect primarily older
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Echlin proposed that the problem could arise from design flaws
in how the basic input/output system, or BIOS, chip retrieved the
time and date from a computer's real-time clock, a battery-driven
chip that keeps track of time even when the computer is off. Most
software on stand-alone personal computers relies on the BIOS for
time and date.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts had consistently dismissed the time-dilation
reports, saying faulty components rather than design bugs were
undoubtedly responsible for the reported date jumps. They were
stunned, and big corporate computer users were worried, by the
seeming confirmation from Compaq's Albany unit, which had just been
acquired in Compaq's merger with Digital Equipment Corp. The Albany
center also said it would sell diagnostic and repair tools
developed by Echlin.
</P>
<P>
   As criticism filtered back to Compaq's headquarters in Houston,
both Compaq, the leading PC maker, and Intel, the leading PC-chip
producer, set out to methodically search for the Crouch-Echlin
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's testing was especially extensive. And the company said
last week that although it could not completely rule out the
existence of time dilation, it had disproved all reported
hypotheses for how the anomaly could occur. The company also said
its tests included one machine provided by Echlin and had used his
diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, meanwhile, revised its Year 2000 site
(www.compaq.com/year2000/year2000-qa.html) to say it would no
longer sell the Echlin tools. But Echlin is not ready to concede.
He said that while he had not yet seen the new research, evidence
continued to trickle in that post-2000 time dilation occurs, albeit
rarely.

   Executive Musical Chairs at Shopping.com, Again
</P>
<P>
   It sounded drastic _ the third management team in nine months.
But for Shopping.com, an Internet retailing company, it was more
like business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The company said last week that Randall Read, an executive from
the packaging industry, would replace Shopping.com's chairman,
Frank Denny, who is becoming president and chief executive. Denny,
in turn, was replacing John Markley.
</P>
<P>
   According to Denny, Markley resigned to spend more time in the
family cabinet business. Markley had arrived in June to replace
Robert McNulty, who was president and chief executive before
leaving for undisclosed reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest shuffle, Denny, Shopping.com's founder, will take
over day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping.com, which sells housewares, sporting goods, computer
supplies, electronic gadgets and more, was initially backed by Bill
Gross, the financier who has ``incubated'' dozens of Internet
businesses through his company Idealab.
</P>
<P>
   Catching the wave of investor enthusiasm for electronic
commerce, Shopping.com's initial public offering in November 1997
was an instant success, starting at $9 a share and soon trading as
high as $39.
</P>
<P>
   But things soured. The Securities and Exchange Commission
suspended trading of Shopping.com shares for two weeks in March,
though trading resumed after the SEC found no wrongdoing by
executives of Shopping.com. But in September, an arbitration panel
of the National Association of Securities Dealers fined the
company's underwriter, Waldron &AMP; Co., on the grounds that it had
inflated Shopping.com's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Corona Del Mar, Calif., has had trouble
filling customer orders, and dozens of customers have filed
complaints with numerous consumer protection agencies. Denny
attributes these problems to an overly ambitious marketing campaign
that generated more sales than the company could handle. It grew
from $40,000 in daily sales in June to $300,000 a day by October.
After scaling back, the company now does about $100,000 in sales a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping.com's shares, having dipped below $1 each last
September, closed Friday at $13.1875, up 68.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Denny said the company was now intent on rebuilding its daily
sales volume, though more gradually than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a power center on the Web, a sort of
CompUSA, Home Depot and Wal-Mart,'' Denny said. But first, given
the recent upheavals, he may be busy building a power center in the
executive suite.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: An extraordinary Medicare reform proposal was unveiled
last week by a federal commission, but it didn't get the attention
it deserved because of the country's preoccupation with
presidential impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel proposed to replace the system of government
paying separately for each Medicare service with a program offering
a fixed payment to each beneficiary with which to buy private
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach also would provide for prescription drug
coverage, the lack of which is perceived as one of Medicare's
greatest shortcomings. The commission's chairman, John Breaux,
Democratic senator from Louisiana, said coverage of prescriptions
was necessary because ``drugs are as important today as a hospital
bed was in 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan panel, with Bill Thomas, a House Republican from
California, as co-chairman, fashioned an alternative akin to the
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. This program covers
millions of government workers, including members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Under the commission proposal, according to The New York Times,
Medicare beneficiaries could choose from a wide range of
health-care insurance plans, including those provided by health
maintenance organizations. They would be allowed to change plans
once a year.
</P>
<P>
   While the proposal's supporters say competition among
health-care insurers would restrain costs, not everyone agreed. One
commission member with extensive experience in Medicare management
called this rationale ``total fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's fantasy or not, such an approach is no more
fantastic than the prevailing assumption that taxpayers can finance
forever carte blanche access to the medical-care demands of an
increasing cohort of senior citizens living ever-longer lives.
Throw in the scientific advances capable of extending life by
increasingly expensive means, regardless of the quality of the
resulting life, and Medicare's current approach is beyond fantasy.
It's a long-term economic impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic problems with Medicare. One, it depends on
finite economic resources to finance it. Moreover, it is a
one-size-fits-all program that is woefully unresponsive to the
needs of many beneficiaries. Failure to cover prescription drugs
for most Medicare clients is the most obvious example of this
systemic defect.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of reform involving market discipline decry the
inevitability of rationing, but their protests miss the point that
rationing has already begun. Whenever Medicare mandates
increasingly stringent reimbursement schedules for health-care
providers, this is rationing. While it may be imposed on providers,
it sooner or later affects the quality of care of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   As the gap between Medicare tax revenue and the cost of benefits
demanded widens, more rationing will become necessary and its
harmful effects will become increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this proposal is the best solution remains to be seen.
The only thing known for sure is that the current system is
collapsing under its own weight, and government isn't, by its very
nature, geared to deal with the challenge in a rational manner.

   NEW YORK _ Who is that sleek young time bomb of a man? At
moments, he seems as frightened and helpless as a 4-year-old who
has lost his parents at the fair; at other times, he is the soul of
patrician urbanity, your ideal white-tie dinner partner. Then the
eruptions come in nasty bolts of anger. And they aren't half as
scary as when his face freezes into a grim, affectless mask. What
is he called again? Oh, right. Nero.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Nero, the Roman emperor whose name has become a byword
for cruel and unusual despotism, and who, as embodied by Toby
Stephens, is holding compellingly tormented sway over the Majestic
Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the second of two
imports from the Almeida Theater of London.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the familiar full-blown tyrant with violin that
Stephens is portraying in the crackling production of Jean Racine's
``Britannicus'' that opened on Friday night. It's something far
more intriguing: a man-boy on the cusp of monsterhood, someone who,
in the course of the evening, will take that last step into a state
beyond moral redemption.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to look far to see what propels him there: It's
Mom, of course, the scheming, power-hungry Agrippina, and she is
played to a savory fare-thee-well by Diana Rigg. This fine actress
would have seemed to have provided the last word on strangulating
maternal figures in her sublimely creepy performance in the
television drama ``Mother Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, she offers an equally forceful portrait that is
also much more nuanced. Under the direction of Jonathan Kent, Ms.
Rigg and Stephens perform a mother-and-son duet that works both as
enjoyable political soap opera and unsettling psychological
portraiture, kindling the histrionic sparks that are oddly absent
from their teamwork in Racine's ``Phedre,'' which runs in repertory
with ``Britannicus'' through Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that ``Britannicus'' has been allotted only four
performances (the remaining two are on Thursday and Friday) to
``Phedre's'' 10 during the Almeida's visit to the academy. You can
understand the logic. ``Phedre'' is a known quantity, at least to
anyone who took introductory French literature, and the title role,
essayed here by Ms. Rigg, has been a testing ground for great
actresses for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Almeida's ``Phedre'' is crippled by a palpable awareness
on the part of its creators that they're tackling something big,
with an attendant stiffness that isn't entirely offset by Ms.
Rigg's viscera-twisting performance. In contrast, all involved in
this ``Britannicus'' exude a relaxed, pleasurable confidence.
They're having a fine old time. Undoubtedly you will, too, while
getting to know, under the best possible circumstances, a play that
doesn't deserve its obscurity among English-speaking audiences.
</P>
<P>
   What a play it is: a piano-wire-taut piece of work that obeys
the Aristotelian unities while opening windows onto all sorts of
levels of contemplation. Although it deals with the corrosive
effects of obsessive love found throughout Racine, it is far less
monolithic than usual in its approach. ``Phedre,'' as the poet Paul
Valery noted, turns into a monologue in the memory. ``Britannicus''
is a concert of voices vying for dominance, none of which are as
one-note as you might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   It's as entertaining a tale of Roman decadence and cut-throat
politics as Robert Graves' ``I, Claudius,'' but it resists turning
its characters into mere players in a sinister chess game of good
and evil. The motives of the power jockeys in ``Britannicus''
aren't entirely clear even to themselves. Alliances are
untrustworthy precisely because human personality is so fluid.
Anyone following the current breakneck reversals in the real-life
drama of the American presidency will have no difficulty giving
credence to the ever-shifting world of ``Britannicus.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Racine's great inspiration, in reshaping accounts from
the annals of Tacitus, to present a fledgling emperor who had not
yet become the eponymous Nero of legend. The 22-year-old has ruled
Rome for only six months when the play opens, and he is just
starting to bristle under the control of Agrippina, whose
machinations landed him on the throne at the expense of his rival
and stepbrother, Britannicus (Kevin McKidd).
</P>
<P>
   Nero especially resents his mother's having arranged the
engagement of Britannicus to the chaste and exquisite Junia (Joanna
Roth), and has had the girl made a prisoner in the imperial palace.
This political move is complicated by the emperor's response on
having seen Junia for the first time. As he tells one of his
tutors, Narcissus (Julian Glover), ``Nero is in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens does a lot with that simple line, inflecting it with a
combination of regal arrogance and embarrassment. He and Kent
consistently and effectively emphasize Racine's idea of Nero at a
crossroads. His divided potential, to become an honorable leader
and a self-indulgent tyrant, are embodied by his two advisers, the
canny but virtuous Burrus (David Bradley) and the devious
Narcissus, both persuasively portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is, from the outset, an unhinged quality to this Nero
that the intoxication of power is pushing toward sadism. It's all
in the text, but Stephens taps it with flair, as in his quivering
description of his first vision of Junia. What clearly attracts
him, more than anything else, is her state of distress. And you are
always aware of his profound ambivalence toward his mother, to whom
he remains, to his shame, infinitely susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rigg has chosen to play Agrippina not as a vengeful serpent
but as the ultimate politician, a brisk, unflinching pragmatist
with an outsize ego, and the decision works wonderfully. There's a
touch of both Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Rodham Clinton to her
Roman matron, clad in Maria Bjornson's Chanel-like ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is someone who has mastered the rules of the game and knows
just when to intimidate and when to cajole, plying her majestic
alto voice in ways that brook no argument. She accomplishes the
considerable trick of showing when she is wounded without ever
displaying signs of weakness. For all her self-admiration, she is
not a deluded woman, either, and Ms. Rigg makes it believable when
Agrippina becomes the voice of the conscience of history, which
will condemn her son in the centuries to come.
</P>
<P>
   The dead-on look of the show by Ms. Bjornson and lighting
designer Mark Henderson suggests an Italian fascist version of the
corridors of Buckingham Palace. Ms. Bjornson and Kent make terrific
use of a set of giant fish tanks, metaphors for both entrapment and
the dauntingly public nature of its characters' lives. In the
evening's most potent image, Nero hides behind one of those tanks,
his face visible to the audience through the water as a melting
mask, as he watches an encounter between Junia and Britannicus.
</P>
<P>
   As the naive victims of a corps of arch manipulators, Ms. Roth
and McKidd have thankless roles, but they play them with an
energetic agitation that makes their inevitable fates the more
tragic. And Barbara Jefford, looking like an elegant Miss Marple as
Agrippina's confidante, is a nicely restrained foil to Ms. Rigg's
grandeur while clearly cut from the same cynical cloth. All of the
cast, for the record, is utterly at ease with Robert David
MacDonald's first-rate rhymed translation, its artificiality coming
to feel like the natural language of a courtly society.
</P>
<P>
   As in much of Racine, the most spectacularly dramatic moments
take place offstage, but you never feel cheated by only hearing
about them. Kent creates the tense, calculating atmosphere of
candidates at a presidential convention waiting in a private
chamber as their fates are decided outside. There is a regal
staircase, revealed only in the play's second half, at the back of
the stage, with steps leading to an unseen room where a murder
takes place that will change the course of an empire.
</P>
<P>
   By the play's end, that room, we are told, has become a scene of
grotesque chaos. Agrippina's response to the description of that
scene, as impeccably rendered by Ms. Rigg, says everything about
the world she inhabits. She is appalled and, in some way, broken,
but there is also some cold internal mechanism that clicks on and
allows her to start assessing the damage and think about tidying
up. It is, in other words, politics as usual.

HDTV SET PRICES ARE FALLING, BUT CONSUMERS REMAIN SCARCE
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Nev.) 
(ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If the consumer electronics industry can be counted
on for one thing, it is that the prices of their products will
plummet, even when that may not be in the best interests of the
companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with high-definition television. Just two months after
the transition to digital broadcasting began, one company
exhibiting new products here at the annual Consumer Electronics
Show is offering an HDTV for $2,999, less than half the cost of the
cheapest set the industry was selling in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies announced plans to sell HDTV's in that
price range by the end of the year, leaving some executives worried
that the industry, among the least profitable in the United States,
is once again digging a hole for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a question of how much we want prices to come down,''
said Howard Stringer, the chief executive of the Sony Corp. of
America. ``We still have to sell'' conventional, analog television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association, which sponsors the show, announced Friday that his
member companies sold 13,176 HDTV's to dealers in the last months
of 1998, and retailers said the companies had not been able to
produce enough sets to meet demand. The figure surprised most
people at the show. Before the announcement, Saul Shapiro, a vice
president for ABC, had said he thought ``a few hundred people
across the country'' were watching his network's high-definition
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising or not, 13,176 is a tiny fraction of the nation's
television business. Last year, Americans bought more than 27
million conventional television sets. And Stephen Nickerson, a vice
president with Toshiba America Consumer Products, noted, ``No
matter how many digital televisions are sold, analog set sales
cannot go down'' because ``digital sales are not going to pay the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   From every corner of the television industry, company executives
and government officials have been urging the manufacturers to drop
their prices _ and fast, so the transition to digital broadcasting
can pick up speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital television must be affordable if consumers are going
to embrace it,'' Susan Ness, a member of the Federal Communications
Commission, said at the convention. And Peter Smith, a vice
president for NBC, echoed that, saying his network needed ``a clear
expectation and confidence that someday everyone will be able to
afford an HDTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Those comments, and others like them, resulted from the product
announcements that had been made in the months before the show.
Every mainstream manufacturer but one was offering giant,
rear-projection high-definition television sets that cost $7,000 to
$12,000. The holdout was Sony, which is selling a table-top HDTV
with a picture tube for $9,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies showing their wares indicated that the
landscape would change drastically later this year. By the
Christmas shopping season, when most televisions are sold, several
manufacturers will be selling ``direct-view'' HDTV sets, the ones
with picture tubes, for $3,000 to $5,000, executives with the
companies say. These table-top sets will not be able to offer a
picture as a clear and sharp as the big ones, but they will still
look far better than conventional analog televisions.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Hitachi, is already selling an HDTV of sorts for
$2,999, although to receive HDTV, a buyer would also need a digital
tuner box, which by midyear will be on sale for about $700. The
company says the 36-inch, direct-view model offers sufficient
resolution to qualify as an HDTV. But Hitachi's model has a
traditional, square picture tube. To qualify officially as an HDTV
under the industry's guidelines, a set must have a wide screen.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, by the end of this year, many other companies say
they will be offering wide-screen table-top HDTV's at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub. While $3,000 is notably more appealing than
$7,000 or more _ the industry already sells hundreds of thousands
of conventional sets for about $3,000 _ it is still far more than
most people are willing to spend for a television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the price needs to be about 1.5 times the cost of an
analog set'' for mass sales to begin, said John W. Strobel, the
vice president for digital television marketing at Philips
Electronics N.V., the nation's second-largest seller of
televisions. And right now, most analog sets sell for $250 to
$1,500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some manufacturers say they fear that many
consumers will view a $3,000 high-definition television as simply
an over-priced set, not an irrelevant piece of esoterica, as the
$8,000 HDTV's are generally regarded now. And, the manufacturers
add, American consumers are well trained by decades of experience
to understand that a consumer-electronic product costing $3,000
this year will almost certainly cost $1,500 next year. So they will
wait.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the fear pervading the industry. Once the new,
lower-priced HDTV's reach the showrooms later this year, American
consumers will begin taking notice. They will decide to buy an
HDTV, but after the price falls even further. And in the meantime,
they will not buy anything else _ analog or digital _ giving the
industry a disastrous year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives have been hoping for a seamless transition
that when graphed, looks like an X as the sale of digital sets
climbs at the same rate as the sale of analog sets falls. But some
companies, hoping to use the transition to gain a greater market
share, are cutting prices faster than the others had bargained for,
threatening that development.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives had worried that they would have faced this
situation already. But the industry actually sold 6 percent more
television sets in 1998 than the year before _ the largest number
of them at the end of the year, after the first high-definition
sets had gone on sale. This suggests that most consumers have not
yet taken serious notice of high-definition television.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bitterly cold air will arrive across the Great Lakes and
Northeast on Monday in the wake of a cold front departing the
Atlantic seaboard. Residual moisture behind the front will cause
snow flurries to linger across the mountains of New England.
Farther east, gusty winds from the northwest drying on descent from
the Appalachians will squelch clouds, causing abundant sunshine
along the northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as cold air gathers heat and moisture on transit over
the unfrozen Great Lakes, snow squalls will affect areas downwind
of the lakes. Over 6 inches of fresh snow could accumulate in
Michigan's upper peninsula and the snow belts east of Lake Erie and
Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   After a clear and cold start, sinking air currents associated
with high pressure will promote sunny conditions over the Southeast
on Monday, including northern Florida. A jet-stream disturbance
crossing the tepid waters off south Florida could spawn a few
showers near the southeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   An ``Alberta clipper'' low, which is a fast-moving low-pressure
system originating in the province of Alberta, will cross the
northern Plains on Monday. The low will bring a swath of snow from
North Dakota to Illinois, though a modicum of moisture and the
system's rapid movement will preclude heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the west will direct warm air to the front
range of the Rockies on Monday with noticeably milder conditions
streaming into the southern Plains and Texas. Onshore breezes will
promote showers near the northwest coast Monday. Fog will still
plague much of the Central Valley, with cirrus clouds dimming the
sun at times elsewhere in California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: California Contrasts
</P>
<P>
   Paso Robles, Calif., experienced record extremes in temperature
on Saturday without a cloud in the sky. The day dawned calm with a
record minimum of 21 degrees, breaking a 50-year-old record by 1
degree. An active breeze from the east developed at midday and this
helped to raise the afternoon temperature to a record 74 degrees,
eclipsing a record set in 1962. The 53-degree change in one day at
Paso Robles is more than some sections of the California coast see
in six months and is also indicative of the dry air mass that has
migrated to the central California shores.

PASSION AND MOONLIGHT, WITH FOOTNOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In classical music, it often seems, all roads lead to
Beethoven. Two such paths converged last week when Jeffrey Siegel
and Ruth Laredo, pianists and commentators, turned their efforts to
that German master.
</P>
<P>
   Talk from the stage has become commonplace in recent years, if
not during concerts themselves then in the form of preconcert
lectures, as musical institutions strive to sustain or build on
current audiences. Commentary is increasingly seen as a way to
bridge the gap between listener and performer, and to compensate
for cutbacks in educational resources among the public. But the
pianists at hand began supplementing their performances with chat
long before it became fashionable to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, who is in his 12th season of Keyboard Conversations at
the 92nd Street Y, gave a rationale for the practice at the start
of his program, ``Beethoven Forever,'' on Wednesday evening. The
conversation is intended to make the listening experience more
meaningful, he said, ``something more enriching than a mere wash of
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of ``musical too much,'' he added, with masterpieces
often taken for granted, ``one needs to learn to listen to that
which one hears.'' Accordingly, he provides a brief analysis of a
composition, complete with musical examples, before playing it
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laredo, who is in her 11th season of Concerts With
Commentary at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, seemed less
interested in providing detailed musical insight on Friday evening
than in creating an atmosphere. Her commentary consisted of a
reading of biographical information that might just as well have
been printed in the program, except on the theory, perhaps, that
the material sinks in better when administered aurally and that the
process enhances the connection between performer and listener.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laredo's little lectures and performances, one as formal as
the other, remained distinct. Siegel, despite a certain stiffness
of manner, established a more relaxed setting for the listener
while making greater demands on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Public speaking, performance and analysis all demand different
types of concentration, which don't mix easily. Every longtime
listener has undoubtedly seen performers who, having delivered
detailed explanations of what they were about to play, proved
unable to play it, as if stumbling over feet watched too closely in
the act of walking.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel did remarkably well at all this, not only speaking but
also playing from memory, even as he extracted a voice from the
texture or showed how a particular turn or cadence might have
progressed differently. The demonstrations were illuminating,
although they tended to continue into the performances, with Siegel
making many of the same points again in exaggerated fashion, mildly
distorting the flow of the music and occasionally tripping
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, he gave interesting expositions and reasonably
persuasive performances of three Beethoven bagatelles as well as
two sonatas: the ``Pathetique'' and the late E major (Op. 109).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laredo was less compelling on both counts. She opened with
the ``Moonlight'' Sonata (the famous first movement only),
presumably trying to set a mood but instead establishing a tone:
one of perfunctoriness, which was furthered by a late program
change, with the lofty Opus 101 Sonata dropped from the end.
</P>
<P>
   Her survey of Beethoven's life thus seemed oddly inconclusive,
trailing off with the ``Appassionata'' Sonata (Op. 57). The
performances of that work and of the early C major Sonata (Op. 2,
No. 3), though unmingled with significant analysis, suffered
occasional slips of hand or memory but were basically sound and
shapely.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from audience turnout and response, it is clear that
these series, seemingly similar but in fact quite disparate, have
developed loyal and appreciative followings. Whether they serve any
larger function in building audiences for classical music is an
open question but one that need not concern these performers. In
carving out valued niches for themselves, they have done enough.

   TOKYO _ In a wood-paneled room rich with Persian carpets in the
sedate Bunkyo-ku district, Sawako Noma, 55, sat forward as she
offered a visitor coffee. Wearing a neat gray suit with knee-length
skirt, her short hair neatly coiffured, her crossed ankles leading
to sensible low heels, Mrs. Noma looked to be the prototypical
Japanese housewife: demure, gracious, unprepossessing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what Mrs. Noma was until 1987, when her husband
died and she took over the reins of Kodansha Ltd., Japan's largest
publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no editorial experience, no schooling in business,'' she
said. Her resume bears out her words. The first entry, after higher
education (Seisen Women's University) reads: June 1987 _ President
and CEO, Kodansha Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   She is, some say, the Katharine Graham of Japan's media
industry. The busts &UR;  &LR;  guarding the fireplace in the guest room of
the corporate headquarters are those of her grandfather, Seiji
Noma, who started the company in 1909, and her grandmother who ran
the company for a time. But to make the analogy complete, one might
have to throw in Random House for good measure. As head of
Kodansha, Mrs. Noma reigns over an empire of 1,173 employees, 54
magazines, a newspaper, and book companies in Japan, the United
States and Europe that published 2,576 new titles in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Like her counterpart at The Washington Post, Mrs. Noma met with
some resistance when she assumed power. ``Kodansha tends to attract
some very smart, very arrogant, very hidebound people _ extremely
well-paid men who see themselves as creme de la creme,'' said a
publishing executive who insisted on not being identified. ``There
was a tremendous war _ rather like the Heike-Genji war,'' he said,
referring to Japan's 12th-century civil war. ``The Nomas had become
weak, because there was no male heir ready to assume power.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Noma graciously but firmly skirted any suggestion of
rebellion, saying only, ``I think everybody thought the president
had to be a man.'' But she said her son, Yoshinibu, was only 18
years old at the time, a university freshman. ``I didn't want to
sacrifice his youth,'' she said, adding that she wanted him and her
three daughters to be able to experience life and make their own
mistakes. At the same time, she felt a sense of duty to the family.
``It was my obligation to become president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to her speak, it is clear that she also relished the
chance to break out of her sheltered existence. ``My curiosity was
stronger than any fear,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say anything,'' Mrs. Noma recalled of her first year
on the job. ``I just watched and found out how things were run.
Then I started making suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her suggestions have won her respect inside and outside her
company, and business analysts credit her with Kodansha's success.
(In 1996, World Business, an Asian business magazine, selected her
as one of the world's 50 most prominent businesswomen). In the
decade since she has taken over, Kodansha has solidified its
position as the No. 1 publishing company in Japan. Corporate sales
in 1997 topped 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion) _ a 32 percent
increase over 1987, and a quite respectable figure considering that
Japan has been in recession for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   One of her first acts as president was to dump Penthouse Japan
from the company's magazine roster. She approved the addition of a
number of women's magazines to an already successful group. The new
ones are Voce (which concentrates on beauty with a clever ad
campaign featuring some of Japan's most unattractive personalities,
all made up), Vivi (aimed at women in their teens and 20s) and Mine
(for independent young women, single or just married).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese magazine business has been horrible since the
bubble burst,'' said Robert Kirschenbaum, president of Pacific
Press Service, a Tokyo photographers' agency. ``But the women's
magazines continue to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine stable _ which accounts for 64 percent of
Kodansha's sales _ is broad, ranging from the respected literary
magazine Gunzo, with a circulation of 20,000, to the comic magazine
Shonen, 400 pages of tales of wild-eyed sushi chefs and crazed
ninjas. Shonen is bought by 4.2 million preteen and teen-age boys
and girls each week.
</P>
<P>
   The book list is similarly varied, ranging from works by
literary luminaries like the Nobel laureates Yasunari Kawabata and
Kenzaburo Oe to children's books, including ``Totto-chan: The
Little Girl at the Window,'' which has sold 6.8 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Noma has also continued to expand Kodansha's global reach
by financing several literary awards _ including one for
translations of Japanese literature _ and by publishing works of
Japanese literature through Kodansha International and its
subsidiary, Kodansha America.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Noma's eldest daughter, Chikako Noma, who works as a senior
editor for Kodansha America in New York, noted that the
international division was more of a mission than a profit center.
The mission has met with considerable success. The division has
introduced English translations of the works of the Nobel laureates
as well as those by a younger writers, including ``Norwegian
Wood,'' by Haruki Murakami.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most surprising, under Sawako Noma, the editors at
Kodansha America have published original titles on American life,
several of which have made it to best-seller lists. ``Having Our
Say,'' the stories of Sarah and A. Elizabeth Delany, two black
sisters, sold 1.5 million copies and was on The New York Times
best-seller list for 35 weeks (hardcover) and 63 weeks (paperback,
published by Dell).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No Western publishers have achieved such bicultural success,
although the Japanese public has a voracious appetite for foreign
books.
</P>
<P>
   Sawako Noma and others point out that publishing is very
different in Japan from what it is in the rest of the world, and
the language barrier has proved to be a mighty fortress against
foreign incursion, as would-be interlopers like Rupert Murdoch have
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese publishers are also blessed with a public that is
almost 100 percent literate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, there are a limited number of people who can be
called readers,'' said Tetsu Shirai, deputy executive director of
Kodansha International who headed Kodansha America in the 1980s.
``In Japan, the ordinary citizen likes to read _ reading is seen as
entertainment and has been since the 16th and 17th centuries. In
America, there seems to be a psychological barrier for people to go
to a bookstore. Here, it isn't uncommon, even in the smallest of
towns, for people to set a date to meet at a bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Japanese publishers are worried. Sales show that
instead of buying books and magazines, young people are spending
their money on cellular phones and computer games. Kodansha and
other publishers are starting a campaign this spring to combat this
trend.
</P>
<P>
   And Sawako Noma signed off on the company's expansion into
animated movie and video productions, based on its cartoon
characters. ``Akira,'' which stars a big-eyed character by the same
name, became an instant classic, and ``Ghost in the Shell'' hit No.
1 in sales in its seventh week on the U.S. video charts in 1996.

AMAZON SURGE MAY REFLECT THE NEW MATH Of THE INTERNET 
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga.) 
(ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Amazon.com, the best seller that really mattered last week
was not a book title, but the company's stock. Whether it was
simply more Internet frenzy, or a further sign that online commerce
may require its own investment calculus, the company's shares had a
remarkable run last week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, an Internet bookseller which has yet to report a
profitable quarter since going public in May 1997, saw its share
price soar by nearly 50 percent in the first trading week of the
new year. Since the beginning of December, the stock price has
climbed about 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of last week's run-up came in response to news _ a stock
split, word of robust holiday sales of the company's books and
compact disks, and a deal to acquire a new warehouse. But mainly,
optimistic investors seemed willing to buy Amazon.com shares at any
price.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Friday, Amazon.com's total stock market value
surged past $30 billion, making it worth more than a major
industrial company like Texaco Inc. And even after some investors
had second thoughts, and the stock retreated sharply from its high
point, Amazon.com, with a market value of $25.4 billion, was still
worth more than the combined value of two leading retailers, J.C.
Penney and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon.com closed Friday at $160.25, up just $1.375
for the day, after trading as high as $199.125 earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this unrestrained enthusiasm despite the
company's lack of profit may reflect investors' appreciation for
Amazon.com's sales momentum and the value of its dominant position
as the leading electronic bookseller. Moreover, it comes as many
investors seem to be finding the shares of a variety of Internet
companies irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, Broadcast.com Inc., which provides video
and audio programs on the Internet, saw its shares soar $65.50, or
49.6 percent, to close at $197.50, after trading as high as $230.
In the absence of news that would justify such a surge, Nasdaq
officials asked the company to offer an explanation, but
Broadcast.com declined to provide one.
</P>
<P>
   In such a context, some Internet bears see more greed than logic
in the meteoric rise of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you explain this behavior?'' said Rick Berry, an
analyst in Atlanta with J.P. Turner &AMP; Co., who is advising
investors to sell Amazon.com's stock. ``It is avarice in its most
pure form. It's the greater fool theory, which is that someone buys
stock in the hope that someone is going to come from behind and buy
it for even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns may be expressed in a meeting expected Monday in
New York, where officials of the National Association of Securities
Dealers are to meet with securities industry executives to discuss
the recent volatility of many Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Berry predicted that last week's market surge in Amazon would
probably represent a buying climax, and he said he expected the
stock to start falling 30 to 50 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts see an underlying logic, even if it does not
conform to conventional investing theory.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's stock began booming in the first week of 1999
trading as investors anticipated the 3-for-1 stock split last
Tuesday. That same day, the Seattle-based company announced that
its fourth-quarter sales had quadrupled, to $250 million. The
company's electronic store drew more than a million new customers
in the peak holiday season when it started expanding its product
lines to include stuffed toys and personal electronics.
</P>
<P>
   That expansion impresses Derek Brown, a senior analyst with
Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco, who said investors were
speculating on the prospects for the company's movement into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon sale's have gone from nowhere to $250 million,'' said
Brown, who noted that their fourth-quarter sales exceeded his
expectations by 30 to 40 percent. ``They're on a run rate for a
billion dollars a year. That revenue used to be going to
traditional booksellers. I think Amazon is taking market share and
expanding the market, and the question is who are they taking
market share from?''
</P>
<P>
   The third-place Internet bookseller, the Borders Group, has
suffered from the view that the bookstore chain has not invested
aggressively enough in the Internet. Its new chief executive,
Philip M. Pfeffer, said in late December that the company needed to
start doing more to promote its activities on the Internet even as
it continued a rapid international expansion of superstores. Last
week, Borders said its online commerce effort is projected to post
a loss of 12 to 14 cents for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble has seen its own electronic store remain lodged
in the No. 2 spot and is also losing money. But the rich German
media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G. is its new partner in the
venture, and Bertelsmann's new chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff,
predicts that barnesandnoble.com will overtake Amazon sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barnes &AMP; Noble announced that its online sales in the
critical seven-week holiday period ending Jan. 2 rose to $17.8
million, nearly quadrupling 1997 sales in the similar period.
</P>
<P>
   But can the more traditional booksellers beat the upstart
Amazon.com in the publicity wars?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest reasons behind Amazon's success is
the fact that they do have brand momentum _ Amazon gets a
tremendous amount of free publicity,'' Brown said. ``Investors
could lose interest in them, but right now they are the dominant
E-commerce player and there is little to suggest that they won't be
dominant in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly last week, there seemed to be no limit to investor
enthusiasm for the future of Amazon.com. As of Sunday afternoon,
even its No. 3 and No. 5 best sellers seemed particularly apt:
``The Motley Fool's Rule Breakers, Rule Makers: A Foolish Guide to
Picking Stocks'' and ``How to Get Started in Electronic Day
Trading: Everything You Need to Know to Win in Wall Street's
Hottest Game.''

WB SUCCEEDS BY SERVING YOUTH ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Along with much of the audience and most of
the profit, the confidence bordering on arrogance that once
characterized the network television business has faded away this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is alive and well in at least one place, TV's youngest,
hippest and increasingly only upwardly mobile address: the upstart
would-be network known as WB &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to figures that make WB the only broadcast network to
demonstrate ratings growth this season, company executives view
themselves as already securely established as a legitimate fifth
network, on track to turning a profit within two years, and in
position to assume complete leadership among the youngest segment
of adult TV viewers within five years.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, the two top WB executives said, the network might
just even start scheduling more shows from Warner Brothers, the
studio owned by its parent company, Time Warner &UR;  &LR; _ if only the
studio starts making shows good enough and hip enough to squeeze
their way onto the roster that now includes such youth-oriented
hits as ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek'' and
``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Warner Brothers just has to do a better job'' developing shows
with the youthful skew that WB requires, said Jamie Kellner, the
chief executive of WB. Kellner and Susanne Daniels, the new
president of WB's entertainment division, spoke at a session of the
Television Critics' Association meeting here last week and in
separate interviews later.
</P>
<P>
   For WB, ``broadcasting'' is increasingly a misnomer because the
network is unflinchingly dedicated to never becoming too broad for
its own good. The model, as Kellner put it, is not what NBC &UR;  &LR; has
been for the last five years, the dominant network with a wide
range of viewers, nor even what Fox &UR;  &LR; would like to become, the
leader with a large adult group of viewers up to the age of 49.
</P>
<P>
   Radio is attractive as the new model, Kellner said, because
radio companies have done increasingly well on Wall Street despite
being highly fragmented and controlling extremely small slices of
audience.
</P>
<P>
   That looks to be the future of television networks as well, he
said, adding, ``If it's going to be a fragmented marketplace, make
sure the one you're hanging onto is the most valuable one in terms
of advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   As WB sees it, what advertisers want is youth, more youth and
nothing but youth, and the network is searingly focused on giving
them exactly that. Far from looking to expand its reach, to compete
for wider segments of viewers, Kellner said, WB would stick to its
youth orientation. ``Our goal is to remain with a median age under
30 years of age,'' he said. ``That is the long-term, set-in-stone
goal for this network.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one other goal when the network was established
four years ago by the Warner television studio was that it would
serve as the fallback distribution outlet for the programs the
studio makes. Warner Brothers was concerned about the increasing
effort by the networks that carried its programs, mostly NBC, owned
by General Electric Co., and ABC, &UR;  &LR; a unit of Walt Disney Co., to
fill their schedules with shows they themselves owned. Subsequent
schedules from those networks have begun to validate those
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner conceded that ``vertical integration is going to happen
in television,'' with networks relying more on shows delivered by
the studios with which they are aligned.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Warner Brothers will soon be restricted to
producing shows exclusively filled with characters in their teens
and early 20s?
</P>
<P>
   Barry M. Meyer, the executive vice president of Warner Brothers,
said he did not think so, because he could not envision a time when
a network would be totally vertically integrated, locking out shows
from any other studio. He conceded that the ``landscape has changed
a bit,'' with networks like NBC trying to compel studios to cede
ownership to them on every show scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are still producing older shows for CBS &UR;  &LR; and a lot of
shows for NBC,'' Meyer said. ``If there is a major shift in the
policies at these networks, then the whole industry is going to
have to be re-evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Warner Brothers is more than happy with the
success being built by WB, Meyer said. ``How could we not be
pleased?'' he asked. ``I don't think it's too strong a statement
that the WB is redefining the business in a way, both in its
economic model and the way they have niched themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the moment at least, WB is hardly a conduit for
Warner Brothers programs; only a few of its shows, and none of its
high-profile hits, are provided by the Warner's studio. Instead,
WB's schedule is dotted with shows supplied by the Warner Brothers
studio's main rivals, like Fox (``Buffy''), Disney &UR;  &LR; (``Felicity''),
Sony's Columbia unit (``Dawson's Creek'') and Aaron Spelling's
Spelling Entertainment Group (``Seventh Heaven'').
</P>
<P>
   The WB connection has proved to be a windfall for these studios
because in recent years shows on WB have sold re-run rights in
syndication for very high prices. Ms. Daniels noted that after its
first year, ``Buffy'' sold to the FX network for more than $1
million an episode.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said WB was under no obligation to favor Warner Brothers
shows. The network is a partnership of Time Warner, the Tribune Co.
television stations group and his own company, Acme Broadcasting.
``We're in this together,'' Kellner said, adding that if Time
Warner and Tribune are unhappy with WB's executives, ``they can
fire us if they want to,'' but that while they're in place ``we
operate the business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``in our first two years we got no cooperation from
the studio.'' Very few of the studio's producers generated programs
for WB. Since then, he said, ``more effort has been made.'' But he
said, ``Maybe there's a hex on us or something like that, but we've
not been able to break through yet with Warner Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner added: ``We always said we were going to put on the best
shows. It's their job to get some of their shows to be the best
shows.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Daniels said she expected more Warner shows to start
filtering to WB soon, after existing deals tying some of the best
Warner Brothers producers to NBC and ABC run their course. She
mentioned the team of Marta Kaufman, Kevin Bright and David Crane,
the creators of ``Friends''; Bruce Helford of ``The Drew Carey
Show'' and John Wells of ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the business is to make money,'' Kellner said,
describing the approach he believed Warner Brothers executives
should apply to WB. ``The younger you are in terms of the appeal of
your programs, the higher the value in syndication.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner contrasted WB's strategy for building a new network with
that of Fox, where Kellner worked during its ascension in the late
1980s and early 1990s. The mistake Fox eventually made, both he and
Ms. Daniels said, was to abandon its one-time identity as ``the
bad-boy network,'' as Ms. Daniels put it, in a quest to overtake
NBC for command of the broader age group favored by many
advertisers, viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said the push by Fox, a unit of News Corp., to acquire
rights to the National Football League was a mistake because it
signaled the end of a programming approach characterized by the
philosophy ``If you can see it somewhere else, it doesn't belong
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, football became hugely costly. ``The Fox network is not
profitable now,'' Kellner said,
</P>
<P>
   For Fox, of course, this analysis flies in the face of the
growth that acquiring football helped fuel, both in adding stronger
affiliated stations and in gaining wider credibility for Fox as a
full-fledged network.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kellner has a growing body of ratings results to back up
his arguments. Of the six networks now competing in prime time,
only WB has shown increases in viewing this year, about 10 percent
for the season. More important for WB, whose early success came
largely as a result of enormous viewing by teen-age girls, some of
the most significant increases have been among viewers who qualify
as young adults, those between the ages of 18 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said WB took in about $300 million in advance
commitments from advertisers last spring, and he predicted the
comparable figure will reach $450 million this year. Movie
advertisers, particularly, have flocked to WB shows, looking for
the young viewers that form the base audience for so many
contemporary films.
</P>
<P>
   So confidence _ yes, even arrogance _ is brimming over at WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are the No. 1 network 18 to 34, we'll probably be the
most profitable network in America,'' Kellner said. ``That's our
goal.''

<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Some days Avilio Guia likes to come and sit
outside the new Carlos III Market and watch the people coming and
going from dollar-only shops.
</P>
<P>
   He was a foreman on the construction team that built the mall a
year ago. Now, it is a world out of his reach. His government
salary is only 600 pesos a month, less than $30. He has no way to
earn hard currency and the shops inside accept nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never buy anything here,'' the 56-year-old builder
says, balancing the cheap cigar he bought in a government store in
his hardened hand and peering up at his work, at the abstract
sculptures hanging from the ceiling, the colored lights and the
corkscrew walkway lined with shops selling watches, televisions,
electronics, toys, jewelry. ``The people who shop here are mostly
people with relatives in the United States, or young women, who get
money one way or another from tourists,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the Soviet bloc collapsed and cut off Cuba's
lifeline of subsidies and aid, Cubans struggle to survive in a dual
economy, fueled in large part by money flowing from their greatest
enemy, the United States. Washington has maintained a 37-year
embargo on its nearest Caribbean neighbor but moved recently toward
marginally more contact, announcing last week that it would permit
payments from Cuban emigres and other Americans to increase.
</P>
<P>
   The once egalitarian island has evolved into a society of haves
and have nots, where schoolteachers and doctors supplement meager
state incomes with ingenious moonlighting known as ``inventando,''
or inventing. Hotel workers make far more than professionals. More
and more people are turning to illegal schemes, running gypsy cabs,
engaging in prostitution or in black-market sales of Cuba's famous
cigars, rum and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cubans have abandoned state jobs and opened small
businesses under new rules allowing self-employment, in the faint
hope of earning more than they did from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Driving these trends is a simple reality: State-controlled wages
have remained frozen while prices have risen dramatically since the
Soviet era ended. Even though Fidel Castro's government continues
to distribute rations of subsidized food and to provide free
housing, medical care and education, most people cannot make ends
meet on salaries or pensions alone.
</P>
<P>
   Government stores are nearly bare, and the food in farmers'
markets is relatively expensive, thanks to onerous taxes on the
vendors. Only people who get dollars from relatives abroad or tips
from tourists can afford to live decently. ``One head of garlic
costs a half-day's salary,'' lamented one man in his 50s who was
shopping at a farmers' market in the city of Ciego de Avila, and
who asked not to be identified. ``We go hungry, or we invent a way
to live, to somehow get dollars through contraband, whatever it
takes. Here, no one lives on their salaries alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Cuba's economic malaise go back to 1991, when $4
billion in annual Soviet aid suddenly evaporated. By 1993, the
centrally planned economy had shrunk by 35 percent and the island's
11 million inhabitants were squeezed as never before. Prices
skyrocketed. Hunger became common. Factories closed for lack of
spare parts. Thousands of Cubans began fleeing to the United States
on rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crisis hit, Castro has consistently blamed the United
States' embargo for his people's hardships, accusing Washington
again and again of ``waging economic war.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Castro, who remains a die-hard Marxist,
reluctantly adopted limited free-market reforms. The dollar was
legalized, and Cuba opened its doors to foreign investors willing
to enter joint ventures. The government has since poured capital
into tourism, building several new hotels _ mostly with European
and Canadian partners _ and restoring historic sections of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for foreign exchange, Castro's managers set up stores
controlled by quasi-state enterprises that accept only hard
currency. The state-owned hotel and dollar-store chains compete to
some degree with each other, and the government has also tried to
boost productivity at state factories and collective farms, giving
managers more power to hire, fire and set productivity goals, and
in some cases pegging salaries to production. Some workers now
receive bonuses and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has also allowed people to go into small-scale business
for themselves _ although they cannot expand, nor employ anyone
beyond the family of the owner. More than 160,00 people now operate
private restaurants, workshops, schools, shoe-repair places or
cafes. Spare rooms in houses can be rented. Artisans can hawk their
wares to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The government also established markets where farmers could sell
produce left over after they have supplied the state with its
quota.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these elements of private enterprise, Cuba remains
essentially a communist system. Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of
economy and planning, said last week that the reforms were intended
to allow some private employment without dropping the state's
commitment to socialism: cradle-to-grave social security, free
education and free health care. ``We are not going to convert to a
market economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of workers still receive low state salaries in
pesos. Net profits from hotels and dollar shops go directly into
the Central Bank, where they are available to help finance the
government, diplomats say. In return, every Cuban family gets
rations of rice, peas, milk and other staples at enormous
discounts, and is expected to live from the state salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the state discourages the private enterprises by
taxing them heavily on expected earnings rather than on actual
sales. ``One makes just enough to live, no more,'' said Victor
Rodriguez, whose family runs a tiny restaurant in Havana, which the
state limits to 12 seats and taxes $200 a month. ``It lets us live
a little less smothered.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba's sugar industry has been in a steady decline for
nearly a decade, the new Cuban economy is driven largely by a $1.4
billion tourist industry, $800,000 in remittances from Cubans
abroad and hard-currency tips from tourists. Cuban economists
estimate nearly half the country is now earning some income in
dollars. ``We have two markets, segregated, in dollars and in
pesos,'' said Antonio Romero, an economist at the University of La
Habana. ``We are in the presence of a dual economy, a dual economy
that from my perspective is the most complex problem the Cuban
economy has today. At the heart of this is without a doubt the
measures the government took in the context of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Noreiga, who is 50, stood sullenly in the state bodega
known as Unidad 303-04 in Havana Vieja, or Old Havana, waiting for
a clerk to measure out her rations of rice, peas and sugar. On one
wall was a blackboard listing the store's few items, their
subsidized prices and how much each family is allowed. No meat or
vegetables were available, though tobacco was. The dingy shelves
were virtually empty, save for forlorn boxes of cigarettes,
matches, a bottle of rum and a few small packages of evaporated
milk.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk measured out five pounds of rice for Ms. Noreiga's
household of five people, and then two-and-a-half pounds of peas,
marking them down in her soiled ration book in pencil. ``With five
pounds of rice you can't make it through the month, and you can't
eat only rice,'' Ms. Noreiga said. She and her husband, a dock
worker, have a combined income of only about $5 a month in Cuban
pesos, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is Three Kings Day and I can't buy anything for my
grandchildren,'' she said. ``Because we don't have dollars to buy a
present.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people in the shop said the bodegas seldom have meat,
fresh milk or vegetables. When these things come in, they are
rationed to families with children. Some people who do not have
access to dollars go for months without eating meat.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Cuatro Camino's farmers' market on the opposite
side of Havana looks like paradise. The stalls are chock-full of
produce: cucumbers, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, yucca, yams, mangos
and rice. A crush of people crowd the vendors. Upstairs there is a
small butchery section, where one can buy pork and mutton, though
never beef.
</P>
<P>
   But prices, though reasonable by American standards, are too
steep for Cubans trying to live on a basic government salary of
between $7 to $9 a month. A pound of red or black beans costs more
than 65 cents. Rice is 22 cents a pound. Vegetables range between
13 and 32 cents a pound. Four pounds of salt pork is $1.13. ``If
you buy food one month, you don't buy clothes, and if you buy
clothes, you don't buy food,'' said one woman, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The markets depend on middlemen whom the government has accused
of exploiting farmers and has promised to stamp out. They buy
excess produce from private farmers and cooperatives and transport
it to Havana. In interviews, several said they could make about $5
a day after taxes, assuming they sold everything. ``We have to pay
a tax before we sell the meat, and if we don't sell it, it's our
problem,'' said Vladimir Duran, a 31-year-old butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Castro's administrators said they were planning to
crack down on the vendors. Since most farmers have no way to
transport their produce, fears are rising here that the markets,
which have become the main source of food, will effectively shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it was often said about Castro's Cuba that everything
was shared equally, even the poverty. Since the legalization of the
dollar, the society has splintered.
</P>
<P>
   Factory workers and farm employees appear to have suffered the
most. But even professionals have taken jobs in hotels or moonlight
as guides because they can earn more in tips than from their
government salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hortencia Volvio, 47, is typical of working-class people who
have seen their buying power disappear. Since she was 18, Mrs.
Volvio has worked at the Bantroi Shoe Factory in Havana, cutting
the uppers for men's shoes. She makes about $8.45 a month _ enough
to live decently in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, her managers have begun docking pay when
employees fail to meet production quotas. Some months she makes
less than $4. She has eaten no meat since September. ``I would like
to find another job,'' she said. ``This way, one can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to add insult to injury, the shoes she makes are sold in
dollar-only shops. She can't buy them and must make do with
defective discards.
</P>
<P>
   She envies Cubans who receive money from abroad. ``I would also
like to go to the store and buy all the things I need,'' she said.
``I would like to have a good life like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people who receive remittances from family in the United
States said they could not survive otherwise. Many said the
payments they received, usually amounting to less than $1,000 a
year, merely meant they could eat well and buy good clothes. ``I
have three brothers abroad and they send me money, otherwise I
couldn't live,'' said Esperanza Garcia, a 35-year-old veterinarian
who was working for $7 a month, plus tips, as a tour guide in a
Havana hotel. ``I'm lucky. My children do not want for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there are the hustlers.
</P>
<P>
   Every day after school, Juan Antonio, a 51-year-old English
teacher who requested that his last name not be published, walks
down to old Havana town and prowls the streets, looking for
tourists. At home, he has a dozen boxes of fine cigars, all
contraband from Cuba's best cigar factories. ``I come to the street
and I try to sell you a box of cigars, or I try to take you to a
place you don't know,'' he said. ``I come every day after school.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the chain of cigar smuggling gets a cut, but Juan
says he can make as much $100 a week, far more than his teacher's
salary of 200 pesos a month. Juan says it feels demeaning, after
decades of teaching school, to be accosting tourists and hawking
cigars. His feet hurt him most days, and he would prefer to me at
home, reading.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A porter at a hotel in Ciego de Avila, a veteran of the war in
Angola, sells Monte Cristo cigars on the black market. He said the
illegal cigar business involves people both inside and outside the
factories, and most local officials turn a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know people need to survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In cities, the most common underground activity is driving a
gypsy cab. Almost everyone with a car, be it a decrepit 1950s
Chevrolet or a 1970s Soviet model, uses it to make hard currency.
Several drivers said police usually let them go for a small bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez Leiba, 40, drives a bus for eight hours a day on a
state salary. Every afternoon, he ferries tourists around old
Havana in his 14-year-old Moskvich car. He dodges police, who
demand a $250 tax each month from licensed cabs. ``You have to
struggle to make it here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have made more difficult choices. Marisol is 24,
and left her hometown of Bayamo two years ago for Havana. She said
she quit her $7-a-month job as a clerk at a state-owned store after
her husband abandoned her and their 3-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Now she lingers every night at a bar across from the Hotel Capri
in a black evening dress, picking up tourists and trading sex for
money in a friend's apartment nearby. Marisol, who asked that her
last name not be used, said prostitution was one of the few ways
she could support her son without going hungry. The government
salary, she said, never lasted an entire month, and her son was
underweight and scrawny when they left Bayamo.
</P>
<P>
   She said she finds clients two or three times a month, and
usually earns between $120 and $300. She loathes her foreign
clients for treating her like an object rather than a human being,
she said. ``But I have to put up with it, `' she said. ``I do it
for a just cause, you understand, for myself and for my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisol inhabits the nighttime world of Havana's Vedado section,
where pimps buttonhole tourists and offer to take them to discos
where prostitutes congregate, or to private apartments to meet
women.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has vowed to stamp out this kind of prostitution, and
prostitutes in Havana have felt pressure from increased police
patrols. Marisol's pimp is a 24-year-old who gave his name as
Alberto, who said he had dropped out of college because there
seemed to be little point in continuing to study to become a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   His father and mother are both Communist Party stalwarts with
government sinecures, he said, and are disappointed in him. But he
makes about $30 a night guiding men to prostitutes. ``I don't see a
future in this country,'' he said, drawing on a cigarette. ``Think
about it. The enemy is the United States, but the money we need,
the principal money of Cuba these days, is the money of the
enemy.''

THE TITANS OF WIRELESS ARE TEARING DOWN REGIONAL FENCES
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Germany, Canada) 
(ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George F. Schmitt, president of Omnipoint Communications, a
small wireless phone carrier, recalls sitting in his kitchen in
Montville, N.J., one morning last May with Omni, his pet blue and
gold parrot, and hardly believing what he was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a public conference call, top executives from the AT&AMP;T
Corporation, the nation's biggest communications company, were
explaining how they meant to rewrite the de facto rules for pricing
wireless calls. Not only would AT&AMP;T do away with long-distance
charges for wireless, but it said it would also end the additional
``roaming'' fees for using a phone when traveling to an area
covered by a different company's network _ a charge that consumers
had been resenting since the first mobile phones made their debut
in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly sounded like a great new cost-saving convenience
for wireless customers. But the move also seemed such a drastic
economic departure from the industry's conventional practices that
Schmitt wondered how anyone _ even mighty AT&AMP;T _ could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed home so I could listen to the call that morning, and
I was sitting there thinking, `How can they do this?''' Schmitt
said in an interview last week. ``After the call was over I sat
there for a long time with Omni, but until I saw their ads I think
I really underestimated it. They did an outstanding job of changing
who would use AT&AMP;T and pulling customers in.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt may have had only his parrot to keep him company that
morning, but he was hardly alone. It took many communications
experts time to realize that by introducing the plan that day that
it called Digital One Rate, AT&AMP;T had changed the ground rules of
the wireless business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the depth of that shift may not have become clear
until Dec 31, when reports emerged that the Bell Atlantic Corp.,
the nation's No. 1 local phone company, was trying to acquire the
leader in wireless, the Airtouch Corp., based in San Francisco, for
around $45 billion. Bell Atlantic had apparently decided that being
merely the third-biggest wireless carrier in the United States was
not enough and that it was prepared to dilute its future earnings
to acquire Airtouch's network.
</P>
<P>
   And last week it became clear that Bell Atlantic was not alone
in coveting Airtouch. Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest mobile
phone carrier, also jumped into the bidding. And yesterday reports
emerged that British Telecom PLC was also considering making an
offer. MCI Worldcom Inc. weighed a bid last week, but decided to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the way the market is moving, there is certainly virtue
in having a national footprint, whether you achieve that through
ownership or through partnership,'' said Jonathan Marshall, an
Airtouch spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Airtouch bidding war, analysts do
not expect that takeover to be the industry's last.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the communications industry, it is an old
story: You need scale to thrive, and perhaps even to survive. But
in the wireless sector it is being told these days for the first
time. As AT&AMP;T and other major players, like Nextel and Sprint, use
their national footprints to create leverage in the marketplace,
smaller, regional carriers like Omnipoint and even the Baby Bells
are feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the carriers' move to a national battlefield
means lower rates, better service and broader coverage. For the
carriers, however, the changes can mean slimmer profit margins,
tougher competition and a drive to find partners with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guy is getting squeezed,'' said John Bensche, a
wireless analyst at Lehman Brothers, who acknowledges that he also
initially underestimated the impact of AT&AMP;T's new plan. ``AT&AMP;T sort
of exploded the market with One Rate. For the regional guys it's
going to be hard; it's going to be very hard. You can make money.
You're not going to go bankrupt. But you may be doomed to sort of
subpar returns. So I think some of these guys are going to merge.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reflecting the impact of national competition, the
looming shake-out may be an inevitable consequence of the sheer
proliferation of wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, almost every American metropolitan market
had only two cellular carriers. But in 1996 the Federal
Communications Commission auctioned rights to a big swath of
frequencies, and that led to the creation in 1997 of as many as
four new wireless carriers per market in some places. What was good
for competition, however, has not always been good for the
carriers' books.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a new wireless carrier must spend millions,
sometimes billions, of dollars to build an extensive network before
signing up a single customer. The competition, meanwhile, may be
able to charge lower rates because its network is already in place.
Or the new entrant often finds itself building alongside a giant
like AT&AMP;T or Sprint that can either pay for the construction out of
the cash flow generated from its existing long-distance business or
can afford to borrow billions at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly seeing a move to where more market share is
being captured by national services,'' said Andrew Sukawaty, chief
executive of the Sprint PCS venture. Sprint PCS is not yet among
the top 10 wireless carriers, but in the 1996 auctions, it bought
licenses covering almost the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a national financing game,'' Sukawaty said,
``and it's hard to see how the local and small-business players
will be able to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Schmitt's Omnipoint _ which offers service in New
York City, elsewhere in the Northeast and in Miami _ provides a
good example of the challenges facing small wireless carriers.
Pressed for cash, Omnipoint was able to secure $375 million in new
financing late last year, mostly from companies with which it
already does business, Siemens of Germany and Northern Telecom of
Canada. Nonetheless, the company is canvassing foreign
communications companies in search of someone to buy a big equity
stake or perhaps even to acquire the whole company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Omnipoint is unusual among small carriers in being able
to secure additional financing at a crucial stage. Other carriers,
like Pocket Communications, which owned a license for the Chicago
area, have filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder some small regional carriers are forming partnerships
in hopes of expanding their service areas and pooling marketing
costs. One such group is the GSM Alliance. The alliance takes its
name from GSM, or global system for mobile communications, a
digital wireless technology that is used widely in Europe and Asia
but has not become as popular in the United States. Among the GSM
Alliance members, which have banded together to form roaming
agreements, are Omnipoint, Aerial Communications, Powertel, Western
Wireless and Microcell of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But the GSM Alliance, while far from a failure, has not yet made
much of a dent in the marketplace. Some small-company executives
involved in the group say that it is being held back by the caution
of two Baby Bell members, Bell South and SBC Communications. Those
executives said the Bell companies, attuned to regulatory concerns,
have been reluctant to back initiatives, like collaborative pricing
plans, that were proposed by other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the Bells note that one company's
foot-dragging may be another's compliance with antitrust laws. SBC,
for example, is still trying to gain regulatory approval of its
planned acquisition of the regional phone company Ameritech, which
recently put its Chicago wireless system up for sale to help
address regulators' concerns. That system should fetch more than $2
billion.

<P>
   Although many people on Wall Street and in the communications
industry expect some of the GSM members eventually to merge as they
try to expand their coverage areas, a role may remain for regional
carriers in the wireless business. Earle Mauldin, who oversees the
BellSouth wireless operations, said that only about a quarter of
his company's wireless customers roam outside their home markets.
And Stanley T. Sigman, who runs SBC's wireless business, said only
4 percent of his customers roam outside SBC's territory.
</P>
<P>
   But for AT&AMP;T, with its national presence, those regional
arguments do not hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were paying 80 cents a minute when you're on the road
making a long-distance call, would you roam?'' said Dan Hesse,
president of AT&AMP;T's wireless operation. ``It's a chicken-and-egg
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even some of the regional carriers acknowledge the growing
allure of a national reach. ``Most people are calling a few towns
over to their mom and dad or their place of work or where their
kids go to school,'' said John W. Stanton, chairman of Western
Wireless, one of the larger regional carriers, and chairman of the
Cellular Telephone Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will clearly be some regional players playing roles in
the market,'' Stanton said. ``There will also be a few national
players that will have the vast majority of subscribers.''  &QL;

`RACE FOR THE SUPERBOMB': THE MERRY, SCARY OLD DAYS OF RACING FOR
THE BOMB

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a decade after the end of World War II, the United States
and the Soviet Union waged a secret war to be the first to create
the ultimate weapon. Few people in either country knew of it, and
even the scientists and officials entrusted with the work could not
grasp the full import of what they were up to. Their efforts and
concerns are the stuff of ``Race for the Superbomb,'' Monday
nights' absorbing two-hour ``American Experience'' chronicle of the
building of the hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, mistrust of Soviet intentions combined
with what scientists had learned in making an atom bomb gave
impetus to research, championed by Edward Teller, into a weapon of
practically unlimited destructive power. In the Soviet Union,
Stalin ordered a crash program for a Soviet bomb by a team of
physicists that included, famously, the young Andrei Sakharov.
</P>
<P>
   International tensions in Berlin and Korea added to the urgency.
Although most of the U.S. physicists who had worked on the atom
bomb warned against what became known as ``the super'' (Isidor Rabi
and Enrico Fermi called it ``an evil thing''), President Harry S.
Truman, fearing lest the Soviets get there first, gave the
go-ahead, and both countries went on crash programs.
</P>
<P>
   The differences among U.S. physicists both in their attitudes
toward the idea of a hydrogen bomb and in approaches to its
creation are described Monday evening in remarkably clear fashion.
When a test of the first hydrogen device was exploded with 800
times the power of the atom bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, it was
at once evidence of the scientists' success and a confirmation for
opponents that the weapon was too powerful ever to use.
</P>
<P>
   Sakharov, who was playing catch-up with his own weaker version
of an H-bomb, said that thoughts of potential casualties turned him
old and gray. But warnings by Soviet scientists of an end to life
on earth were shelved by the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States careers were destroyed along with
friendships. The nation was alerted to the clash among the band of
physicists who had built the A-bomb when J. Robert Oppenheimer, who
condemned the idea of aiming hydrogen bombs at enemy cities, was
deprived of his security clearance, ending his role as a government
adviser. Teller, who testified against him, was ostracized by his
former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   By 1955, the narrator says, ``The H-bomb had become a symbol of
doom.'' U.S. planes, some equipped with the bombs, were on constant
alert, requiring a huge peacetime military establishment. Richard
Rhodes, the H-bomb historian who contributes significantly to ``The
Race for the Superbomb,'' says the effort ``essentially militarized
a very peaceful democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   An epilogue notes that years after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, several thousand nuclear warheads of both Russia and the
United States remain poised for action, even though everyone now
recognizes they are too dangerous to launch. Getting rid of the
super, this thoughtful documentary concludes, has proved even
harder than building it.

 &HT;    SENATE BIPARTISANSHIP FRAYS AS TOUGH DECISIONS LOOM
 &HT;    440&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The warmth of bipartisan accord chilled slightly
Sunday as U.S. senators clashed over witnesses and other issues in
the impeachment trial for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides continued to praise Friday's 100-0 vote that
set procedures for opening the trial next Thursday, the decision of
whether the Senate should hear witnesses was put off. But it flared
up again as the Senate jurors fanned out to the Sunday television
talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans gave strong indications that they want to hear from
at least a handful of witnesses on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe some will have to be called,'' said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I.. While some Democrats considered Chafee a possible
ally in any move to cut the trial short, the senator said he would
not go along with an early dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said. If
House prosecutors say they need such testimony, ``It's going to be
pretty hard for senators to vote against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats doubted the need to go beyond the written record to
reach a verdict on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation'' that he opposed the idea because ``we have a
body of evidence which is just phenomenal, 60,000 pages, five
volumes, an amazing array of data. We are ready now to present the
evidence and make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republican House ``managers'' who will lay out
the impeachment case to the Senate continued to lobby hard for
admission of witnesses to bring their case to life. The rules now
require a full presentation of the case followed by a vote whether
to invite witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a trial if you don't have witnesses,'' said Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla. on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., echoed the sentiment and proposed
6-10 witnesses. ``We're alleging that the president turned the
judicial system upside down, and you need witnesses to tell that
story,'' he said on NBC. Otherwise, ``it's easy to write it off as
a bunch of lawyers telling tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid this disagreement, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, denounced the
charges against Clinton in the harshest rhetoric since the senators
were sworn in as ``impartial'' jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unanimous vote taken in the Senate the other day, I think
in no way legitimizes the sham, partisan action taken by the
House,'' Harkin told Fox News. ``All we can do is hope to cloak
ourselves ... with some dignity in handling this pile of dung.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. shot back, asking ``Well, is your
position, Tom, that if the president committed perjury, he should
not be removed from office?''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said that it ``depends'' on the case, and repeated that
the House had been ``reckless'' in the way it built its case.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats voiced open skepticism about the case they will
soon hear. On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., echoed White House complaints that the impeachment was a
partisan move by a lame-duck House.
</P>
<P>
   Another Californian, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said that
although Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair was
reprehensible, she goes into the trial with a view ``jaundiced'' by
four years of investigations of Clinton. ``I kind of developed a
view that there are people who want to, quote, 'get this
president,' `` she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, told her that ``as jurors we have to
put that behind us'' and added, ``it isn't a question of how this
matter got to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emergence of strife, some in this unique jury tried
to keep alive the mood established last Friday when the 100
senators met privately in the historic and intimate old Senate
chamber, where Henry Clay once forged compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that meeting without the glare
of TV cameras had made a difference and would aid in the Senate
trial, where the current rules call for deliberations on motions
and the verdict to be conducted in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., speaking on ABC's ``This Week,''
concurred. ``Our motivation ought to be to have whatever possible
being made public,'' he said, but added that he would oppose an
effort to open the entire process to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the bipartisan cooperation so far, Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., said he has urged the White House to avoid a ``scorched
earth'' defense such as was used in the bitter House debate.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said, the process is ``bipartisan at the kickoff,'' ``the
half-time is questionable,'' and ``if there is overtime, all bets
are off.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Silicon Valley's surging economy slowed during
1998, stung in part by the Asian economic crisis, according to an
annual report that tracks the health of the nation's leading
high-technology center.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley added 19,400 jobs last year, compared with 62,000
in 1997, and exports from the region declined for the first time in
eight years, according to the 1999 Index of Silicon Valley, which
was released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is compiled by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley
Network Inc., a coalition of corporate and civic organizations,
shows that the region has continued to grow but that some of the
remarkable start-up fever, a trademark of the area, has ratcheted
back. Initial public offerings, which peaked at 73 in 1996, fell to
32 in 1998, and commercial vacancies, which have been at historic
lows, inched up slightly, by more than a percentage point, from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some signs of slowdown and a long recession that has
gripped the semiconductor equipment industry, which is centered in
the valley, there were still signs indicating that the area remains
a remarkably robust economic region.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the real average wage in the area rose 2 percent
last year, to $49,060, and real per-capita income continued to rise
at a rate faster than that of the nation as a whole. Quick-growing
companies, or ``gazelles,'' increased to 92 from 64, largely on the
strength of the explosion in Internet commerce. And the amount of
venture capital invested in Silicon Valley grew 14 percent, to $3.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The slowing of the growth rate in the area was not viewed as
entirely bad by the researchers who track the region's economic and
quality-of-life trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say we've gone back to a more normal growth rate,''
said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics in Palo
Alto, Calif., which prepared the report for Joint Venture. ``The
valley's long boom has put incredible pressure on the environment
and on housing and transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the report included data that compare the
region's productivity in specific industries with the rest of the
country. Measured in terms of value added per employee, Silicon
Valley workers in the computer and communications industries
generated $250,000 for each employee, compared with slightly less
than $100,000 for the average U.S. &UR;  &LR; worker. Valley workers also
sharply outpaced average rates in the semiconductor industry and in
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a tremendous amount of productivity,'' Henton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued strong growth of the valley economy, Joint
Venture officials noted some signs of inequality and a failure to
meet future educational needs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, from 1991 to 1997, the report shows that real
income fell 8 percent for households in the bottom fifth of income
distribution. At the same time, real income rose 19 percent for
households in the top fifth of the income pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the high school graduation rate, which is now at 70
percent, has been slipping in the last five years; the graduation
rate for Hispanic students stands at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new economy, which is more and more diverse, and the new
demographics are not intersecting,'' said Ruben Barrales, president
and chief executive of Joint Venture. ``You have Hispanic and black
kids who are not participating, and we're looking at an
unsustainable scenario right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation and housing also continue to be issues that
plague the area. Last year, 31 percent of the freeway miles in
Santa Clara County received the worst possible congestion rate, up
from 26 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Silicon Valley is considered to be the
most wired region of the country, only 52 percent of its residents
have access to e-mail. That falls to less than 30 percent for those
households with incomes of less than $40,000. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Dance and the circus were happily united when the
Lisa Giobbi Movement Theater performed on Saturday night as part of
the Altogether Different series at the Joyce Theater. The
offerings, most of them created by Ms. Giobbi, made the cast both
dance across the floor and hang above the stage from various kinds
of trapezes, cords, wires and rigging.
</P>
<P>
   Two new pieces showed off Ms. Giobbi's ingenuity.
``Temptation,'' a New York premiere to a taped score by Hayley Moss
and a group called Nomad, began with Ms. Giobbi's moving languidly
on the floor. She was tempted in an unusual fashion by Timothy
Harling, who descended head downward on a wire and pulled her up
into his arms. After entwining in midair, he returned her to the
floor looking astonished. Anyone would be astonished after an
encounter like that.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Babylon,'' a world premiere to music by Ms. Moss, Ms.
Giobbi remained high above the stage, wiggling seductively in a
scarlet costume by David Robinson that made one recall that in
ancient times Babylon was celebrated for its opulence and vice.
</P>
<P>
   Other works made artful use of earth and air. Ms. Giobbi
remained rooted to the floor in ``Hormonal Tempest.'' But the
lighting by Donalee Katz and Mitch Levine caused her arms to cast
enormous, grotesque shadows on the backdrop. Ms. Giobbi floated in
midair throughout ``Falling Angel,'' in which she resembled an
angel at times and a sylph from a 19th-century Romantic ballet at
other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of Flying,'' for Jennifer Binford, Rebecca Jung,
John-Mario Sevilla and Terry Pexton, contrasted rolling movements
on the floor with aerial swayings. In ``Give Me a Sign,'' Ms.
Giobbi and Harling seemed involved in a gauche courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Harling was dragged about by bands of material attached to his
body in ``Sabastian,'' a solo he choreographed. He and Ms. Giobbi
dangled precariously from a trapeze in ``Fall From Grace,'' which
she choreographed with Sasha Pavlata. Despite the title, no one
fell. In their collaboratively devised ``Polymorphously Perverse,''
Ms. Giobbi resembled an inert rag doll as Harling partnered her.
Then he appeared to rape her. This duet certainly involved more
than clever stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The Altogether Different series features five companies at the
Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street in Manhattan's
Chelsea section. Ms. Giobbi's group performs again on Thursday and
Sunday nights.

MUSIC REVIEW: WALLOWING IN MELODIOUS HAPPINESS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone who has seen the new ``Star Trek'' movie will
have no trouble recognizing Meredith Monk and her fellow performers
as they appear in her ``Celebration Service'' at St. Mark's Church
in the East Village. They clearly are the Ba'ku, a peace-loving
people who have gained the secret of eternal youth and rejected
technology, even though their earth-tone clothing looks
suspiciously machine woven.
</P>
<P>
   The religion of the Ba'ku is unstated in ``Star Trek:
Insurrection,'' but it must surely be much as Ms. Monk imagines it
in her hourlong ceremony of song, recitation and gentle
calisthenics. Happiness is all. Happy texts come from everywhere: a
20th-century Osage woman, Martin Buber, poets of ancient India,
Afghanistan, Japan and China, the ubiquitous Hildegard von Bingen.
Happy music comes from the throats of the performers in Ms. Monk's
habitual style, which abstracts from Appalachian folk song and
Gregorian chant the lowest common denominator. Happy people sing
and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Their happiness is engaging, but disquieting. For a long time
Ms. Monk has calmly gone about breaking the normal contract of
performance, whereby performers do something excellent. She is not
in the business of excellence. She prefers pleasantness. There are
some nice moments in ``A Celebration Service,'' including a bit of
organum near the start and a twelve-part canon excerpted from
``Atlas.'' (Several additional numbers, too, come from other works
by Ms. Monk.) But the most complicated melody is one the audience
is invited to sing, ``Processional.''
</P>
<P>
   With nothing happening Friday that demanded expertise (happiness
being the most undemanding emotional state), one felt present at
something like a grade-school show. The point was not to be moved,
stirred or struck, but to condone, and perhaps this is asking too
much when the show is being put on by grown-ups. So sweet, so
tender and so unassuming, ``A Celebration Service'' was distinctly
aggressive in its demands for a sympathy it refused to earn.
</P>
<P>
   There are further performances next weekend.

<P>
   For Amazon.com, the best seller that really mattered last week
was not a book title, but the company's stock. Whether it was
simply more Internet frenzy, or a further sign that online commerce
may require its own investment calculus, the company's shares had a
remarkable run last week.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, an Internet bookseller which has yet to report a
profitable quarter since going public in May 1997, saw its share
price soar by nearly 50 percent in the first trading week of the
new year. Since the beginning of December, the stock price has
climbed about 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some of last week's run-up came in response to news _ a stock
split, word of robust holiday sales of the company's books and
compact disks, and a deal to acquire a new warehouse. But mainly,
optimistic investors seemed willing to buy Amazon.com shares at any
price.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Friday, Amazon.com's total stock market value
surged past $30 billion, making it worth more than a major
industrial company like Texaco Inc. And even after some investors
had second thoughts, and the stock retreated sharply from its high
point, Amazon.com, with a market value of $25.4 billion, was still
worth more than the combined value of two leading retailers, J.C.
Penney and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon.com closed Friday at $160.25, up just $1.375
for the day, after trading as high as $199.125 earlier in the
session.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say this unrestrained enthusiasm despite the
company's lack of profit may reflect investors' appreciation for
Amazon.com's sales momentum and the value of its dominant position
as the leading electronic bookseller. Moreover, it comes as many
investors seem to be finding the shares of a variety of Internet
companies irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, Broadcast.com Inc., which provides video
and audio programs on the Internet, saw its shares soar $65.50, or
49.6 percent, to close at $197.50, after trading as high as $230.
In the absence of news that would justify such a surge, Nasdaq
officials asked the company to offer an explanation, but
Broadcast.com declined to provide one.
</P>
<P>
   In such a context, some Internet bears see more greed than logic
in the meteoric rise of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you explain this behavior?'' said Rick Berry, an
analyst in Atlanta with J.P. Turner &AMP; Co., who is advising
investors to sell Amazon.com's stock. ``It is avarice in its most
pure form. It's the greater fool theory, which is that someone buys
stock in the hope that someone is going to come from behind and buy
it for even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns may be expressed in a meeting expected Monday in
New York, where officials of the National Association of Securities
Dealers are to meet with securities industry executives to discuss
the recent volatility of many Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Berry predicted that last week's market surge in Amazon would
probably represent a buying climax, and he said he expected the
stock to start falling 30 to 50 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts see an underlying logic, even if it does not
conform to conventional investing theory.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's stock began booming in the first week of 1999
trading as investors anticipated the 3-for-1 stock split last
Tuesday. That same day, the Seattle-based company announced that
its fourth-quarter sales had quadrupled, to $250 million. The
company's electronic store drew more than a million new customers
in the peak holiday season when it started expanding its product
lines to include stuffed toys and personal electronics.
</P>
<P>
   That expansion impresses Derek Brown, a senior analyst with
Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco, who said investors were
speculating on the prospects for the company's movement into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon sale's have gone from nowhere to $250 million,'' said
Brown, who noted that their fourth-quarter sales exceeded his
expectations by 30 to 40 percent. ``They're on a run rate for a
billion dollars a year. That revenue used to be going to
traditional booksellers. I think Amazon is taking market share and
expanding the market, and the question is who are they taking
market share from?''
</P>
<P>
   The third-place Internet bookseller, the Borders Group, has
suffered from the view that the bookstore chain has not invested
aggressively enough in the Internet. Its new chief executive,
Philip M. Pfeffer, said in late December that the company needed to
start doing more to promote its activities on the Internet even as
it continued a rapid international expansion of superstores. Last
week, Borders said its online commerce effort is projected to post
a loss of 12 to 14 cents for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble has seen its own electronic store remain lodged
in the No. 2 spot and is also losing money. But the rich German
media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G. is its new partner in the
venture, and Bertelsmann's new chief executive, Thomas Middelhoff,
predicts that barnesandnoble.com will overtake Amazon sometime next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barnes &AMP; Noble announced that its online sales in the
critical seven-week holiday period ending Jan. 2 rose to $17.8
million, nearly quadrupling 1997 sales in the similar period.
</P>
<P>
   But can the more traditional booksellers beat the upstart
Amazon.com in the publicity wars?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest reasons behind Amazon's success is
the fact that they do have brand momentum _ Amazon gets a
tremendous amount of free publicity,'' Brown said. ``Investors
could lose interest in them, but right now they are the dominant
E-commerce player and there is little to suggest that they won't be
dominant in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly last week, there seemed to be no limit to investor
enthusiasm for the future of Amazon.com. As of Sunday afternoon,
even its No. 3 and No. 5 best sellers seemed particularly apt:
``The Motley Fool's Rule Breakers, Rule Makers: A Foolish Guide to
Picking Stocks'' and ``How to Get Started in Electronic Day
Trading: Everything You Need to Know to Win in Wall Street's
Hottest Game.''

THE TITANS OF WIRELESS ARE TEARING DOWN REGIONAL FENCES

<TEXT>
<P>
   George F. Schmitt, president of Omnipoint Communications, a
small wireless phone carrier, recalls sitting in his kitchen in
Montville, N.J., one morning last May with Omni, his pet blue and
gold parrot, and hardly believing what he was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In a public conference call, top executives from the AT&AMP;T
Corporation, the nation's biggest communications company, were
explaining how they meant to rewrite the de facto rules for pricing
wireless calls. Not only would AT&AMP;T do away with long-distance
charges for wireless, but it said it would also end the additional
``roaming'' fees for using a phone when traveling to an area
covered by a different company's network _ a charge that consumers
had been resenting since the first mobile phones made their debut
in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly sounded like a great new cost-saving convenience
for wireless customers. But the move also seemed such a drastic
economic departure from the industry's conventional practices that
Schmitt wondered how anyone _ even mighty AT&AMP;T _ could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed home so I could listen to the call that morning, and
I was sitting there thinking, `How can they do this?''' Schmitt
said in an interview last week. ``After the call was over I sat
there for a long time with Omni, but until I saw their ads I think
I really underestimated it. They did an outstanding job of changing
who would use AT&AMP;T and pulling customers in.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt may have had only his parrot to keep him company that
morning, but he was hardly alone. It took many communications
experts time to realize that by introducing the plan that day that
it called Digital One Rate, AT&AMP;T had changed the ground rules of
the wireless business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the depth of that shift may not have become clear
until Dec 31, when reports emerged that the Bell Atlantic Corp.,
the nation's No. 1 local phone company, was trying to acquire the
leader in wireless, the Airtouch Corp., based in San Francisco, for
around $45 billion. Bell Atlantic had apparently decided that being
merely the third-biggest wireless carrier in the United States was
not enough and that it was prepared to dilute its future earnings
to acquire Airtouch's network.
</P>
<P>
   And last week it became clear that Bell Atlantic was not alone
in coveting Airtouch. Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's largest mobile
phone carrier, also jumped into the bidding. And yesterday reports
emerged that British Telecom PLC was also considering making an
offer. MCI Worldcom Inc. weighed a bid last week, but decided to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the way the market is moving, there is certainly virtue
in having a national footprint, whether you achieve that through
ownership or through partnership,'' said Jonathan Marshall, an
Airtouch spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Airtouch bidding war, analysts do
not expect that takeover to be the industry's last.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the communications industry, it is an old
story: You need scale to thrive, and perhaps even to survive. But
in the wireless sector it is being told these days for the first
time. As AT&AMP;T and other major players, like Nextel and Sprint, use
their national footprints to create leverage in the marketplace,
smaller, regional carriers like Omnipoint and even the Baby Bells
are feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the carriers' move to a national battlefield
means lower rates, better service and broader coverage. For the
carriers, however, the changes can mean slimmer profit margins,
tougher competition and a drive to find partners with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guy is getting squeezed,'' said John Bensche, a
wireless analyst at Lehman Brothers, who acknowledges that he also
initially underestimated the impact of AT&AMP;T's new plan. ``AT&AMP;T sort
of exploded the market with One Rate. For the regional guys it's
going to be hard; it's going to be very hard. You can make money.
You're not going to go bankrupt. But you may be doomed to sort of
subpar returns. So I think some of these guys are going to merge.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides reflecting the impact of national competition, the
looming shake-out may be an inevitable consequence of the sheer
proliferation of wireless carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, almost every American metropolitan market
had only two cellular carriers. But in 1996 the Federal
Communications Commission auctioned rights to a big swath of
frequencies, and that led to the creation in 1997 of as many as
four new wireless carriers per market in some places. What was good
for competition, however, has not always been good for the
carriers' books.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that a new wireless carrier must spend millions,
sometimes billions, of dollars to build an extensive network before
signing up a single customer. The competition, meanwhile, may be
able to charge lower rates because its network is already in place.
Or the new entrant often finds itself building alongside a giant
like AT&AMP;T or Sprint that can either pay for the construction out of
the cash flow generated from its existing long-distance business or
can afford to borrow billions at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly seeing a move to where more market share is
being captured by national services,'' said Andrew Sukawaty, chief
executive of the Sprint PCS venture. Sprint PCS is not yet among
the top 10 wireless carriers, but in the 1996 auctions, it bought
licenses covering almost the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a national financing game,'' Sukawaty said,
``and it's hard to see how the local and small-business players
will be able to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Schmitt's Omnipoint _ which offers service in New
York City, elsewhere in the Northeast and in Miami _ provides a
good example of the challenges facing small wireless carriers.
Pressed for cash, Omnipoint was able to secure $375 million in new
financing late last year, mostly from companies with which it
already does business, Siemens of Germany and Northern Telecom of
Canada. Nonetheless, the company is canvassing foreign
communications companies in search of someone to buy a big equity
stake or perhaps even to acquire the whole company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Omnipoint is unusual among small carriers in being able
to secure additional financing at a crucial stage. Other carriers,
like Pocket Communications, which owned a license for the Chicago
area, have filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder some small regional carriers are forming partnerships
in hopes of expanding their service areas and pooling marketing
costs. One such group is the GSM Alliance. The alliance takes its
name from GSM, or global system for mobile communications, a
digital wireless technology that is used widely in Europe and Asia
but has not become as popular in the United States. Among the GSM
Alliance members, which have banded together to form roaming
agreements, are Omnipoint, Aerial Communications, Powertel, Western
Wireless and Microcell of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But the GSM Alliance, while far from a failure, has not yet made
much of a dent in the marketplace. Some small-company executives
involved in the group say that it is being held back by the caution
of two Baby Bell members, Bell South and SBC Communications. Those
executives said the Bell companies, attuned to regulatory concerns,
have been reluctant to back initiatives, like collaborative pricing
plans, that were proposed by other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the Bells note that one company's
foot-dragging may be another's compliance with antitrust laws. SBC,
for example, is still trying to gain regulatory approval of its
planned acquisition of the regional phone company Ameritech, which
recently put its Chicago wireless system up for sale to help
address regulators' concerns. That system should fetch more than $2
billion.

<P>
   Although many people on Wall Street and in the communications
industry expect some of the GSM members eventually to merge as they
try to expand their coverage areas, a role may remain for regional
carriers in the wireless business. Earle Mauldin, who oversees the
BellSouth wireless operations, said that only about a quarter of
his company's wireless customers roam outside their home markets.
And Stanley T. Sigman, who runs SBC's wireless business, said only
4 percent of his customers roam outside SBC's territory.
</P>
<P>
   But for AT&AMP;T, with its national presence, those regional
arguments do not hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were paying 80 cents a minute when you're on the road
making a long-distance call, would you roam?'' said Dan Hesse,
president of AT&AMP;T's wireless operation. ``It's a chicken-and-egg
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And even some of the regional carriers acknowledge the growing
allure of a national reach. ``Most people are calling a few towns
over to their mom and dad or their place of work or where their
kids go to school,'' said John W. Stanton, chairman of Western
Wireless, one of the larger regional carriers, and chairman of the
Cellular Telephone Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will clearly be some regional players playing roles in
the market,'' Stanton said. ``There will also be a few national
players that will have the vast majority of subscribers.''  &QL;

NEW EUROPEAN CURRENCY OPENS INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- So you've heard about the euro. You saw the
headlines, watched a bit of the news broadcast of Europeans
celebrating its debut.
</P>
<P>
   But let's cut to the chase: What does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   What does it matter to Joe Accountant or Jane Teacher? What does
it matter to the country's 401(k)s, Roth IRAs and all the other
seemingly arcane financial terms we've tried to memorize in the
last few years?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you want to make money as an investor, or you want the
company you work for or invest in to make money in its
international deals, it matters. It matters a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to invest,'' said Jerry Clebanoff, chief
investment officer of City National Investments, a unit of City
National Bank in Beverly Hills. ``Potentially, the growth rate in
that region could be very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who slept through the euro's introduction, here's a
quick primer: A new European currency called the euro officially
came into existence on Jan. 1. It will be used by 11 European
nations, chief of which are Germany and France. These countries
will phase out their individual currencies over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the euro will create a European powerhouse that
backers say will rival the might and clout of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it creates the world's second-largest financial
market for investors -- the European bloc. That's especially
alluring at a time when analysts believe the stock markets of the
United States are overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the euro is launched successfully and not too many risk
factors are highlighted, there are more investment opportunities in
European stocks. The U.S. stock market seems really saturated,''
said Tomoko Iwakawa, corporate foreign exchange adviser for Union
Bank of California in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can invest part of their portfolio in these nations in
several ways:
</P>
<P>
   They could buy mutual funds that invest in Europe or specific
European nations;
</P>
<P>
   They could buy World Equity Benchmark Shares; or WEBS, which are
traded on the American Stock Exchange in U.S. dollars, Clebanoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying foreign securities is much more expensive than buying
U.S. stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   WEBS are shares of an index fund that invests in a foreign
country. There's one for France, Germany, Italy and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The fund buys stocks that are part of a Morgan Stanley Capital
International Index for a nation, which is similar to the Dow Jones
industrial average or Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike an index fund, WEBS are traded just like an
individual stock and may be purchased through a broker.
</P>
<P>
   So each share of WEBS is a slice of a diversified basket of
stocks. Prices trade generally between $10 to $20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Clebanoff recommends between 10 percent to 20 percent exposure
in one's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the euro came shortly after World War II. The goal
was to link the European countries closely to avert another war.
</P>
<P>
   Since political unity was difficult to accomplish, an economic
union became the goal. As business became more globalized, the
importance of a union became increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to compete with the rest of the world, Europe
realized that instead of fighting against each other they needed to
unite,'' Iwakawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 15 members in the European economic and
monetary union. The Euro has been adopted by 11 of its members:
Germany, France, Belgium, Finland, Spain, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Britain, Denmark and Sweden, won't be joining. Greece
failed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The euro began trading on Jan. 4, for $1.17. That meant one euro
is equal to $1.17 in American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the euro exists as an exchange rate in paperless
transactions -- checking accounts, stock and bond prices, credit
cards, business deals and others -- and also in travelers checks.
The actual euro bills and coins will begin circulating in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the 11-nation alliance, with 290 million people,
will create a more stable economic and business environment,
analysts say. And having one currency is a plus for the 11 nations
as companies save money by eliminating the costs of exchanging
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make the European union stronger,'' said Ken
Ackbarali, senior economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   American companies that do business in Europe should also
benefit from the euro, because instead of dealing with 11 different
currencies, they only have to use one. They'll also save on
currency exchange costs, plus have the added benefit of targeting
one larger market instead of 11 small ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bullish on investment opportunities in Europe in
general,'' said David Horner, senior financial strategist at
Merrill Lynch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   True, there's still some risk. Most economists believe the
European economy's growth will slow slightly in the near term, and
that could strain relations in the union.
</P>
<P>
   But Clebanoff argues that foreign markets ``historically have
been faster growing than U.S. markets.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, long-term investors who can afford to let their
investments sit for at least three years should consider buying
some European stocks to diversify a portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's going to hit you in your 401(k), it matters.

POLICE OFFICER WHO INTERROGATED BIKO IS DENIED AMNESTY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ A former police officer who said he helped tackle
the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko and smash his head into a
wall when Biko was in custody in 1977 has been denied amnesty by
the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has not yet released its findings, but George
Bizos, a lawyer for the Biko family, said it had ruled that no
amnesty could be granted because the police officer had not
admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gideon Niewhoudt, and the four other officers
involved in Biko's interrogation told the commission that Biko had
attacked them after he had been forced to stand. They said they had
been defending themselves when they jumped on him.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the incident, Biko, naked, disoriented and suffering
from severe head injuries, was driven 750 miles across South Africa
for medical treatment. He died before he got any, on Sept. 12,
1977.
</P>
<P>
   His case outraged the world and helped galvanize the
anti-apartheid movement. Although an investigation at the time
cleared the police officers of any wrongdoing, it became clear that
an obviously injured Biko had spent days manacled to window bars
before dying alone on the floor of a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened to him has been an enduring secret. When
the five officers involved in his interrogation applied for amnesty
in 1996, many South Africans hoped they would finally hear a full
explanation of how Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness
Movement, had died.
</P>
<P>
   But few were satisfied with the version of events the five
police officers put forward during weeks of testimony to the Truth
Commission in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the question of whether Niewhoudt, who is in jail
for other crimes, is believable, the commission's decision focuses
on an issue that was particularly galling to the Biko family: None
of the police officers accepted blame for Biko's death or confessed
to any criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In theory the verdict leaves Niewhoudt vulnerable to criminal
prosecution. But such a prosecution seems unlikely. Legal experts
say proving intent to kill for a murder charge would be extremely
difficult. And a lesser charge of manslaughter would not be
possible because of a 20-year statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Mdu Lembede, confirmed that the commission had made
the ruling in the Niewhoudt case. It was apparently made on Dec. 15
but was not released to the public because it came as the Christmas
holidays began. Lembede said the text of the ruling would be
available on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Applications for amnesty made by the four other officers are
being considered by a different panel and are probably not ready
for decision yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has received more than 7,000 applications for
amnesty and still has many high-profile cases to deal with, like
those of the two men convicted of killing popular leader Chris Hani
on the eve of the 1994 elections, or some of the more notorious
police officers of the apartheid era. They include Col. Eugene de
Kock and Craig Williamson, who masterminded gruesome assassinations
of liberation activists.
</P>
<P>
   In general the commission has signaled its intention to forgive
rather than punish the most heinous crimes of apartheid. Among
those to have gotten amnesty is a police officer who organized a
nighttime raid on political activists that killed 11 people, most
of them women and children attending a wake.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also granted amnesty to the young men who stoned
an American student, Amy Biehl, to death in 1993 when she drove
some friends home to a black township.
</P>
<P>
   Created as a way to put South Africa's brutal past to rest, the
commission has the power to grant amnesty in return for
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   During the police officers' amnesty hearings, a few new details
about Biko's death emerged. The officers admitted they had lied
about which day Biko had received a head injury because they had
not followed regulations about seeking medical help. But they
continued to maintain that the death had been largely the result of
an interrogation gone awry because of Biko's belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   Biko's relatives have fiercely opposed amnesty for the officers,
saying after the hearings that they still did not think the truth
had come out.
</P>
<P>
   Bizos said Sunday that because the commission's ruling did not
deal with the question of whether Niewhoudt finally told the truth,
it was not wholly satisfying. But, he added, perhaps that did not
matter. ``The world's jury has already decided.'' he said.

PATENTS: MEASURING JUMPING TALENT; POOL CUE WITH FEEDBACK; IBM TOPS
THE LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Ariz., Japan)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes a basketball player worth millions of dollars?
Although many factors can be involved, jumping ability doesn't
hurt. Coaches have tried to measure such talent using a system of
tall poles. Now two University of Tulsa students and a professor of
mechanical engineering have designed a method of measuring how high
someone can jump that adds a computer microprocessor and
mathematical formulas to the calculation.
</P>
<P>
   A patent for the device was issued to the professor, Steven
Tipton, and two mechanical engineering graduate students, Matt
Hackworth and Kelly Willson.
</P>
<P>
   One common technique relies on a framework of poles that looks
like ``a big clunky hat rack with rulers sticking out of it,''
Tipton explained. An athlete first reaches up and touches the
highest tag he can reach. Then he or she jumps and swats at even
higher tags. Another testing method involves putting chalk on an
athlete's hands and having him or her jump and touch a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfaction with these methods prompted the search for a
better device. The students came up with a 9-pound, briefcase-size,
computer-controlled jumping meter. The device consists of
electrical switches attached to a timer, which is in turn attached
to a microprocessor and a display screen.
</P>
<P>
   An athlete stands upright on a slim, battery-operated pad
embedded with a series of pressure-sensitive switches. His weight
shuts down power to the mat. Then he jumps, instantly reactivating
the switches and triggering a timer. When the athlete lands again
on the pad, the switches are flipped off once again.
</P>
<P>
   The timer registers the seconds that the athlete is airborne,
and the inventors say they can use a mathematical calculation to
translate that time into a height measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Though the invention belongs to the University of Tulsa, Tipton,
Hackworth and Ms. Willson received patent 5,838,638.
</P>
<P>
   Pool Cue Offering Two Kinds of Feedback
</P>
<P>
   Playing pool may not require strength or speed, but it certainly
depends on pinpoint accuracy. Hand-eye coordination is essential to
billiards, snooker and pocket pool, as is the ability to visualize
where a ball will go. Paul Petrusek, an inventor from Phoenix,
believes mastering that technique may be the hardest part of
learning to play pool well. So he has patented a cue stick with a
guide rib embedded along its shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners often miss shots in pool when the cue twists or
rotates, putting too much English on the ball and sending it off
its intended path. With difficult shots, like those reached from
the far side of a pool table, an open bridge is often used. But
Petrusek believes a bridge reduces accuracy even more.
</P>
<P>
   He believes his ribbed cue will provide beginners with the
visual and tactile feedback necessary to eliminate poor cue
handling and teach players how to continuously reproduce accurate
shots.
</P>
<P>
   His cue looks like an ordinary pool stick with a tip, a shaft
and a butt. The guide rib attaches along the length of the shaft
section in two possible ways, either slid into a dovetail joint or
snapped into clips arrayed in a groove. The rib, protruding from
the shaft, can be round, square or pointed like the tip of a
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   A player would aim the cue with the rib facing downward toward
the playing table and sliding between his or her fingers as a
guide. It could also be used with an open bridge. Petrusek received
patent 5,704,842.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Leads List of Most '98 Patents
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued its annual list of
top 10 patent recipients last week, and for the sixth consecutive
year, IBM led the pack _ this time with 1,724. Otherwise, the list
was dominated by Japanese companies. The other nine, in descending
order of most patents received, were Canon, NEC, Motorola, Sony,
Samsung, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Eastman Kodak and Hitachi. Together, the
10 companies won nearly 50 percent more patents than the number
granted to the 1997 top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

A COLOMBIAN TOWN GROPES FOR A PEACE OF ITS OWN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ In the streets, the
campesinos of San Vicente del Caguan dared a quiet pride and even
hope, seeing luminaries from the nation's capital and around Latin
America descend on their town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laboratory for peace,'' said banners strung across the airport
and around the square, where on Thursday the government and leftist
rebels opened talks toward a peace that the campesinos here have
wept, ached and prayed for.
</P>
<P>
   The banners referred not so much to the latest effort to end the
fighting that has claimed 35,000 lives over the last decade but to
this town's novel attempts to find a peace of its own with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, San Vicente del Caguan seemed like a
special circle of hell rising from a grisly war that had become a
national way of life: bombs exploded in parks and streets,
residents were dragged from their homes for execution, and holding
public office was a reliable way to shorten one's life.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said most of the killing was by the rebels, who
suspected townsfolk of sponsoring right-wing paramilitary death
squads. But they said police and military officers also killed
because they suspected the town of selling supplies to the rebels
and because they considered some local officials corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were scared to be out in the street, especially in the
evening,'' said Jorge Puertas, 55, a shoeshine man. ``Everyone had
less customers and less money. I was scared in case I got killed
for shining the wrong person's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, said Mayor Omar Garcia, a bomb exploded in the same
square where President Andres Pastrana appeared Thursday, killing
eight residents and injuring 50. Three city councilmen were
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not paramilitaries, we're not coca growers, and we're
not helping the guerrillas,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   So, terrified and expecting little help from the Bogota
government, residents set up their own peace commission of 70
townsfolk last fall. They swallowed their fear and sent delegations
into the mountains to seek out the guerrilla commanders. They said
they were poor campesinos, tired of dying, and had no money to
finance paramilitary armies.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents even talked of seeing an apparition of the Virgin
Mary in the mountains near Puerto Rico and made penance by walking
24 hours straight to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back like this,'' said the Rev. Ruffino Reyes,
twisting his legs and falling halfway to the ground like someone
near fainting. They prayed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations set up regular contact with the guerrillas, who
asked the town's ombudsman to tell them about corruption and other
problems in the local government. They told the mayor to replace
those accused of corruption, who stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas never confirmed they were doing the killing,
but it got better,'' Garcia said. ``The guerrillas got to know the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As people here watched government troops and policemen pull out
two months ago as part of a larger 90-day evacuation of security
forces from an area of southeastern Colombia the size of
Switzerland, some became nervous and left town in fear of rebel
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Martha Ospina, 28, the town has calmed down. At first,
she said, the people complied with the rebels' orders out of fear.
``They thought they might be taken away, or face some kind of rebel
justice,'' she said. ``But now people comply out of respect. People
feel comfortable with the guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ospina said the rebels explained to the shopkeepers and
other townspeople how they would run San Vicente and how they have
administered the laws ``honestly,'' reducing corruption. ``They
apparently even intervene in infidelity and marital disputes if
they are asked to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, residents wondered if their experience at building
contacts with the rebels could be a seed that would flower around
the country. At the talks on Thursday, pieces of this fragmented
and polarized country reconnected in small encounters that made
distant enemies and strangers seem more human.
</P>
<P>
   In this forgotten slice of Colombia, residents were both tickled
and fearful as they watched the grand spectacle of the nation's
efforts to forge peace unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Elvio Rojas, 50, a wood merchant, smiled shyly and waved as a
jeep carrying Maria Emma Mejia, the attractive former Foreign
Minister, passed a few feet from where he sat. A 20-year-old rebel
doing guard duty, wearing lipstick and toting a machine gun, asked
whether Ms. Mejia had arrived in town yet and described herself as
``an admirer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Roine Chavez, chief of the president's security detail,
praised the ease in coordinating security with the rebels, who
agreed to having 60 bodyguards from the National Police, including
sharpshooters, accompany the president here. Air forcce pilots,
shuttling visitors in and out of the town, chuckled over the rebel
commanders' delight at seeing the beauties of Ivan and His Bam
Band, a musical group, dance through the afternoon. ``It can't be
work all the time,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides say that peace could take five years or more to build
and that negotiations will most likely unfold even as the war
intensifies. In that war, San Vicente sits at the edge of the abyss
_ a region set for a dramatic increase in U.S.-backed fumigation
and other counterdrug efforts that will most likely mean attacking
the rebels in their rural strongholds and bringing the war back
here again.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by conservative Republicans, the United States has more
than tripled antinarcotics aid to Colombia this year to $290
million, which will largely be used to step up the firepower and
intelligence gathering abilities of the National Police and the
army, in the heart of guerrilla-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Washington has failed to deliver or earmark money for
the development of alternative crops in coca-growing areas, a
cornerstone of Pastrana's $3.5 billion plan to bring about peace by
weaning peasants from coca growing and the rebels from a major
source of their income.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony here Thursday, the American Ambassador, Curtis
W. Kamman, said peace was essential to open the way for American
aid for development of forgotten areas like San Vicente del Caguan.
But Colombians involved in the peace effort were quick to criticize
Washington's willingness to invest in fumigation of coca crops and
other measures that will certainly heighten strife in the region
rather than in rural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has to be willing to take a chance,'' said
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, who has headed efforts to negotiate peace
with the National Liberation Army, a smaller rebel organization
powerful in the north. ``It can't take the safe road and say we'll
only invest after the peace is there. It has to be willing to bet
on peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia agreed, and said that for all their involvement in
skimming commissions off drug trafficking, the rebels say the
fighting will not end until Colombia changes a society that they
insist is stacked against the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is not a paper that's signed,'' the mayor said. ``It's
something that has to be built.''

IMPEACHMENT NOT ON AGENDA AT HISTORIANS' MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Pa., S.C., Ky., N.C.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-POLITICS, IMPEACH-SENATE) 
(lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a contemporary constitutional drama going on
just a few miles away, historians flocked to the U.S. capital last
week to discuss topics like the dilemma of the South Asian
intellectual and acoustics in early America.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the 113th annual meeting of the American Historical
Association include nary a word (officially, anyhow) on
impeachment, even as it explored long-ago violence in the politics
of North Carolina and Kentucky and the French influence on Cairo in
the 19th century?
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are prepared months in advance,'' Eric Foner of
Columbia University, the association's president-elect, said on
Friday without a trace of defensiveness. ``What is esoteric to one
person may be essential to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Foner is an expert on the Civil War and the Reconstruction era
that occasioned the last presidential impeachment, that of Andrew
Johnson in 1868, and he emphasized that the several thousand
historians gathered here Thursday through Sunday were very much
interested in the events unfolding at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being discussed a great deal in the corridors,'' the
professor said. ``And I can tell you that very few historians here
feel that the charges against President Clinton rise to the level
of impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The practicalities of scheduling aside, some historians offered
higher-minded reasons for not jumping into scholarly explorations
of the current impeachment. When the extent of Clinton's troubles
began to emerge, there was a lot of discussion among historians,
face to face and via electronic mail, Richard Jensen of the
University of Illinois at Chicago recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally politicized,'' Jensen said, ``so we stopped
talking about it.'' At least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   To politicize a subject, he said, is to risk contaminating it,
at least when one hopes to approach the subject as a scholar in
quest of the elusive truth. Far better for historians, he said, to
let the subject cool a bit first, much as the Senate is supposed to
be the saucer that cools the tea, legislatively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Shammas of the University of Southern California, whose
specialty is economic history, tried to foreclose any discussion of
impeachment by jokingly throwing up her hands. ``I don't know
anything about Monica Lewinsky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, she wondered whether the Clinton impeachment
would help set off another sea change in American politics: a
reaction against the growing power of conservatives, much as there
was a backlash against liberal causes three decades ago. (A
historian, not a fortune teller, she did not try to answer her own
question.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brose, a graduate student at the University of
Pennsylvania, specializes in Asian history but said he and those
who share his field have been caught up of late in the impeachment:
``It's a big topic, especially coming here to Washington.'' Soon,
he said, the impeachment will be grist for scholars.
</P>
<P>
   And Ronald Granieri, an assistant professor at Furman University
in Greenville, S.C., said he and some of his colleagues have
concluded that Clinton is the victim of ``a political setup job.''
</P>
<P>
   Granieri, whose specialty is European history, said he thinks
Clinton is doing a good job, basically. Like many Americans,
Granieri cited the healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Foner, the new president of the largest professional historical
organization in the United States, with about 15,000 members,
conceded that some topics on this year's agenda could seem arcane
to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, by definition, talking to ourselves,'' he said. They
were discussing the Argentine fingerprint system, the Neapolitan
Revolution of 1799 and homemaking in fascist colonial Libya, to
name topics that seem not only outside history's mainstream but
away from its tiniest tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Such topics, and many others, explore the stuff of life
throughout the world, Foner said. They are a reminder, if any is
needed, that history is much more than battlefields and
governmental intrigue and the deeds and misdeeds of the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Next year in Chicago, he said, there may be room on the annual
meeting's agenda for a discussion of impeachment _ assuming that
Clinton's fate is decided by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not political pundits,'' he said without a trace of
smugness. ``We like to know how something turns out before we
analyze it.''

   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ In the streets, the
campesinos of San Vicente del Caguan dared a quiet pride and even
hope, seeing luminaries from the nation's capital and around Latin
America descend on their town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laboratory for peace,'' said banners strung across the airport
and around the square, where on Thursday the government and leftist
rebels opened talks toward a peace that the campesinos here have
wept, ached and prayed for.
</P>
<P>
   The banners referred not so much to the latest effort to end the
fighting that has claimed 35,000 lives over the last decade but to
this town's novel attempts to find a peace of its own with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, San Vicente del Caguan seemed like a
special circle of hell rising from a grisly war that had become a
national way of life: bombs exploded in parks and streets,
residents were dragged from their homes for execution, and holding
public office was a reliable way to shorten one's life.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said most of the killing was by the rebels, who
suspected townsfolk of sponsoring right-wing paramilitary death
squads. But they said police and military officers also killed
because they suspected the town of selling supplies to the rebels
and because they considered some local officials corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were scared to be out in the street, especially in the
evening,'' said Jorge Puertas, 55, a shoeshine man. ``Everyone had
less customers and less money. I was scared in case I got killed
for shining the wrong person's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, said Mayor Omar Garcia, a bomb exploded in the same
square where President Andres Pastrana appeared Thursday, killing
eight residents and injuring 50. Three city councilmen were
assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not paramilitaries, we're not coca growers, and we're
not helping the guerrillas,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   So, terrified and expecting little help from the Bogota
government, residents set up their own peace commission of 70
townsfolk last fall. They swallowed their fear and sent delegations
into the mountains to seek out the guerrilla commanders. They said
they were poor campesinos, tired of dying, and had no money to
finance paramilitary armies.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents even talked of seeing an apparition of the Virgin
Mary in the mountains near Puerto Rico and made penance by walking
24 hours straight to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came back like this,'' said the Rev. Ruffino Reyes,
twisting his legs and falling halfway to the ground like someone
near fainting. They prayed for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The delegations set up regular contact with the guerrillas, who
asked the town's ombudsman to tell them about corruption and other
problems in the local government. They told the mayor to replace
those accused of corruption, who stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas never confirmed they were doing the killing,
but it got better,'' Garcia said. ``The guerrillas got to know the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As people here watched government troops and policemen pull out
two months ago as part of a larger 90-day evacuation of security
forces from an area of southeastern Colombia the size of
Switzerland, some became nervous and left town in fear of rebel
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Martha Ospina, 28, the town has calmed down. At first,
she said, the people complied with the rebels' orders out of fear.
``They thought they might be taken away, or face some kind of rebel
justice,'' she said. ``But now people comply out of respect. People
feel comfortable with the guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ospina said the rebels explained to the shopkeepers and
other townspeople how they would run San Vicente and how they have
administered the laws ``honestly,'' reducing corruption. ``They
apparently even intervene in infidelity and marital disputes if
they are asked to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, residents wondered if their experience at building
contacts with the rebels could be a seed that would flower around
the country. At the talks on Thursday, pieces of this fragmented
and polarized country reconnected in small encounters that made
distant enemies and strangers seem more human.
</P>
<P>
   In this forgotten slice of Colombia, residents were both tickled
and fearful as they watched the grand spectacle of the nation's
efforts to forge peace unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Elvio Rojas, 50, a wood merchant, smiled shyly and waved as a
jeep carrying Maria Emma Mejia, the attractive former Foreign
Minister, passed a few feet from where he sat. A 20-year-old rebel
doing guard duty, wearing lipstick and toting a machine gun, asked
whether Ms. Mejia had arrived in town yet and described herself as
``an admirer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Roine Chavez, chief of the president's security detail,
praised the ease in coordinating security with the rebels, who
agreed to having 60 bodyguards from the National Police, including
sharpshooters, accompany the president here. Air forcce pilots,
shuttling visitors in and out of the town, chuckled over the rebel
commanders' delight at seeing the beauties of Ivan and His Bam
Band, a musical group, dance through the afternoon. ``It can't be
work all the time,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides say that peace could take five years or more to build
and that negotiations will most likely unfold even as the war
intensifies. In that war, San Vicente sits at the edge of the abyss
_ a region set for a dramatic increase in U.S.-backed fumigation
and other counterdrug efforts that will most likely mean attacking
the rebels in their rural strongholds and bringing the war back
here again.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by conservative Republicans, the United States has more
than tripled antinarcotics aid to Colombia this year to $290
million, which will largely be used to step up the firepower and
intelligence gathering abilities of the National Police and the
army, in the heart of guerrilla-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Washington has failed to deliver or earmark money for
the development of alternative crops in coca-growing areas, a
cornerstone of Pastrana's $3.5 billion plan to bring about peace by
weaning peasants from coca growing and the rebels from a major
source of their income.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony here Thursday, the American Ambassador, Curtis
W. Kamman, said peace was essential to open the way for American
aid for development of forgotten areas like San Vicente del Caguan.
But Colombians involved in the peace effort were quick to criticize
Washington's willingness to invest in fumigation of coca crops and
other measures that will certainly heighten strife in the region
rather than in rural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has to be willing to take a chance,'' said
Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, who has headed efforts to negotiate peace
with the National Liberation Army, a smaller rebel organization
powerful in the north. ``It can't take the safe road and say we'll
only invest after the peace is there. It has to be willing to bet
on peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia agreed, and said that for all their involvement in
skimming commissions off drug trafficking, the rebels say the
fighting will not end until Colombia changes a society that they
insist is stacked against the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is not a paper that's signed,'' the mayor said. ``It's
something that has to be built.''

OTTAWA WOMAN CLAIMS VATICAN DIPLOMAT, A PRIEST, THREATENED HER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Vatican's elegant diplomatic compound in Ottawa is
usually one of the most tranquil and circumspect embassies in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But lately it has been the focus of much attention because the
local police have charged one of the embassy's senior officials, a
Roman Catholic monsignor, with harassing a former employee and
threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents filed on Nov. 10, Monsignor Vito
Rallo, an Italian who is the second-highest-ranking representative
of the Pope in Canada, physically intimidated a female employee
repeatedly from July 1997 to March of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rallo, 45, has refused requests for comment on the criminal
charges made by Josephine Greco, 52, who was the embassy's cultural
attache until she was dismissed on Sept. 30. The Vatican itself has
also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, diplomats like Rallo are protected from criminal
prosecution by diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gibson, a local lawyer representing Rallo, said the
charges were without merit. He said he was skeptical about Mrs.
Greco's motives for filing a complaint and called her ``a
disgruntled employee'' with a vendetta against the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were problems related to her work,'' Gibson said in a
telephone interview. ``But no one has been served with any papers
so I'm not sure exactly what it is that she is claiming.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greco said she filed her complaint with the police in
August, a month before she was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a disgruntled employee,'' she said. ``He threatened
to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greco was born in Italy and holds both American and Italian
passports. She said her responsibilities as attache included
preparing background reports on members of the Canadian clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greco would not say what she believed had motivated Rallo
to threaten her, but she said harassment began soon after she
joined the embassy four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a woman of great dignity and great honor,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Ottawa, ``but I suffered four
years of absolute terror and anguish.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when the pattern of harassment became more
violent, she contacted the police. ``I was advised that I should
file a complaint because if I were not to do anything at all,
something bad could happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greco claimed that her health deteriorated in the time she
worked at the embassy. She suffered angina attacks and was
hospitalized. In all, she said, she lost about two weeks of work
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was while she was on sick leave that she was
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa police would not discuss the case, but in the
complaint filed with the Ontario provincial court, Rallo is accused
of engaging ``in threatening conduct'' that caused Mrs. Greco ``to
fear for her safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson confirmed that Mrs. Greco was dismissed in September but
would not give the reasons for the termination. He said the local
police should not have filed the charges until a crown attorney,
the Canadian equivalent of a district attorney, had determined
whether there was sufficient evidence to go forward.

DOCTORS INCREASINGLY BESIEGED BY DRUG-SALES REPRESENTATIVES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Dr. Spartaco Bellomo took a few
minutes before office hours began in his Jersey City, N.J., suite
to attend to one of the few traditions of medical practice that
have survived almost unchanged from the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It involved leaning back in his chair, listening, nodding,
asking a question or two and murmuring a few reassuring words. In
the chair opposite Bellomo, however, sat not a patient but Marie
Atkinson, a sales representative from Dupont Pharmaceuticals,
plugging the company's newest product.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are your patients doing on Sustiva, doctor?'' Ms. Atkinson
asked, her lap piled high with literature about the drug. One of
Bellomo's patients was doing very well indeed, and Ms. Atkinson
beamed. ``Excellent,'' she said, rising to go. ``Doctor, you've
made my day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1850 that a drug salesman first knocked on an American
doctor's door to take up just a few moments of his time, and the
dialogue has not stopped since. It is only growing louder. Since an
overhaul of the health care system fizzled four years ago, the
pharmaceutical sales force has exploded, from about 35,000
full-time sales representatives and supervisors in the top 40
pharmaceutical companies in 1994 to more than 56,000 now, according
to the Scott-Levin consulting firm in Pennsylvania. An additional
6,000 people are employed by independent marketing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-Levin estimates that pharmaceutical companies spent $5.3
billion in the first 11 months of last year sending representatives
into doctors' offices and hospitals, and an additional $1 billion
holding marketing events for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   That translates into nearly one drug salesperson for every 11
practicing physicians in the United States, and almost $9,000 per
doctor, a class size and budget that might be the envy of any other
educational venture. But the relationship between the
pharmaceutical sales force and the doctors they ply with
information has been fraught with tension for many years, and many
physicians feel that the new numbers are only making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   National spending for prescription drugs has more than doubled
in the last decade, to $78.9 billion in 1997 from $37.7 billion in
1990, according to IMS Health Inc., which collects health-related
information. A recent analysis in The New England Journal of
Medicine noted that the fraction of the personal health care dollar
spent paying for prescription drugs is growing faster than any
other part, including doctors' and hospital bills, at least partly
because prescription drug costs have increased on average 17
percent a year in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The same industry pressures thought to be responsible for these
soaring costs have helped bump up the sales force. Developing drugs
remains a huge uncovered expense for the industry. Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group, has
calculated that only three in 10 marketed brand drugs make enough
money to cover the industry's average research and development
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the organization estimates that generic drugs are
subtracting an increasing fraction of prescription volume from the
brand-name pharmaceutical houses: 44 percent in 1997, up from 27
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Food and Drug Administration speeds its approval of
new drugs, more and more unfamiliar _ and expensive _ brands must
be introduced to prescribing doctors, while at the same time more
medically similar drugs are clamoring for their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the sales force performs a vital
educational role for the industry, said Michele Robinson, a
spokeswoman for the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association
of pharmaceutical houses. Sales representatives introduce doctors
to new families of brand-name drugs, and update them on using the
older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug companies still view the physician as their primary
client,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at issue in the drug representatives' sales talk are the
usual questions of accuracy and reliability that dog all highly
competitive advertising ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, studies have repeatedly shown that
doctors who say they rely a great deal on information supplied by
pharmaceutical representatives instead of medical journals tend to
have more expensive prescribing habits than other doctors, and are
somewhat less likely to choose the best drugs for a given job.
</P>
<P>
   One study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1995, found a dozen errors of fact in tape
recordings of 13 presentations made by drug representatives to
doctors, errors that invariably favored the presenter's own drug at
the expense of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   A few other issues specific to the traditions of the
representatives' job compound the problem. Namely, given three
medically equivalent brand-name drugs, is a harried doctor more
likely to write a prescription for the one featured in the small
print of an obscure medical journal, or the one endorsed in a few
pithy words by the sales representative who just left a stack of
colorful brochures in the office?
</P>
<P>
   Or might the doctor just possibly choose over either of them the
brand whose logo is embossed on the expensive fountain pen another
salesman pressed into his hand at an elegant dinner the night
before?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Despite this decade's significant changes in both
medical advertising and medical practice, face-to-face drug
promotion remains an invaluable marketing tool. ``Personal selling
is still the most effective and certainly the most expensive way of
selling prescription medications,'' said Dr. Mickey Smith,
professor of pharmaceutical administration at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford and an authority on drug marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of sales jobs has changed slightly over the decade,
Smith said. Drug representatives now make calls not only on
doctors, but also on executives and pharmacists who work in
supervisory capacities for hospitals and insurers. Sophisticated
prescription tracking systems can identify which doctors are
prescribing medications and let representatives tailor their
presentation, encouraging the reluctant prescribers and
complimenting the enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a growing percentage of advertising budgets dedicated
to introducing drugs directly to consumers, the industry has
realized that the doctor ultimately makes the prescribing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   And so in private offices and hospital corridors alike,
traditional sales representatives energetically chat up the staff.
Unlike the salesmen of years past, many now have a strong
background in science or health care (Ms. Atkinson of Dupont is a
nurse), specialize in one drug only or one group of drugs, and get
to know their subject very well.

   HOUSTON _ Food, water and bullets are not the only things being
bought by people who fear that the Y2K phenomenon will bring a
societal meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Some are also buying solar-powered electrical systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sell one or two per month for homes. Now we are
selling four or five a week and the customers are telling us it is
because of Y2K,'' said Marshall Blalock Jr., president of Southwest
Photovoltaic Systems of Tomball, a city of 7,000 about 20 miles
northwest of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the `solar hippies' that were buying them. Now
it's just normal people,'' Blalock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stems from a computer programming practice begun
more than 30 years ago. To save computing capacity, programmers
used the last two digits to designate each year. For example, 1978
was written ``78.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of next year, many fear that computers will see
``00'' and interpret it as 1900 _ causing shutdowns or malfunctions
that will lead to a general breakdown in communication,
transportation, general infrastructure and ultimately society.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating such a crisis, nervous people across the country
have begun stockpiling food, water, clothing, fuel, medicine and
other essentials. Advice on what to stock is readily available on
hundreds of Internet sites offering advice on everything from
beekeeping to water purification.
</P>
<P>
   Government and industry officials discount the problem, saying
many operations performed by computers are not related to time and
year and that any glitches that arise will cause only minor
inconveniences.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the anxiety, the President's Council on Year 2000 has
set up a toll-free line providing information on how computers,
small businesses, telephones and other products and services will
be affected by the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The information on the line, 1-888-USA-4-Y2K, comes from
government agencies, companies and industry groups reporting on
what measures they are taking to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Industries, parent company of Houston Lighting and
Power, has been working on the problem since May 1997 and plans to
spend $35 million to $40 million on it, said spokeswoman Leticia
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said HL&AMP;P has examined all computer programs and systems
and made changes or replacement where needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 priority is to ensure that the production and
delivery of energy is uninterrupted,'' she said. ``We feel
confident that we are going to deal with this in an appropriate
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said the company continuously plans for emergencies,
including coal and gas stockpiling and ensuring enough HL&AMP;P
employees are available to handle any situation.
</P>
<P>
   She said there have been instances in the past where
weather-related outages caused computers to be shut down and
technicians operated the power system manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful at it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The HL&AMP;P Web site _ www.hlp.com _ has a section on Y2K, which
notes that Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a Saturday, when electrical
demand is lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electrical system will have excess generating capacity
during the millennium date change to help balance any possible
problem. Also, electric systems and power delivery do not rely
heavily on computerized technology or digital controls,'' the site
says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such precautions, many people are taking no chances on
having a reliable power source. Thus, the mini-boom in solar
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Blalock said solar cells can generate enough power for a
five-bedroom house, and systems cost from $5,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends on the (electrical) load you want to have,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The systems are composed of solar panels that convert sunlight
into electricity and feed the current into a controller, which
sends it to an inverter where it is converted from direct current
to alternating current for household use.
</P>
<P>
   Any surplus generated power is stored in batteries that supply
current for night use and times of heavy cloud cover.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Photovoltaic's marketing manager Jim Gregory said the
company began noticing the trend about three months ago. He said
the new customers tell them they fear that the Y2K bug will not
only cause food shortages, but also a loss of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hoping that it won't happen but want to be ready just
in case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory said the company has not installed any solar power
systems in traditional residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them have gone in houses where people have one or two
acres and big lots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said many solar units have been installed in weekend cabins
and mobile homes across the Texas countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually set up to power a refrigerator, lights, fans
and a water well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has not been limited to Texas, according to Richard
Curry, editor of Photovoltaic Insider's Report.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said sales figures are unavailable but every person in the
industry he has talked to has reported increases in sales of the
systems for home use.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are attributing those increases to Y2K,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gregory believes the trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be self-sufficient. They could go out and get a
generator but you have to feed it fuel. With solar there is no
fuel, just the sun.''

 UNDATED: very well. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some become so expert that they begin to blend into the health
care team. Salesmen who sell surgical devices have long been
present at operations to guide doctors using new equipment; in a
widely publicized case in Beth Israel Hospital in New York City
last year, a salesman has been accused of participating in surgery
that cost a young woman her life.
</P>
<P>
   For representatives who sell drugs rather than equipment, the
FDA tries to prevent the practice of medicine without a license
with guidelines that strictly limit what the representatives may
and may not discuss with doctors. Representatives are limited to
passing on only the most basic information about a drug; they
cannot discuss studies in progress or observations the drug agency
has not yet approved for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA cannot stop representatives from sweetening their
presentations with little extras. These range from reprints of
pertinent articles and colorful charts to hang in the office, to
ballpoint pens and pocket calendars bearing product or company
logos, to trays of cookies, bagel breakfasts and pizza lunches.
Many representatives routinely lug cartons of drug samples with
them to keep office cabinets stocked with their product.
</P>
<P>
   And often the extras take on another dimension entirely, always
in the name of education. Some representatives buy expensive
textbooks or pay for trips to conferences for a doctor or the
doctor's trainees. Others sponsor golfing outings, river cruises or
lavish dinners at expensive restaurants where an after-dinner
speaker discusses the state-of-the art treatment of a given
condition and, inevitably, the role in it of the sponsor's drug.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long debated where, in the spectrum of
pharmaceutical-sponsored information, pens, books, white wine and
chocolate mousse, to draw the ethical line.
</P>
<P>
   For some doctors, keeping an open door for the sales
representatives is an educational imperative made even more
essential by the glut of new products. Bellomo of Jersey City, for
instance, may see a half-dozen or more representatives a week,
usually by appointment, spending as long as half an hour with each.
The information they provide him is valuable ``at least 90 percent
of the time,'' he said. One passed on a new safety warning about a
drug a few months ago, Bellomo said, and the official warning still
has not arrived. ``That person is welcome in my office anytime,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For other doctors, there is persuasive evidence for giving the
representatives a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically do not go to them for information,'' said Allan
Brett, director of the division of general internal medicine at the
University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia. ``When
a new drug is coming out, I tell the representative, `I'm really
not interested in what you have to say. I'm glad you told me it's
coming out, but I'm going to get my information from somewhere
else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo sees drug samples as a handy way to start a patient on
treatment at night after the drugstores are closed, and also a way
to ease the cost of treatment. But for Brett they are an insidious
way to hook doctors and patients onto new, expensive drugs, when
older, cheaper, safer alternatives might easily suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gifts divides doctors as well. Some agree with the
official policy of the American Medical Association that pens and
other items of negligible value are permissible, as are gifts like
textbooks that have an educational value that might indirectly
benefit the doctor's patients (whose prescription dollars are,
after all, directly paying for the gifts).
</P>
<P>
   But for other doctors, even trinkets are troubling. ``The fact
that you can walk down the hall here and every pad, every pen,
every little magnet on the door for messages has a drug company's
name on it,'' Brett said, ``that bothers me. I think there's a
cumulative ethos that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can buy my own pens and sticky pads,'' said Dr. Allen
Shaughnessy, director of research in the Family Practice Residency
in Harrisburg Hospital in Harrisburg, Pa. Like other medical
educators, Shaughnessy is increasingly concerned with what kind of
limits, if any, he and his colleagues should place on the contact
between the residents training in his program and drug sales
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital policies vary. Some ban drug representatives from busy
patient-care areas or confine them to a room at the end of the
hall; others confine sales pitches to specific activities on
specific days, while others issue them identification tags and
allow them to roam freely.
</P>
<P>
   And in teaching hospital wards, the representatives _ friendly,
well dressed, bearing gifts and food _ are invariably popular
visitors. Shaughnessy said he once found residents presenting cases
to a pharmaceutical representative for treatment advice, apparently
finding him more pleasant and accessible than their supervising
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``My zealous approach was, throw the bums out,'' Shaughnessy
said. ``But then I thought, no, we're really throwing out a useful
information source for a lot of people.'' He now invites sales
representatives to a biweekly seminar on ``information
management,'' where his residents critique their spiels for logic
and usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Shaughnessy is seeing a difference in his trainees.
``I've been doing this for a long time,'' he said. ``It seems like
10 years ago there used to be more moral outrage among the
residents,'' he said. ``Business is a big part of medicine now.
It's easier for the drug reps to sneak in under the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atkinson of Dupont said that only a single doctor among the
385 in her territory has told her that he has a policy of not
speaking to pharmaceutical representatives. But Ms. Atkinson still
leaves information in the lobby for him, she said, and Dupont's
prescription tracking service lets her monitor his prescribing
habits. And ``he's writing,'' Ms. Atkinson said. ``He's writing.''

<P>
   The recent wave of tougher sentencing laws has succeeded in
making criminals serve longer prison sentences and slowed the
release of inmates, helping to increase the nation's record prison
population even as crime has dropped in the 1990s, according to the
first comprehensive study of the new laws released Sunday by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that the
average time served in state prison by violent criminals rose to 49
months in 1997 from 43 months in 1993. Measured another way, the
proportion of their sentences that these offenders had to serve
before release increased to 54 percent in 1997 from 47 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of all types of criminals who were
eligible for release from state prison who were actually let out
fell to 31 percent in 1996 from 37 percent in 1990, the Justice
Department report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental thing the report shows is that the changes in
the American prison population are the result of a shift in policy,
rather than any basic change in the nature of criminals or the
crime rate,'' said Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren
Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   As another indication of how public anger at criminals affected
the justice system, the report said that while most crime rates
fell beginning in 1991, the proportion of criminals arrested for
violent crimes who were sentenced to state prisons jumped sharply.
The number of arrests for murder, for example, declined to 16,100
in 1996 from 19,800 in 1990, but the rate at which offenders were
sent to prison for murder rose to 613 per 1,000 arrests in 1996
from only 460 per 1,000 arrests in 1990. Although the report did
not say so, this increase appeared to reflect harsher treatment of
criminals by prosecutors, judges and juries.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of tougher sentencing laws and public attitudes
toward crime helps explain a seeming anomaly, the report concluded.
The number of inmates incarcerated in state prisons climbed 60
percent from 1990 to 1997, but the number of people sent to prison
grew only 17 percent during those years.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 1.8 million Americans behind bars _ in jails and
state or federal prisons _ and the state prison population has been
growing at 7 percent annually since 1990, though the crime rate has
fallen for seven straight years. The Justice Department report
covered only state prison populations, which total about 1.1
million inmates.
</P>
<P>
   While the report clearly demonstrates that the new laws have
achieved the public's goal of making criminals serve longer prison
sentences, there is still widespread debate among criminologists,
law-enforcement officials and politicians over how much this has
contributed to the drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing they agree on is that incarcerating more
criminals averts some crimes. But precisely how many is virtually
impossible to measure, given the disparity in incarceration rates
between the 50 states and the difference in motivation for and
frequency of crimes like murder and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians now claim the increase in the number of people
behind bars is responsible for the decline in crime, but Alfred
Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, said this was ``too simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ignores the fact that throughout the 1980s crime rates were
going up when the prison population was rising just as fast as it
has in the 1990s,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   To gauge how much impact prison has had on crime, Blumstein
suggested, it is important to separate older and younger criminals.
Since 1980, the homicide rate for adults ages 24 and older has
declined by half, and it is likely that the incarceration of many
older people convicted of murder has affected the adult homicide
rate.
</P>
<P>
   But prison has much less impact on younger people, who are
generally more impulsive and less likely to be sent to prison, and
it was an explosion of homicide by juveniles and young people that
drove violent crime rates skyward in the late 1980s, Blumstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many law-enforcement authorities have insisted that it is really
the improved and more aggressive police work that has reduced
crime, especially in New York City. But Blumstein said he has found
that police arrests per crime from 1980 to 1996 ``were remarkably
flat'' in the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there has been no demonstrable change in police
effectiveness in solving crime,'' he said, and therefore changes in
police practice ``have not been contributing to the growth in
prison population.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Justice Department report suggests that the movement by
the states and the federal government, beginning in 1984, to pass
so-called ``truth in sentencing'' laws has been instrumental in
increasing the length of time served by inmates. These laws were
designed to meet the public's frustration with sentencing practices
that allowed judges to give criminals so-called indeterminate
sentences _ a term of five to 10 years, for example. Inmates were
often released after only a fraction of the time had been served.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to pass tougher laws, which require inmates to serve
substantial portions of their sentences, speeded up after the
federal government passed its own law in 1994 providing grants for
prison construction to states that force inmates to serve 85
percent of their terms. Forty states now have a version of such
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the changes in laws under which inmates now must
serve longer sentences, the Justice Department found other factors
that have also resulted in longer time served for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states have eliminated their parole boards, reacting to
the public's feeling that the boards were too lenient on inmates.
But even in those states where parole boards retain authority over
prison releases, the report said, the average time served by
inmates has increased to 25 months in 1996, up from 23 months in
1990, as the boards themselves have followed the trend toward
tougher punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Overall release rates from state prisons, for those inmates
eligible for release, have dropped to 31 percent in 1996 from 37
percent in 1990, the report found. The release rate for murderers
has fallen fastest, to 5.2 percent in 1996, down from 9.7 percent
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that black prison inmates generally serve
longer time for the same crime than white inmates _ 26 months for
blacks for all types of crimes compared with 24 months for whites.
The difference is most pronounced for rape, with black inmates
serving an average of 70 months while whites serve 56 months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For drug offenses, blacks serve 20 months and whites, 18 months,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But for murder the situation is reversed. Blacks serve an
average of 86 months, while whites serve 90 months. Since most
murders occur within a race _ with most whites killing other whites
and most blacks killing other blacks _ these statistics suggest
that the key factor in sentencing for murder may be the race of the
victim, not the race of the killer, with a lesser value being
placed on the life of black victims.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the report's most surprising finding was the slowness in
the growth in the number of new inmates sent to prison each year,
compared with the rapid increase in the prison population. The
number of new prisoners reached 540,748 in 1996, up 17 percent from
460,739 in 1990. But the total state prison population climbed to
1,100,850, up 60 percent from 689,577 in 1990.

 &HT;    Barnes' inauguration signals start of challenging governorship
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For weeks after his November victory, Roy Barnes
studied inaugural addresses and pored over the utterances of other
governors taking office near the dawn of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   During an annual family holiday outing to New York, he stayed
behind in the hotel room to work on a draft of his own speech while
the rest of the family took in the post-Christmas sights of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with the state Capitol as a backdrop, Barnes today will
deliver his carefully polished inaugural address to an anticipated
crowd of about 5,000 _ a 10-minute oratory that many associates say
Barnes has prepared for his whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal address,'' was all press secretary Gary
Horlacher would reveal about what Georgia's 80th governor will say
as he takes the oath of office. ``It's not a policy wonk speech.
It's an address from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked on the stage by seven of the state's eight living
ex-governors, Barnes will set the tone for his administration,
mindful that it has to follow Zell Miller, the state's most popular
and most heralded governor in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   For Barnes, a folksy Mableton attorney, the traditional outdoor
inauguration under what organizers are praying will be sunny,
albeit brisk, conditions, is a moment that seemed unlikely after
his first bid for governor in 1990 fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   But lest Barnes gets caught up in the loftiness of the moment _
a prospect aides say is unlikely for the man who's spent more than
two decades immersed in the day-to-day minutiae of policy-making in
the Legislature _ the inauguration also signals the start of the
year's legislative session. That's where he'll have to make good on
the campaign promises that put him on the flag-draped stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work ahead is what's going to be tough,'' said Sen. Steve
Thompson (D-Powder Springs), Barnes' floor leader in the Senate,
``because we have the issues of air, water and transportation that
have to be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes won the governorship on promises to implement regional
approaches to combat water pollution, reform managed health care
and come up with new ways to untangle metro Atlanta's traffic
gridlock and clean up smog-laden air that prompted a federal
highway funding cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   After midnight chimes the end of the inaugural ball and a
weekend of festivities, Barnes will face lawmakers likely to battle
his administration over details of his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But for today, the hard work of the next four years will be set
aside as Barnes and Lt. Gov.-elect Mark Taylor start the day with
an ecumenical service at Providence Missionary Baptist Church,
where more than a dozen religious leaders are to offer prayers for
the success of the new administration.
</P>
<P>
   About five miles away and minutes after the final benediction,
all 236 members of the Georgia Legislature will be sworn in for a
two-year term. Then lawmakers will file outside to watch Barnes and
Taylor take their oaths of office.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no parade, but local bands and choral groups will
be positioned to entertain attendees along the trek from the
Georgia State MARTA station to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Offering the invocation will be the Rev. Frank Harrington, the
lieutenant governor's pastor in Atlanta _ and minister to the man
Barnes outpolled to win the governor's job, Republican Guy Millner.
</P>
<P>
   The full House and Senate will be able to look on from their
guest-of-honor positions around the stage erected at the foot of
the West Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy's trying to put his own stamp on (the ceremony),'' said
Senate Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah). ``His life is the
Capitol and the General Assembly. This is a way of him
acknowledging those roots.''

CHOCK-FULL OF CHOCOLATE RECIPES TO DIE FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death by chocolate?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. I don't think it's going to work, in no fault due to one
recent medical dispatch indicating that people who eat chocolate
live longer than those who abstain.
</P>
<P>
   So let that be your resolution for the new year. Start each day
with capsules of vitamin E, vitamin C, a multivitamin, half an
aspirin and then hit yourself in the kisser with a few Hershey
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't get that wild look in your eye. The study did not
indicate that you'll live to be 108 if you brush your teeth with a
Snickers bar after a breakfast of Coco-Puffs with double-fudge
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation is the watch word.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that does not seem to be the sermon preached by Marcel
Desaulniers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate is not just the most deliciously intoxicating
substance in the cosmos, it might be the key to universal peace,''
he has written.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamsburg, Va., chef also wrote ``Death by Chocolate''
and, most recently, ``Death by Chocolate Cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   And he may be right about the soothing properties of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   If everybody in Congress were forced to consume a Chocolate
Boulder before delivering a speech on the floor of the House or
Senate, back-slapping would replace back-stabbing and Henry Hyde
would make a motion to adjourn so he could join Bill Clinton for a
game of croquet on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel's Chocolate Boulders
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 pound semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound butter, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tightly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Toast the pecans on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven. Remove
after 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chop half the semisweet chocolate into quarter-inch pieces. Chop
the rest into eighth-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Heat an inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over
medium heat. Place the quarter-inch pieces in the top half of the
boiler. Heat until completely melted, stirring with a rubber
spatula. (Alice used chocolate chips and melted them in the
microwave.) Transfer the chocolate to a one-quart bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Place the softened butter in the bowl of an electric mixer. Add
the brown sugar and beat three minutes on medium speed. Scrape down
the sides with a spatula, add the eggs and vanilla then beat again,
three minutes on medium speed. Scrape down the sides then beat
again on high speed for two minutes, until smooth. Add the melted
chocolate and beat another minute on medium until incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   With the mixer on slow speed, gradually add the flour, baking
powder, salt and mix for 30 seconds. Stop the mixer motor. Add the
remaining chocolate bits and pecans. Mix on slow speed 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Remove bowl from mixer and stir with the rubber spatula to make
sure everything is thoroughly combined.
</P>
<P>
   On two cookie sheets, form cookies from heaping tablespoons of
the batter.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the sheets on the top and middle shelves of the 350-degree
oven for 12 to 14 minutes. Halfway through the baking process,
reverse places of the cookie sheets on the shelves, and turn each
sheet 180 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   When cookies are done, remove from oven, let cool on the sheets.
This recipe should make three dozen cookies. The chef recommends
they be consumed within two days, sooner if possible.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for Chocolate Boulders is contained in the book
``Best of the Best,'' published by the editors of Food and Wine
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Alice the Artist recently cooked up a batch of Boulders, which
were terrific, then from the same book found this recipe for
chocolate bread pudding, which is sensational. It is from
``Emeril's Creole Christmas'' but would also be terrific as a
dessert at Easter, the Fourth of July or Ground Hog Day.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate Bread Pudding
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, melted
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   8 slices day-old white bread
</P>
<P>
   2 more cups semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Spiced cream
</P>
<P>
   The chef advises that you can substitute any orange-flavored
liqueur for Grand Marnier. If you use liqueurs only for cooking,
buy those tiny, airline-style bottles for sale at the liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the crusts from the bread and cut the slices into
half-inch cubes. You should have about four cups.
</P>
<P>
   Grease a six-cup loaf pan with butter.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the eggs, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, melted
chocolate and Grand Marnier together in a large mixing bowl until
very smooth. Add the half-and-half and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Add the bread and let mixture sit for 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Pour half the mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the top
with the unmelted chocolate chips. Pour the remaining bread mixture
over the chocolate chips. Bake until the pudding is set in the
center, about 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool for five minutes. In 20 minutes Alice's pudding looked
like a punctured football. Not to worry. Because you cut the
pudding into 1-inch-thick slices and cover up all the sins with:
</P>
<P>
   Spiced Cream
</P>
<P>
   1 quart heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Beat the cream with an electric mixer on high speed in a large
mixing bowl for about two minutes. Add the sugar, cinnamon and
nutmeg and beat again until the mixture thickens and forms stiff
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Alice cut this spiced cream recipe in half and had more than
enough to cover the pudding slices.
</P>
<P>
   There. We have done enough for the mental and physical health of
readers for this week.
</P>
<P>
   We are now trying to determine if any health studies have
indicated beneficial results from a diet of pork cracklings,
pepperoni pizza and maple bars.

 By N.R. KLEINFIELD with KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As far back as when he was 16 and first had an
inkling that something was wrong with him, his life appeared to
turn inward and downward. Until the police took him away, he lived
in a basement shoebox of a room in Queens. He watched ``The
Simpsons'' and listened to Pink Floyd and ceaselessly paced the
linoleum floor.
</P>
<P>
   He would prattle on about becoming a business executive, though
he never progressed beyond landing a job at a Dunkin' Donuts that
lasted one day. He yearned to have an adoring wife and family, but
he had no real friends. Adrift in his thoughts, he would wander
through a graveyard and circle the streets of Queens in the dim
hours before dawn. Acquaintances said he could not seem to grasp a
future because he barely had a present.
</P>
<P>
   From the recollections of those who knew him, Andrew Goldstein,
the 29-year-old man accused of pushing Kendra Webdale to her death
under a subway train on Jan. 3, felt forlorn and rootless, an
uncomfortable and frustrated man in the grip of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   When someone with a mental illness kills, images are evoked of a
crazed and wicked population that should be separated from the rest
of society, even though research confirms that the mentally ill are
generally no more dangerous than anyone else. But many of them need
more care than they get. Advocates who work with the mentally ill
have been quick to conclude that Andrew Goldstein was one more
person neglected by the system, that this tragedy reinforces the
notion that there is too little money and too few programs to serve
a needy population that is no longer kept in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, with Goldstein arraigned on a charge of
second-degree murder and under observation at Bellevue Hospital,
and with his past care under investigation by state and city
officials, it is unclear how well or poorly he was served by the
fragmented mental health system and by society. Nor is it clear
whether the death on those subway tracks could have been prevented.
There is always ambiguity and nuance in such stories. Mental
illness defies a tidy narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's life, as pieced together from interviews with people
who knew him and with state and city officials, is indeed untidy.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Queens on Sept. 26, 1969, and grew up on Long
Island. His parents divorced and his father moved to Delaware.
Kevin Canfield, Goldstein's court-appointed lawyer, said that
Goldstein had told him that his father is an anesthesiologist and
his mother a secretary, and that he has two brothers. Canfield said
that Goldstein's parents refused to talk about their son.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein went to the Bronx High School of Science, a top public
high school that admits students through a citywide entrance exam.
``For the most part, he was always alone,'' said Carl Aridas, 29, a
risk management officer who went to high school with him. ``He
played chess but was not particularly good. He also came out to
play softball but he wasn't too athletic.'' He said Goldstein was
focused on his grades and intent on going to medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, something scary happened when he was 16.
According to Canfield, Goldstein told him that he was riding the
bus to school and reading a book when he could no longer make sense
of the sentences before him. He began getting medical and
psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he graduated from Bronx Science in 1987 and enrolled at
the State University of New York at Stony Brook (where he took
courses on and off until as recently as the fall of 1997). While at
college, his schizophrenia intensified (the disease tends to
manifest itself during the college years) and in August 1989 he was
committed to Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, a state-run hospital in
Queens, the first of three commitments there. He was discharged in
September and remained an outpatient. In August 1992, he was
committed a second time and again was discharged the following
month.
</P>
<P>
   Under his disability, he received a monthly Supplemental
Security Income check of about $550. For several months, he shared
an apartment in Kew Garden Hills with Larry Termo, now 51, a
counselor at Incube Inc., a New York organization that helps people
with psychiatric histories get jobs. Goldstein was going to
Vocational Rehabilitation Service in Queens for treatment, though
someone who knew him there said he was flippant and not truly
engaged in the group sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Termo said Goldstein was unreliable about taking his medication.
He took Haldol, an anti-psychotic, and Cogentin, which treats the
trembling side-effects that often accompany Haldol. Termo said
Goldstein complained that the pills made him sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Termo said he also felt Goldstein was in some denial about his
illness. Termo urged him to find work. Goldstein reported to his a
job at Dunkin' Donuts for only one day, Termo said. He insisted he
wanted to start at the top. ``I would talk to him, his eyes would
get wide, he wouldn't quite understand,'' Termo said.
</P>
<P>
   Termo said Goldstein affected a joking manner, but seemed to
derive little pleasure out of life. One of the few times Termo saw
him truly happy was when they watched the sun rise in a Queens
park. This simple exercise put Goldstein in a buoyant mood. While
he was out, he phoned his mother to tell her about how he was
having such fun.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   When Termo would wake up at 7:30 a.m. to get ready for work, he
would often find Goldstein shuffling in the front door after
walking the neighborhood all night. Goldstein told Termo he was
making phone calls to a high school friend in Japan in the middle
of the night. The bills mounted and Termo had to pay some of them.
Once, Termo said, Goldstein ordered a $5,000 stereo that he put on
his mother's charge card. She made him return it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Termo did not feel Goldstein was dangerous, he felt he
was too much for him to handle. He thought he needed close
supervision. ``I couldn't take care of him,'' he said. ``He wasn't
doing anything with his time. I didn't feel it was healthy for him
to be just collecting his checks.'' He asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Goldstein was admitted to Creedmoor's
``crisis unit,'' which gives short-term help to recently discharged
patients who are having serious trouble. While there, he assaulted
a nurse. She was not seriously injured. The assault caused
Goldstein to be committed to Creedmoor for a third time, in
December 1992. This time, he remained until August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Termo said he visited Goldstein once at Creedmoor. Goldstein
told him that someone had a knife and wanted to hurt him. He also
said, ``Look, all of this because of a housing problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When Creedmoor discharged him, his doctors did not feel he was
ready to rejoin the community. So he was assigned to Creedmoor's
12-bed community residence that afforded supervised care. In
November 1994, he was discharged. The State Office of Mental Health
said that it has reviewed his Creedmoor discharge and deemed it
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein went to live at the Leben Home for Adults, a boarding
house containing 371 beds in Elmhurst, Queens. It offers room and
board but no counseling or supervision for someone who is mentally
ill. He lived there for most of four years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his discharge plan, Goldstein was required to
continue counseling and medication, and he received treatment at
the New York Psychotherapy and Counseling Center and, most
recently, at the Bleuler Psychotherapy Center. Officials from both
centers did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canfield, Goldstein told him he would have periodic
hallucinatory episodes. A sense of overwhelming dread would
overtake him. He would see squares moving from the back of his head
to the front. Then his mind would go blank and he could not
remember what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   There were sundry other hospitalizations. He was treated at
Bellevue Hospital Center last May and in August went to Hillside
Hospital in Glen Oaks, Queens, to seek help. He was given a
prescription for 10 days. When the hospital called to see if he was
taking the medication, a hospital spokeswoman said, they learned he
had given them a wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   His only brush with the police was on Dec. 17, 1997. Law
enforcement officials said several youths at a Barnes and Noble in
Forest Hills, Queens, harassed him, and as he left he knocked a
woman into a bookshelf. Her eye and face were injured. He was
arrested on misdemeanor assault charges, though the woman did not
proceed with the case. The police took him to Elmhurst Hospital
Center for evaluation, where he was kept for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After he was arrested last Sunday, police officials said
Goldstein told them that less than a year ago he had tried to push
another woman in front of a subway train in Brooklyn. But the
police could find no record of the event, and his lawyer said that
Goldstein told him that the incident actually involved shoving a
woman while they were on board a subway train.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three months, Goldstein occupied a $300-a-month
basement room in a three-story brick house in Howard Beach, Queens.
He had lived there for six months several years ago, but Sarita
Gonzalez, his landlady, said she made him leave because of slovenly
habits and for nearly causing a fire while cooking. He begged to
come back, and she relented three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Three other men rented companion rooms: John Olson, 20, and
Bernard Nuza, 23, brothers who work at a local bagel shop, and
Isaac Vega, 38, a messenger. They said Goldstein was often
outwardly in a good mood _ they would even call him ``Happy'' _ but
he was desperately lonely and spoke in a disjointed fashion. Late
at night, he would drift past Nuza's room and try to strike up a
conversation. ``I think he just wanted some attention and no one
was willing to give it to him,'' Nuza said. ``He wanted to go out
with us, but he was too weird to go out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein noticed that two of them smoked. He began smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The other renters said he had a strained relationship with his
parents. His father would send him $50 a month, his landlady said.
Olson said he recently had a squabble with his mother over money.
He said that Goldstein would go to her for a few dollars and she
would tell him that was the last time he could see her that month.
``Everything was a negative about mom,'' said Vega.
</P>
<P>
   He never seemed to work. He had resumes in his room that listed
one-month stints as a receptionist at a leasing company, a grillman
at McDonald's and a telemarketer. He had a blank application for a
job at a CVS Pharmacy and financial aid applications to SUNY and
York College.
</P>
<P>
   To pass time, the others said, Goldstein would visit a nearby
cemetery and wander around inspecting the gravestones. Sometimes he
took long walks at night. Mostly, he stayed in his room, watching
TV and listening to music. He especially liked Pink Floyd's ``The
Wall'' which, among other things, is about mental illness and drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a weird guy,'' Olson said. ``Sometimes he would
just laugh out loud for no reason. He would wear the same clothes
for three or four days.''
</P>
<P>
   And he would pace, back and forth across the short parameters of
his room, a dozen times, before pausing and then resuming the
pattern. Nuza said that Goldstein frequently told him he wanted to
be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Goldstein went unannounced to see his old
roommate, Larry Termo. They went to a Wendy's restaurant. Goldstein
had a Coke and Termo a coffee. Goldstein was broke, so Termo paid.
</P>
<P>
   Termo thought Goldstein seemed more together and, needing the
money, he mentioned that maybe he should move back in with him.
Goldstein quickly warmed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Termo told him, ``Listen Andy, you're not going to become an
executive right away. You're going to have to take your medication
and see a counselor and acquire some skills.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Goldstein replied, ``Larry, you're really helping me.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not see him again. Two weeks ago, he left a message on
Termo's answering machine. He said he would like to get together
again. He said maybe they could go to Wendy's. He did not leave a
number, and Termo was unable to return the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was an immature young kid who wasn't following his
therapy and was in denial that he needed therapy,'' Termo said. ``I
always felt he would learn the hard way, but not like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The other renters in the Queens basement said that recently he
had stopped taking his medication. Canfield said Goldstein told him
that his medication left him disassociated and lethargic and his
muscles stiff. Newer anti-psychotic drugs don't have the severe
side-effects of the older generations, but they are more costly.
``Andy wanted to be institutionalized,'' Canfield said. ``He knew
his life was terribly painful for himself and his family. The
tragedy is that Andrew was on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Vega said Goldstein felt particularly unwanted during the
holidays. He said that the day before he was arrested he went to
the hospital to have his ankle looked at, though there was nothing
wrong with it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who work with the mentally ill said that Goldstein seemed
poorly served by the system. ``We're really concerned that there
are huge gaps in the mental health system,'' said Jody Silver,
director of advocacy for Community Access Inc., a Manhattan program
that provides supported housing for people with psychiatric
disabilities. ``He had a place to live but he didn't have support.
It sounds like he needed a program with an intensive support
service, where he would be visited daily by a case worker who would
monitor his medication and help him with his life. He was totally
alone in the community. This person was grossly underserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Schwartz, the assistant executive director at Venture House,
a so-called clubhouse for the severely mentally ill in Queens where
people can come to socialize and get peer support, said, ``It
doesn't seem like anyone was going out of their way to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he has not reviewed Goldstein's records, Neal Cohen, the
city's mental health commissioner, said he could not gauge how well
the system served him. He agreed that there remain funding issues.
``We have by no means completed the construction of the community
mental health system,'' he said. But he felt coordination among a
fragmented system was more vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think it's less an issue of more services
than it is an issue of coordination among the services we have,''
he said. ``When someone drops out with a history of serious mental
illness, we want the community program to make a serious effort to
return the person to the program. That's something that doesn't
just come with funding. It comes with a culture of how you care for
people with serious mental illness.''

   He said that the city plans to start a pilot program called the
``Alert Program'' in the next few months. Five Manhattan hospitals
will be linked to a central data base containing treatment
information about anyone who is mentally ill and appears at the

   At around 10 o'clock on Jan. 3, police officials said, Andrew

   By 5 p.m., he had made his way to the northbound platform of the

south end of the station. He asked her the time.

POLICE OFFICER WHO INTERROGATED BIKO IS DENIED AMNESTY
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG _ A former police officer who said he helped tackle
the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko and smash his head into a
wall when Biko was in custody in 1977 has been denied amnesty by
the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has not yet released its findings, but George
Bizos, a lawyer for the Biko family, said it had ruled that no
amnesty could be granted because the police officer had not
admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gideon Niewhoudt, and the four other officers
involved in Biko's interrogation told the commission that Biko had
attacked them after he had been forced to stand. They said they had
been defending themselves when they jumped on him.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the incident, Biko, naked, disoriented and suffering
from severe head injuries, was driven 750 miles across South Africa
for medical treatment. He died before he got any, on Sept. 12,
1977.
</P>
<P>
   His case outraged the world and helped galvanize the
anti-apartheid movement. Although an investigation at the time
cleared the police officers of any wrongdoing, it became clear that
an obviously injured Biko had spent days manacled to window bars
before dying alone on the floor of a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened to him has been an enduring secret. When
the five officers involved in his interrogation applied for amnesty
in 1996, many South Africans hoped they would finally hear a full
explanation of how Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness
Movement, had died.
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the question of whether Niewhoudt, who is in jail
for other crimes, is believable, the commission's decision focuses
on an issue that was particularly galling to the Biko family: None
of the police officers accepted blame for Biko's death or confessed
to any criminal behavior.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ If he could take control of the millions of
dollars Mexico spends each year to combat drug trafficking, Miguel
Gonzalez Espinosa would spend a little less of it on high-tech,
heavily armed operations at airports and along the border, aimed at
stopping the flow of drugs from Colombia on their way to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who proudly calls himself a recovering alcoholic,
directs a small drug rehabilitation center in the downtrodden
neighborhood that surrounds the city's Basilica de Guadalupe. He
sees firsthand the toll taken by a less-talked-about, but
increasingly damaging problem: the rise in drug abuse _ especially
cocaine and crack _ among Mexican youth.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last two months, his residential treatment center,
which relies entirely on private donations, has taken in 12 new
clients and is running above capacity, with 40 residents.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Gloria Acevedo, 15, who had been living on the
streets for two years, stealing and working as a prostitute to
support her cocaine habit. Marco Antonio Salazar, 19, arrived
stoned after he beat up his sister and was kicked out by his
parents. And an addiction to crack led Isaac Perez, 22, to quit his
job, sell all his belongings and steal cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a drug crisis up to our necks,'' said Gonzalez,
president of the Fundacion Dr. Sergio Berumen, the residential
treatment program named for a philanthropist who gave seed money
for the center. ``When traffickers cannot get their drugs across
the border, they sell it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been recognized for years as a major transit station
for drugs. More than half of the cocaine smuggled into the United
States passes through Mexico, as well as much of the heroin and
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   At a U.N. meeting about the drug trade last summer, President
Ernesto Zedillo characterized his country's crisis as one that is
generated by drug consumer nations, especially the United States.
There are new signs, however, that the number of Mexican consumers
is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 report by the Ministry of Health says that in the last
six years cocaine use has quadrupled among Mexicans ages 12 to 19.
Among patients at government-run treatment centers in Mexico City,
whose numbers have increased from 4,500 to 13,500 in the last six
years, marijuana remains the drug of choice for most adolescents,
health officials report. But cocaine, particularly crack, ranked
second _ before cheaper choices like glue and paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   The government has responded to the problem with increased
funding to its own drug treatment centers. It has also created a
public service campaign called ``Live Without Drugs.'' The campaign
includes radio and television announcements, educational programs
in schools and a Web site that answers questions about drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In cities across the country, including Culiacan, Ciudad
Victoria, San Luis Potosi and Hermosillo, the police have proposed
a program known as Operation Backpack, which would allow them to
search students for drugs and weapons, although some parents have
expressed reservations. Parents have started community patrols
around school playgrounds and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the voracious consumption of drugs in the United
States, Mexico's drug problem remains small. But to Gonzalez even
one drug-addicted child is too many. ``Every day I see how drugs
are destroying young people,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, drug abuse in Mexico is spreading
fastest in poor communities where unemployment is high and
education levels are low, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Acevedo, a flirtatious girl who dyes her hair strawberry
blond and wears sparkly pink lipstick, ran away from a shattered
family. She said her mother, a waitress, and her father, a street
vendor, began using drugs when she was just an infant. Both would
stay away from home for days at a time, leaving her to beg for food
from neighbors for herself and her three younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, she said, she began stealing her parents' drugs and
hiding in the cluster of fruit trees in her backyard to get high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ever got high, I thought, this is what life
is supposed to be,'' she said. ``I had found something that would
fill the emptiness.''
</P>
<P>
   She ran away at 12 and lived in train stations or abandoned
offices. Last October she nearly died from an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was drugs,'' she recalled. ``Suffering for me was
when I didn't have anything to get to make me high.''
</P>
<P>
   When it opened 10 years ago, the Fundacion Dr. Sergio Berumen
primarily served alcoholic adults, who needed a place to dry out so
they could go home to their families. Over the last five years,
Gonzalez said, younger people started coming for help, and they
were addicted to drugs, not alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gonzalez said, more than 80 percent of the residents are
drug addicts between 13 and 20. The white metal front door is
almost always left open, Gonzalez said. Residents are free to leave
anytime they please.
</P>
<P>
   Group meetings are held five times a day for the residents to
talk with one another about their addictions and any other
distress.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting, the 19-year-old Salazar spoke from the
podium for more than 15 minutes. This time of year is especially
hard for him, he said, echoing the feelings of many in the room.
</P>
<P>
   It hurt, he said, that he could not celebrate the holidays with
his 8-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be with my family,'' he said. ``But I am afraid of
what I would do if someone offered me drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if I will ever feel ready to go home.''

LINCOLN CENTER MAY SELL A JASPER JOHNS ARTWORK  
 (EXCLUSIVE)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is considering
selling Jasper Johns' only public artwork, the monumental
``Numbers, 1964,'' in hopes of raising what some people estimate
could be as much as $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first time Lincoln Center had parted with work
from its impressive holdings, and opponents of the sale are worried
about the implications of a sale.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is faced with increasingly heavy production and
maintenance costs, and some fear that if it sells ``Numbers,'' it
might also sell other works on its central plaza and in the lobbies
of its buildings. The art, which thousands of music, theater and
ballet devotees see year-round, includes pieces by Henry Moore,
Elie Nadelman, Marc Chagall and David Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years ``Numbers'' has graced the lobby of the New York
State Theater. It was commissioned by one of the building's
architects, Philip Johnson, and has always hung in the spot
selected by Johnson and Johns.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the possible sale of ``Numbers,'' an imposing
9-foot-by-7-foot painting of Johns' signature gridded numbers, has
been circulating around the art world for months.
</P>
<P>
   In October Beverly Sills, Lincoln Center's chairwoman, and
Nathan Leventhal, its president, wrote to the artist: ``Word has
reached us you are upset as a result of hearing rumors that Lincoln
Center was about to sell your magnificent work `Numbers' which is
proudly displayed in the New York State Theater. This is not the
case.'' The letter said that Lincoln Center had been approached by
``several individuals,'' but that the board had ``no intention of
considering these offers or seeking others.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, however, Leventhal and Ms. Sills wrote Johns
again, saying that ``because the pressure continued to increase
from several would-be buyers we felt we had a fiduciary obligation
to inform the full Lincoln Center board of directors of these
expressions of interest. At a Dec. 14 meeting the board unanimously
decided to consider selling the painting.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Leventhal said no firm offer had been made.
But whatever the status of a possible deal, opposition has been
mounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appalling,'' said Johnson, adding that he did not
know the details of a possible sale, only that Ms. Sills and
Leventhal had scheduled four different dates to meet with him, but
that ``the meeting was put off all four times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale of this painting is a disservice to artists, to art,
to architecture, to the architectural profession and to the
public,'' Johnson added. ``It was commissioned for the building and
is by the greatest American artist of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johns, in a letter he faxed on Saturday to Ms. Sills and
Leventhal, wrote: ``I realize that I am not a disinterested
observer of these maneuvers, but I do feel obliged to state my
conviction that stripping our public spaces of their salable
features would seem shortsighted and even irresponsible. I do not
think that `pressure ... from ... would-be buyers' has any
relevance to that idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers'' is historically significant because it is the
largest work in his numbers motif, and the only one in which each
number is a separate unit, on an individual stretcher, fashioned
from a material called Sculpmetal and then bolted to other units.
Because the painting was made specifically for the New York State
Theater, home to the New York City Ballet and the New York City
Opera, Johns derived the measure for the numbered grids from the
foot length of the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Johns said he could not remember what he
was paid for the painting. But he clearly remembers wearing a hard
hat when he visited the site while the building was still under
construction, to see where his piece would hang. ``I made the work
based on the site,'' he said. ``Since it's my only public
commission, it is of great importance to me. I would like it to
stay where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the prospect of raising more than $15 million is alluring
to the board of Lincoln Center. The center has mounting expenses
because of the rising costs of its productions and festivals as
well as the maintenance of its aging buildings. But Leventhal said
it was too early to discuss the specifics of the proceeds of a
sale, because ``if there is an offer, I don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say what the money could be used for other than
to ensure that ``we will continue to do what's necessary to promote
Lincoln Center.'' He did, however, say that money from a sale would
not go toward the rising cost of operating the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Theater is owned by the city and leased to
Lincoln Center, which in turn leases it to the City Center of Music
and Drama Inc., the original parent of the City Ballet and City
Opera. But Leventhal said the artwork within the theater belongs to
Lincoln Center and is the center's to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers'' was bought through a fund set up by the Albert A.
List Foundation, an organization that supports the arts. Leventhal
said he had letters from Vera List, Albert's widow, endorsing the
sale. On Saturday, Mrs. List said she understood Lincoln Center's
reasons for wanting to part with ``Numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Johns is a museum piece,'' she said. ``But I still hope
they use the returns to buy contemporary art, because it enhances
the environment.'' While she said she had no idea who was
interested in buying the painting or how much it would bring, she
added, ``I assume it is worth a goodly sum of money and Lincoln
Center certainly needs money.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other people associated with Lincoln Center are
strongly against a sale. ``We at the New York City Ballet oppose
the sale of the painting,'' said Christopher Ramsey, the company's
director of external affairs. ``Eugene P. Grisanti, a member of the
ballet's board, spoke out forcefully against it at the most recent
board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the museum world, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, expressed concerns over the safety of the painting,
which hangs on the lobby's north wall with a protective cordon of
red velvet ropes. Security isn't tight enough, some say. Others
believe that despite the ropes, people in the crowded lobby might
bump into the work.
</P>
<P>
   But those who believe it should stay where it is point out that
the artist chose to work with Sculpmetal because of its durability,
rather than using oil paint and encaustic, an ancient technique
involving pigment suspended in melted wax, which Johns is credited
with reviving.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a draft letter to Leventhal and Richard Schwartz, vice
chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts, Kirk Varnedoe,
the chief curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern
Art and a member of an advisory committee to Lincoln Center, wrote:
``One of the joys of any culture, and particularly of any
metropolitan area, is the possibility of encountering art outside
the museum, in a civic space. This ideal was the motivating
principle behind the series of commissions initiated as part of the
Lincoln Center project.''
</P>
<P>
   To sell this artwork for profit, Varnedoe continued, would be
``betraying'' the understanding under which the artist made the
work. ``The violation of trust would be bad enough were the piece
transferred to a museum; but 10 times worse if it were sold into
private hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Few museums would have the money to buy a painting as expensive
as this without the help of a patron. Leventhal declined to say how
much he believed the painting was worth, and said no value had been
determined. Officials at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses
said that they had been approached by Lincoln Center recently to
appraise the work.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the painting's large size and the recent market for
Johns' work, some of the auction experts said ``Numbers'' was worth
about $10 million. Several people who have had reports from Lincoln
Center board members, though, said the price being offered was much
higher: $15 million, after a previous offer of $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in the art world about a buyer has included David
Geffen, the Hollywood entertainment executive, who has paid
exceptionally high prices for contemporary artworks and who might
ultimately give ``Numbers'' to the Los Angeles Museum of
Contemporary Art, where he is a trustee and a building is named
after him. (Reached by phone at the weekend, Geffen denied any
interest in buying the painting.)
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that Lincoln Center has approached the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in
Manhattan, though no one wanted to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Johns' work has long been coveted by museums around the world.
Three years ago the Museum of Modern Art held a much acclaimed
Johns retrospective. And in October the Metropolitan Museum
acquired its first Johns, ``White Flag,'' from 1955, the second in
a series that he based on the American flag. The painting came
directly from the artist's collection.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fate of ``Numbers,'' the loudest protesters firmly
believe Lincoln Center has no business moving it, no matter what
the offers. ``It was created for the theater,'' Ramsey said. ``And
that dictates where it should stay.''

IRAQ PUTS OFF VOTE OF DEFIANCE AGAINST U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ After more than a month of rising defiance, the
Iraqi government postponed a vote Sunday in which its Parliament
had appeared ready to take further steps along a collision course
with its Western foes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parliament issued only a mild statement critical of
last month's American-led air strikes against Iraq. Those attacks
prompted calls from some legislators for measures that would have
been a direct challenge to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for the postponement, which came at the end
of a special two-day session. But the legislative body is an
instrument of President Saddam Hussein's government, and it appears
that Baghdad decided to skirt a further confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before Sunday's vote, the majority of the 250-member
Parliament appeared ready to formally reject several of the U.N.
resolutions that were imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Parliament adopted a resolution calling only for
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which have served as bases for Western
military operations against Iraq, to pay reparations for the damage
caused by last month's air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of Parliament said consideration of tougher
measures, including the possible repudiation of Iraq's border with
Kuwait, could resume by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   And the legislators did reinforce the government's rejection of
Western-imposed no-flight zones over large parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the Iraqi reaction to the American and British air
strikes had followed an increasingly confrontational path. Since
the attacks ended on Dec. 19, the Iraqi government has zeroed in
its air defenses on American warplanes and called on Arabs to rise
up against governments in the region aligned with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps have prompted renewed warnings from the West,
including a statement this weekend by Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain, on an official visit to Kuwait, that warned of further
military action if Iraq once again appeared to be threatening its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By setting aside a more confrontational message, Iraq may have
been trying to limit hostility from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the air strikes ended last month, Iraqi frustration over a
lack of Arab backing has been mounting. While Arab governments
remain opposed to the air strikes, they have expressed outright
hostility toward Saddam, whom they distinguish from the Iraqi
people, more than at any time since the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of Arab foreign ministers has been scheduled for Jan.
24, and the tensions over Iraq are expected to be high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their recent criticism of Saddam, even some countries
critical of Iraq have hinted that they might use the session to
push for an easing of the economic sanctions that the United
Nations has imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in several Saudi-owned newspapers said Sunday that Saudi
Arabia was ready to press for such a move as long as military
pressure against Baghdad continued.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf of Iraq sought at a news
conference Sunday evening in Baghdad to make the most of such
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Saudi Arabia to end its cooperation with the
American and British enforcement of the no-flight zone over
southern Iraq, and on Arab countries to lift economic sanctions
unilaterally at the coming meeting.

THIS WEEK WILL HAVE A THEME FOR A PROBABLE GORE CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While still months from officially declaring
himself a presidential candidate, Vice President Al Gore is
scheduled to announce a series of initiatives this week that his
aides say will be major themes of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore will unveil the administration's budget request for
community planning programs. Tuesday, he will propose tax
incentives for education and job training programs. Wednesday, he
will award Empowerment Zone grants and speak to a Jewish group in
New York in support of the Israeli peace process. Thursday and
Friday, he will be the host for officials from 45 countries at a
conference to promote open trade.
</P>
<P>
   These issues may sound familiar, as they have been hallmarks of
the Clinton administration. But as the backbone of Gore's campaign,
they clearly define him as an extension of Clinton, a calculation
that suggests the vice president is confident voters will reward
him for the administration's successes but not blame him for the
president's personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   But by offering only mild criticism of the behavior threatening
to drive Clinton from office, Gore seems willing to endure some
criticism. Already, two Republican presidential hopefuls, Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, and Sen.r John McCain
of Arizona, have denounced Gore as an apologist for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the electoral clock is ticking, we are still more
than two years away from the term of the next president,'' Gore
said Sunday in an interview. ``So while political speculation is
understandable and omnipresent, for my part, I'm going to continue
to focus on my work as vice president and put off for quite some
time into the future a formal announcement of my candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say he is betting that with the stars aligned as
they are _ a robust national economy, an enormously popular
president and a Clinton-Gore fund-raising apparatus already tapping
Democratic donors for the $20 million Gore expects to raise by
December _ the vice president risks nothing by not stepping out
from behind Clinton, even with the impeachment trial set to begin
this week.
</P>
<P>
   That means that people waiting to learn more about Al Gore, the
presidential aspirant, had better settle in for Al Gore, the vice
president, for many months to come. For now, he is not willing to
articulate so much as a sentence about his own personal values or
priorities, beyond the work at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how I define my campaign and myself as a
candidate,'' Gore said. ``With all due respect, I would like to
defer a discussion of my candidacy until I have formally announced
as a candidate. I am well aware that the work which the president
and I do has all manner of political resonance, and that's as it
should be in this system. But I'm going to focus on the substance
of that work and on the impact it has on the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's unwillingness to begin defining himself as a candidate
may have had an impact at least on potential opponents. Two
potential Democratic contenders, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, have decided not to run, and aides to
Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said
he was unlikely to try.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey, has formed an
exploratory committee. And Sen.r John Kerry of Massachusetts and
the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said they were considering a run.
</P>
<P>
   But none seems to have the fund-raising power or grass-roots
organization that Gore has built in recent years as an active
campaigner for other Democrats. He has built especially strong
contacts in the four states that will have a large influence in
producing the party nominees by virtue of their early caucuses and
primaries _ Iowa, New Hampshire, New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial, to be sure, remains an uncertainty. Even
so, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said
Sunday in an interview that he did not believe that anything that
happened to Clinton ``would have any effect at all on the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not entirely sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that he would not much be affected,'' Sen. Joseph
I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one of the first Democrats to
criticize the president's moral judgment, said in an interview.
``But I'm only guessing.''

   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ In an election condemned by the United
States and Europe before it was even held, President Nursultan
Nazarbayev, who has led Kazakhstan since Soviet times, ran for a
fresh seven-year term Sunday against three virtual unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   The official turnout in this Central Asian nation, which has
been courted by the West because of its large energy reserves, was
86 percent. Official results were expected on Monday, and
presidential aides said they hoped Nazarbayev would win by an 80
percent margin. Nazarbayev's chief rival, former Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin, was disqualified from running.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Astana, Nazarbayev rejected vote-rigging
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the U.S. State Department declared the election
unfair. The Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
West's main election-monitoring agency in the region, said it would
not recognize the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the turnout figure and the tallies for all the candidates
have clearly been determined way in advance, and the only thing
interesting in this campaign is whether Nazarbayev receives 90
percent or below,'' said a Western diplomat.

VOTING IN NIGERIA GETS HIGH MARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Officials monitoring Nigeria's countrywide
elections said Sunday that the voting had been generally peaceful,
well organized and represented an improvement over last month's
local elections and another positive step toward the presidential
contest next month.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results in the races for governors and legislators
in 35 of 36 states on Saturday showed that Nigeria's three
political parties scored victories in their ethnic and geographic
bases. Monitors said that the turnout was lower than in last
month's local elections, particularly in the Muslim-dominated,
Hausa-speaking north.
</P>
<P>
   The leading party, the People's Democratic Party, continued to
solidify its national standing by winning the governor's race in
more than half the states. The results further strengthened the
likelihood that Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, the party's most prominent
member, would become the next president of Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of how dramatically Nigeria's political climate
has changed in the six months since the sudden death of the
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha that the governor-elect in Lagos state,
Bola Tinubu, is a former exile who spent the last four years in
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The journey to today's triumph has been rough and difficult,''
said Tinubu, dressed in a navy blue aso oke, the traditional garb
of Nigeria's southern Yoruba people, in his victory speech.
</P>
<P>
   Tinubu, a former senator, returned to Nigeria after Abacha's
successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, began a series of political
reforms scheduled to culminate in a handover to a civilian
government in May. His return came just after the sudden death in
July in prison of Moshood Abiola, the billionaire Yoruba and Muslim
businessman who succeeded in unifying this ethnically and
religiously divided country of 108 million, but whose victory in
the 1993 presidential elections was annulled by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a victory for pro-democracy forces,'' said Tokunbo
Afikuyomi, another former exile who was among hundreds dancing to
Kool and the Gang's ``Celebration'' in Tinubu's house. ``It shows
that Abiola lives on.''
</P>
<P>
   Their great hope mixed with great skepticism, Nigerians cast
ballots last month in elections that domestic and foreign monitors
judged free and fair, though marked by widespread logistical
problems and at least 10 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, about 100 officials from embassies and
American and British election-monitoring organizations, as well as
hundreds of Nigerians, fanned out across the country to observe
ballots that were cast in the open, on sidewalks and under trees,
at simple wooden tables on which two rocks typically held down
posters that read ``polling station.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitors said the voting was more orderly than last month's.
Election officials were better trained and more responsive to
complaints, security around polling stations had improved, and
voting areas were more clearly defined. Elections have been held in
the past, but they were often rigged by the military, which has
ruled Nigeria for all but 10 years since independence from Britain
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a better conduct of the polling,'' said K.
Srinivasan, leader of a monitoring team for the Commonwealth of
Britain and its former colonies. ``In many places a considerable
improvement. Orderly, well-organized and some lessons had been
learned. It's another step toward the road to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections were held in all but one of the 36 states; they were
canceled in Bayelsa, in the Niger Delta region, where at least 20
people have been killed recently in protests over the distribution
of oil wealth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The People's Democratic Party, a centrist party that won 60
percent of the races last month, is composed of many former
opponents of Abacha. Obasanjo, president from 1976 to 1979 and the
only military ruler to have given up power to a civilian
government, is considered such a formidable front-runner that the
two other parties have said they will present a common challenger.
</P>
<P>
   While the Alliance for Democracy and the All People's Party are
ideologically opposed, they complement each other geographically.
The Yoruba-dominated Alliance for Democracy, which is made up of
many former supporters of Abiola, won the governor's seat in six
states in its southwest base. By contrast, many former allies of
Abacha belong to the All People's Party, which won a handful of
gubernatorial positions in northern and central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors said that the turnout appeared low in Saturday's
elections, especially in the central and northern states, where at
some stations only 5 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
They attributed the decrease from last month in part to the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 agents with the Transition Monitoring Group, an
umbrella organization of 45 Nigerian organizations observing the
elections, issued generally positive reports, said Clement Nwankwo,
the group's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were still isolated cases of violence and some
reports of ballot boxes being stolen by party supporters,'' Nwankwo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also warned that there were inconsistent practices at
polling stations, a fact that could open the door to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One uses ink, the other doesn't,'' Srinivasan said. ``One
folds the paper before giving it to the voter, and another
doesn't.''

 &HT;    A brutal game for Brunell
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With his left ankle swollen and his
psyche scarred, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell
limped away from Sunday's divisional-round playoff defeat here
Sunday looking like a worthy candidate for the red badge of
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for much of the four hours that preceded
Brunell's depature from Giants Stadium, the six-year veteran played
as if he was trying to win the booby prize instead of a spot in the
AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances to get points on the board, and we had some big
plays, but we also had some costly turnovers that really hurt us,''
Brunell said following the 34-24 loss.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other player on the Jacksonville offense, Brunell
was in the middle of all three _ the chances, the cheers and the
choking.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on a balky ankle that had hobbled him the final month of
the regular season, and which required a painkiller injection for a
second consecutive week in the playoffs, he completed only 12 of 31
passes for 156 yards. Offsetting his three touchdown passes were a
like number of interceptions. His passer rating for the game was a
miniscule 46.0 and, to anyone who witnessed his performance, that
number doesn't lie.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was a day when Brunell was alternately brilliant
and boneheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Brunell's ankle injury precluded him from
scrambling or using his feet to buy time in the pocket, Jets
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick primarily relied on a scheme
that placed more emphasis on covering than rushing. In the New York
``nickel'' packages, there often were only two defensive linemen on
the field. One neat wrinkle installed by Belichick featured five
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell there were times he was confused and other
instances where he simply had nowhere to go with the ball,'' said
Jets strongside linebacker Mo Lewis, the former University of
Georgia standout. ``We just wanted to drop people and force him to
sit in the pocket. Going in, we figured his running wouldn't be too
much of a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Brunell ran only twice, for nine yards.
</P>
<P>
   More shocking was Brunell's lack of accuracy. A 52-yard bomb to
wide receiver Jimmy Smith on the final play of the first half was a
superb touch pass, perfectly placed over Jets cornerback Otis Smith
and free safety Jerome Henderson. A 19-yarder to Keenan McCardell
for a touchdown on third-and-15 showed nice arm strength. But
Brunell had consecutive completions only three times, was
scatterarmed much of the afternoon and had five throwaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he acknowledged, ``a long day.''

 &HT;    Jets shoot down Jaguars
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Long before it was a buzz phrase among
those harkening to a purer time in sports, Bill Parcells was old
school. The New York Jets coach embraced a time-honored football
theory that if you've got a big gun in a big game, you shoot it as
often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In his team's 34-24 victory over Jacksonville on Sunday
afternoon, Parcells took that adage one step further, blasting away
at an overmatched Jaguars defense with a relentless double-barreled
attack that produced big plays and a berth in the AFC championship
game against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells was the precision marksman, his bullets were Jets
tailback Curtis Martin and wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parcells just kept loading and reloading those guys,'' said
Jaguars linebacker Kevin Hardy. ``Those two were shooting holes in
us all day.''
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play, Martin caught a 17-yard screen pass
from Vinny Testaverde. On the second snap, the quarterback fired a
7-yard sideline pass to Johnson. Those two plays were simply an
auguring of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pair combined to touch the ball on 53 of New York's 77
snaps, accounted for 331 of 429 yards and 21 of 29 first downs, and
scored all four Jets touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martin had 42 ''touches'' for 182 yards. He rushed 36 times
for 124 yards, caught six passes for 58 yards and produced 13 first
downs. Twice he scored in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _ The loquacious Johnson generated 149 yards on 11 ''touches,''
including nine catches for 121 yards. He scored the game's first
touchdown on a 21-yard reception. With less than a minute to play
in the second quarter, he sprinted to an 11-yard touchdown on a
clever end-around play. The same running play netted the Jets a key
first down in the fourth quarter and came on the same drive when
Johnson moved the chains with a 20-yard catch on third-and-14.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm proud of some of the little things I contributed,
too,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The first overall player selected in the '96 draft finished the
game off with a flourish, intercepting Mark Brunell's desperation
last-second heave after Parcells inserted him as an extra defensive
back. He also made the key recovery of a second-quarter fumble and
veterans from both clubs suggested the unusual play was the game's
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   So versatile was his offense that Parcells, the first coach in
NFL history to lead three different teams to a conference
championship game, even offered rare praise. That the Jets were
unable to close out the Jaguars could be attributed to a defense
that became too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 17-0, the Jets were stunned by Jimmy Smith's 52-yard
touchdown catch on the final play of the first half. They also
surrendered an 88-yard kickoff return to Reggie Barlow, a play that
led to a Jaguars touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' exuberance over his offense wasn't quite overshadowed
by those defensive lapses, but he wasn't happy with them and
acknowledged the Jets will have to improve by next Sunday to have
any chance of upsetting the Broncos. Still, the man many feel is
the best big-game coach in recent league history, has been around
long enough to know you allow yourself at least a few hours to
enjoy a playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're coaching a team that hadn't posted one
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, it wasn't aesthetically perfect in a lot of areas,''
Parcells said. ''But let's face it, that is a pretty good win for
this franchise.''

HONG KONG DEMOCRATS SPLIT ON ELECTIVE ROUTE VS. STREET PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Eight months after it won a resounding victory in
legislative elections here, Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement is
divided over whether the Democratic Party should abandon elective
politics and take its cause to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary meeting Sunday, a group of young party
members called on their leaders, in effect, to man the barricades.
Declaring that Hong Kong's government was strangling the growth of
democracy here, the young members said the party should focus on
mobilizing ``the masses'' rather than running for seats on Hong
Kong's largely toothless Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having one or two more seats won't change anything,'' said
Andrew To, a leader of the so-called Young Turks. ``All democratic
movements come from the masses on the streets. You need martyrs to
change the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a call to arms is startling in Hong Kong, where politics is
hardly a contact sport and where even the most strident opposition
leaders have tried to work within the system. But these are
frustrating times for this former British colony, which reverted to
Chinese rule just as Asia was slipping into recession.
</P>
<P>
   As Hong Kong's government searches for a way out of its worst
economic crisis since World War II, democratic leaders say it has
hobbled the pace of reform and marginalized its chief advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Democratic Party won 43 percent of the vote in the
elections last May _ the most of any party _ it received just 13 of
the 60 seats in the Legislative Council under Hong Kong's electoral
laws. And the party's leaders have been granted only two meetings
with Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, a conservative
shipping magnate appointed by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After the second meeting, on Saturday, the party's chairman,
Martin Lee, lashed out at Tung, calling him a ``benign dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tung doesn't believe in democracy, and it is no surprise
that his administration is devoted to thwarting it,'' said Lee, a
lawyer whose proper manner and professorial mien belied his
fighting words.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the leaders of the Democratic Party seem to
spend less time fighting Tung than squabbling among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who holds a seat in the Legislative Council, says his party
must continue to work within the system because it was elected by
the voters to do that. He notes that when the Chinese government
dissolved the last freely elected Legislative Council on July 1,
1997, the pro-democracy leaders vowed to regain their
representation.
</P>
<P>
   But To, a 32-year-old university lecturer, said the legislature
``wastes time debating unimportant issues.'' He said the party
should focus instead on organizing street protests and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lee nor To thinks that the party will fracture.
Political experts agreed that a split was unlikely. For one, it is
not clear how many parties a politically apathetic Hong Kong can
support. In a city of 2.7 million voters, the Democratic Party has
only 600 members.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Young Turks lack a recognized leader like Lee, who
travels the world advocating democracy in Hong Kong. With so few
elective offices here, the young members are unlikely to have one
soon. Experts said that lack of opportunity explains their
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Council itself plays second fiddle to the strong
executive branch. It cannot, for instance, even introduce
legislation without Tung's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And within the legislature, Tung plays favorites, pro-democracy
leaders said. While he has little to do with the democrats, they
said he heaps praise on Hong Kong's leading pro-Beijing party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that the democrats don't have a
dialogue with Beijing,'' said Joseph Cheng, a professor of
political science at the City University of Hong Kong. ``In order
to have an influence on the government of Hong Kong, they must have
legitimacy with Beijing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In many ways, the democrats are victims of unexpected
circumstances. The party won votes by promising to be a bulwark
against Chinese interference in Hong Kong. But Beijing has for the
most part stayed out of Hong Kong's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The democrats have also been thrown on their heels by the Asian
financial crisis. In the prosperous days before the handover, the
Democratic Party espoused the same free-market ideas as the
government. But now, with unemployment running at record levels,
the younger members are demanding that the party fight for working
people.
</P>
<P>
   With Democratic Party leaders like Lee, a highly paid lawyer, it
is not a natural fit. ``Despite its grass-roots image, the leaders
of the party are quite well-off people,'' Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's meeting, both factions of the party were eager to
play down their differences. ``People expressed their views
frankly, but there were no fireworks, as many expected,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the party would remain in the Legislative Council,
while at the same time organizing more protests and rallies. ``The
demonstrations must be well-planned rather than wildcat affairs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   To said the leaders agreed to work for the interests of
working-class as well as middle-class voters. But he added that the
meeting did not resolve the deeper questions about the future of
Hong Kong's democracy movement. ``Although we had long hours of
debate, you can't change a party overnight,'' he said.

PARCELLS' HAUNTING OPPORTUNITY IN DENVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs for story slugged FBN-JETS-BRONCOS on sports digest.) 
 (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It didn't take long. The third or fourth
question for Bill Parcells after the Jets' 34-24 victory over the
Jaguars on Sunday involved his thoughts on the American Conference
championship game next Sunday in Denver, where on Saturday the
Broncos, with Terrell Davis galloping for 199 yards, stomped the
Dolphins by 38-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play like they did against Miami, it'll be hard for
anybody to beat 'em,'' Parcells said. ``We're going to prepare and
do the best we can, but we have to improve to beat 'em. They're the
world champions, so we'll be hard pressed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Those diplomatic words are about all anybody would expect
Parcells to say about how the Jets will try to rope, brand and
break the Broncos, especially in Mile High Stadium, where the
Broncos are 18-0 since losing to the Jaguars in the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Broncos are beatable; The Giants showed that.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a haunting opportunity for Parcells and these Jets
to do in Denver what Parcells and his 1990 Giants did in San
Francisco by dethroning the 49ers, who were then going for record
Super Bowl three-peat, in that season's National Conference title
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought about that,'' Parcells said, ``but what
happened with the Giants eight years ago is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Not when the same coach is planning how a similar
underdog team with a similar ball-control offense will be trying to
dominate the time of possession in order to keep the ball away from
the reigning Super Bowl champions, who have a similar classic
quarterback: John Elway now, Joe Montana then.
</P>
<P>
   Time of possession made the difference Sunday _ nearly 40
minutes for the Jets, slightly more than 20 for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   And after those 1990 Giants upset the 49ers, 15-13, on Matt
Bahr's five field goals, time of possession is why those Giants
edged the Buffalo Bills, 20-19, in Super Bowl XXV _ roughly 40
minutes for the Giants, roughly 20 for the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   In another similarity to 1990, those Giants had to cope with a
Bills team that had routed the Raiders, 51-3, in the American
Conference championship game, just as the Jets must now cope with
the Broncos coming off their rout of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   In the National Football League's theory of relativity, a team's
next game seldom has anything to do with its previous game. The
teams and the matchups are different. But the concepts can be the
same. So look for the Jets' offense to be as aggressive in Denver
as it was Sunday against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Jets' defense is, its defensive coaches (Bill
Belichick, Al Groh and Romeo Crennel, ordained by Parcells as
``Wizards'') know they can't shut down Elway and Davis completely,
any more than they shut down the Jaguars' offense with Mark Brunell
and running back Fred Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense isn't the 1990 Giants defense (Lawrence
Taylor, Carl Banks, Leonard Marshall, Erik Howard and Mark Collins)
that limited Montana's offense to one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami on Jan. 31, the Jets must
outscore the Broncos. And the best way to do that is with long,
time-consuming drives that will depend on running back Curtis
Martin's durability and Vinny Testaverde's passes to Keyshawn
Johnson, Wayne Chrebet and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curtis felt so light on his feet, he told me, `I've got to
have the ball today,''' fullback Keith Byars said. ``After the bye
week, he was running with fresh legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin gained a total of 182 yards _ 124 on 36 rushes (one for
every million dollars in his five-year, $36 million contract), 58
on 6 receptions of screen passes. And if the Jets are to upset the
Broncos, Martin must find a way to put those numbers together next
Sunday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Denver defense didn't let Miami establish a running
game,'' Byars said. ``They turned Miami into a must-pass offense.
They took away Miami's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Bronco defense was capable of taking away the Jets'
will, Byars said: ``No, not a divisional champion. Just like we
didn't take the will away from Jacksonville.'' And after watching
how the Jaguars didn't fold against the Jets after trailing by 17
points on three different occasions, the Broncos might be
susceptible to just a bit of overconfidence next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe, their talkative tight end, reminded the Dolphins
``to have Jimmy Johnson's office ready because we're going to need
to break down film'' at the Super Bowl, as if the Broncos were
already the AFC champions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Broncos were talking about going undefeated this
season, they lost to the Giants, 20-16, and then lost to the
Dolphins, 31-21. So they're beatable. Not that the Jets think they
can sneak up on the Broncos as the Giants did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Broncos didn't have any respect for the Giants,'' Pepper
Johnson said. ``We might not have that type of advantage that the
Giants did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' advantage is Bill Parcells, along with his defensive
Wizards and his other assistant coaches _ the same coaches that
were on Parcells' staff when the 1990 Giants upset the 49ers and
then the Bills. And on Friday the Jets will be going to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get us a big plane,'' Parcells told the Jets' president, Steve
Gutman.
</P>
<P>
   The coach meant a chartered jet with a big enough fuel tank so
that it can get to Denver non-stop. To go with what Bill Parcells
hopes will be a non-stop ball-control offense. Just like the 1990
Giants.

FRENCH RIGHT BICKERS AFTER A POLITICAL DEAL WITH LEFT IN LYONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Leaders of the French conservative political parties
that lost the last national elections in 1997 were at each other's
throats again this weekend, this time over a victory.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of political back-stabbing and maneuvering amid
furious charges of betrayal, a centrist conservative was finally
elected head of the Rhone-Alpes regional parliament in Lyons early
Saturday morning, but only with leftist support from Socialist
members. The vote plunged the right _ still smarting from its 1997
national loss to the leftist coalition that put the Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin in power _ yet further into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Comparini, a member of the Union for French Democracy
party, won the regional office in post-midnight balloting after a
37-hour marathon of shady bartering that even her party colleague,
Mayor Raymond Barre of Lyons, had described as ``a disgusting
spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Comparini's triumph was a blow to former Defense Minister
Charles Millon, who had been head of the Lyons regional parliament
since 1988. Millon has been losing ground since last spring, when
he accepted support from the extreme-right National Front. The
National Front, led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, was anathema to moderate
rightists until last March, when the Socialists and other leftists
whittled down the conservative vote in elections for the powerful
regional assemblies, which control millions in spending on schools
and public works and often lure national leaders as members.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Millon, three other mainstream conservative regional
assembly leaders accepted support from the National Front, which
President Jacques Chirac denounced as racist and xenophobic for
policies that call for expulsion of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative leaders in Paris purged the apostates and formed a
new umbrella campaign organization called the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, it was a pretty shaky grouping. Its leader, Philippe
Seguin, of the Rally for the Republic movement founded by Chirac,
was furious at the deal with the left that brought Mrs. Comparini
to power in Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Alliance has not broken up _ let's say it's in
seriously bad shape,'' a spokesman for Seguin, Francois Fillon,
said in an interview with the conservative weekly Journal du
Dimanche. His party and its leaders, he said, expected their
partners to explain why they had accepted leftist support to win.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Bayrou, head of the Union of French Democracy,
congratulated his party colleague Mrs. Comparini on her victory and
said that while left and right would mostly keep going their
separate ways, Saturday's vote had shown that they could meet to
defend essential French republican values against extremism if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Millon, who has started a party of his own called ``The Right,''
demanded new regional elections Sunday and said that he was sure
the right could win them. ``The Alliance has blown up in mid-air,''
he told French radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance has been hoping to agree on a single ticket, led by
Seguin, for elections to the European Parliament in June, counting
on a strong showing then to bolster the conservatives in the next
presidential elections three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem for the conservatives has been that the
National Front consistently draws off 15 percent of the rightist
vote, depriving the mainstream parties of enough support to defeat
the leftist opposition in many constituencies.

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno is set on Monday to
become the longest-serving attorney general of this century,
surpassing the record set 60 years ago by Homer Cummings, an
attorney general in the administration of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's longevity at the Justice Department is notable because
she got the job in March 1993 almost by accident when President
Clinton hurriedly plucked her from her job as the elected
prosecutor in Dade County, Fla., after his first two nominations
for attorney general collapsed in embarrassing controversies over
household workers.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, 60, is unlikely to break the record for longest time in
the post. That is held by William Wirt, who served for 11 years
over the administrations of James Monroe and John Quincy Adams,
from Nov. 13, 1817, to March 3, 1829.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings held the post from March 4, 1933, to Jan. 2, 1939,
serving as one of Roosevelt's chief legal advisers during the
Depression banking crisis, and helping create the New Deal recovery
program.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' insider role at the White House serves as a sharp
contrast to the chilly gulf that has often separated Reno and
Clinton, whose aides have complained about Reno's crusty
independence each time (five so far) that she has referred cases
involving Cabinet officials to independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent-counsel statute has also indirectly helped
Reno keep her job. Largely because removing her would seem
blatantly motivated by political pique, Clinton has never dared to
try.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's tenure got off to a potentially disastrous start when she
approved a tear-gas assault in April 1993 by the FBI on an armed
religious cult barricaded at a compound near Waco, Texas. More than
80 people died in a resulting fire. Reno accepted responsibility
for the tear-gas assault, but said the deaths were caused solely by
David Koresh, the Branch Davidian leader, who died.
</P>
<P>
   In legal circles, Reno has never been regarded as one of the
giants of the office. Nor has she compiled a record of aggressive
initiatives like Robert F. Kennedy's efforts on civil rights or
organized crime. Still, in a period when crime rates have been
falling, Reno has been an advocate for law enforcement and for
measures against youth violence and violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the Justice Department her stewardship has elicited criticism
and praise. Her wooden manner, lack of command of some issues and
inability to set priorities have infuriated subordinates and
threatened to erode her authority over a department of more than
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno remains a solitary figure of propriety in the
frequently troubled Clinton administration. She has many admirers
within the Justice Department, particularly among lower-level
employees. They regard her as a relentlessly honest and rigorously
fair public official who has softened the aloof image of the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a joke going around the department suggested that some
aides are ambivalent about Reno's tenure. As the joke goes, one
employee says to another, ``Did you know that Janet Reno has just
broken the record for the longest-serving attorney general in the
last 150 years?''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague replies, ``I thought she'd been here longer.''

   SILICON GRAPHICS BETS ON NEW WORK STATIONS
</P>
<P>
   After three years of declining fortunes, Silicon Graphics is
placing a big bet Monday as it introduces a line of work stations
built around Intel chips and Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts like the new machines, nearly all remain neutral
on Silicon Graphics' stock, saying that the company has yet to show
that it can return to sustainable growth and profitability. Given
Silicon Graphics' history of introducing brilliant new technology
only to fumble on product delivery, it is perhaps not surprising
that analysts are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   THE KATHARINE GRAHAM OF JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Sawako Noma, 55, the president and chief executive of Kodansha,
Japan's largest publishing company, is often compared to Katharine
Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post. Like Mrs.
Graham, Mrs. Noma took control of a family company, in the face of
some resistance, after her husband died. Unlike Mrs. Graham, Mrs.
Noma took charge of an empire of 1,173 employees, 54 magazines, a
newspaper, and book companies in Japan, the United States and
Europe.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GROWTH SLOWING IN SILICON VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's surging economy slowed during 1998, stung in
part by the Asian economic crisis, according to an annual report
that tracks the health of the nation's leading high-technology
center. The region added 19,400 jobs last year, compared with
62,000 in 1997, and exports declined.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INDUSTRY COULD PAY A PRICE FOR HDTV
</P>
<P>
   As several companies announce plans to sell high-definition
television sets at much lower prices, in some cases for less than
half of what the cheapest sets cost only last fall, some executives
are worried that the prices may be too low and will threaten the
industry's profitability in the short term.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASCEND TO SELL COMPUTER DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   Ascend Communications, a maker of advanced data communications
equipment, will announce Monday that it is selling its Stratus
Enterprise Computer division for more than $100 million to a group
led by Investcorp, the Middle East investment group.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PREVIEW OF 2000 GOES WELL
</P>
<P>
   Because many computer programs look a full 52 weeks ahead, many
users had feared that the advent of this year might cause problems
as computers encountered the year 2000 problem for the first time.
Although there were a few mishaps last week _ some older equipment
in New York could not produce 00 on auto inspection stickers so
chose 91 instead, for example _ the disruptions seemed to be
isolated.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GITIC DEBT REPAYMENT DELAYED
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials told dozens of creditors of Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp., or Gitic, not to expect
repayment of $4 billion anytime soon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUDITORS TO DISCLOSE CONFLICTS
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in July, auditors must disclose any relationship they
have with the public companies they audit that could compromise
their independence, according to new rules approved by the
Independence Standards Board.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOYOTA PRESIDENT TO LEAD GROUP

JETS NOTEBOOK: OTIS SMITH, JOHNSON, TESTAVERDE AND BIG PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 By FRANK LITSKY  
 (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In his nine seasons in the National
Football League, Otis Smith has been a heartbreaker. The New York
Jets' 33-year-old starting cornerback makes big plays, but some of
them help the other team and not his.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's ups and downs in the Jets' 34-24 playoff victory over
the Jacksonville Jaguars Sunday were typical. On the plus side, he
made an interception and knocked down three Jaguar passes (as a
team, the Jaguars broke up only three passes). On the minus side,
he allowed two touchdown catches by Jimmy Smith, and his
pass-interference penalty on fourth-and-9 midway through the fourth
quarter let the Jaguars keep the ball and kick a field goal that
closed their deficit to 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   On Jimmy Smith's second touchdown, five minutes into the final
quarter, he came back on an underthrown pass; it was a good play by
him rather than a bad play by Otis Smith. On his first touchdown, a
52-yard desperation throw as time expired in the first half, Otis
Smith had outside coverage and Jerome Henderson, playing safety,
was supposed to cut over and protect the inside. Henderson got
there too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just miscommunication between the safety and myself,''
Otis Smith said. ``He thought I was going to be there. I thought he
was going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets Coach Bill Parcells thought Henderson would be there, too.
When he was asked about that play, he said of Henderson: ``There's
no excuse for that. He got over too late.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Parcells say to Henderson?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can repeat it,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   The interference penalty against Otis Smith also came on a pass
from Mark Brunell to Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jimmy even saw the ball,'' Otis Smith said. ``I
broke on it, and I told the official that. He said I pushed. If he
could have looked at a replay, he may have called it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Otis Smith's day appeared bittersweet. Not so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the game goes,'' he said. ``They make plays.
You make plays. I don't take any plays personally.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT'S HARD TO MAKE HIM HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Johnson, the Jets' middle linebacker, and Jumbo Elliott,
one of their offensive tackles, won Super Bowl rings while playing
for Parcells and the New York Giants. They did not need words to
know that the coach was hardly pleased with the way the Jets, after
taking a 17-0 lead, let the Jaguars back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing for Bill a long time,'' Johnson said. ``I'm
not happy and I know he isn't happy. He didn't say that in so many
words, but he wouldn't say you played a great game unless he
thought that. He wasn't happy with the score. We had these guys
down and they came back. He's not coaching just for a victory. With
him, a win isn't just a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, like Johnson, understands Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game,'' Elliott said, ``he didn't tell us anything
except that we have tomorrow off. But I think he was happy that the
game plan worked extremely well. He knows how to handle things.''
</P>
<P>
   But like almost every other pro football coach, Parcells is a
prisoner of the more-work-is-better mentality. What were his
post-game plans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get to bed early,'' he said, ``and get in the office early
tomorrow to start getting ready for Denver.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TESTAVERDE NOT THERE YET
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde did more than his share in helping the Jets
win. He completed 24 of 36 passes. In the second quarter, when
Curtis Martin fumbled, Testaverde ran down Chris Hudson, who had
picked up the fumble, and caused him to fumble away the ball on
what appeared to be an attempted lateral.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, the Jets' quarterback seemed more interested
in handing out praise. He had kind words for Curtis Martin (``he
ran the ball fantastically''). He spoke highly of his offensive
line (``that one sack was my fault because I held on to the ball
too long''). He commended the Jaguars (``every time we scored a
touchdown, Jacksonville came back with a big play'').
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest game I've won as a pro,'' the 12-year
professional said. ``Next week against Denver will be bigger. I'm
excited, but I'm not satisfied yet. It's not a matter of money.
It's not a matter of fame. I just want to play for a Super Bowl
ring.''  &QL;

ON PRO FOOTBALL: ADVERSITY MAKES JETS MORE AGGRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Bill Parcells stormed toward Keyshawn
Johnson one day in practice last week and screamed that he had
ruined a play. Johnson yelled back that he had not. Johnson
explained why. Oh, Parcells said. Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little nervous,'' Parcells confided in Johnson.
``I'm not sure if these guys are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried to calm Parcells. Assure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're ready, coach,'' he said. ``We're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Parcells so nervous about? The playoff game, the bundle
at stake versus Jacksonville, was certainly enough.
</P>
<P>
   But anxiety was defeated. The New York Jets beat the Jaguars by
34-24 at Giants Stadium Sunday afternoon and advanced to the
American Football Conference championship game against Denver next
Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But whom had Parcells been more concerned about, his guys or the
other guys? He knew Jacksonville, with one of his pupils, Tom
Coughlin, as its coach, would be prepared. He considered that
Jacksonville featured a quarterback in Mark Brunell who displays
fancy feet and a cannon-like arm. No doubt, the Jaguars would be
feisty, score some points, light some fires, take some chances.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was concerned about Jacksonville, all right, but he was
more worried about his guys. Would they hear footsteps? Could they
handle the moment? Would they be too anxious, press, try to make it
all happen at once, fall behind and try to turn a good play into a
great play? Begin to fall all over themselves? Play catch-up all
day?
</P>
<P>
   We are talking adversity. How would the Jets respond?
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jets found out, the Jaguars did. They found out that
the Jets were much better at handling adversity.
</P>
<P>
   And at the start of the game, the Jets created it for
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   These were two eager, spirited teams before kickoff, and early
on the Jets channeled their energy into success. The Jets took the
opening drive for a touchdown. At the start of the second quarter
they made it 10-0. They scored that field goal on a drive that
included a third-and-6 pass of 10 yards from Vinny Testaverde to
Wayne Chrebet, a daring pass that began at the Jets' 11-yard line.
They scored on John Hall's 52-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   You are the Jaguars, a warm-weather team playing a hot team on a
chilly day on the road and getting no breaks. Hey, the other team
just scored a touchdown to start the game, tossed a successful
third-down pass from its own 11 and then made a 52-yard field goal.
You press. You add in that from the end of the first quarter to the
middle of the second quarter, for a stretch of more than 12
minutes, the other team has the ball for 24 plays and you have it
for 1 play. And your 1 play was an interception. If this had
happened to you, if you are the Jaguars, you wonder what is going
on. You press.
</P>
<P>
   You try to turn a good play, any play, into a great play.
</P>
<P>
   You try to score 10 points at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets came out and established ball control and they kept
it for themselves,'' said Keenan McCardell, a Jacksonville receiver
who tried to explain what happened when the Jaguars finally got the
ball back in the second quarter on a turnover and then, on safety
Chris Hudson's foiled lateral, turned the ball right back over to
the Jets. That play helped the Jets keep the ball for another
4-plus minutes in the second quarter. For another 11 plays. For
another field goal and a 17-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris felt like the rest of us _ we had to put something
together,'' McCardell said. ``He was trying to get us points right
away. He was trying to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn a good play into a great play.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing under adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to make plays in a playoff game,'' Coughlin
said. ``Just a foolish mistake. A dumb mistake, and Chris feels
very badly about that. It's the name of the game. Humans play it.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly do.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to why Parcells, why the Jets, may have
been worried. How would they handle adversity?
</P>
<P>
   They found out. Jacksonville settled down and made a game of it,
ran at the Jets with gusto and closed to 31-24 with 6 minutes 38
seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   How did the Jets respond? On their next drive, on third-and-14
at their own 30, the Jets passed. No running and no punting and no
playing to lose. It was all playing to win. Testaverde found
Johnson for a 20-yard gain. First down. More time milked. The Jets
would eventually punt, but then they would play to win on defense,
gambling, blitzing Brunell, getting the ball back to the Jets'
offense with 1:59 remaining. That led to the game's final points,
another Hall field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Jets have traveled so far, so fast this season in part
by playing to win in the face of adversity. Nothing stupid, but
plenty of risks that work. By getting up when knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches have a comfort level with us now that they are not
afraid to call certain plays at any time of the game,'' tight end
Kyle Brady said. ``We have taken the season and developed a good
relationship between coaches and players and understand that during
the course of the game adversity is definitely coming. But how do
you deal with it?''
</P>
<P>
   You deal with it like Brady did.
</P>
<P>
   It was late in the third quarter, Jacksonville had just cut the
Jets' lead to 24-14 and Brady had just caught a 17-yard pass to the
Jacksonville 4. Safety Donovin Darius socked Brady so hard on the
tackle that the 6-foot-6-inch Brady, all 268 pounds of him, flew in
the air like a feather and crashed to the ground like concrete. He
slowly got up. Even more slowly, he trudged to the sideline.
Parcells was in his face, challenging him. Would Brady get back in
there? How would he handle adversity?
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something like we need you and get tough and some
other things,'' Brady said. ``Quite frankly, I'm still feeling
woozy. I can't remember the entire incident.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers, though, getting up. Walking off. Walking back on.
</P>
<P>
   Handling the moment, the adversity, like all the Jets did. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After three years of declining fortunes, Silicon Graphics Inc.
is placing a big bet Monday as it introduces a line of work
stations built around Intel chips and Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts like the new machines, nearly all remain neutral
on the shares of Silicon Graphics, saying that the company has yet
to show that it can return to sustainable growth and profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Given Silicon Graphics' history of introducing brilliant new
technology only to fumble on the delivery of products, it is
perhaps not surprising that analysts are taking a wait-and-see
attitude. For one, the new machines are already late. First
promised for the second half of 1998, the line so far includes two
models: the 320, available next month starting at $3,395, and the
540, expected to be shipped in the second quarter, starting at
$5,995. The prices do not include monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hesitation may also reflect the new direction being
taken with the work stations, which are used for high-performance
tasks from three-dimensional modeling to financial analysis to
animation. Silicon Graphics executives have long asserted that no
work station based on a conventional personal computer can equal
the performance of the company's designs, which use the MIPS
microprocessor and a variation of the Unix operating system. And
the new machines based on Pentium 2 chip and Windows NT do not.
</P>
<P>
   Their prices, however, start at about half that of Silicon
Graphics' home-grown 02 series, and by including the company's own
video and graphics circuitry, can outperform other PC-based work
stations that must rely on add-on boards for these functions.
``From the very beginning when we announced this, everyone of
course asked, `How are you going to differentiate?''' Richard
Belluzzo, chairman and chief executive of Silicon Graphics, said in
a telephone interview. ``We were convinced we could take Microsoft
and Intel technology, surround it with Silicon Graphics innovation,
and play by PC rules.''
</P>
<P>
   To compete with lower-cost producers like the Dell Computer
Corp., Silicon Graphics has also adopted a new business model for
its Windows-Intel machines. Unlike its traditional products, which
are assembled at the company's headquarters in Mountain View,
Calif., the new line is completely assembled by Space Contractors
Inc., a leading contract manufacturer. Space Contractors will build
each machine to order. Silicon Graphics plans to sell the machines
from its Web site (www.sgi.com) as well as through its direct-sales
force and resellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty impressed with what I've seen,'' said Peter
Ffoulkes, an analyst with Dataquest. ``There's a lot of difference
between what SGI is bringing to market and a vanilla Dell
machine,'' he said, adding that because the machine has
three-dimensional graphics and video, ``there is the potential to
deliver significant performance advantages when dealing with that
kind of data.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ffoulkes is an industry analyst, who reviews products rather
than stocks. Nonetheless, the introduction of Silicon Graphics' NT
machines is important for all technology investors, he contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If technology doesn't make a difference, _ and if SGI can't
make a difference, then who can? _ that has a lot of implications
for investing in technology at all unless it's in Microsoft or
Dell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Milunovich, a managing director of Merrill Lynch, said
that while he, too, admired the new machines, he questioned whether
they would make a big difference in the company's fortunes.
``They're late,'' he said, ``and while they may be differentiated,
the best technology doesn't always win in the market, in fact it
often does not win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``this is the first good news since the new management
arrived,'' he said, referring to Belluzzo, who joined the company
from Hewlett-Packard a year ago, and other senior executives he has
since recruited. Milunovich has a neutral rating on Silicon
Graphics shares.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Friday at $16.3125, up substantially from a
52-week low of $7.375 on Oct. 8, but still a fraction of the $45 it
fetched in 1995. In the last five quarters, the company has lost
$504 million. Silicon Graphics is expected to report its fiscal
second-quarter results on Jan. 26; analysts surveyed by First Call
expect a loss of 19 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot riding on'' the new machines, said Daniel
Kunstler of J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think they've thought long and hard and come up
with something that will give them an advantage,'' he went on,
``but I'm a little unclear what that is. We have to be very
attentive to execution; availability is going to be absolutely
key.'' He rates Silicon Graphics a hold.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lone buy recommendation among analysts at major securities
firms comes from Doug Van Dorsten, who is with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
He plays down the importance of the new machines, which he does not
expect to add more than $30 million in annual sales to the
company's $3 billion in revenue. Instead, he expects the new
management to turn around the company's core business in high-end
servers, which are still based on the MIPS processor, and to
improve operating efficiency and profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dorsten also notes that Silicon Graphics has substantial
tangible assets _ including its ownership of the Wavefront and
Alias software companies, and its 85 percent stake in its MIPS chip
business, which went public last year _ that are not reflected in
the stock price. Those assets are worth more than $7 a share, he
said, and a projected profit of 75 cents a share in fiscal 2000
would suggest a stock price in the high teens. Improved margins
could bring earnings a share to $1.05 to $1.10 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives you a share price in the low 20s,'' he said.
``They've still got a long way to go, but I think they have a shot
at it.''

REPUBLICAN N.E. SENATORS KEY TO PRESIDENT'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four moderate Republicans from New England, who
last week killed a proposal that would have swiftly concluded
President Clinton's impeachment trial, have emerged as a pivotal
force in deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   After hoping for days that these New Englanders would back a
blueprint for an abbreviated trial, Senate Democrats said they
accepted a compromise on Friday only after realizing the GOP
moderates wanted to retain the option of hearing from witnesses and
would not support the Democratic-backed plan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the four Republicans _ who have demonstrated an ability to
go against the GOP tide _ remain crucial to the Democratic strategy
of ending the trial without permitting House managers to call
witnesses or present new allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The four members of the group are Senators John H. Chafee of
Rhode Island, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, and Olympia J. Snowe
and Susan M. Collins, both of Maine. Each has indicated an interest
in quickly concluding the trial, despite their refusal to back the
trial proposal of Senators Slade Gorton, a Republican of
Washington, and Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they did not believe the moderates had buckled
under conservative pressure to conform to the party line, as some
believe moderate Republicans did during the impeachment process in
the House. But the Democrats fear that the moderates still need to
satisfy the conservative wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting conflicting signals from them,'' said one
Democratic Senate aide.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Senate Democrats accepted that they ``can't ask them
to shut down the process up front,'' a Senate source involved in
Democratic leadership decisions said of the New England
Republicans. ``There has to be some factual basis on which they can
hang their hat. Once you get that factual basis, then you can
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Their positions are continually evolving. Snowe, Collins, and
Jeffords have said they would be interested in hearing evidence
from potential witnesses, but have not declared an absolute stance
on how that should occur. They have largely kept the details of
their opinions guarded, saying they are waiting to see how the
evidence unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, their views might diverge. The moderate New
Englanders are not a formal caucus, although they meet every
Wednesday for lunch _ with a fifth moderate member, Senator Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania. Except for abortion rights, none could
recall a specific position on which all four moderates always break
from the Republican Party as a solid bloc. Usually they break away
one at a time on issues such as health care or the environment, and
members said they are even divided on some specifics in the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they clearly share a constituency peculiar to New England _
fiscally conservative, socially more liberal, and willing to vote
for members of either party depending on the candidate. Three of
them, Jeffords, Snowe, and Chafee, must keep that constituency in
mind; they are up for reelection in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   They are no doubt considering poll numbers as well. Just days
before opening arguments in the trial, public opinion polls
continue to show overwhelming opposition to removing Clinton from
office over the sex scandal. The results of a CNN/Time poll
released Saturday showed 34 percent believe the Senate should
convict Clinton, which could automatically remove him from office.
But 62 percent said the charges do not warrant Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's bipartisan agreement, which specifies how the first few
days of the trial will unfold, appears to have put the Senate on
the brink of avoiding a bitter impeachment battle. But the deal
postponed the most contentious debate _ the handling of potential
witnesses, including Monica S. Lewinsky _ and left open the
possibility of a future partisan split.
</P>
<P>
   In such an instance, senators in both parties said, moderate
Republicans would be a deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   The four Republicans have proved a formidable force. During a
Republican conference last week, Snowe led the way in urging her 54
colleagues not to throw in the towel on a bipartisan agreement
after only a few hours' debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympia basically turned things around,'' Jeffords said of
Snowe, who has bucked the Republican party on issues such as tax
credits for the sick and family leave initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rushing to a decision (Thursday) night and really
hadn't thought it out as to why, when there were definite feelers
coming from the Democrats that we ought to be bipartisan, there was
a rush on our side to get everything done,'' Jeffords said.
``Olympia said, `Wait a minute, why does it have to be done
tonight?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his Republicans' weekly radio address Saturday, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said, ``All week, we had seemed
hopelessly divided. But after listening to one another, speaking
face to face, we came together in the last 15 minutes of our
meeting. It was a moment none of us will ever forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican said the framework would help ensure
that the Senate conducts the trial with ``decency and decorum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all over, no matter what the outcome, you will be
proud of your Senate _ and prouder still that our system of
government is able to handle even this momentous matter with
civility, order, and fairness,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he still must contend with the New England Republicans,
who have made clear their intention to act on their own instincts
rather than their party's interests. The four privately have told
Lott that they will not be swayed by party interests on the most
crucial issues, such as whether to convict the president, but they
will try to help him ensure the trial is fair and adequately
thorough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not necessarily votes that either side of the aisle
can count on,'' said Felicia Knight, a spokeswoman for Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to work with the majority leader on these kinds
of issues to the extent possible to make sure the process goes
forward,'' Jeffords said. ``But we have let it be known that our
votes on other matters are going to be based on conscience, not on
support for the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is charged with lying under oath before a federal grand
jury and obstructing justice in trying to conceal his sexual affair
in the White House with former intern Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, to
convict the president. But only a simple majority of 51 is needed
to dismiss the charges or to approve a motion to cut short the
trial by forcing a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Senate, 55-45, so
Democrats need to pick up only six GOP votes to control the
proceedings if their 45 members remain unified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the swing group on that side, in the sense that, when
things get out of whack, they can have a tempering effect,'' said
Senator Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut. ``But I think on
this matter, there is a sense that this is a very perilous few
weeks, that this is a court of last resort. . .in a sense I think
today we're all Democrats, we're all Republicans.''

ORLANDUS WILSON, 81, SINGER IN INFLUENTIAL GOSPEL QUARTET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlandus Wilson, whose bass voice was the foundation of the
Golden Gate Quartet's gospel harmonies, died on Dec. 30 in Paris,
where he lived. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Quartet had a huge influence on American sacred
and secular music. Performing in clubs and concert halls as well as
churches, and backing up blues singers like Lead Belly and Josh
White, the quartet demonstrated that gospel had all the vitality of
secular music. Its driving versions of spirituals were a model of
vocal harmony for groups from the Dixie Hummingbirds to the
Spaniels. And Wilson, who joined the group in 1934, provided its
syncopated bass lines for six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Chesapeake, Va. When he joined the Golden
Gate Jubilee Singers in 1934, all four members were still in high
school. Two years later the group was singing five days a week for
a radio station in Columbia, S.C., and in 1937, they signed to RCA
Records' Bluebird label, releasing a new single every month.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, they were part of the program at John Hammond's
historic ``Spirituals to Swing'' concert at Carnegie Hall, sharing
the bill with Joe Turner, Sidney Bechet, Lionel Hampton and Benny
Goodman. The quartet stayed in New York City with a regular
engagement at Cafe Society, where their sets included gospel and
popular material. In churches, the quartet sang only gospel songs.
</P>
<P>
   The group moved to Columbia Records in 1941 and shortened its
name to the Golden Gate Quartet. During World War II, it recorded
songs like ``Stalin Wasn't Stallin' '' along with spirituals.
Wilson left the group to join the Navy in 1944 and returned in
1946. The quartet had a national radio show on the CBS network and
appeared in a number of films, including ``Star Spangled Rhythm,''
``Hollywood Canteen,'' ``Bring On the Girls'' and ``A Song Is
Born.'' It had performed at the inauguration of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, becoming the first black group to sing in Constitution
Hall, and also sang for the Roosevelts at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, after a 28-country tour sponsored by the State
Department, the Golden Gate Quartet relocated to Paris. With Wilson
as its manager and arranger, the group continued to be a major
concert draw in Europe and on world tours. Since the 1970s, the
group has included Wilson's grandnephew, Paul Brembly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the quartet gave its first performance in the United
States since the 1950s when it was inducted into the hall of fame
of United in Group Harmony, an organization devoted to preserving
the history of vocal harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson announced his retirement from performing with the quartet
in October but continued to oversee rehearsals for his replacement,
Andrew Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gun, and a son, Charles, of
California.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after the Senate struck an unexpected note
of harmony with an agreement on how to conduct the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, Republicans and Democrats disagreed
anew Sunday over the one overriding question that threatens to
cleave the two parties: whether to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate poised to hear opening arguments in the trial on
Thursday, Senate Republicans spanning the ideological spectrum
spoke forcefully Sunday for the need to hear from witnesses who
could clarify factual disputes in the case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a trial before where you had factual
disputes where you didn't have witnesses where you could watch
their demeanor on the stand, listen to them, judge one witness
versus another witness,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, on ``Meet
the Press,'' the NBC program. ``That's basically our system of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., a moderate, echoed the sentiment of
most of his colleagues, saying, ``I do believe some witnesses will
have to be called.'' He also spoke on ``Meet the Press.'' But in a
sign that partisan displays may have been merely delayed by
Friday's agreement to postpone for two weeks a decision on
summoning witnesses, Democrats took the opposite stance.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the existing record sufficiently lays out the
case for the Senate to make a determination on Clinton's fitness to
hold office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a body of evidence that is really phenomenal _ 60,000
pages, five volumes _ an amazing array of data that I think
probably answers virtually every scintilla of question there would
be about what happened and why it happened,'' said Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, on ``Face the Nation'' on
CBS. ``We know the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican managers, who will prosecute the case against
Clinton, said Sunday that they would like to call six to 10
witnesses, among them Monica Lewinsky; Betty Currie, Clinton's
personal secretary; Vernon Jordan Jr., the Washington lawyer who is
Clinton's confidant; Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide, and
perhaps unidentified women who have claimed that Clinton made
sexual advances toward them, including Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Senate begins in earnest the first presidential
impeachment trial in 131 years and only the second in the nation's
history. It will plunge into the details of a scandal that led to
Clinton's impeachment by the House of Representatives, along a near
party-line vote, on charges that he committed perjury and
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   After edging toward a partisan divide last week, all 100
senators emerged from an unusual closed-door caucus on Friday with
an agreement on how to conduct the trial and to postpone the
question of summoning witnesses until after the House impeachment
managers and Clinton's lawyers have made their opening
presentations. The agreement was passed unanimously on the floor of
the Senate on Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's statements by Senate Republicans and Democrats made
clear that while the bipartisan agreement on Friday was a lesson in
comity, the rest of the proceedings may not necessarily engender
the same congeniality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested that we are in a bipartisan mode for the opening
kickoff,'' said Sen. John Breaux, R-La., on the ABC program ``This
Week.'' ``Half-time is questionable. And if we go into overtime,
all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a view that Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, hoped would not
prevail. ``I do think bipartisanship will continue, irrespective of
the outcome, irrespective of the votes cast down the road,'' she
said on ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and the White House are allowed to present a series of
motions in the early part of this week, with most of the activity
occurring behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers met all day Sunday planning their strategy
for the week. By noon Monday, they expect to file an executive
summary, similar to the one sent to the House Judiciary Committee
in December, maintaining that charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice are too thin to warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, the
House will begin presenting its case, followed by the White House.
House prosecutors have indicated that they may need only eight to
10 session hours to make their case, and not the full 24 session
hours allocated to them by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary
Committee, and the other 12 managers who will prosecute the case in
the Senate do not want to tire the senators _ and possibly undercut
their arguments for calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went on for the full 24 hours, senators will say, golly,
are they ever going to shut up?'' a House Republican aide said.
``We're walking a very fine line here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which was planning a double-barreled defense
strategy, one barrel focusing on the facts, the other on the
public, was also considering not using its full 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Following the two arguments, the Senate could face another
crucial vote, perhaps on Jan. 25 when it is expected to take up a
White House motion to dismiss the case. The vote would require a
simple majority, 51 votes, but with 45 Democrats and 55 Republicans
in the Senate, few expected that it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we want to hear this case out,'' said Chafee, ``and I
think I'd be surprised if a motion to dismiss at that early stage
prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux cautioned the White House to avoid any ``scorched earth''
tactics that may delay the case, and he urged that the president's
lawyers defer from trying to get the case dismissed at the outset
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would put a lot of pressure on people that are not ready to
make that decision,'' Breaux said. ``To make them vote on that
proposition before we hear the opening arguments, I think would be
a mistake on the part of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   If the motion to dismiss fails, the Senate would take up the
more contentious issue of witnesses. Under the ground rules the
Senate adopted on Friday, senators would vote on a list of
witnesses that House prosecutors and the White House would like to
depose. The vote would provide an early indication of whether
senators would like more information.
</P>
<P>
   After depositions were taken, the Senate would decide which, if
any, of the witnesses would actually testify in the trial, voting
on each witness separately.
</P>
<P>
   Hopping from one morning talk show to the next, House Republican
prosecutors stepped up their call for witnesses Sunday by arguing
that it would turn the scandal's cast of characters into human
beings and help clear up differences or ambiguities in testimony.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton never asked her
to lie, said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., one of the House
prosecutors. But prosecutors say she could shed light on what
Clinton did ask her to do, especially as it refers to her job
search, an underpinning of the obstruction of justice case against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said it was possible that calling witnesses who are
sympathetic to Clinton may tarnish the prosecutors' case, but it
was a risk the prosecutors were willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   To help allay the concerns of senators who worry that the trial
will be weighted down by salacious details, House Republican
prosecutors have said they would stipulate to Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony on the perjury charge, which would avoid rehashing many
of the embarrassing specifics of the sexual relationship between
her and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth can come out through the witnesses,'' Rogan said on
``This Week.'' ``And if the witnesses aren't able to present the
case, then all you have are a bunch of lawyers standing up reading
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Republicans, and a few Democrats, urged Clinton to
postpone his State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, a
date that would overlap with his trial before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we're in the middle of this kind of fact-finding,
it is very, it's almost schizophrenic then to turn around and go
that evening into the state of the union,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., said on NBC. ``I know for me, it's going to be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., agreed. ``I think it would create
acrimony within the chamber that is really unnecessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., whose daughter is married to
one of Hillary Rodham Clinton's brothers, said on ``Meet the
Press'' that the ``people deserve to hear from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said Clinton planned to
deliver his speech and had ``no intention of being diverted from
that.''

SCANDAL STORIES HURT RATINGS, CBS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ The television networks have created ``Monica
fatigue'' among viewers and hurt their own newscast ratings by
focusing so heavily on the White House sex scandal, according to
CBS News President Andrew Heyward.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said the ``saturation coverage'' of the affair between
President Clinton and former intern Monica S. Lewinsky has created
a backlash that became measurable as the networks tallied their
fourth-quarter ratings, even though the story by then had moved
into the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered it so much, it has turned off the public in
droves,'' Heyward said Saturday in an interview at the midwinter
meeting of television critics.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward's remarks followed a press conference during which CBS
Television President Leslie Moonves defended the network's decision
_ made over the opposition of Heyward and CBS News anchor Dan
Rather _ to broadcast an NFL game on Dec. 19 rather than the first
House of Representatives vote to impeach a president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was the only major network to stick with previously
scheduled programming (and was rewarded with higher ratings for the
football game than the other networks received for coverage of the
impeachment vote). Heyward and Rather acknowledged that they were
disappointed that the network chose to broadcast the football game,
though Heyward noted CBS provided seven news updates during the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of a possible merger between CBS and CNN, the
subject of much speculation, Heyward and Moonves played down the
possibility, though neither ruled it out. In the interview, Heyward
acknowledged that CBS has had discussions with CNN since 1996 about
some form of alliance, but he said there are many obstacles to a
merger, including issues such as who would wield editorial control
and how the different approaches to news could be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   He said CNN still is identified with ``generic, wire-service
news,'' adding, ``If CBS became that, there wouldn't be a reason to
exist for us.'' In addition, he said, there is ``ambivalence within
Time-Warner,'' owner of CNN, about a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward also denounced as ``outrageous'' a subpoena issued to
``60 Minutes'' by a Marine Corps prosecutor who is seeking tapes of
an interview the CBS newsmagazine conducted with the pilot of a
military jet involved in a fatal accident last year in the Italian
Alps. CBS has filed a motion in military court arguing that the
subpoena for tapes that have not yet aired abridges the network's
rights under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outcry over a November ``60 Minutes'' broadcast that
showed Dr. Jack Kevorkian administering a fatal dose to a Michigan
man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, Heyward said he has had no
second thoughts about permitting the broadcast. ``It did what good
journalism is supposed to do, which is provoke debate about
important national issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves raised some eyebrows during a press conference when he
criticized the Gore Commission, of which he was a member, as ``rife
with bureaucracy,'' and said it was not ``a worthwhile exercise.''
The commission was established to draft a report to Vice President
Al Gore, the FCC, and Congress on what the obligations of
broadcasters should be in return for use of the new digital
spectrum.

 &HT;    Hudson `should have just held onto the thing'
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The strangest event of Sunday's game,
and one cited by players from both teams as perhaps the most
significant, came in the second quarter with the New York Jets
leading 10-0 and driving to extend that margin.
</P>
<P>
   With a second-and-15 at the Jaguars' 17-yard line, Jets tailback
Curtis Martin carried on a draw play over the right side and
fumbled. The ball was scooped up by Jacksonville free safety Chris
Hudson, who raced 47 yards down the right sideline and had only New
York quarterback Vinny Testaverde between he and the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   But as he approached the quarterback, Hudson seemingly attempted
to lateral to corner Dave Thomas. The loose ball was deflected by
Testaverde and recovered by Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
Referee Bob McElwee ruled that Hudson had not tried a forward
lateral, an infraction which would have kept the ball in Jaguars
possession. The recovery by Johnson stood.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Jacksonville having the ball at the Jets 35-yard
line, New York regained it and then drove 65 yards to Johnson's
10-yard score on an end-around play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make a play, that's all,'' explained an
obviously brainlocked Hudson after the game. ``I guess I should
have just held onto the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Select company
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Johnson was not the first man in league playoff
history to score on a catch, score on a run, record an interception
and have a fumble recovery in the same contest. In the 1937 NFL
championship game, Chicago's Jack Manders made the same four plays
as the Bears lost to the Washington Redskins 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   Shared misery
</P>
<P>
   The snafu by Hudson wasn't the only foul-up by a Jacksonville
defensive back. Trailing 31-24, strong safety Donovin Darius
intercepted Testaverde's pass in the end zone with 2:24 to play.
Instead of just staying in the end zone and taking a touchback that
would have put the ball at the 20-yard line, Darius tried to run it
out. He was stopped at the 1-yard line. ``Dumb, just absolutely
dumb,'' Darius said. Almost as ill-advised was the play-call by
Jets coach Bill Parcells. He could have run the ball instead and
virtually bled the clock. ``If I had it to do over again,''
Parcells conceded, ``I probably wouldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawg day afternoon
</P>
<P>
   The two former University of Georgia standout on the New York
defense both played well. Tackle Jason Ferguson had a team-high
seven tackles and also deflected a pass by Mark Brunell. Strongside
linebacker Mo Lewis had six tackles from scrimmage and also a
special teams tackle. ``This kind of win is something I've waited a
long time for, but all I'm going to do is get home, call for
delivery pizza and start thinking about next week and what it's
going to take to stop (Denver tailback) Terrell Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Weakside linebacker Kevin Hardy played a superb game for the
Jaguars and finished with 19 tackles, including 14 solo stops. . .
. New York's 29 first downs established a new team record for a
playoff game. . . . Jets kicker John Hall had a 52-yard field goal,
the longest in Jets playoff history. . . . Jacksonville offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer is expected to interview for the head
coach opening in Baltimore this week.

POLITICAL MEMO: MYRIAD ISSUES AWAIT THE ATTENTION OF WHITE HOUSE
AND CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., N.H.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a city that seems to be all impeachment all the
time, the question now is whether there is any hope of Congress
working with the Clinton administration to address the full plate
of other issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and Medicare need to be overhauled before they
are driven into bankruptcy by the aging of the baby boom
generation. Military leaders say the Pentagon needs more money to
insure national security.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have ideas for improving schools. Republicans are
pressing for big tax cuts, Democrats for more spending on health
and child care. The shortcomings in the laws governing political
fund-raising remain unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike have powerful motivations to
prove to the electorate that they have not been consumed by the
impeachment process, especially given that the Senate trial of
President Clinton now seems likely to stretch into next month and
perhaps longer.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, some members of both parties think the White
House and the Republican leadership in Congress will be eager to
strike deals on big issues like Social Security once the
impeachment trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial has obviously knocked everything off the agenda for
a period of time, but as a practical matter, this is a time of year
when Congress does very little anyway,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg,
R-N.H..
</P>
<P>
   ``It could end up having a positive impact because after we come
out of the trial there's going to be a desire on both ends of
Pennsylvania Avenue to show constructive action,'' Gregg said.
``The issue that's sitting there ready to go is Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But such an outcome presumes that there is enough trust between
two parties who have been savaging each other for months that they
will be willing to wade hand-in-hand into issues that are easy
targets for demagoguery. Trust may prove to be an especially scarce
commodity since Republicans and Democrats are thinking as much in
terms of positioning themselves for the 2000 elections as in terms
of what they might accomplish legislatively this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitter partisanship in the past has not prevented us from
getting things done,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. ``We did it
with welfare reform and with the balanced budget agreement. But
both sides will have to believe they are getting something from it.
If both sides think they're better off by doing nothing and blaming
the other, we'll get nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a complex and subtle political calculus at
work. Clinton would clearly like to leave a legacy of
accomplishment to offset the stain of impeachment. But doing so _
whether on big issues like Social Security and health care or on
specific programs like building more classrooms _ will require him
to compromise with Republicans, a prospect that is not appealing to
many congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats in particular think their best chance of
recapturing control of the House in 2000 is to paint Republicans as
right-wing zealots who have accomplished nothing of importance to
the American people. The dynamic could also be affected by whether
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
chooses to challenges Vice President Al Gore for the party's
presidential nomination, leading to an open battle between the
party's centrist and liberal factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for a lot of congressional Democrats is why we
should do anything to help build a record of accomplishment for the
Republican Congress,'' a senior Democratic aide in the House said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, too, there are widely varying views on how to
proceed at a time when their party's standing in the polls is
plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, 13 of the 19 Republicans up for re-election in
2000 are from states Clinton carried in 1996, suggesting some
willingness to move to the center. Senate Republicans are
increasingly eager to reach a deal on Social Security so they can
turn the agenda to an issue they believe is the most proven
political winner available to them: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois has promised to
steer Republicans in a more pragmatic direction and to work with
Democrats. But any substantive compromises he makes are likely to
expose him to the same furious response from his right wing that
helped bring down Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny Hastert has got to be able to tell the far right of his
party to knock it off, that he's going to govern from the center,''
Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., said. ``It's possible, though,
that if he tries he'll get run over.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Matsui said, if the Republican leadership and
the White House prove willing to work with each other, ``the left
of our party won't be happy because then you'll see bills getting
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question as to how much pressure the
electorate will put on Washington to get down to business. Stephen
Moore of the Cato Institute, a research organization influential
with conservative Republicans, said that with the economy humming
along nicely and the country lacking any sense of urgency about big
policy changes, the electorate may find gridlock in Washington to
be an acceptable or even appealing outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton, at least, is determined to show the voters an
activist administration at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we rest on our laurels, become diverted in our energies,
or keep working together?'' Clinton asked in a speech in Detroit on
Friday. ``If we work together, there are no limits to 21st century
America.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   White House officials continue to work on a wide variety of
relatively small-bore policy initiatives to include in the budget
proposal Clinton will send to Capitol Hill on Feb. 1. And they are
considering whether to make a renewed push starting with the State
of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 19, for a bipartisan
agreement on shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, White House officials have been floating the
idea of leaving the current retirement system more or less intact,
with its financial problems addressed through a package of benefit
cuts and tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   To make that approach more palatable to Republicans who have
been demanding that Social Security be remade to include private
investment accounts, the White House would then call for the
creation of retirement accounts that would not technically be
linked to Social Security but would use the federal budget surplus
to give individuals tax breaks or other incentives to save for old
age.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans arguing that future budget surpluses will be
big enough both to fix Social Security and finance a big tax cut,
the administration is also considering whether to lay out
explicitly how it would use the surplus beyond dealing with Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president believes is that the agenda-setting
function is vital to the presidency,'' Paul Begala, senior adviser
to the president, said. ``Last year he was quite innovative in
using the coalescence of the State of the Union and the budget and
the absence of Congress in early January to dominate the agenda and
set the policy agenda for the year. He intends to do the same thing
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Begala bristled at the idea that the policy proposals Clinton
announced last week _ long-term care, after-school programs, drug
treatment for inmates _ were intended to divert attention from
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a diversion, this is the presidency, this is our
job, it's leading the only superpower on God's earth,'' Begala
said. ``It's what we did last year before anyone had heard of
Monica Lewinsky.''

SCANDAL STORIES HURT RATINGS, CBS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ The television networks have created ``Monica
fatigue'' among viewers and hurt their own newscast ratings by
focusing so heavily on the White House sex scandal, according to
CBS News President Andrew Heyward.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said the ``saturation coverage'' of the affair between
President Clinton and former intern Monica S. Lewinsky has created
a backlash that became measurable as the networks tallied their
fourth-quarter ratings, even though the story by then had moved
into the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered it so much, it has turned off the public in
droves,'' Heyward said Saturday in an interview at the midwinter
meeting of television critics.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward's remarks followed a press conference during which CBS
Television President Leslie Moonves defended the network's decision
_ made over the opposition of Heyward and CBS News anchor Dan
Rather _ to broadcast an NFL game on Dec. 19 rather than the first
House of Representatives vote to impeach a president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was the only major network to stick with previously
scheduled programming (and was rewarded with higher ratings for the
football game than the other networks received for coverage of the
impeachment vote). Heyward and Rather acknowledged that they were
disappointed that the network chose to broadcast the football game,
though Heyward noted CBS provided seven news updates during the
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of a possible merger between CBS and CNN, the
subject of much speculation, Heyward and Moonves played down the
possibility, though neither ruled it out. In the interview, Heyward
acknowledged that CBS has had discussions with CNN since 1996 about
some form of alliance, but he said there are many obstacles to a
merger, including issues such as who would wield editorial control
and how the different approaches to news could be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   He said CNN still is identified with ``generic, wire-service
news,'' adding, ``If CBS became that, there wouldn't be a reason to
exist for us.'' In addition, he said, there is ``ambivalence within
Time-Warner,'' owner of CNN, about a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward also denounced as ``outrageous'' a subpoena issued to
``60 Minutes'' by a Marine Corps prosecutor who is seeking tapes of
an interview the CBS newsmagazine conducted with the pilot of a
military jet involved in a fatal accident last year in the Italian
Alps. CBS has filed a motion in military court arguing that the
subpoena for tapes that have not yet aired abridges the network's
rights under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the outcry over a November ``60 Minutes'' broadcast that
showed Dr. Jack Kevorkian administering a fatal dose to a Michigan
man suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, Heyward said he has had no
second thoughts about permitting the broadcast. ``It did what good
journalism is supposed to do, which is provoke debate about
important national issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves raised some eyebrows during a press conference when he
criticized the Gore Commission, of which he was a member, as ``rife
with bureaucracy,'' and said it was not ``a worthwhile exercise.''
The commission was established to draft a report to Vice President
Al Gore, the FCC, and Congress on what the obligations of
broadcasters should be in return for use of the new digital
spectrum.

`SUPERBOMB': ARMS RACE MADNESS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RACE FOR THE SUPERBOMB 
Produced by: Thomas Ott 
Channel: PBS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a dry, slow start, ``Race for the Superbomb,'' a new
edition of PBS's ``The American Experience,'' should be on
everyone's TV-viewing calendar. Is there a more chilling or
important late 20th-century story than that of the competitive Cold
War bomb-building and brinksmanship that imperiled humanity and
bequeathed to the world still-present dangers?
</P>
<P>
   It's fearful and sobering to be reminded of how close to
extinction the world may have come in the 1950s as the United
States and the Soviet Union secretly constructed and stockpiled
earthshaking weapons of mass destruction. And how both superpowers
proceeded aggressively but almost blindly, unsure about just what
to do with the unimaginably destructive forces their top physicists
were eagerly harnessing.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Superbomb'' captures the mad atmosphere of
national paranoia _ fanned by historical experiences like Japan's
surprise attack on the US military base at Pearl Harbor in 1941 _
that drove the perilous arms race. Significantly, it reveals how
irresistible the advancement of knowledge was even to scientists
deeply worried about the consequences of their weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two-hour documentary, President Eisenhower
concluded privately that nuclear war was ``insanity,'' but insisted
he didn't know what else the nation could do to provide security.
His Soviet counterpart, Premier Khrushchev, had similarly deep
reservations, but also fueled the Cold War with bellicose talk and
frightening bomb-testing programs and production.
</P>
<P>
   The second hour of ``Race'' is a captivating real-life horror
story on an immense scale played out on several levels _ political,
scientific, social, and cultural. But to get there, you have to
endure the first hour devoted largely to the development of the
H-Bomb or ``Super,'' as physicist and advocate Edward Teller dubbed
it. ``Endure'' may be too strong a word, but the first half
resembles an encyclopedia entry: informative but largely colorless,
devoid of the second hour's dynamic interweaving of political and
social material.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of access to recently released civil defense and
US military films, ``Superbomb'' is able to dramatize the scope of
the government's pernicious propaganda. Although US leaders knew
about the inescapable horrors of nuclear war, the government
``educated'' citizens about how to hide under couches or flee
cities to avoid harm. The wooden civil defense footage would be
funny if it weren't also disturbingly deceptive and antidemocratic.
Another film reveals how the US military tried to dispel fear of
atomic war among infantry troops. (At the end, a relieved soldier
is seen drawing deeply on his cigarette.) ``Superbomb'' also covers
the less surprising deceits perpetrated by the USSR, whose early
bomb-construction program under Stalin was aided by slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the design of this literate, impressively researched film
goes beyond exposing the lies, delusions, and human losses that
accompanied the arms buildup it carefully chronicles. Often
dramatic and disconcerting, ``Superbomb'' is history bristling with
implications _ about unprecedented US peacetime militarization and
the risks sometimes inherent in scientific progress. And about not
only the awesome power of megaton bombs but also of fear itself.

BREACHING SECURITY AT U.S. AIRPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Va., Mo., Iowa., N.C., Texas, Ind., Fla.)   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How good is airport security?
</P>
<P>
   Good enough, the Federal Aviation Administration has said
repeatedly. Even so, efforts by outsiders to assess security at
America's airports are all but fruitless, because the FAA says it
cannot provide details without giving away information that could
help terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But FAA reports of violations by one airline show that agents
masquerading as passengers were able to smuggle guns, hand grenades
and bombs past security guards and their scanners, or send the
weapons in through exits.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, 1993, for example, a female FAA agent entered the
departure terminal of Port Columbus International Airport, in
Columbus, Ohio, with a handgun under her waistband, in the small of
her back.
</P>
<P>
   She set off a metal detector and was ``selected for examination
by the checkpoint security supervisor using a hand held metal
detector,'' according to FAA documents.
</P>
<P>
   The security supervisor passed the metal detector over the FAA
agent, and the alarm sounded when it was over the area of the
handgun, according to the report. The wand was passed over the FAA
agent a second time, and again the alarm sounded in the area of the
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   But the security supervisor ``failed to take any further action
and the subject with the handgun in her waistband entered the
sterile area,'' and was free to proceed toward the boarding gate,
the FAA reported
</P>
<P>
   The documents also recount how an investigator strolled
unchallenged into unguarded aircraft. In another instance, federal
employees sent to ticket counters with the assignment of drawing
suspicion to themselves _ by paying cash for the next flight out,
or refusing to show identification, for example _ provoked no
special security precautions toward their bags. Others were never
asked if they were carrying packages from strangers, or if they
replied that they were carrying such packages, the airline failed
to react appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, a pile 51/2 inches thick, were on USAir, now known
as USAirways, and were given to The New York Times in response to a
Freedom of Information Act request. The documents, requested in
November 1996, were released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Times requested the documents after the FAA made a brief
announcement in November 1996 that it would settle 84 charges
against the airline for $450,000, but would give no details on the
charges. Under the same request, the FAA released documents on
safety violations in April 1997. But 73 other alleged violations
involved security.
</P>
<P>
   Cathal Flynn, the FAA's associate administrator for civil
aviation security, said Friday that the violations summarized in
the documents were characteristic of those occurring now, and that
USAirways' security record was about the same as all big airlines'.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that these represented only the failures, and he
pointed out that of the 10,000 tests conducted by the FAA each
year, the airlines pass most.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said the tests are getting tougher, forcing the airlines
to detect smaller smuggled objects, for example, and that generally
the airlines are improving.
</P>
<P>
   The security rules under which the airlines operate are secret
and many details of the violations were blacked out before the
documents were released. Here, though, is a sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 6, 1995: An FAA security agent posing as a passenger used a
personal credit card at the ticket counter in Kansas City to buy a
ticket to Des Moines on a flight leaving that morning. The airline
representative asked if he had been given a package by anyone
unknown to him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I replied that the night previous, I was in a pizza parlor in
Parkville, Mo., with my wife and was discussing my trip to Des
Moines,'' the security agent replied. ``A young man apparently
overhead our discussion and asked if I would take some books to Des
Moines for a friend of his. He explained that this `friend' would
come to my motel and pick up the books.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline agent ``asked me if I checked the box to see if it
really contained only books, and I replied `no,''' the FAA agent
said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline agent went to a back room to consult with someone,
according to the FAA report, and then returned to ask her customer
whether the incident in the pizza parlor had occurred that day, or
the night before. ``I replied `last night,' '' the FAA agent said.
``She then stated that everything was OK, presented me with my
ticket and accepted my checked bag with the 'unknown
person/package' inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had sought a fine of $8,750, but the case was closed as
part of the general settlement in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   May 22, 1996: An FAA agent, posing as a passenger, paid $326
cash at the ticket counter at Charlotte, N.C., for a round-trip
ticket to Raleigh, and checked a bag, a combination that should
have triggered a special search of the bag. The ticket agent ``was
being assisted by a trainee employee, who in his zeal to assist,
attached the bag tag and loaded it on the belt,'' with no special
screening, according to the documents. The ticket agent said later
that she did not believe the FAA agent met the criteria for special
screening, because he had bought a round-trip ticket; two of her
supervisors agreed. But all three were wrong, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   USAir argued it should not be fined, partly because it suspended
the ticket agent for a week without pay and put her on probation
for 18 months. ``The severity of the discipline would serve as an
effective example to all employees of the importance placed on full
compliance with security directive procedures,'' the airline said
in a letter to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA deleted the amount of the proposed fine.
</P>
<P>
   April 7, 1994: William Olive Jr. usually carries his 9mm Colt
handgun in the glove box of his car, but had put it in his
soft-sided briefcase and forgotten it. Then he went to the airport
in Tampa to catch a flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the briefcase on the X-ray machine on its side as I
usually do and it passed through screening without any
interruption,'' he later told the FAA in a letter. At the gate, he
opened the briefcase to get his ticket, and saw his loaded gun. He
told the ticket agent, who told him to go back to the checkpoint,
where the screeners ran his briefcase through the machine a second
time.
</P>
<P>
   USAir told the FAA that ``due to the position of the gun during
presentation, the X-ray image produced a long, narrow bar,
resembling a curling iron or similar device.'' The company, asking
that it not be fined, said it had administered 564 tests at Tampa
in the prior 12 months, with a 97 percent pass rate, and that it
had also detected and confiscated ``31 real weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it reviewed its records and found eight similar
violations, none at Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 15, 1995: An FAA agent posing as a passenger arrived for a
flight from Akron-Canton Regional Airport, in North Canton, Ohio,
and checked one bag. Asked by the ticket agent for identification,
the passenger replied that ``he did not have a driver's license due
to the fact it was taken from him because of several traffic
violations.'' The ticket agent warned that the man's bag would not
be put on the plane unless the passenger himself boarded.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline put the bag on the plane and carried it to its
destination, and the ``passenger'' did not board.
</P>
<P>
   USAir had accumulated at least 22 similar violations between
July 1, 1995, and July 1, 1996, the FAA said.

<P>
   June 13, 1996: FAA agents at Terminal 2W at Dallas/Fort Worth
``were able to introduce an FAA-approved test object (hand grenade)
into the sterile area using the revolving exit door without
detection. The Special Agents repeated the evaluation using a bag
containing all the following FAA-approved test objects; a hand
grenade, a dynamite bomb, a pipe bomb and an encapsulated weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time during the evaluations did the sensor activate,
stop the door and prevent the introduction of the test objects,''
the documents report. ``A mitigating factor to be considered is the
corrective action taken to post a guard at location of the door to
preclude further unauthorized access.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent's statement said he used a black vinyl knapsack
weighing about nine pounds. ``Several passengers observed the
testing but did not report our actions,'' the agent wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 30, 1994: A female air traffic controller was recruited by
FAA security personnel as a tester, and she walked through a metal
detector at Indianapolis International Airport with a gun, setting
off the detector. A security screener went over the controller with
a hand wand and waived her through, failing to find the gun.
</P>
<P>
   USAir said in a letter to the FAA that using the wand on the
passenger, the screener ``had unintentionally touched her chest
with the hand wand which made him very self-conscious in being
careful not to touch the tester again. In this effort, he believes
he held the wand away from her body more than the recommended 1-3
inches making the wand ineffective in detecting the test object.''
The airline said it had bought wands that worked within a 10-inch
range.
</P>
<P>
   April 9, 1996: An FAA agent carried a blue briefcase with a
``test object'' through security at Roanoke Regional Airport, and
then confronted the screener, who had missed it on the X-ray
machine's display.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of the (word deleted) object was clearly visible as
a dark silhouette against a light background,'' the agent reported.
When the agent asked the security screener to say what she thought
the test object was, as viewed on the x-ray monitor, the screener
said ``she had thought that the round grenade was possibly a ladies
compact makeup case.''
</P>
<P>
   And on hundreds of occasions, the airline accepted packages from
unknown shippers without verifying their contents, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Flynn said of the incident involving the screener who
touched the passenger with the wand, ``as a human, one understands
the kind of thing that happens there. The screeners have a
difficult job to do, to be courteous, to avoid excessively
bothering people, but yet to ensure that they are no longer causing
an alarm before they proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency insists that the screeners do their job right, he
said.

COMMENTARY: BEATING THE YANQUIS AT THEIR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cuban and American leaders are pondering the issue of whether a
Baltimore Orioles visit to Cuba would strengthen or weaken the
regime of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The question seems improbable, yet governments have long used
baseball to promote their values and politics. When the Sandinistas
took power in beisbol-crazed Nicaragua in 1979, they considered
banning the sport. Instead, they decided they could use it to help
build the New Socialist Man. They began with Managua's 30,000-seat
stadium, called ``Anastasio Somoza Garcia'' after the father of the
dynasty the Sandinistas overthrew. They renamed the stadium for the
man who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American governments love to use the symbol of America as a
political canvas. Baseball was exported to Mexico by American
railroad engineers, to Japan by missionaries and to Panama by canal
builders. An American consul created the first Nicaraguan team in
1905. Baseball's empire encompasses mainly countries that have
spent long periods in America's grip.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment and revolution also flower in these environments, one
reason Cuba, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have all had
governments that might want the Yankees to win, but certainly want
the Yanquis to lose. And although foreign fans, especially
Dominicans, treat their major-league players as national heroes,
many also resent a baseball relationship that has mirrored
America's economic and political practices abroad, with the gringos
raiding the best players and then claiming their tournament as the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, besuboru is designed to reinforce the values of
selflessness, obedience to authority, hard work and loyalty. Robert
Whiting, who has written books on Japanese ball, notes that players
practice to near-collapse. A players' strike is inconceivable, and
few players even change teams or demand high salaries. A superstar
American player who took leave from his Japanese team when his
8-year-old son had brain surgery was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball stadiums in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s looked like
American ballparks before the days of Beanie Baby giveaways and
exploding scoreboards. In the Heroes and Martyrs of September
stadium in Leon, Nicaragua's second-largest city, signs advertised
Coke and beer, vendors sold hot dogs and the announcers hawked
local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua's best player was Julio Medina, captain of the
national team and Sandinista icon. Before the revolution, Medina
had grown up cheering for the Cincinnati Reds, but when a scout for
the Reds offered Medina a contract in 1984, he said, essentially:
No thanks, I'd rather be an agronomist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of the revolution and in sports want to form a new
man, both as a professional and as a sportsman,'' he told me at the
time. Biology student by day, member of the Sandinista Youth,
Medina even turned down the per diem players received when
traveling abroad. When I watched him play, he shook hands with the
opposing players when he reached their bases. At one point he
tagged out a player trying to steal second, and as the player
walked away, Medina shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Havana, the Olympic gold medals won by Cuba's baseball
players help show the superiority of socialism. Players who want to
pitch for the Yankees must come to America by raft.
</P>
<P>
   But pre-revolutionary Cuba had minor-league teams. One American
scout, Joe Cambria of the Washington Senators, lived in Havana.
Castro, who pitched (right-handed) at the University of Havana, had
two tryouts with the Senators but was rejected _ good slider,
mediocre fastball. Baseball will not bring Castro's regime to an
end. But had Cambria been more patient with a developing prospect,
baseball might have prevented it.

CLARE POTTER, WHO SET TRENDS IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES, DIES AT 95
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn., Va.)   (jw) 
 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clare Potter, a leading American fashion designer of the 1930s
and '40s known for imaginative use of color and simplicity of line,
died Jan. 5 at her home in Fort Ann, N.Y. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Claire McCardell and Tina Leser, Ms. Potter was one
of the designers credited with inventing American sportswear, a
style that has influenced designers all over the world. She was a
featured designer at Lord &AMP; Taylor when the store was headed by the
legendary Dorothy Shaver, and received the first Lord &AMP; Taylor
Design Award in 1938 for ``distinguished designing in the field of
sports clothes for women.'' She also received a Neiman Marcus Award
in 1939 and a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1946. In 1939, she
designed a blue wool dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to meet
King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Ms. Potter's designs are in an exhibition called,
``Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960,'' at the Wadsworth
Atheneum in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the
curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
``She was one of that first group in the 1930s of designers
recognized by name. She was recognized by American women for
getting rid of ornamentation. She wasn't the boldest, like Claire
McCardell, but she was known for color and simple textures, for a
discreet style of dressing, for sophisticated sportswear.''
</P>
<P>
   An aristocratic-looking woman who loved sports, particularly
horseback riding, Ms. Potter designed for women like herself who
favored casual clothes that were simple yet sophisticated. ``Large
numbers of American women want clothes that are refined,'' Ms.
Potter said in a 1948 interview with The New York Times. ``I aim to
give them in a medium-priced, ready-to-wear costume what they would
find in custom-made styles.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the styles she was known for were the two-piece swimsuit
consisting of a bra and bloomers, the evening sweater and the
sidesaddle-draped skirt. Even for evening, her designs tended to be
as casual as a shirt and skirt or pants and a tunic. One outfit of
the 1940s combined a rose-colored blouse, a pale blue floor-length
skirt and a green belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses,
trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie
Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of
Technology. ``She wasn't influenced by Paris, but by the modern
American leisure life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Potter was born in Jersey City, N.J., in 1903. Her affinity
for color could be traced to an interest in art she developed while
in high school, where she was art editor of the school paper, and
continued with studies at the Art Students League. Although she did
not know how to sew, she took a draping course and produced what
she later described as ``my first weird costume,'' consisting of a
long, slinky red wool dress with huge silk sleeves that she dyed to
match.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and after graduation found a job with a dress manufacturer. In
1948, she went into partnership with Martha Stout, a former
magazine editor, in a ready-to-wear company called Timbertop. The
name came from the turkey farm in West Nyack, N.Y., where Ms.
Potter lived with her husband, J. Sanford Potter, an architect.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the mid-1950s she was in business on her own, working from a
barn on her farm with her husband drafting the patterns for her
clothing. ``It was very chic to go out there and buy things in a
lovely spot,'' recalled Virginia Wagoner Booth, who was then a
buyer for Lord &AMP; Taylor and became a lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Potter designed and built a Japanese-style
house in Fort Ann on Lake Nebo, where the couple grew camellias and
raised Dalmatians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept horses down in Virginia,'' Ms. Booth said, ``and
went down every weekend in the fall to hunt. Clare remained
physically active almost until the end. When she took to her
bedroom, she could look out at the lake and see the birds. She
loved to watch and feed the birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sandy died four years ago,'' she added, referring to
Potter, ``we scattered his ashes on the property. We'll do the same
thing with hers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Potter left no survivors.

ADVERTISING: HUMOR IS CATALYST IN NEW $40 MILLION KINKO'S CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you feel warm and fuzzy when AT&AMP;T urged you to ``Reach out
and touch someone''? Did your eyes tear when Hallmark cajoled you
to ``care enough to send the very best''?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered yes, you are among the intended audience for an
ambitious campaign from a leading business services marketer. The
campaign, which begins Monday, uses humor to help convince
consumers that presentation materials, color copies and video
conferences should be considered ways to communicate along with
telephone calls and greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   Kinko's Inc., which operates more than 900 retail stores in nine
countries, is introducing the campaign as part of a marketing
effort with a budget of $40 million. The campaign, which carries
the theme ``Express yourself,'' includes television, print and
outdoor advertising; a redesigned Web site (www.kinkos.com);
promotions and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is the first for Kinko's by the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit
of Omnicom Group since the agency's Playa del Rey, Calif., office
was awarded the account in July. Previous ads portrayed Kinko's as
``your branch office'' and ``the new way to office,'' whatever that
meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinko's was focusing internally, talking about the functional
side, the buildings and machines,'' said Ellen Turner, senior vice
president for marketing and sales at Kinko's in Ventura, Calif.
``We knew we needed to change the lens to focusing back on the
customer, the benefits of going to Kinko's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By saying that you have ideas and Kinko's helps you
communicate them,'' she added, ``we're now pushing out to the
emotional side.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shift the emphasis, Ms. Turner said, was based
on research among customers ``trying to understand why they use
Kinko's instead of someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're considered a product, someone down the street can
have your product at a better price,'' she added, ``and you're
toast. If you're considered a service, you're their friend, and
that generates loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign starts with four playful television commercials
that present life moments, exaggerated for effect, when services
from Kinko's prove surprisingly useful. All end with an announcer's
assertion that ``sometimes, it's not just what you say, but how you
say it.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in one spot, police use an overhead slide
projector to make a presentation to persuade robbers cornered
inside a bank to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've assembled officers here, here and here,'' a police
official proclaims, gesturing to points on a diagram projected on a
wall, ``as well as sharpshooters here and here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause. A robber emerges from the bank and asks: ``The
sharpshooters. Where are they again?''
</P>
<P>
   In a second commercial, when a flight ``stuck in Idaho''
prevents a football coach from being with his players for a big
game, he communicates with them by means of a video conference; a
TV set is rolled from the locker room onto the field so he can
follow the team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a third spot, a man offers a pad of flip charts to a woman to
bolster his proposal of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth commercial features chickens in a henhouse listening to
a farmer's speech, supplemented with graphs, enticing them to
increase egg output. The alternative, he warns, can be seen on a
chart labeled ``Plan B,'' depicting a bucket of fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic product demonstration, but with the twist of
putting people in unexpected situations,'' said Clay Williams, a
managing partner and creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, who
worked on the campaign with his partner, Chuck Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty dry category with not a whole lot of
excitement built in,'' Williams said. ``But looking at the output
of a Kinko's as a reflection on the consumer personally, it's
possible to establish a real emotional tie to the place.''
</P>
<P>
   TBWA/Chiat/Day is known for humorous work that entertains
consumers, particularly its campaigns for longtime clients like
Energizer, Nissan and Taco Bell. But there is a contentious debate
along Madison Avenue over whether yuks generate bucks _ that is,
whether entertaining ads actually stimulate sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of criticism of humor for humor's sake,'' said
Bennett, who is also a managing partner and creative director at
TBWA/Chiat/Day. ``But here the humor comes out of the brand, and
the brand is at the center of the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough cuts of the commercials were tested with consumers, he
added, who responded by ``telling us they were appreciative of the
humor and of the humorous truth in the spots, where Kinko's more or
less comes to the rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said, ``If you give short shrift to selling, there's
nothing funny about that when the account goes in review.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will appear on programs like ``60 Minutes'' and
``Dateline,'' that often carry pitches for business services, as
well as on what Ms. Turner called ``programs watched by a younger,
`doer'-oriented group'' like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Politically
Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the print ads will appear in mainstay business
magazines like Fortune, she added, as well as in publications new
to Kinko's like ESPN Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Vanity Fair
and Wired.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads adopt the same tongue-in-cheek tone as the
commercials. For example, one ad shows a ``Dear John'' letter with
a fever chart tracking a steep decline in ``amount of love for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``P.S.'' in the form of a pie chart labeled ``Who to
blame: you, 3 percent; me, 97 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   If for some reason the campaign does not work, perhaps
TBWA/Chiat/Day can send that chart to Kinko's.

THIS WEEK WILL HAVE A THEME FOR A PROBABLE GORE CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While still months from officially declaring
himself a presidential candidate, Vice President Al Gore is
scheduled to announce a series of initiatives this week that his
aides say will be major themes of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Gore will unveil the administration's budget request
for community planning programs. On Tuesday, he will propose tax
incentives for education and job training programs. On Wednesday,
he will award Empowerment Zone grants and speak to a Jewish group
in New York in support of the Israeli peace process. On Thursday
and Friday, he will be the host for officials from 45 countries at
a conference to promote open trade.
</P>
<P>
   These issues may sound familiar, as they have been hallmarks of
the Clinton administration. But as the backbone of Gore's campaign,
they clearly define him as an extension of Clinton, a calculation
that suggests the vice president is confident voters will reward
him for the administration's successes but not blame him for the
president's personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican presidential hopefuls, Lamar Alexander, the
former governor of Tennessee, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, have
denounced Gore as an apologist for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the electoral clock is ticking, we are still more
than two years away from the term of the next president,'' Gore
said Sunday in an interview. ``So while political speculation is
understandable and omnipresent, for my part, I'm going to continue
to focus on my work as vice president and put off for quite some
time into the future a formal announcement of my candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say he is betting that with the stars aligned as
they are _ a robust national economy, an enormously popular
president and a Clinton-Gore fund-raising apparatus already tapping
Democratic donors for the $20 million Gore expects to raise by
December _ the vice president risks nothing by not stepping out
from behind Clinton, even with the impeachment trial set to begin
this week.

RANGERS' VICTORY SETS UP A MOVE INTO PLAYOFF CONTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Except for the injury to Petr Nedved, the Rangers
emerged from Sunday's victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning with
several reasons to smile. By beating the woeful Lightning by 5-2 in
Madison Square Garden, they moved one victory from the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   They scored on their first shot of the game, off the rush, by
Mike Knuble. They scored on a penalty shot by John MacLean. They
got another nifty performance from Dan Cloutier, their backup
goalie, who made 22 saves. And their two offensive stars, Brian
Leetch and Wayne Gretzky, returned to the score sheet after modest
absences.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rangers play three more last-place teams _ the Islanders
on Wednesday, Chicago on Friday and Montreal on Saturday. Like the
Lightning, all three rank at the bottom of their respective
divisions. Another hot streak, and the Rangers are quite capable of
them, could put the Blue Shirts (16-17-7) back into playoff
contention as they pass the halfway point of their 82-game
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But they will need the help of Nedved, their creative center who
helped manufacture Knuble's goal by carrying the puck with speed,
drawing the coverage toward him and then leaving a pass at the blue
line for Leetch, who set up Knuble's classy finish at the 20-second
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Nedved fell to the ice after his
right knee collided with the right knee of Pavel Kubina during what
Nedved called a pick play. The Rangers described the injury as a
mild knee sprain. Coach John Muckler called it a first-degree knee
sprain and added, ``If you are going to have a sprain, that's the
best to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, who has eight goals and 14 assists in 21 games, seemed
uneasy and uncertain about playing against the Islanders on
Wednesday. ``We'll see how it goes tomorrow,'' he said. ``It's
sore. Definitely, it's not 100 percent.'' Should he miss the game,
the Rangers would probably use Manny Malhotra, who moved up from
the fourth line and took Nedved's place between Knuble and Niklas
Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a two-game losing streak against a team that
leaves town with a five-game losing streak. The Rangers had beaten
the Lightning by 10-2 in Tampa in their first meeting this season.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is Tampa? Late in the first period, Wendel Clark of the
Lightning, with no one around him, lost control of his feet and
crashed into the boards. In light of his tough-guy persona, it is a
wonder Clark did not drop his gloves and start punching himself in
the head. He is but one name on a roster of discards from
everyone's recycling bins. Here a Stephane Richer, who scored one
of the goals; there a Benoit Hogue, who has feuded with Coach
Jacques Demers; here a Craig Janney, who did not dress; there a
Petr Svoboda, who left with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch, without a point in his previous six games, had three
assists, although he has not scored a goal in 14 games. ``I love
day games,'' the captain said. ``I'd like to play one a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, with no points in his previous two games and no goals
in his previous nine, had a power-play goal, one assist and four
shots on goal. The goal was No. 892 of his 20-year career, the most
ever by a National Hockey League player. Gretzky, who has said ``I
wear my heart on my sleeve'' when showing emotion, now wears,
literally, a heart on his jersey. His wife, Janet, put the tiny,
red valentine on the back of his shirt, just inside the first ``9''
of his number ``99.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean scored for the second time on two penalty shots in his
career. This one came at the 12-minute-12-second mark of the first
period, as the Rangers were killing a penalty, and it gave the
Rangers a 2-0 lead. Pulled down from behind by Drew Bannister,
MacLean was awarded the shot by Paul Stewart, who refereed in a
flamboyant style. MacLean skated in on the goal, faked back to the
forehand and beat Bill Ranford between the skates for his 14th goal
of the season. He is second on the team, behind Adam Graves, who
got his 18th at 16:25 as the Rangers decided this one early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to jump on them,'' MacLean said. ``We knew it was
their third game in three and a half days.'' Because his goal took
place while his team was killing a penalty, it technically counted
as a short-handed goal, the first for the Rangers in 122 games.
Marc Savard scored the other Ranger goal, on the power play at 5:12
of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   For Cloutier, it was his seventh start of the season and it
raised his record to 3-3-2. Although he was one of the stars, the
spotlight was also shared by Stewart, the referee who recently
recovered from colon cancer. After awarding the one-penalty shot,
Stewart ignored another obvious penalty shot when a Tampa player
gloved the puck in the crease. He called Malhotra for a diving
infraction. Twice he penalized the Rangers by two men for two full
minutes. Once he put the Lightning two men down for 72 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   A former player who had a brawling style, Stewart is loquacious
and well liked even by those hockey folks who occasionally question
the consistency of his judgment. On Sunday, his curious
decision-making kept things interesting.

 EDITORIAL: THE EXPANDING PRESIDENTIAL RACE  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The nation's crop of presidential candidates is exploding. Sen.
John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire
recently became official Republican hopefuls. Elizabeth Dole
cleared the way for what her aides say is likely to be a
presidential bid, and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
announced his intention to announce.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley are in the race. Sen. John Kerry is in what
politicians like to call ``testing the waters'' mode. Things are
happening so fast that other potential candidates, like Sen. Bob
Kerrey, a Democrat, and John Ashcroft, a Republican, have felt
obliged to rule themselves out of the running for nominations that
will not be formally bestowed on anyone until the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to run is being driven mainly by money worries. The
calendar for the next presidential primaries is so front-loaded
that both nominations will probably be decided in early March.
Conventional wisdom holds that a candidate needs to raise at least
$20 million this year to compete seriously. Every day a potential
candidate delays making a commitment is one day less to solicit
money.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential hopefuls, like Alexander and Dan Quayle, have
been running for months without any campaign committee, raising
money through ``leadership'' political-action committees that
theoretically exist only to promote certain issues that the
candidate in question also happens to espouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have been most successful in attracting
candidates for the nomination, because the field seems so open.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is the man everyone has been watching.
But if Bush does intend to run, he is certainly discreet enough to
wait at least until he is sworn in for a second term this month
before he announces he wants to move on to higher office.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mrs. Dole's ambitions are creating most of the
stir, since she could be the first woman to make a competitive bid
for her party's presidential nomination. Although Mrs. Dole has yet
to declare her candidacy, her announcement that she is quitting her
job as president of the American Red Cross is evidence that she is
serious. Giving up a good job is a far more convincing show of
intention than the creation of an ``exploratory committee.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does run for president, there is a danger that the
Republican field will quickly dwindle. That would be too bad. The
peculiar schedule of the primaries and the loathsome state of
campaign finance could easily create a situation in which a
front-runner stumbles under the intense scrutiny of the media early
next year, but there is no other candidate with enough money to
make an effective challenge.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to regard either of the early favorites as
unstoppable. Bush has never been tested in a national campaign.
Gore may look like a shoo-in now, but the events of the last few
years have demonstrated how much can happen in a short period of
time to make a strong candidate less attractive, particularly if
the candidate in question is a member of the current
administration.
</P>
<P>
   While any discussion of the year 2000 election now may seem too
much too soon to the public, the sight of all these candidates is
heartening. We hope the field still looks crowded 12 months down
the road.

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS LEGALLY UNIQUE, LAWYERS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.Y.)  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-POLITICS, IMPEACH-HISTORY) 
(js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In setting a detailed schedule to resume the
president's impeachment trial but putting off the vexing issue of
whether witnesses will be heard, the Senate demonstrated to many
lawyers and others just how different the impeachment trial was
from any other legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thoroughly odd way to do business,'' said Yale Kamisar,
a professor of criminal procedure at the University of Michigan Law
School. The strangest element, he said, is to begin the trial and
only decide later in the process whether or which witnesses will be
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``In no other kind of proceeding do you have this kind of
piecemeal approach where you get started and see how things develop
and then decide what to do,'' Kamisar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really sui generis,'' a situation without exact legal
parallel, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial also defies description in that it is
neither a civil nor a criminal proceeding in the normal meaning of
the word. Burt Neuborne of the New York University Law School said
that it bore elements of both, but argued that it should probably
be closer to a criminal proceeding because of the gravity of the
event and the need to have the greatest protections for the
accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the consequences are so great and the importance to
the nation is so overwhelming, there should be the most cautious
set of procedures and standards,'' Neuborne said. ``That's most
close to criminal proceedings where you have the guaranteed right
to counsel and notice of the charges as well as the right to
cross-examine witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Another distinction is that in trials, both civil and criminal,
a judge is the ultimate arbiter and is charged with ensuring that
all the proceedings conform to traditional notions of fairness and
due process.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains unclear whether Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will serve in the trial as anything more than a presiding officer,
as many have suggested. Any ruling Rehnquist makes may be
overturned by a majority of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Neuborne said he believed that the chief justice was obliged,
nonetheless, to try to enforce a sense of due process. For example,
he said, under the plan approved on Friday, it would be possible
for the Senate to vote to allow witnesses called by the House
prosecutors but to deny hearing witnesses offered by the
president's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuborne said that should be unthinkable and the chief
justice would have to block such an event. ``They may be able to
limit the witnesses the prosecution presents, but they cannot limit
the witnesses the president might think he needs to mount his
defense,'' he said. ``And the chief justice took an oath himself,
and it's clear he has an obligation to maintain some legal
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rough plan agreed to on Friday, either side may depose
the other side's witnesses before they can be called to testify
before the Senate. That feature, which is intended to prevent any
surprises, is typical of a civil rather than a criminal proceeding.
In criminal trials, lawyers may seek to question the other side but
there is no obligation to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that figures in almost all other legal proceedings
but which seems to have no place in the Senate trial is a defined
standard of proof. Criminal trials require that a conviction be
beyond a reasonable doubt, a standard of proof that legal
historians say dates from 1770, when British soldiers were put on
trial for killing civilians in the Boston Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Civil trials have two different standards of proof: ``a
preponderance of the evidence,'' used in most proceedings, and
``clear and convincing evidence,'' a slightly higher standard used
in extraordinary proceedings like loss of citizenship, commitment
to an institution or taking custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Baron, a Washington lawyer who helped prosecute two
impeachment cases before the Senate against Alcee Hastings and
Walter Nixon Jr., both federal judges, said each senator may decide
on his or her own what the standard should be. At the time of his
trial in 1989, Hastings explicitly asked that the highest standard
of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, be required and the Senate
rejected that, Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike all civil and criminal proceedings, which may be
appealed through the court system, the verdict in the impeachment
trial may not be taken to the courts, in the view of most scholars.
In his 1993 ruling on the impeachment of Nixon, Rehnquist wrote
that the Constitution made the Senate the sole arbiter of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David Souter filed a concurring opinion, saying that
impeachments are not generally subject to court review, but if the
Senate chose to make its decision on some outrageous standard, like
a coin toss, the courts might then step in.

U.S. NOW TELLS OF MUCH DEEPER DAMAGE BY POLLARD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adamant that President Clinton refuse requests for
clemency for Jonathan Pollard, an American spy for Israel, U.S.
military and intelligence officials say Pollard did more damage to
national security than the public has been told.
</P>
<P>
   An article to be published in The New Yorker on Monday cites
those officials as saying that Pollard, who was arrested in 1985
and is now serving a life sentence, gave Israel invaluable American
intelligence secrets in exchange for payments of $50,000 and
promises of $540,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, intelligence officials confirmed the gist of the
magazine article, written by the investigative reporter Seymour
Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have long suspected that information
delivered to Israel by Pollard was subsequently obtained by the
Soviet intelligence services _ either deliberately handed over by
Israel in exchange for freedom for Soviet Jews or surreptitiously
obtained by Moscow's spies in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard and his supporters have contended that he did not do
real damage to American national security and should be pardoned or
paroled.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the deadline that Clinton gave American military,
intelligence and law enforcement agencies last month for submitting
their views on the question, a response to demands for Pollard's
release made by Israel in October at the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations held at Wye Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and intelligence officials have said the FBI,
CIA and Defense Department will submit reports arguing against
leniency. The State Department and Justice Department are also to
give their views.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Clinton and his aides were not likely to make a
decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents Pollard handed over to Israel, Hersh's
article said, was a 10-volume directory of the frequencies and
bandwidths of signals intercepted worldwide by the National
Security Agency, which is the United States' primary electronic
eavesdropping service and its biggest espionage entity.
</P>
<P>
   That set of data would afford a foreign intelligence service
deep insights into American techniques for spying on the world.
Pollard told the author that U.S. officials had ``consistently
lied'' about the importance of the signal intelligence he gave the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Another set of documents divulged by Pollard, the article said,
was a computerized information retrieval system containing
intelligence reports filed by American spies, intelligence
analysts, military attaches and citizens in the Middle East. A
foreign intelligence service possessing this information could
determine the identities of intelligence agents and informers.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard also handed over more than a year's worth of reports
from a Navy surveillance station in Spain that monitored the Middle
East and North Africa, the article said.
</P>
<P>
   It said a fourth set was the daily list of telecommunications
interceptions undertaken by the National Security Agency. Such data
could help a foreign intelligence service evade detection by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The material handed over by Pollard showed how the United States
spied on Israel, just as his arrest and conviction showed how
Israel spied on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine article strongly suggested that Pollard, whom
it described as a cocaine abuser and an inveterate liar during the
time of his espionage for Israel, had no idea of the value of what
he handed over, and no concept of the damage it caused American
intelligence.

CRANE SUIT AGAINST COLTEC MAY ALTER MERGER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.C., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fate of Crane Co.'s $1.7 billion unsolicited takeover bid
for Coltec Industries now rests largely in the hands of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Crane has sued Coltec, which agreed in November to be acquired
by B.F. Goodrich for $1.4 billion and the assumption of debt, in a
last-ditch effort to derail the deal with Goodrich and force Coltec
to consider its offer.
</P>
<P>
   The battle among the three aerospace and industrial-products
companies may reach a turning point Monday, when Judge Barbara
Jones of U.S. District Court in New York is scheduled to hear
arguments on a motion by Coltec to dismiss Crane's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, based in Stamford, Conn., says it wants to use its shares
for a stock-for-stock deal with Coltec in what is called a
pooling-of-interests transaction. Such transactions are less
expensive and usually tax-free. As a result, they have been very
popular in many recent mergers, including that of Daimler-Benz and
Chrysler. At the same time, the accounting has been coming under
increased scrutiny from regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But a hostile bid for Coltec would make a pooling transaction
unworkable, Crane says, because of certain provisions in the
agreement between Coltec and Goodrich that allow the companies to
take shares in each other. The Crane lawsuit is likely to focus
attention on the use of pooling transactions and the resources
companies have to ward off unwanted takeover bids.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Crane contends that Coltec, by agreeing to be
acquired by Goodrich of Richfield, Ohio, broke a 1995 promise to
notify Crane of any offers to buy the company. The lawsuit, filed
last month, seeks to block Coltec's deal with Goodrich and to void
the anti-takeover provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Coltec, based in Charlotte, N.C., says that the 1995 agreement
with Crane, which came after the two companies held informal talks
about a possible deal, did not require it to notify Crane if a
third party expressed interest in buying the company, nor did it
prohibit it from negotiating an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The main anti-takeover provision in the agreement between Coltec
and Goodrich gives Goodrich an option to acquire as much as 19.9
percent of Coltec stock. Coltec has a similar option to acquire
Goodrich stock. The options would be set off if their merger does
not go through. Crane contends that such ``lock-up agreements''
hurt shareholders, because they can eliminate more lucrative
counteroffers.
</P>
<P>
   Options for cross-ownership are able to thwart unwanted takeover
bids because of accounting regulations that prohibit any
significant change in the holding of a company immediately before a
merger that uses a pooling transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Such a transfer of a significant amount of stock has the same
effect as a poison pill, a provision that typically makes the stock
of a target company more expensive for a would-be acquirer, noted
Robert Willens, a tax specialist with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Crane has said that it is interested in acquiring Coltec
only if it can use a pooling transaction, which would be less
expensive than a stock purchase. In a pooling transaction, merging
companies merely add together the book value of their assets; there
is no change from pre-merger values and no good will is created. As
a result, the transaction is tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the purchase method of accounting assumes that
one company buys the assets of another. If the price paid for the
acquired company exceeds the market value of its assets, the
difference is recorded as good will. The good will must then be
written off over a period of years, causing a reduction in earnings
each time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The popularity of pooling has certainly surged. In 1989, only 5
percent of the dollar volume of total transactions were
pooling-of-interests combinations. By the third quarter of 1998,
that had increased to 65 percent, according to Securities Data Co.
of Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting standards board and the Securities and Exchange
Commission have been looking more closely at such transactions in
response to criticisms that pooling allows companies to overpay for
acquisitions while leaving almost no trace on their books.
</P>
<P>
   And although poolings were intended for combinations in which
each company would own an equal stake in the other, they allow
transactions in which one company can own a majority stake in
another and still receive the preferential accounting treatment.
The accounting board is now studying whether two accounting methods
should continue to be used for mergers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the lock-up agreements between Coltec and
Goodrich could prevent another bid from a third party should the
deal between the two collapse, some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is the lock-up option precludes pooling that would
trigger the exercisability of the option,'' Willens of Lehman
Brothers said. ``Apparently the only way the lock-up option can be
rescinded is if the court decides the lock-up option was illegal
from the outset and strikes it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Lucas, director of research and technical accounting at
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, said the board had not
addressed whether the elimination of the lock-up agreement would
prevent pooling with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, several Wall Street analysts said that if the deal
fell through, Goodrich would probably give up the cross-ownership
and instead take the $50 million break-up fee, which is also part
of the agreement with Coltec.
</P>
<P>
   And should Crane succeed in the courts and get the lock-up
agreements voided, acquiring Coltec in a hostile pooling
transaction would still not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, out of 11 hostile bids structured as pooling
transactions, only three have been completed. The largest was
Newmont Mining's $2.86 billion acquisition of Santa Fe Pacific Gold
Corp., announced in December 1996.

BLUNDERING JAGUARS PLAYED AGAINST THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin kept
searching for words to describe the things he had seen his Jaguars
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foolish,'' Coughlin said. ``Ill advised. Dumb mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin had complimented the New York Jets for their 34-24
divisional playoff victory Sunday at Giants Stadium. He had praised
his team for a second-half rally that fell short, adding that he
was proud of quarterback Mark Brunell, who played on a sore left
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   But standing in a quiet corner of a somber locker room, Coughlin
shook his head as conversation inevitably came back to the Jaguars'
blunders _ three interceptions of Brunell, a fumble recovery that
ended as a bizarre fumble lost, and an inexplicable misstep after a
late interception by Jaguars safety Donovin Darius that cost
Jacksonville almost 20 yards at a pivotal time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Errors, that's what they were,'' Coughlin said. ``They were
the huge factors in the game. Very, very ill advised.''
</P>
<P>
   For sheer blooper value, nothing was as entertaining as the
bobbled attempted lateral by Jaguars safety Chris Hudson in the
second quarter. Leading by 10-0, the Jets were driving in Jaguars
territory moments after their first interception of Brunell, who
would finish the game with just 12 completions in 31 passing
attempts for 156 yards.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jaguars' 18-yard line, Jets running back Curtis Martin
fumbled, the ball bouncing directly into the hands of Hudson, who
burst up the field with the recovery. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde
was the lone Jet between Hudson and the end zone. As Hudson neared
both Testaverde and the sideline at midfield, he made eye contact
with his teammate Dave Thomas and attempted a lateral.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced off Thomas, who never seemed to gain
possession, knocking it forward, where it was covered by Keyshawn
Johnson at the Jets' 35-yard line. Turnover had led to turnover
and, 11 plays later, the Jets went ahead by 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Hudson was doing, Coughlin said, ``I wish I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said he was trying too hard to make a big play. ``Of
course, I wish I could take it back,'' he said. ``But I can't. I
won't be haunted by it. I feel down, but we had 59 other minutes to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Coughlin said, ``It might have been a different game if
it's 10-7 there instead of 17-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he was as startled as anyone to see Hudson heave the
ball at him. ``I thought he'd keep running,'' Thomas said. ``It was
a spontaneous decision. In the heat of the battle, things fly
through your head.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the line of reasoning Brunell used to explain his
decision to loft an underthrown ball in wide receiver Keenan
McCardell's direction on Jacksonville's first possession of the
second half. He might have blamed his injured ankle, but he did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a poorly thrown ball,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's pass was 5 yards behind McCardell, who was open up the
left sideline, and was intercepted by Jets safety Corwin Brown. The
Jets scored seven plays later to take a 24-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have stepped into it and gotten more on the throw,''
said Brunell, who acknowledged that his ankle hampered him, though
he rallied the Jaguars with two touchdown passes later in the
second half. ``It got up a bit and the wind got hold of it. A
foolish thing on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the Jaguars were doing wrong, they trailed the Jets by
only 7 points when Darius intercepted a Testaverde pass in the
Jacksonville end zone with 2 minutes 24 seconds remaining. After
catching the ball, Darius stepped inches over his the goal line in
a timid attempt to run back his interception. Surrounded by Jets,
he was tackled, giving the Jaguars the ball on the 1-yard line
instead of the 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I caught the ball, I collided with Keith Byars,'' Darius
said, referring to Testaverde's intended receiver. ``I jumped up
and my eyes were kind of blurred. I didn't know where I was. It was
a natural reaction to try and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin shook his head over Darius' mistake, too. ``I don't
know what he was thinking,'' Coughlin said. ``I'm sure he wasn't
thinking that he wanted to put the offense on the 1-yard line. But
I would have liked to have had the opportunity to tie the game
starting at our 20-yard line. That might have been a legitimate
chance.'' &QL;

<P>
   On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Dr. Spartaco Bellomo took a few
minutes before office hours began in his Jersey City, N.J., suite
to attend to one of the few traditions of medical practice that
have survived almost unchanged from the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It involved leaning back in his chair, listening, nodding,
asking a question or two and murmuring a few reassuring words. In
the chair opposite Bellomo, however, sat not a patient but Marie
Atkinson, a sales representative from Dupont Pharmaceuticals,
plugging the company's newest product.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are your patients doing on Sustiva, doctor?'' Ms. Atkinson
asked, her lap piled high with literature about the drug. One of
Bellomo's patients was doing very well indeed, and Ms. Atkinson
beamed. ``Excellent,'' she said, rising to go. ``Doctor, you've
made my day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1850 that a drug salesman first knocked on an American
doctor's door to take up just a few moments of his time, and the
dialogue has not stopped since. It is only growing louder. Since an
overhaul of the health care system fizzled four years ago, the
pharmaceutical sales force has exploded, from about 35,000
full-time sales representatives and supervisors in the top 40
pharmaceutical companies in 1994 to more than 56,000 now, according
to the Scott-Levin consulting firm in Pennsylvania. An additional
6,000 people are employed by independent marketing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Scott-Levin estimates that pharmaceutical companies spent $5.3
billion in the first 11 months of last year sending representatives
into doctors' offices and hospitals, and an additional $1 billion
holding marketing events for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   That translates into nearly one drug salesperson and almost
$100,000 for every 11 practicing physicians in the United States, a
class size and budget that might be the envy of any educational
venture. But the relationship between the pharmaceutical sales
force and the doctors they ply with information has been fraught
with tension for many years, and many physicians feel that the new
numbers are only making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   National spending for prescription drugs has more than doubled
in the last decade, to $78.9 billion in 1997 from $37.7 billion in
1990, according to IMS Health Inc., which collects health-related
information. A recent analysis in The New England Journal of
Medicine noted that the fraction of the personal health care dollar
spent paying for prescription drugs is growing faster than any
other part, including doctors' and hospital bills, at least partly
because prescription drug costs have increased on average 17
percent a year in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The same industry pressures thought to be responsible for these
soaring costs have helped bump up the sales force. Developing drugs
remains a huge uncovered expense for the industry. Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry group, has
calculated that only three in 10 marketed brand drugs make enough
money to cover the industry's average research and development
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the organization estimates that generic drugs are
subtracting an increasing fraction of prescription volume from the
brand-name pharmaceutical houses: 44 percent in 1997, up from 27
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Food and Drug Administration speeds its approval of
new drugs, more and more unfamiliar _ and expensive _ brands must
be introduced to prescribing doctors, while at the same time more
medically similar drugs are clamoring for their allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the sales force performs a vital
educational role for the industry, said Michele Robinson, a
spokeswoman for the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association
of pharmaceutical houses. Sales representatives introduce doctors
to new families of brand-name drugs, and update them on using the
older ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug companies still view the physician as their primary
client,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at issue in the drug representatives' sales talk are the
usual questions of accuracy and reliability that dog all highly
competitive advertising ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, studies have repeatedly shown that
doctors who say they rely a great deal on information supplied by
pharmaceutical representatives instead of medical journals tend to
have more expensive prescribing habits than other doctors, and are
somewhat less likely to choose the best drugs for a given job.
</P>
<P>
   One study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1995, found a dozen errors of fact in tape
recordings of 13 presentations made by drug representatives to
doctors, errors that invariably favored the presenter's own drug at
the expense of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   A few other issues specific to the traditions of the
representatives' job compound the problem. Namely, given three
medically equivalent brand-name drugs, is a harried doctor more
likely to write a prescription for the one featured in the small
print of an obscure medical journal, or the one endorsed in a few
pithy words by the sales representative who just left a stack of
colorful brochures in the office?
</P>
<P>
   Or might the doctor just possibly choose over either of them the
brand whose logo is embossed on the expensive fountain pen another
salesman pressed into his hand at an elegant dinner the night
before?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Despite this decade's significant changes in both
medical advertising and medical practice, face-to-face drug
promotion remains an invaluable marketing tool. ``Personal selling
is still the most effective and certainly the most expensive way of
selling prescription medications,'' said Dr. Mickey Smith,
professor of pharmaceutical administration at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford and an authority on drug marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of sales jobs has changed slightly over the decade,
Smith said. Drug representatives now make calls not only on
doctors, but also on executives and pharmacists who work in
supervisory capacities for hospitals and insurers. Sophisticated
prescription tracking systems can identify which doctors are
prescribing medications and let representatives tailor their
presentation, encouraging the reluctant prescribers and
complimenting the enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a growing percentage of advertising budgets dedicated
to introducing drugs directly to consumers, the industry has
realized that the doctor ultimately makes the prescribing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   And so in private offices and hospital corridors alike,
traditional sales representatives energetically chat up the staff.
Unlike the salesmen of years past, many now have a strong
background in science or health care (Ms. Atkinson of Dupont is a
nurse), specialize in one drug only or one group of drugs, and get
to know their subject very well.

KINGS' HEALTHY GOALIES ARE DYNAMIC DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS 
Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lost in all the groin injuries has been a simple
fact about the Kings' goaltending tandem.
</P>
<P>
   When Stephane Fiset and Jamie Storr both are healthy, the Kings
have one of the best duos in the National Hockey League, and
certainly the most underrated.
</P>
<P>
   While Fiset was recovering recently from the third of his groin
injuries, Storr started a career-high 10 consecutive games, posting
a 7-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Fiset returned to the lineup and was the main
reason the Kings escaped with a 1-1 tie with the Edmonton Oilers.
That he played as well as he did after being sidelined for nearly a
month was doubly impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steph is a battler,'' said coach Larry Robinson, whose team is
7-1-1 in its last nine games and visits the San Jose Sharks
tonight. ``There are guys you want to take with you to war, and
Steph is one of those guys because he's going to battle all the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who has a 1.84 goals-against average, shrugged at the
compliment, preferring to focus on the goaltending depth of the
Kings, who have won their last four road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can be the best two goalies in the league, it's going to
be awesome for the team,'' he said. ``Me and Jamie, we're just
trying to do our job out there. Every time we go out there, we have
a job to do, and right now, we're doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Street-fighting man: The Kings had an unlikely combatant
Saturday: 5-foot-8 right wing Donald Audette, who took on 6-foot-2
Bill Guerin late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Audette didn't embarrass himself either, except for the fact he
didn't have his jersey tied down, which earned him an automatic
game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the net,'' Audette said when asked about the fight.
``I guess I pushed him and he pushed me. The next thing I see, he's
got his gloves down so I said, `I guess we're going to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Audette said he usually gets in about one fight a year. As for
the jersey miscue that got him tossed, he said: ``I never tie it.
It always bugs me when I tie it up. It's not like I'm going to
fight every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of fighting, he said: ``It's part of the game. I'm never going
to turn it down. If it's there, it's there. But I don't look for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the same scrum, Kings defenseman Rob Blake almost came to
blows with former teammate Marty McSorley. They wound up simply
hanging on to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping he wasn't going to throw a punch,'' Blake
said.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley said: ``Blakey is a big part of their hockey team. He
is a huge part of their hockey team. If he is in the middle of a
skirmish, then I think he is the best guy to grab.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither player was penalized.

 UNDATED: very well. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some become so expert that they begin to blend into the health
care team. Salesmen who sell surgical devices have long been
present at operations to guide doctors using new equipment; in a
widely publicized case in Beth Israel Hospital in New York City
last year, a salesman has been accused of participating in surgery
that cost a young woman her life.
</P>
<P>
   For representatives who sell drugs rather than equipment, the
FDA tries to prevent the practice of medicine without a license
with guidelines that strictly limit what the representatives may
and may not discuss with doctors. Representatives are limited to
passing on only the most basic information about a drug; they
cannot discuss studies in progress or observations the drug agency
has not yet approved for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA cannot stop representatives from sweetening their
presentations with little extras. These range from reprints of
pertinent articles and colorful charts to hang in the office, to
ballpoint pens and pocket calendars bearing product or company
logos, to trays of cookies, bagel breakfasts and pizza lunches.
Many representatives routinely lug cartons of drug samples with
them to keep office cabinets stocked with their product.
</P>
<P>
   And often the extras take on another dimension entirely, always
in the name of education. Some representatives buy expensive
textbooks or pay for trips to conferences for a doctor or the
doctor's trainees. Others sponsor golfing outings, river cruises or
lavish dinners at expensive restaurants where an after-dinner
speaker discusses the state-of-the art treatment of a given
condition and, inevitably, the role in it of the sponsor's drug.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long debated where, in the spectrum of
pharmaceutical-sponsored information, pens, books, white wine and
chocolate mousse, to draw the ethical line.
</P>
<P>
   For some doctors, keeping an open door for the sales
representatives is an educational imperative made even more
essential by the glut of new products. Bellomo of Jersey City, for
instance, may see a half-dozen or more representatives a week,
usually by appointment, spending as long as half an hour with each.
The information they provide him is valuable ``at least 90 percent
of the time,'' he said. One passed on a new safety warning about a
drug a few months ago, Bellomo said, and the official warning still
has not arrived. ``That person is welcome in my office anytime,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For other doctors, there is persuasive evidence for giving the
representatives a wide berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically do not go to them for information,'' said Allan
Brett, director of the division of general internal medicine at the
University of South Carolina School of Medicine in Columbia. ``When
a new drug is coming out, I tell the representative, `I'm really
not interested in what you have to say. I'm glad you told me it's
coming out, but I'm going to get my information from somewhere
else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo sees drug samples as a handy way to start a patient on
treatment at night after the drugstores are closed, and also a way
to ease the cost of treatment. But for Brett they are an insidious
way to hook doctors and patients onto new, expensive drugs, when
older, cheaper, safer alternatives might easily suffice.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gifts divides doctors as well. Some agree with the
official policy of the American Medical Association that pens and
other items of negligible value are permissible, as are gifts like
textbooks that have an educational value that might indirectly
benefit the doctor's patients (whose prescription dollars are,
after all, directly paying for the gifts).
</P>
<P>
   But for other doctors, even trinkets are troubling. ``The fact
that you can walk down the hall here and every pad, every pen,
every little magnet on the door for messages has a drug company's
name on it,'' Brett said, ``that bothers me. I think there's a
cumulative ethos that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can buy my own pens and sticky pads,'' said Dr. Allen
Shaughnessy, director of research in the Family Practice Residency
in Harrisburg Hospital in Harrisburg, Pa. Like other medical
educators, Shaughnessy is increasingly concerned with what kind of
limits, if any, he and his colleagues should place on the contact
between the residents training in his program and drug sales
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital policies vary. Some ban drug representatives from busy
patient-care areas or confine them to a room at the end of the
hall; others confine sales pitches to specific activities on
specific days, while others issue them identification tags and
allow them to roam freely.
</P>
<P>
   And in teaching hospital wards, the representatives _ friendly,
well dressed, bearing gifts and food _ are invariably popular
visitors. Shaughnessy said he once found residents presenting cases
to a pharmaceutical representative for treatment advice, apparently
finding him more pleasant and accessible than their supervising
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``My zealous approach was, throw the bums out,'' Shaughnessy
said. ``But then I thought, no, we're really throwing out a useful
information source for a lot of people.'' He now invites sales
representatives to a biweekly seminar on ``information
management,'' where his residents critique their spiels for logic
and usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Shaughnessy is seeing a difference in his trainees.
``I've been doing this for a long time,'' he said. ``It seems like
10 years ago there used to be more moral outrage among the
residents,'' he said. ``Business is a big part of medicine now.
It's easier for the drug reps to sneak in under the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atkinson of Dupont said that only a single doctor among the
385 in her territory has told her that he has a policy of not
speaking to pharmaceutical representatives. But Ms. Atkinson still
leaves information in the lobby for him, she said, and Dupont's
prescription tracking service lets her monitor his prescribing
habits. And ``he's writing,'' Ms. Atkinson said. ``He's writing.''

 &HT;    Yikes, it'll be the Vikes
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Memo to the Falcons: Bring your ``A'' game next
week. The Vikings are every bit what their won-lost record
suggests, and then some. Just ask the Arizona Cardinals. Catch them
on their way to vacation _ battered, bruised and thoroughly
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Never once was Minnesota threatened Sunday by the upstart
Cardinals at the Metrodome. By the time Arizona could say,
``Brrr!'' _ game-time temperature outside was minus-1 degree _
Viking quarterback Randall Cunningham had directed two touchdown
drives that started the Vikings' 41-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, Minnesota hosts Atlanta, winners Saturday over San
Francisco, in the NFC Championship Game next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was 14-2, won their first (playoff) game convincingly,
we know they're going to be a formidable foe,'' Vikings coach
Dennis Green said. ``They have a great running game and a lot of
veterans who are winners. It'll be a great matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   This one was not. Minnesota compiled 416 yards of total offense.
Cunningham threw for 228 yards on 17-for-27 passing with three
touchdowns. Pro Bowl rookie Randy Moss managed four catches for 73
yards and a TD against fellow Pro Bowl defensive back Aeneas
Williams. Leader Chris Carter had five receptions for 82. Running
back Robert Smith rushed for 124 yards on 19 carries. All that, and
Cunningham still hardly was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't (clicking) on (offense),'' he had the audacity to
say. ''Our purpose is to dominate and to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Vikings' disposition, and possess a confidence that
matches their ability.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get the ball, every possession we can score,'' Moss
said.
</P>
<P>
   They were close to doing that Sunday. To wit: Mitch Berger only
attempted one punt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough task for anyone,'' Smith said, ''because we have
so many guys who can make the big play.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Cardinals settled down Sunday, the Falcons had
already begun game-planning for the Vikings. Minnesota jumped to a
17-0 lead, and did so in diverse, scary ways. It took 7:20 to drive
80 yards on 13 plays to open the game. Then, after a Cunningham
interception to Williams in the end zone, the Vikings marched 62
yards on four plays. Leroy Hoard ended the sustained drive with a
1-yard run and Cunningham connected with tight end Andrew Glover
for a 15-yard pass play to end the other.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the defense gave up little. Nothing, in fact. Arizona
had the ball just once in the first quarter - for 56 seconds - and
had -1 net yards to the Vikings' 141. That they trailed just 7-0
after one was a significant accomplishment. But it was only a
matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what a juggernaut is,'' Cardinals coach Vince
Tobin said, ''but I know one thing: They've got a good football
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and young quarterback Jake Plummer got the jitters
early, but played differently after the inauspicious start. The
Cardinals moved the ball well, and Plummer, after two early
interceptions, ended up going 23-for-41 for 242 yards.
</P>
<P>
   They scored on scored on three fourth-down 1-yard runs by Mario
Bates. But each touchdown was matched by a Minnesota assualt, which
was loudly celebrated by purple-wearing fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any team that comes in here is going to have a tough time,''
Smith said. ''It's so noisy that it's tough to concentrate. We know
Atlanta plays in a dome, too. But I'm glad we'll be at home.''

 &HT;    Falcons refuse to fear Minnesota
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons free safety Eugene Robinson sat down in front
of his TV Sunday afternoon and watched Minnesota wail on Arizona.
It didn't take long to figure out that the Atlanta's first-ever
appearance in an NFC Championship Game next Sunday will be in the
Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   So about the time the Vikings (16-1) took a 24-7 lead on the way
to a 41-21 win, Robinson switched channels.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Gia, watched the movie, ''Armaggedon,''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons (15-2), are going to punch a ticket to Super Bowl
XXXIII, they'll have to win a war against the highest-scoring
offense in NFL history in a facility that is as loud as any in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson, who was 3-1 the last two seasons against the
Vikings while he played for the Packers, didn't want to hear any
hype _ just like he didn't want to see too much of the Vikings, at
least not yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to watch a game like that, where they look like
world beaters,'' he said. ''I remember before by first game against
them in Green Bay, (Packers defensive coordinator) Fritz Shurmur
showed video of them looking just awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Turn it off. Show me something when they got punched
in the mouth, when they're vulnerable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are 13-6 all-time against Atlanta, including four
straight wins over the Falcons, the last a 23-17 victory here in
1996. In Atlanta's last trip to Minnesota, the Vikings won 43-17 in
'89.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves didn't need much film study Sunday to get to
the point. ''They're explosive, a complete football team,'' he
said. ''The question is going to be which offense can play the
best?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Reeves and his staff will take Robinson's suggestion, and
show only video of the Vikings' low points.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is there aren't many.
</P>
<P>
   They lost only one game, 27-24 at Tampa Bay on Nov. 1 when the
Buccaneers succeeded in running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That helped keep the potent offense of quarterback Randall
Cunningham, wide receivers Cris Carter and Randy Moss, and running
back Robert Smith off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are good at that. They led the NFL in average time
of possession (33:10 per game).
</P>
<P>
   That's what Robinson wants to hear _ positive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't need to see them pounding the Cardinals,'' he said.
''Right now, their fans think they're the greatest thing since
sliced bread. I refuse to think that way. I refuse to think a team
can't be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the attitude of a team that has won 10 straight
games.

 &HT;    Falcons had better win the coin flip
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ To the next team entering the Minnesota Vikings
purple asylum _ and we all know who that is _ this single snipet of
advice: Win the coin toss, at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   After that, fellas, you're pretty much on your own in devising
ways to keep the ball out of the home team's hands and its wildfire
offense off the scoreboard. These guys make trips to the end zone
look so routine, it's as if they're just there to pick up a jug of
milk and loaf of bread.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the NFC Championship, the Falcons would have
been better off not peaking at Minnesota's 41-21 dismantling of
Arizona Sunday. What was to be gained, other than an unhealthy
respect? What exactly was there to be learned? A team that set a
record for points in a season, a team that won 15 games in the
regular season by an average margin of 17 points, is going to show
a little offense.
</P>
<P>
   No one was surprised by the ruthless character of the Vikings
offense. Least of all Minnesota. ``We have a lot of money invested
in the offense. We expect the offense to be the bellcow of this
team,'' receiver Cris Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious, what the Vikings displayed in this division
playoff game was the nature to begin the landslide early and
smother an opponent in an avalanche of points. They are not of a
mood to mess around.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Cardinals made the crucial error of not winning the
opening toss. So the Vikes took the ball on the kickoff and didn't
give it back until nearly eight minutes later with Leroy Hoard
burrowing in for the first of many touchdowns. ``And they said we
can't drive the ball; that all we can do is make big plays,'' said
Carter, referring to the last few critics who remained standing.
</P>
<P>
   With this first possession, the Vikes began their campaign of
confusion. Monica Kauffman doesn't have as many looks as the
Minnesota offense. They even got cute on third-and-1, using running
back David Palmer as a shotgun quarterback while the real thing,
Randall Cunningham, split out wide left. Of course, it worked.
``And I don't think we got to everything,'' said Cunningham,
hinting there is much in reserve for the Falcons. ``We didn't even
get Jake (receiver Reed) the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was settled quite early. While the Vikings hoarded the
ball, Arizona sputtered. For the first 19 minutes of play, the
Cardinals total offense mirrored the outside temperature _ minus-1.
These birds weren't nearly dirty enough for the job at hand.
</P>
<P>
   So, this is what awaits the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dome crowd more throaty than its own. This visitor
from Atlanta was having some bad Kirby Puckett flashbacks. The
scene can melt the unprepared. It was late in the second quarter
before young Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer could get his game
on Prozac and under control.
</P>
<P>
   There's an offense that rolls up 416 yards and 41 points and is
dissatisfied. ``I don't believe we were really on,'' Cunningham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there's a defense that can be had, but a touchdown against
the Vikings is no more than holding serve.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday is going to be way too much fun. Just win the coin
toss, get the ball first, and hold on.

OTTAWA WOMAN CLAIMS VATICAN DIPLOMAT, A PRIEST, THREATENED HER
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(ms) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Ottawa police have charged a senior official at
the Vatican's embassy, a Roman Catholic monsignor, with harassing a
former employee and threatening to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents filed Nov. 10, Monsignor Vito
Rallo, an Italian who is the second-highest-ranking representative
of the pope in Canada, physically intimidated a female employee
repeatedly from July 1997 to March of  &QL; 
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rallo, 45, has refused requests for comment on the criminal
charges made by Josephine Greco, 52, who was the embassy's cultural
attache until she was dismissed Sept. 30. The Vatican also declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, diplomats like Rallo are protected from criminal
prosecution by diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gibson, a local lawyer representing Rallo, said the
charges were without merit. He said he was skeptical about Mrs.
Greco's motives for filing a complaint and called her ``a
disgruntled employee'' with a vendetta against the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were problems related to her work,'' Gibson said in a
telephone interview. ``But no one has been served with any papers
so I'm not sure exactly what it is that she is claiming.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greco said she filed her complaint with the police in
August, a month before she was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a disgruntled employee,'' she said. ``He threatened
to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that when the pattern of harassment became more
violent, she contacted the police. ``I was advised that I should
file a complaint because if I were not to do anything at all,
something bad could happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ottawa police would not discuss the case, but in the
complaint filed with the Ontario provincial court, Rallo is accused
of engaging ``in threatening conduct'' that caused Mrs. Greco ``to
fear for her safety.''

TIME EXPOSED QUARRY'S LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We love fighters like Jerry Quarry.
</P>
<P>
   We call them bangers, fierce warriors who are willing to take
hard punches to the head in order to throw harder ones as
blood-thirsty fans _ who live for the knockout _ roar their
approval from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   This was Quarry, the former heavyweight contender who died of
heart failure last week at only 53.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the long-time Southern California resident got the
better of the mayhem. He lost only nine of 66 fights, including
four total to Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, and lost a
controversial decision to Jimmy Ellis in the finals of a tournament
in 1968 to replace Ali, who was stripped of his championship title.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Quarry would have been a title holder had he fought
today.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the ring, he also was first-rate by most accounts. As
smart as any fighter, he was witty and engaging. I remember seeing
him do an impersonation of Ali as a guest on the Tonight Show that
had Johnny Carson and the studio audience in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   And he could be thoughtful. He served as a television color
commentator for several major fights and was well-respected. He
also wrote poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bright,'' long-time friend Bob Case said. ``If he
didn't fight, I think he could've done whatever he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, he did fight. And, whether or not we stop and
consider it, there is life (begin ital)after(end ital) fighting _
such as it is.
</P>
<P>
   When Quarry stepped out of the spotlight, when he was no longer
needed by promoters, managers, trainers and fans and the only ones
who cared were loving family members and friends, he lost his
biggest fight.
</P>
<P>
   Quarry took a lot of punches in order to throw his own.
Thousands? Tens of thousands, when one includes sparring?
Certainly, his brain was damaged to the point that in the end he
could barely function and his death was linked to the deterioration
of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, he had dementia pugilistica, a disease that hovers
ominously over boxing but hardly gets the attention it deserves. A
doctor reportedly said the punches aged him 30 years while family
and friends said he had the mentality of a child at the end.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, this once-charismatic, super-human man was helpless. As
one of his sisters, Diana, put it shortly before his death: ``You
look into his eyes and nobody's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he relied on Diana and other family members to care for
him the last several years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, who once reveled in Quarry's success because she didn't
know any better, now calls for the banning of the sport. No one,
she said, deserves such a fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask anyone, `Do you want a son of, say, 40 to have the mind of
an 80-year-old?'' said Diana, who has two other boxer-brothers,
Mike and Bobby, who also suffered brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Ask that person, `Are you willing for a few dollars or
what people call `fame' willing to sacrifice a human mind?' Jerry
has good muscle tone, an athletic body but he speaks like a child.
It breaks your heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to disassociate myself from this every day. If you look
into his eyes with any empathy, it would destroy you. I had to
avoid eye contact. Otherwise, I'd break down. I know I would.''
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Quarry served as an example of the best about
boxing: The thrill of battle, the courage, the nobility of the
combatants. In death, he serves as a symbol of the worst of the
sport: The toll it takes on the minds _ and in turn the lives _ of
the fighters and their families.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter sense, perhaps Quarry's story will serve some
good, perhaps the powers that be will take further steps to protect
fighters _ if that's possible _ and the suffering will be
minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, what Quarry had to endure makes no sense whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Oxnard, rapidly becoming a fighter factory, has
three amateurs ranked in the top 10 in their respective weight
classes.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Joel Salas, No. 7 welterweight; Jesus Casrez, No. 10
light welterweight; and Rolando Reyes, No. 10 lightweight....
</P>
<P>
   Michael Grant, who many believe is the next great heavyweight,
resumes his career against Abmad Abdin on Jan. 30 on HBO After
Dark.
</P>
<P>
   Another heavyweight bout on that card, Andrew Golota against
Jimmy Thunder, is more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Golota is trying to recapture the status he lost as a result of
his low-blow disqualifications against Riddick Bowe....
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Michael Moorer will return to the ring this spring,
according to Main Events. Arturo Gatti also expects to fight again
around that time....
</P>
<P>
   Sport magazine's February issue, which is on the newsstands,
includes an in-depth report on boxing....
</P>
<P>
   Donavan ``Razor'' Ruddock, trying to climb back into the title
picture, faces journeyman Tony La Rosa on Jan. 21 in Marksville,
La. USSB is televising the bout....
</P>
<P>
   Keith Holmes gets a chance to regain the WBC middleweight title
from Hassine Cherifi, who won a decision in May in France to take
the belt.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes fought as if left his mind back home in Washington D.C.
He'll win easily this time if his brain shows up.
</P>
<P>
   That bout, as well as WBA middleweight champ William Joppy's
defense against Darren Obah, will be on Showtime. &QL;

 &HT;    Vikings have no liking for Falcons `Dirty Bird'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Seems the Falcons' ``Dirty Bird'' routine doesn't
play so well up here. At least not from the words of a couple key
Vikings after their 41-21 dismantling of the Cardinals Sunday at
the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Randy Moss, the rising star rookie receiver: ``I don't
think Atlanta respects us....They see we lost one game, they lost
two. If I was in their position, I wouldn't respect us,
either...They're cocky, call themselves the 'Dirty Birds' from down
South...I guarantee they watched us play, so ...they're coming here
and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Randall Cunningham went through great pains to not
criticize the Falcons' celebratory dance and nickname, then
proceeded to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought of the ``Dirty Bird,'' Cunningham
paused for several seconds before beginning a rambling statement
about a pregame message from the team's chaplin. Finally, he said,
``Let me put it this way: I wouldn't want to be called anything
dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   After a quick answer to another question, Cunningham
backtracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``About that 'Dirty Bird' thing, it's all fun and games,'' he
said. ``Everybody gets a nickname. We're 'Purple Pride.' There's
'Vinnie and the Jets.' It's good for the fans. We just play the
game and don't get caught up in that hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Smith A Quiet Killer
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to overlook running back Robert Smith when the offense
has three Pro Bowl players in high profile positions. But if you
don't pay attention to him, he'll go for a team-playoff-record124
yards on 19 carries like he did Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way the game developed,'' Smith said. ``Team
pay so much attention to our passing game that they have a decision
to make on who to stop: the run or the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, neither is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We throw in Leroy (Hoard), and he complements Robert great,''
coach Dennis Green said of his power reserve back. ``He's healthy,
fierce and a competitor. He's as good a power runner as they is in
the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   With a touchdown run of 1 yard and a 16-yard TD reception, Hoard
became the first Viking in playoff history to score in both
fashions. . .
</P>
<P>
   Etc. . .
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota used more offensive formations than in any game this
season, including using running back David Palmer at quarterback,
with Cunningham split wide left as a receiver. Moss' 2-yard scoring
reception near the end of the third quarter gave the outstanding
rookie a TD catch in each of the last eight games...At halftime,
Arizona had just 85 yards of total offense...Cardinals owner Bill
Bidwell was n the press box as the game began. When a Minnesota PR
worker passed out Vikings towels before the game, he unwittingly
placed one in front of Bidwell, who did not touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, when asked about the difference in the Vikings'
playoff attitude from last year: ``(You) get into the playoffs at
9-7 and you get in at 15-1. I mean, you figure it out.''

SHANAHAN RELISHES TAKING ON PARCELLS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When Mike Shanahan arrived at his office Sunday
morning, he began studying the New York Jets. Several hours later,
the Denver Broncos' coach turned on his television to make sure he
wasn't wasting his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going back and forth, to see if I should switch
gears,'' said Shanahan, who later kept interrupting his news
conference to check on the final minutes of the Jets' 34-24 victory
over Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The coach stopped in midsentence in one answer. ``Excuse me, I'm
watching the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became certain that Denver would be facing the Jets here
next Sunday for the American Football Conference title and a trip
to the Super Bowl, Shanahan acknowledged several things about the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   First, he feels an extra tingle in matching wits with celebrated
coaches like the Jets' Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think you always get a little juiced up when you're
going against a coach that's had a lot of success and obviously a
couple of Super Bowl rings,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was not surprised that the Jets have improved so
rapidly under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this crazy business is not to get a `name' player but
a guy who's a player,'' Shanahan said. ``They've done that. I like
to think that's what we've done, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the Broncos' 38-3 trampling of the Miami
Dolphins, all but a few Denver players stayed away from the news
media glare.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway expected to do plenty of studying this
week. Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, has played the
Jets only once in the last four seasons, a game here in 1996 won by
the Broncos, 31-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really faced them in a couple of years, so we don't
know what they're all about,'' Elway told NBC from his home. ``So
it'll be like starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken tight end Shannon Sharpe displayed his usual
cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets might be the team to beat,'' he said, ``but they've
got to lay over in Denver. I don't care who we play. If they come
here, they've got to play a flawless game to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe added: ``They're a very talented offense, no question
about it. ``They have two 1,000-yard receivers; so do we. They have
a Pro Bowl quarterback; so do we. They have a 1,000-yard runner;
we've got a 2,000-yard runner. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Marvin Washington, who played eight seasons for
the Jets, the last in 1996, seemed to have no emotional involvement
in playing his former team. ``I think I'm far enough removed from
that situation,'' he said. ``It's a whole different regime, a whole
different group of players. So it doesn't really matter to me who
we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Dolphins limped out of town, several players gave the
Jets a good chance to dethrone the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you the Jets are going to find some kind of way to
shut them down, like we did on that Monday night,'' linebacker
Robert Jones said, harking back to Miami's 31-21 victory in late
December. ``The Jets have a defense to get them, yes they do. In
big games, the Jets play. They come to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Terrell Buckley noted that the Jets under Parcells
are masters of innovation, while his teammate O.J. McDuffie guessed
that the Jets would not be fazed by having to play at Mile High
Stadium, where Denver has won 18 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care where they go,'' the wide receiver said.
``They're ornery like that. They'll play anywhere and they'll play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Shanahan went back to studying film Sunday, he tried to
defuse several inflammatory comments made by his players before the
Miami game. Besides Sharpe's statement that Denver was 10 to 14
points better than Miami, he said Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson
should clear out his office to give Denver room to study for the
Super Bowl, which will be in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot of people take Shannon seriously,'' Shanahan said.
``He's really a good person. He does that sometimes to fire himself
up. But that was kind of rough. I kind of cringed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach balked at Sharpe's assertion that Dolphins quarterback
Dan Marino is a loser. ``Dan Marino is a winner and everybody knows
that,'' the coach said. ``Yeah, I was disappointed when I saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shanahan defended linebacker Bill Romanowski's insinuation
that Johnson had lied in describing injuries to two of his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said what he thought was the truth,'' Shanahan said. ``If
a guy feels like it's the truth, I don't think it's a slap at Jimmy
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Shanahan turned and left for a night of film study. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE LOYAL MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I love a mystery: What inspires the phenomenal
loyalty to Bill Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   There he stands in the dock, impeached as a perjurer, certain of
more censure, roundly denounced by even political allies for
weaknesses that dishonored his office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not one of the aides who call themselves betrayed has turned
on him. Not one of his appointees has resigned in disgust. Not one
close associate or lawyer still living has crumbled, though under
intense pressure of the threat of jail, to testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the revelations of deceit, his wife steadfastly
grasps his hand. His political party marches lockstep down the line
to protect him. And the public, in opinion polls and at the polling
booth, stands by him more staunchly with each step toward historic
shame.
</P>
<P>
   That's loyalty across the board, the likes of which this nation
has never seen before. What's behind it?
</P>
<P>
   Because his personal approval rating is far below his job
approval rating, most of us have assumed that his support is
strictly the product of rampant prosperity. It seems as if the
majority is saying, we're all right, Jack, and don't rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But I've begun to wonder. Good times cannot explain it all.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, undergirds the grim loyalty of Susan McDougal
or makes Web Hubbell ``just have to roll over again''? Without a
powerful psychological tie, they would have cracked years ago. Or
what motivates Harold Ickes, coolly stiffed by Clinton for the
promotion to chief of staff, but still determinedly disremembering
dirty dealings that might implicate the president?
</P>
<P>
   What beyond stubbornness drives Janet Reno, losing professional
respect and her own health, to cling to office longer than any
attorney general this century? What beyond a sense of duty induces
William Cohen, who jumped party ship to impeach Nixon, to remain at
the helm of the Pentagon and bear the scorn of critics who see his
Iraqi missile-lobbing as Clinton impeachment-lobbying?
</P>
<P>
   That's only the beginning of the loyalty mystery. Hillary
Clinton told an interviewer a year ago that if her husband were
proved to be lying, that would be ``a serious offense.'' After
evidence forced him to admit it, she found the offense less
serious. Blind love? Shared political goals? Joint vast-conspiracy
hatred? Or old-fashioned loyalty?
</P>
<P>
   Now to the enigma within. Two out of three Americans _ a far
higher percentage than those who voted for him _ are willing to
abide with him even if the charges are true. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Some don't want to deal with public unpleasantness. Others don't
want snoops prying into their own private lives. Others retain a
reverence for the presidency, no matter what the leader or
sibling-figure does. Add those to the hard-core liberals and
minorities who see their man as a fire wall against spreading lava
from the right.
</P>
<P>
   But there must be something else _ in some undiscovered region
from which no media biggie reports _ to explain the incredible
attachment of this great nation to this ungreat man.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the Kulturkampf with its weapons of messy personal
destruction? In this social conflict, moralizing geezers say to
boomers, ``You see where all your '60s pot and protest and
permissiveness have brought us?'' and graying boomers reply, ``Get
a life and swing a little, Gramps.'' Meanwhile, the Self-Absorbed
Generation, living in surplus, pages itself on cell phones and is
oblivious to such squabbling among its buying-powerless elders.
</P>
<P>
   Only partly. Could it also be partly that those victorious a
generation ago in overturning an election are infuriated by any
comparison of cover-ups? To prevent a ``payback time'' that would
de-demonize Nixon, the aging Good Guys of yesteryear are impelled
to loyally minimize Clinton's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the Clinton loyalty mystery is greater than the
sum of these partlys. Peeling this onion down to its tears, you
discover a widespread affection for this likable lame-duck liar as
fervent as a minority's distaste for him. His many weaknesses
become his strength.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty, we discover, need not be a two-way street. Clinton is a
loyalty blotter; he sops it up. He is impervious to calumny because
he is confident of that loyalty, which multiplies it. Even as
reckoning looms, nothing sticks to him except the majority.

REDSKINS SAID TO BE SOLD FOR $800 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins were sold Sunday to a group headed by
Howard Milstein, co-owner of the New York Islanders hockey team,
for $800 million, a record price for a domestic sports franchise,
according to two people involved in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The sum to be paid to the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke,
the former owner of the team, by Milstein and his partner, Daniel
Snyder, exceeds the $530 million paid by Al Lerner last August for
the expansion Cleveland Browns football team, the previous record
sales price.
</P>
<P>
   The price reflects the cash flow generated by Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium, which just completed its second season of operation. Cooke
stadium has 15,044 club seats, which cost $995 to $2,500 each
annually, and 280 luxury suites that rent for between $45,000 and
$160,000 each per season. The Browns' stadium will have fewer
luxury suites and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' sale will be formally announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein, who bid unsuccessfully for the Browns, will have to
sell all or part of the 45 percent stake in the Islanders that he
owns with his brother, Edward, to comply with the National Football
League's cross-ownership rules.
</P>
<P>
   When he sought to buy the Browns, Milstein said that if he got
the team, he would sell his family's ownership in the Islanders to
the team's co-owner, Steven Gluckstern. He is expected to follow
that course now.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein's family is worth billions of dollars, from New
York-based real estate and banking empires. Snyder owns a
Washington communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reflecting the cash flow at Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium, the $800 million purchase price was influenced by the
Browns' sale price, the $700-million-a-year guaranteed to each NFL
team owner from the new television contracts, and the size and
influence of the Washington market, which is nearly one-third
bigger than Cleveland's.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money produced by a stadium is the economic factor
that divides the richest teams from the rest and makes franchises
leap in value. It was why a successful team like the Minnesota
Vikings, which does not generate huge wealth from the municipally
owned Metrodome, sold for a modest $250 million last year to Red
McCombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Milstein-Snyder group defeated three others, including one
formed by John Kent Cooke, the son of the late owner, that was
described as very strong by the people involved in the sale
process. Other bidders included John McMullen, the owner of the
Devils, and Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems and Sam
Grossman, an Arizona shopping center magnate.
</P>
<P>
   By the terms established by the Cooke estate, Milstein and
Snyder are acquiring the team's stock, a transaction that will
funnel the proceeds tax free to a charitable foundation set up by
the estate.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' sale, by comparison, was an asset purchase. The
Redskin process, compared with that of the Browns, was quiet. The
estate imposed severe confidentiality restrictions, rules that were
stern enough so that bidders like McMullen and Dolan denied they
were bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With the Browns, the league controlled the process, inviting the
bidders to meetings covered by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   League approval of Milstein and Snyder should take 60 to 90
days, but the time span could be shorter because NFL owners are
already familiar with Milstein. It is not known whether that time
frame will preserve the job of Redskins Coach Norv Turner, whose
team went 6-10 last season. Had John Kent Cooke acquired the team,
Turner's future was believed to be more secure.

   MARINELAND, Fla. _ The parking lot is strewn with dead palm
fronds. Rot has invaded the bleachers. Rust dribbles down the
tanks. And the famous portholes are clouded and leaking.
</P>
<P>
   But something is roiling the water.
</P>
<P>
   As Bill Upson approaches with a pail of fish, the surface of a
huge circular pool erupts. A dozen dolphins flip, twist, squeak and
wave their tails at the empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Betty,'' Upson said, pointing at a 300-pound flying
dolphin. ``She throws that big, high triple twist. Here come three
jumping together _ Dazzle, Ariel, Nemo _ they learned that all by
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineland closed four months ago, after 60 years in the
business, but the dolphins still perform three times a day, their
mouths curved in everlasting smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found the dolphins like to keep their routine,'' said
Upson, Marineland's operations chief, adding that if they didn't
play, they could aggressively turn on each other, as Marineland's
human overseers have done.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's most popular tourist attraction in the 1950s and '60s,
Marineland says it was the world's first oceanarium and the first
to teach wild dolphins to perform. Now the park is mired in bond
defaults, years of neglect and blame-trading, and a Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing. A legion of lawyers is settling claims.
</P>
<P>
   If Marineland is to survive, tourism experts say, it must find a
niche in the shadow of Disney and Busch theme parks. Though small,
family-owned attractions fold every year, others thrive, like
Cypress Gardens in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Marineland's new manager, the nonprofit Marineland Foundation,
hopes to renegotiate the bond debt, reopen the aquarium by April
and begin fund raising to help subsidize the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The park's dreams are riding on 19 irrepressible dolphins, which
outnumber the 17 voters in the municipality of Marineland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they go, it's down the tubes,'' said Dennis Blackburn, the
lawyer for the Marineland Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jacoby, an Atlanta developer who has bought Marineland
property across the road from the aquarium, said, ``There is
something very spiritual about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby became interested in Marineland because of his belief
that swimming with dolphins _ as he has done with his daughter, who
suffers a seizure disorder _ can be therapeutic. He plans to build
a therapy center.
</P>
<P>
   But it's going to be a tough battle. Two developers have come
and gone in the last three years. And holders of $9 million in
bonds that are in default recently learned that the Marineland
aquarium's most valuable assets were the dolphins, which could be
sold for $100,000 each. Jacoby said that millions of dollars would
also be needed to rebuild the Marineland aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials stopped recommending Marineland years ago,
said Bill Puckett, president of the Florida Attractions
Association, an industry trade group, and a former marketing
director of Marineland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquariums today _ in Tennessee, Baltimore, Tampa, the Sea
Worlds _ are these big, huge wonders with huge glass windows,''
Puckett said. ``I wouldn't want to try to revitalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   But smaller attractions have found strategies to survive:
Cypress Gardens has year-round flower shows and Silver Springs in
Ocala sells annual passes to area residents for $42, not much more
than its $30 daily fee. The tiny Alligator Farm in St. Augustine
says it has become an accredited zoological park, with every kind
of alligator and crocodile in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Marineland was built on the Atlantic in 1938, it opened a
vista under the ocean's surface, the first such view for some.
Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, the owner of the park and producer of
``Gone With the Wind,'' built the tanks to film underwater, and
several movies were made here, including the 1954 science fiction
movie ``Creature from the Black Lagoon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The park pioneered marine research, studying dolphins' behavior
and their use of sonar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, a Ringling Bros. circus trainer was hired to teach
Flippy, a wild dolphin, to ring a bell and jump through hoops. What
the park called ``the first educated dolphin'' drew so much
attention that Marineland became a must-see tourist stop and a
municipality.
</P>
<P>
   But attendance at the park began to shrink because Disney World
opened near Orlando in 1971, and Interstates 95 and 4 bypassed
Marineland.
</P>
<P>
   However, developers were attracted to the 125 acres adjacent to
the aquarium. The land includes a beautiful stretch of ocean and a
hammock of wild oak along the Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney sold Marineland in 1982 to local investors, who said
they hoped to create a village like Seaside, a planned community.
They sold it in 1996 to investors led by Barry Loughrane, a
marketing executive and co-founder of Omnicom Group in New York
City, who said he wanted to refurbish a ``golden oldie,'' and also
build condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The investors, Marineland Ocean Resorts, spun off the park
itself, with the dolphins and oceanside tanks as a nonprofit
foundation, and persuaded the municipality to sell $9.6 million in
municipal bonds based on attendance projections. They defaulted on
the bonds a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The group also used $900,000 in maintenance funds to pay lawyers
and accountants, Loughrane said. He said he tried to sell it to
Jacoby, the developer, who pulled out at the last minute, leading
the group to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After a contentious bankruptcy filing, Marineland's 125 acres,
without the tanks and dolphins, were sold to the Trust for Public
Land, a nonprofit conservation group, for $7.75 million, said Greg
Chelius, a spokesman for the trust. In turn, the trust sold 36
acres to Jacoby for his planned dolphin-therapy center, and the
remaining 89 acres to Flagler County as a park that must remain
undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   As attendance slipped last year, the foundation cut the aquarium
staff in half, to 15, and then closed the park last October. Both
the trust and Jacoby have donated money to pay salaries of staff
members and the $100,000 annual cost of feeding the dolphins,
including Nelly, at 43 the world's oldest dolphin born in
captivity, according to Marineland.
</P>
<P>
   If the bond debt can be restructured, the foundation wants to
solicit donations and conduct research with the University of
Florida. Jacoby, on whom the foundation's hopes are riding,
envisions a nationwide children's fund-raising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've torn down a lot of green fields,'' Jacoby said. ``I'm
looking for a development where we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Upson, the Marineland operations chief, said, ``Because we
have the animals, we are here and still fighting.''

 CHRON - SGI  
 SGI Bets It All on New Line  &HT;     By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bet-the-company time for Silicon Graphics, the struggling
computer-maker that today unveils its first desktop workstations
based on Intel chips and Microsoft Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   SGI, which until now has relied on its own chips and Unix
operating software, hopes that the new machines _ boasting the
company's vaunted graphics technology _ will help stop a financial
slide that has seen it lose money in eight of the past 10 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Mountain View company have doubled in value
recently, largely in anticipation of the products being introduced
today. The stock, which bottomed at $7.88 on October 8, added $1.06
yesterday to close at $16.31, a new 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new NT workstations are potentially a company-saver,''
said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. ``SGI was able
to take their expertise in high-performance workstations and
convert that into a strong video subsystem for the Intel platform.
On paper at least, the performance looks pretty phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The new SGI 320 ($3,395 without monitor) and 540 ($5,995) are
intended to compete on price and performance with other powerful PC
workstations, broadening the market for the company beyond the
high-end, specialized customers it traditionally has served. For
years, SGI workstations have been favored by engineers, scientists
and the entertainment industry but have been too expensive for
small- and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its established markets, SGI plans to go after
new areas such as publishing and education _ historically dominated
by Apple Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   If they catch on, the new workstations could do for SGI what the
iMac has done to reinvigorate Apple, whose earnings and stock price
have climbed sinced the introduction of the transluscent-blue
personal computer last year.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, SGI may find it increasingly difficult to survive
as an independent company.
</P>
<P>
   Once a favorite of Wall Street and President Clinton, who in
1993 called it a paragon of successful technology, SGI made a name
for itself with sleek workstations that boasted graphics far ahead
of what anyone else could offer. SGI computers were used to pioneer
Hollywood special effects and still are responsible for most of the
dinosaurs, space ships and explosions in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the company has been under assault.
Powerful personal computers running Windows NT have eaten into its
business at the low end, while Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard
have hurt it in the market for high-end Unix servers.
</P>
<P>
   SGI decided that it no longer could survive exclusively as a
Unix vendor. To reach the mainstream market increasingly being
dominated by PCs, it said in autumn 1997 that it would shift its
line over time to the Wintel platform. It will continue selling
Unix-based systems while it phases in Wintel machines.
</P>
<P>
   The SGI 320 and 540 use the latest Pentium II chips and can run
any of the thousands of software programs developed for Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   They also incorporate SGI graphics capabilities, giving them
what could be a significant competitive advantage. SGI claims that
its system can route information six times faster than other
Intel-based systems _ resulting in blazing-fast 3-D graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts think that SGI's high-performance graphics will appeal
to people who need it to create complex animation and video. But
for most graphics tasks, a Dell or Compaq PC could be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If SGI's systems only really excel in high-performance areas,
that's where they may end up, and that would be a problem for SGI''
because it would not be able to significantly expand its market,
said analyst Peter ffoulkes (cq) &LR; of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the potential market for SGI's new systems is large
enough to pull the company out of its abyss is uncertain. And it
faces stiff competition from other computer-makers who won't cede
ground graciously, such as Apple, which is well-entrenched in the
publishing business.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's in the Windows NT arena, SGI also must contend
with the likes of Dell, Compaq and IBM. Dell, wasting no time, will
announce a workstation today that has less graphical firepower than
the entry-level SGI 320 but does sport the same advanced
flat-screen display used by SGI. (In fact, it's made by SGI.) The
Dell system will go for $4,222, far less than the $5,890 that SGI
will charge for its system with the display.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Copeland of International Data Corp. thinks the new SGI
systems will get a warm welcome from existing SGI customers. ``The
next challenge will be for them to expand by capturing other
people's imagination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Belluzzo, who took over as SGI's chief executive a year ago
this month, isn't counting on the new Windows NT workstations to
single-handedly revive the company. But he believes they're ``a
breakthrough product that should give us a great opportunity to
grow revenue and be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the new systems illustrate SGI's commitment ``to
lower price points and make innovative technology available to a
broader market place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, this doesn't solve all the company's problems,''
Belluzzo said, ``but it's a very important part of the whole
story.''

 &HT;    Georgia football teams land verbal pledges from top high school
picks
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia and Georgia Tech both garnered verbal
commitments after big football recruiting weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs landed Rome High defensive end Chris Hewitt, a
preseason Super 11 choice by the Journal-Constitution. Hewitt, a
6-foot-6, 250-pounder, turned down scholarship offers from Virginia
Tech, Auburn and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked Georgia's coaching staff,'' Hewitt said. ``I
wanted to play in the SEC and I wanted my mom and dad to be able to
watch me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Georgia Tech got Rockdale County placekicker Luke
Manget and Marist defensive lineman Hugh Reilly. Manget, who was
hampered by a hamsting injury during his senior season, hit 7 of 12
field goals with a long of 48 yards. Manget put 90 percent of his
kickoffs went into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who turned down a scholarship offer from Virginia, had
12 sacks during his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   In other recruiting news, Morrow defensive back Michael Ages
committed to South Carolina. Defensive end Clint Mitchell, who also
visited Georgia, committed to Florida. Mitchell is the younger
brother of former Gators offensive lineman Jeff Mitchell.

 &HT;    Cunningham grows finer with time
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The remaking of Randall Cunningham has entered the
serious stages.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, having already survived a long, at times unpleasant
career in Philly, the Minnesota Vikings born-again quarterback was
asked Sunday if this season would be the one to leave the lasting
mark on him as a player. ``I hope so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the improvements that have come with age were evident in the
Vikings 41-21 divisional playoff victory over Phoenix Sunday.
Cunningham was the calm leader of the NFL's most varied and
volitile offense, his endzone interception the only major flaw to a
17-of-27, 236-yard passing performance. His three touchdown passes
more than made up for the one ill-advised toss.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the new Cunningham are easy enough to trace _
to a more spiritual, stable nature. ``I'm mature as far as life
goes. I look at the mistakes I made and I don't want to make them
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poise. The poise,'' Vikings nose tackle Jerry Ball has
said. ``The control of emotion. The deliberateness of what he's
trying to do. He's a different quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Jake Plummer, who once hung a Cunningham poster on the
wall of his boyhood bedroom, looked the part of playoff newcomer.
Meanwhile, Cunningham directed the Vikings to a 80-yard, 13-play
drive with the Vikings first possession and a 24-7 lead by
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   He now is a craftsman with many tools. The three touchdown
passes each landed in a different set of hands (tight end Andrew
Glover, running back Leroy Hoard and rookie sensation Randy Moss).
Meanwhile, he benefitted from a running game that amassed 188
yards. Randall Cunningham doesn't have to do it all anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling (to have so many weapons),'' he said,
``but I don't think we really got to everyone today.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a little fun, three times splitting out as a wide
receiver while running back David Palmer took the snap. ``I'm
wondering what the other guy is thinking. I know they don't think
that I'm going to get the ball, we have plays designed to me. . .I
had a route where I was supposed to run a crossing route, but I
don't want to go up in there too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has signed a five-year, $28 million contract
extension. He is the NFL's highest-rated quarterback this season.
His postseason debut with Minnesota was a spectacular success. But
he warns that as of Sunday, you haven't seen the best of him or
this Vikings offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were really on (against the Cardinals). I
hope after today we can get all our cylinders going. We know what
we're capable of doing.''

SALT LAKE PANEL FOCUSING ON EIGHT IOC MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An internal ethics panel of the Salt Lake City Olympic
Organizing Committee has linked eight members of the International
Olympic Committee to a scandal involving cash payments, free
medical care, tuition payments and excessive gifts during the
bidding for the 2002 Winter Games, an Olympic official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said
Roger Jackson, a Canadian, has emerged as a possible interim chief
operating officer of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee as it seeks
replacements for its top two organizers, who resigned last Friday.
Jackson was described as a member of the organizing committee of
the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sunday issue of The Deseret News of Salt Lake City, Tom
Welch, who headed the Salt Lake City bid committee, said he made a
$50,000 cash payment to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from Congo
Republic, and contributed $10,000 to the mayoral campaign of Sergio
Santander Fantini, an IOC member from Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Welch also said Frank Joklik, who resigned last Friday as
president of the SLOC, knew about payments made by the bid
committee. Joklik has denied this.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditures were justified and not part of any vote-buying
effort, Welch said. Welch also denied allegations that the bid
committee had hired prostitutes for members of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never bribed anybody,'' Welch told the newspaper. ``We
never bought a vote. We made contributions as part of the Olympic
family, as an obligation we have. It was the responsible thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch told the newspaper he made a $50,000 payment to Ganga when
the IOC member requested help for children in his ravaged African
nation. The New York Times reported last Saturday that Ganga had
received approximately $70,000 in a series of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Welch was reached at his condominium in Park City, Utah, on
Sunday, but he declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Other IOC members linked to tuition payments for their relatives
include the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon, David Sibandze of
Swaziland and Mohamed Bashir Attarabulsi of Libya. The names of
other members linked to the scandal are not yet known. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A START ON LONG-TERM CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposal on long-term care will give only
modest help to most individuals with debilitating illnesses and
family members who are caring for them, and no help at all to the
very poor. But it might do some good if it puts the long-term care
problem on the nation's political agenda and becomes a starting
point for increased federal involvement. The issue cannot be put
off for long as millions of baby boomers begin facing potentially
huge long-term care costs for themselves or their parents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, nursing homes charge an average of about $200
a day, or $73,000 a year. The cost in the New York City area is
close to $90,000 a year. Even three home visits a week by a nurse
can cost more than $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   With costs this high, few people can afford to pay the bills.
Medicare does not cover most long-term services, nor do regular
health plans, and insurance policies that cover nursing-home costs
can be prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid is currently the major financing source for custodial
care, but it is available only to people with extremely low
incomes. Others have to deplete nearly all of their assets before
qualifying for Medicaid. But because nursing-home costs are so
high, more than half of the people entering nursing homes become so
impoverished that they qualify for Medicaid after less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan is tiny given these enormous needs. The
centerpiece of the proposal is a $1,000 tax credit for disabled
individuals or families that have such a person living with them.
Like other efforts by the administration to shape social policy
through tax cuts, this one has inherent problems. The credit,
expected to cost about $5.5 billion over five years, is spread so
broadly that the benefit to each individual is very small.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the credit would not help the 40 percent of America's
elderly population with incomes too low to be taxed. It would
primarily benefit middle- and upper-income groups. One way to make
the plan fairer is to make the $1,000 refundable to those who are
too poor to owe taxes. Directly financing state programs that help
the elderly and disabled would be more efficient than the tax cut,
though probably less popular in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of the plan offer some promise. The federal
government would give the states $625 million over five years to
provide counseling and support, including respite care, to help
family care-givers. The plan would also allow federal employees to
buy long-term-care insurance policies at lower negotiated group
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Private nursing-home insurance has not been very popular because
premiums can be high. An innovative private insurance program in
New York that helps individuals pay for three years of nursing-home
costs and shields their assets if they should need Medicaid after
three years currently covers fewer than 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The modest Clinton proposal does not solve these problems. It
can only ease the burden a little for individuals and families who
get no help now.

 CHRON - BIOTECH  
 BIOTECH FIRMS MEETING IN S.F. TO WOO INVESTORS  &HT;     By Tom Abate  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biotech companies get their big chance this week to reclaim some
of the hot money that has moved into Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 3,000 investors will gather at San Francisco's St.
Francis Hotel for the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist health care conference, the
biotech industry's marquee event.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-day meeting starting today, 240 large and small
firms will do their best to wow institutional investors with their
latest scientific and financial results.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conference comes at a time when hundreds of small
and midsize biotech firms have been struggling to raise cash
because Wall Street, lured by quick returns on Internet stocks, has
shied away from smaller biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a capital-crunch situation for the companies
that are a few years away from profitability,'' said Dennis
Purcell, director of H&AMP;Q's life sciences practice and conference
host.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell said that in 1998, the combined market value of the 25
largest biotech firms grew by $37.1 billion, a 56 percent gain. But
the rest of the industry, some 360 smaller biotech firms,
collectively lost $8.7 billion, an 18 percent decrease in market
value.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a single Internet stock, Amazon.com, gained $15.4
billion in market cap _ nearly half as much money as the entire
biotech sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small biotech firms, which had been accustomed to going back
to Wall Street for cash infusions, have been struggling,'' Purcell
said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects that many of the companies at the conference will
explain to investors their plans for getting through this dry
spell, through expense controls, partnerships, private placements
or mergers.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Karen Bernstein, editor of the BioCentury
Newsletter in San Carlos, said last year's cash shortage may have
begun to ease. ``What we saw in the fourth quarter was that even
small biotech firms registered some gains in share price, although
they were down for the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennet Weintraub, chief financial officer of Burlingame
biotech firm Megabios Corp., said he doesn't believe in a quick
return to the good old days, when scientists could easily get Wall
Street backing for bright ideas that might take years to move from
the laboratory to the drug store.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too many small companies out there whose whole futures
rest on a single line of research that may or may not pay off,''
Weintraub said. ``These companies are going to have to merge or
else be forced out.''
</P>
<P>
   Megabios itself is merging with Houston's GeneMedicine, another
public biotech startup that works in the same area as Megabios _
devising new genetic tools to deliver drugs to targeted cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sorts of mergers rarely went on before,'' Weintraub
said. But last year's cash crunch forced biotech firms to look for
ways to become more than one-trick ponies. According to BioCentury,
27 mergers were completed or announced in the fourth quarter of
1998, up from just eight deals in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies that decide to sell out should have no trouble
finding buyers. Chiron Corp., a large biotech firm in Emeryville,
is sitting on $1.2 billion it earned from selling off its
diagnostics division and has said it will use at least part of its
hoard to finance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalist Bob McNeil of Sanderling in Menlo Park hopes
last year's cash crisis prompts biotech companies to lower their
burn rate _ the amount of money they spend before they start
generating product revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in most of the '90s was that you had all these
raw startups, with no lab or anything, getting $6 million one day,
and thinking it has to last them two years,'' McNeil said. ``Why
not make it last four years'' by keeping staffing and overhead to a
minimum?
</P>
<P>
   He said his bare-bones philosophy has helped one of his
startups, ReGen Biologics of Redwood City, bring two products to
late-stage clinical trials for less than $12 million. The products,
which are in Phase III trials before the Food and Drug
Administration, seek to repair the knee tissue that people injure
in skiing or other sporting accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys would be thrilled if they could get two compounds to
that stage for $25 or $30 million,'' McNeil said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pledging renewed allegiance to thrift, the
companies presenting at H&AMP;Q will try to assure investors that they
aren't mesmerized by science, but are focused on bringing products
through the Food and Drug Administration's approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the scientific advances are there and you have
lots of small-to-midsize companies with products on the market or
about to come on the market,'' said H&AMP;Q's Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1998 survey, the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America Association counted 350 biotech products
moving through the various stages of human testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, investors haven't valued that,'' Purcell said. ``I
think that points to a big opportunity in the sector.''
</P>
<P>
   He named two overlooked companies with promising products:
SangStat, the Menlo Park firm that has two transplant drugs on the
market, and Coulter Pharmaceuticals of Palo Alto, which hopes to
get regulatory approval soon to market a drug to fight
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the whole purpose of the H&AMP;Q conference is to give
each company a chance to make its case to the institutional
investors who have been focusing only on the large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Association, expressed the hopeful view that investors will leave
San Francisco this week ready to bet on the majority of overlooked
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got better science and better management than we've ever
had as an industry,'' Feldbaum said. ``I think investors are ready
to take a look at some of the small companies that have not been
recognized.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dear friend:
</P>
<P>
   A belated New Year's greeting to all! Best wishes for a safe and
healthy 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a busy time for all of us, what with parole and
commission hearings, psychological examinations and
community-service work. But Saturday night is a special night for
me, my family and my new entourage.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and Casino, we request the honor
of your presence as I have been allowed to once again return to
some economic stability and exploit myself for others by beating
the living daylights out of another human being.
</P>
<P>
   Please share with us in this special pugilistic moment either in
person or through the magic of pay-per-view television.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of an RSVP, please purchase a guest favor at the
entrance. Cocktail reception begins at five o'clock with the main
course _ a filet of Francois Botha _ expected to begin at about
eight o'clock in the evening. Reception to follow at the home of
Siegfried and Roy and/or Las Vegas Memorial Hospital emergency
ward.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to seeing you there and anticipate an evening you
might not soon forget. Keep your ears open for further details.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,

   So where was Milwaukee Bucks owner Herb Kohl when this NBA
lockout deal had to be approved last week?
</P>
<P>
   Oh....
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. senator from Wisconsin was being sworn in as a witness
in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now you see what an unnecessary burden this puts on everyone?...
</P>
<P>
   Let's figure this out: Michael Jordan is supposedly holed up in
a $25,000-a-night hotel suite in the Bahamas while his NBA
counterparts scrape together to make ends meet during the final
days of the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Big spender? It's all relative.
</P>
<P>
   Considering he made $30 million a year on just last year's
Chicago Bulls paychecks, then the equivalent for someone making
$50,000 a year would be to stay in a $41.67-a-night Worst Western
Motel. Do the math....
</P>
<P>
   A Jay Leno quip on the NBA situation: ``The lockout hurt the
little people. I'm glad Bob Costas is back to work.''...
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones and draft picks for Scottie Pippen makes a lotta
cents....
</P>
<P>
   NBC already has plans to have the casts of ``Friends'' and
``ER'' do promos for the return of NBA programming....
</P>
<P>
   Paging James Earl Jones. You're wanted on the set for ``The John
Thompson Story.''...
</P>
<P>
   Load the boys up in the pickup for ``Varsity Blues,'' which
comes out Friday. Think of it as ``All The Right Moves'' meets
``Dawson's Creek,'' with a bunch of ``North Dallas Forty'' thrown
in for excitement....
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think L.A. doesn't need an NFL franchise, Playboy
comes out with an issue featuring bare, naked cheerleaders. Based
on this February issue, a Denver-Atlanta Super Bowl would be most
appealing....
</P>
<P>
   How did we let Raiderette Leah-Marie Duryea get away?...
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City has (begin ital)prostitutes(end ital)? And Karl
Malone wants to leave?...
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Now(end ital) UCLA is going to regret not hiring
Rick Neuheisel....
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals wanted to hire Northridge's Mark Gubicza
back as a minor-league pitching instructor. Gubicza, 36, who tried
out recently for the Boston Red Sox, wants back in the Royals'
rotation....
</P>
<P>
   A yarn going around the Fox offices: When Rupert Murdoch was
asked for his approval of the $105 million contract for pitcher
Kevin Brown, the Dodgers owner said, sure, and while you're at it,
go ahead and ``sign that other bloke'' as well. He was referring to
Roger Clemens. Murdoch had to be informed that Clemens could only
be obtained through a trade....
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, times must be tough for Disney when it can only
afford a $5 million bonus for Michael Eisner. That's not coming out
of Mo Vaughn's signing bonus. &QL;

$30 MILLION CAP EXPECTED TO SUBDUE FREE-AGENT MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Team owners in the National Basketball Association
may be celebrating the ratification of the new collective
bargaining agreement, but some of their general managers are in
mourning. After six months of planning a strategy for a frenzied
free-agent market, many team executives have been forced to scrap
their plans because of the surprisingly low salary cap that
Commissioner David Stern announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While most teams projected that the cap would rise to more than
$32 million this season, Stern, with the agreement of the players'
union, set it at $30 million. For many teams, that $2 million gap
could mean the difference between signing an All-Star and settling
for a solid starter, or between adding two top-notch players to a
lineup or just one. Some teams could be left out of the game
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people were disappointed to see that
number,'' said the New Jersey Nets' president, Michael Rowe, whose
team was not significantly affected. ``If you've got plans to make
a trade or whatever, it means that you're going to have to work a
lot harder now.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 200 free agents available and numerous teams with
significant cap room, the rush for players was expected to be
feverish. But the low cap, plus the new rules that limit maximum
individual salaries, have most insiders predicting that many free
agents will end up staying with their former teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reduces some teams' flexibility and probably takes some of
the sting out of the frenzy,'' said one Western Conference general
manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``My reaction when I
heard that the cap was only $30 million was, `What?' After planning
all year to have cap room, I don't like it at all. It screws up our
plans a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the salary cap is set at 48.4 percent of the previous
season's basketball-related income. Based on last season's figures,
the cap should have been close to $32 million. But at Stern's
urging, Billy Hunter, executive director of the players' union,
consented to the $30 million cap when the two were putting the
finishing touches on the new labor agreement last week. In return,
the league agreed to preset next season's cap at $34 million, which
is much higher than it would have been because of the shortened
season.
</P>
<P>
   While the lower cap benefits owners, it hurts some teams that
hoped to bid for the services of free-agent stars like Scottie
Pippen, Jayson Williams, Rod Strickland, Antonio McDyess and Tom
Gugliotta. Many clubs that thought they would have $8 million to
spend are now down to $6 million, not enough to land most of the
big names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that every team in this league that thought they
could make moves had to re-evaluate when the cap came out,'' Nets
Coach John Calipari said. ``Even teams that thought they were going
to make small moves. Everybody had to come up with a different plan
of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   One agent said that three general managers asked him to approach
the union about petitioning to add $2.5 million to the cap. ``It's
a monumental difference in the planning that many NBA teams have
been doing,'' the agent said. ``It hurts everybody, but it hurts
the teams as much if not more than the players and agents because
all of their planning is down the tubes in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is complaining. Because of the Larry
Bird exception rule, most of the upper-echelon free agents can be
signed by their former teams for much more money than any
competitor could offer. Even teams like Phoenix and Houston, which
are still more than $11 million beneath the cap, may shy away from
the most expensive players in order to split their money among two
or three lesser players. In the end, it could all add up to little
movement among the stars. The agent Bill Duffy summed up the
situation when asked Sunday if the free-agent frenzy had started.
``No,'' he said. ``And it won't start because of the $30 million
cap.''

 CHRON - MUSIC  
 MP3s Turn Up the Volume  
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at the world's five biggest record companies have
started to discuss how best to deal with Internet music pirates.
They hope to have the answer by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of companies like Audio Explosion of San Francisco
aren't waiting that long. They're ready to sell copyright-protected
MP3-formatted songs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is here today,'' said Arnold Brown II, Audio
Explosion's president and CEO. The year-old startup is trying to
capitalize on the growing popularity of MP3, an audio format that
can compress, play and distribute music via the Internet or on one
of a number of portable devices coming to the market.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's hard to wait,'' Brown said. ``We want to be known as the
company that provides a secure solution for MP3s.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio Explosion last week began selling a small selection of
legal, copyright-protected songs for $1 each. The songs, playable
using Audio Explosion's own Mjuice Music Player, are part of a
special promotion targeted at people who have purchased the Rio
PMP300, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.'s controversial portable
MP3 music player.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the company hopes to open its Mjuice.com site for the
general public sometime in February and is already is working with
a major record label that could make music from hip-hop stars like
Big Pun and Funkmaster Flex available in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   Audio Explosion isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, AudioSoft Inc. will launch a new version of the
Internet's most popular MP3 player, WinAmp, which uses AudioSoft's
music-scrambling technology designed to prevent MP3 songs from
being illegally copied and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   AudioSoft CEO Francois-Xavier Nuttall, who founded the company
in 1986 in Switzerland, is shifting his operations to Fremont later
this month to be closer to the mainstream Silicon Valley technology
companies. One of his investors is pop star Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to build on the momentum,'' Nuttall said,
referring to MP3. ``In no way shall I just sit around to wait for
the majors (recording labels) to make a move. I believe the
consumer is ready to pay a fair amount to have some quality
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's MCY America Inc. of New York, which plans to launch
a Web site on January 24 that also will sell protected MP3 music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital music revolution has begun,'' proclaimed Bernhard
Fritsch, president and CEO of MCY. ``We're not only talking, we are
ready to go. It's a fully developed system, and we'll be offering
up to 1 million songs in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Each company is trying to ride the wave that has made MP3 one of
the most popular topics on Internet search engines.
</P>
<P>
   MP3, shorthand for MPEG 1, Layer 3, is a technical standard
approved by international audio and video engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Using MP3, a song that would take up about 50 megabytes of space
on a computer hard dri &LR;   &LR; ve can be compressed to about 5 megabytes
but still retain the sound quality of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Songs also can be ``ripped,'' or copied, from a regular CD onto
the hard drive of a personal computer using MP3. From there, the
song is played back on computer speakers using any of the widely
available software programs, including Microsoft's Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 songs grew in popularity as high school and college students
with access to high-speed Internet lines began trading songs or
posting them on Web sites for free downloads by other MP3 fans. The
popularity spread in the past year as more home and business users
gained higher-speed modems or Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   PC Computing magazine recently reported that the Internet has
become a virtual jukebox filled with at least 20,000 free songs.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Recording Industry Association of America
views this development as a threat. It says the distribution of
those songs, especially music by artists under contract to the
major record labels, violates copyright laws and reduces their
sales revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the MP3 phenomenon has made only a tiny dent in the
$40 billion worldwide recording industry. Analyst Mark Hardie of
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., believes that it will take
another five years before there is a significant shift of
consumer-buying habits toward Internet music.
</P>
<P>
   But the Big Five labels _ BMG Entertainment, Sony Music, Warner
Music Group, EMI Recorded Music and Universal Music Group _ that
control about 80 percent of the popular music industry already
worry that MP3s are just the tip of an iceberg that could sink
their record-distribution structure.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, MP3 music has vividly demonstrated how easily songs
can be sold via the Internet directly from artist to consumer,
bypassing the traditional middlemen like retail stores, CD-makers,
music distributors, wholesalers or even record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 represents artists' empowerment,'' said Michael Robertson,
founder of a site that has become an MP3 portal,  &LR; www.MP3.com.
 &LR; ``It's about consumer freedom. It's not just about pirate music.
It's much bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Big Five, acknowledging that the Web was their
future, put aside their differences to form a rare alliance called
the Secure Digital Music Initiative to decide how to protect their
online music interests.
</P>
<P>
   The SDMI hopes to set technology standards by the end of 1999
ensuring that Internet music distribution moves forward while still
protecting copyrights and revenues. The SDMI includes companies
like Liquid Audio of Redwood City and A2b Music of New York, which
still hope the industry adopts their own secured digital music
formats, which are different than MP3.
</P>
<P>
   But companies like Audio Explosion, AudioSoft and MCY say the
Internet public has already spoken and adopted the MP3-formatted
songs, so they believe that they will be in position to sell or
license their technologies long before the SDMI makes a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Each, in fact, claims they already are negotiating with some of
those record companies on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Audio Explosion has cut an informal but potentially
groundbreaking deal to develop MP3 songs as promotional tools for
Loud Records, which has a stable of well-known hip-hop artists like
Wu-Tang Clan, Funkmaster Flex and Grammy Award-nominee Big Pun.
</P>
<P>
   That's significant because Loud Records is half-owned by BMG
Entertainment, one of the Big Five in the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie of Forrester Research expects that the SDMI will fail
before the companies agree to a standard. He also predicted that
BMG will be the first to break ranks and embrace MP3s, with Sony
not far behind with its its own portable MP3 player.
</P>
<P>
   Loud Records' collaboration with Audio Explosion appears to be
``the first crack in the dam,'' Hardie said.
</P>
<P>
   While BMG has been publicly skeptical about MP3, it also
realizes there's a market for Web music, said Randy Weiner, Loud
Records' executive producer for new media.
</P>
<P>
   Loud wants to start with giving away a limited number of songs
on Audio Explosion to promote new albums but also sees MP3 as a
path to future music sales on the Web, Weiner said.

 CHRON - THE NET FILES   Playboy Sues Ex-Playmate Over Web Site 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the highest-profile cases involving trademark
protection on the Internet, Playboy Enterprises is suing former
Playmate Terri Welles over her alleged use of a programming trick
to lure Web surfers to her site.
</P>
<P>
   The adult-entertainment publishing empire claims that Welles,
41, of San Diego is using a technology called ``meta tags'' to
confuse people into thinking her site is connected to Playboy's.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer counters that she is just trying to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts are closely watching the case to see what impact
it will have on Internet trademark disputes _ especially as
companies invest heavily in Net sites as potential revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
   Welles' attorney, David Noonan, says his client created her
commercial site ( &LR; www.terriwelles.com &LR; ) in June 1997 with the
blessing of Playboy founder Hugh Heffner. Under the banner headline
``1981 Playmate of the Year,'' it contains photos of a scantily
clad Welles, biographical information and links to X-rated banner
ads. Nude pictures are sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Things went well until August 1997, when Playboy started Cyber
Club, its own online den of Playmates and centerfolds. It asked
Welles to join. She refused. Playboy sued Welles in February 1998
for trademark infringement over her use of the phrase ``Playmate of
the Year'' and sought $5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy requested a preliminary injunction. A federal judge in
San Diego ruled in favor of Welles in May 1998. The decision was
upheld in October by the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Playboy added a new claim to its lawsuit: trademark
counterfeiting. Welles countersued Playboy last week for defamation
and unfair-business practices. A final pretrial hearing on the
Playboy suit is scheduled for federal district court this spring in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy objects in particular to the site's use of meta tags.
These are key words embedded in a site's programming code so that
the site is prominently mentioned in certain Internet search
results. They are used by many sites, especially
adult-entertainment ones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Playboy contends that Welles illegally included meta tags for
the words ``Playboy'' and ``Playmate'' so that Web users are
directed to her site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like traveling on the freeway and seeing a sign for
Chevron, but when you pull off the road, you find other gas
stations instead,'' said Neil Smith, a San Francisco Internet
trademark attorney who has represented Playboy in unrelated cases.
``Eventually, you may find Chevron, but it is a misleading sign.''
</P>
<P>
   David Francescani, an attorney for Playboy Enterprises in
Chicago, said that once Playboy customers are ``hijacked'' to
Welles' site, they can count on getting an eyeful of unsavory ads
that Playboy ``would never be associated with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem with her site,'' he said, ``but we do
object to the use of meta tags. The magazine is simply trying to
protect itself against unfair competition and trademark
infringement.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
URGE TO MERGE: Acquisitions of three Bay Area Internet service
providers last week is a harbinger of major consolidation in the
crowded ISP market. Whether that's good news for consumers remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Slip.Net, Netcom and the parent company of Best Internet
Communications were gobbled up by larger communications companies
that intend to blend the ISPs into their vast networking and online
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although a bigger company might mean more and better services
for customers, less competition could hurt in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data communications companies like us want to round out our
offerings with Internet service,'' said Sheldon Ohringer, CEO of
FirstWorlds, the San Diego company that acquired Slip.Net for
$10.45 million in cash plus 187,000 shares of stock Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Added Slip.Net President Ted Glenwright: The buyout ``gives our
20,000 customers richer service and support at the same price.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ISP customers can only hope they are as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the ISP boom in 1997, flat-rate pricing was de
riguer. America Online, Netcom and others were offering unlimited
Internet access for $19.95 per month. Today, AOL has increased its
monthly rate to $21.95. Earlier this year, IBM Internet Connection
Services eschewed the unlimited pricing model in favor of metered
rates based on time of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are turning away from unlimited hours,'' said Greg
Tally, associate editor at Boardwatch of Golden, Colo., a magazine
that tracks ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   There currently are 5,000 ISPs in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications Inc., which bought Netcom 14 months ago, sold
the San Jose ISP to MindSpring Enterprises of Atlanta for $245
million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Verio bought Hiway Technologies, parent of Best Internet, for
about $350 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
I'VE GOT A SECRET: To the surprise of nearly everyone _ especially
self-described iCEO Steve Jobs _ Apple Computer was able to keep a
tight lid on last week's surprise announcement of lollipop-colored
iMacs at the Macworld Expo computer show in San Francisco. For such
a notoriously loose-lipped company, the secret was as unlikely as
Ken Starr keeping his investigation under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So how did Apple stay mum on the space-age Internet computers?
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from the CIA, it allegedly covered in drapes a
portion of its Macworld Expo booth to hide the new machines and it
even sent a security force to a print shop to oversee production of
the colorful iMac posters, according to sources.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With the largest crowd to see a pro
football game in the New York region rattling Giants Stadium, the
New York Jets defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 34-24, Sunday and
suddenly found themselves 30 years and 60 minutes from returning to
a Super Bowl in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory, before a crowd of 78,817, put the Jets in the
American Conference championship game next Sunday in Denver, where
they will be underdogs against the defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos. The winner will play in Super Bowl XXXIII on Jan. 31, a
game the Jets have appeared in only once _ 30 years ago Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only two seasons ago, the Jets had a 1-15 record, the worst in
the National Football League for a second consecutive season, and
they had not won a playoff game in 12 years. So Sunday was a
remarkable day for a franchise whose past three decades had been
overshadowed by its historic victory in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a remarkable day for their star wide receiver,
Keyshawn Johnson, who had said before the game, ``I want to be the
guy on every play, running, catching, blocking, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he nearly was the guy on every play. He ran for two
touchdowns, on a reverse and on a 21-yard pass from Vinny
Testaverde; recovered a fumble at a pivotal moment by racing 60
yards in pursuit of a Jaguar player, and then moved to defense and
intercepted a desperation pass from quarterback Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in 62 years that a player has managed such
accomplishments on both sides of the line of scrimmage, but he
probably was the least surprised of anyone. With anxiety keeping
him awake, he said sleeping only three hours on Saturday night was
an indication that he was going to do great things.
</P>
<P>
   His interception was no surprise. All week, the Jets practiced
with the 6-foot-3-inch Johnson in the role of extra defensive back.
Brunell's pass was a heave of 60 yards, but Johnson outjumped
everyone to haul it in at the 7-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   For the game, Johnson had nine receptions for 121 yards and
rushed for 28 yards on two carries. His big day was shared by
running back Curtis Martin and quarterback Vinny Testaverde. Martin
handled the ball 42 times, with 36 rushing attempts for 124 yards
and two touchdowns and six receptions for 58 yards. Testaverde
completed 24 of his 36 passes for 284 yards for one touchdown, with
one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets statistically dominated the Jaguars, who were bidding
for their second appearance in a conference championship game in
their four seasons. At times it seemed that the Jets would rout the
Jaguars. They built leads of 17-0, 24-7 and 31-14, but Jacksonville
kept coming up with big plays to narrow the margin.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory also represented a personal achievement for
Testaverde, who is in his first season with the Jets after being
let go by the Baltimore Ravens and signing as a free agent in the
off season. Testaverde had lost all six of the games he had played
against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Testaverde said he was not surprised by the success he
has had this season in leading the Jets to victories in 13 of the
14 games he has started.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, the architect of this team's unprecedented
rise from a one-victory season to the divisional title, is aware
that the Jets have to play better than they did today to beat the
Broncos, who have won 18 consecutive games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was critical of several plays by the Jets, but said:
``This was a good win for our franchise. I was happy for our fans.
I'm happy about it. But there's more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Ernie Logan was more direct. ``If we do next
Sunday what we did today, we are not going to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, everything seemed headed toward perfection. Johnson
opened the scoring on a 21-yard pass from Testaverde. John Hall
kicked the longest field goal in Jets' playoff history, 52 yards,
and then Johnson continued his string of heroics.
</P>
<P>
   First, Martin fumbled on the Jaguars' 22. Jacksonville's Chris
Hudson recovered and dashed along the right sideline, past
midfield. From there, just as he was about to be run out of bounds,
he appeared to try to lateral the ball, although the officials
ruled that he fumbled. The ball bounced around and suddenly it was
pounced on by Johnson, who had been a potential receiver far
downfield in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets proceeded to drive to the Jaguars' 10, where Johnson
got the ball again. This time it was on an end-around play and he
dashed into the end zone for a touchdown. It was the second time
this season that he had scored on the play.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Jets ahead by 17-0, a lead that was trimmed on the
final play of the first half when Brunell connected with Jimmy
Smith on a 52-yard score after Jerome Henderson missed the
coverage. The Jets left the field with Parcells directing a tirade
at Henderson. After controlling the ball for more than 14 minutes
in the 15-minute quarter, they had suddenly lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets came out for the third quarter and quickly scored,
with Martin churning out a final 1-yard dive. It was a dramatic day
for Martin, who also caught three screens, picking up good yardage
against overcommitted Jaguars. He also benefited from good blocking
from the linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-7 edge, though, lasted only 65 seconds. Reggie Barlow
returned the kickoff 88 yards and a few plays later Brunell
connected with Keenan McCardell on a 3-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets were to fold, this seemed to be the moment. Instead,
they continued to demonstrate that the six-game winning streak that
closed the season toughened them. They quickly roared back with
another Martin touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jaguars continued to make it interesting. In the
final period, Brunell clicked on a third-and-15 with Smith for a
19-yard touchdown as Otis Smith was covering.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Chrebet fumbled on the next drive and the Jaguars
converted the turnover into a 37-yard Mike Hollis field goal. Now
the Jets' lead was down to 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   On the next drive the Jets got to the Jaguars' 14, and
Testaverde threw the ball into the end zone for Keith Byars. At
that point, with about two and a half minutes remaining, a field
goal would have put the Jets up by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Testaverde was hit as he threw. The pass was
intercepted by Donovin Darius. Unwisely, Darius attempted to run
out of the end zone and was stopped at the one by Byars. Had he
stayed in the end zone, the ball would have come out to the 20.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell was unable to move the Jaguars and the Jets took over
and produced a 30-yard Hall field goal for a 10-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Brunell's final opportunity. After the kickoff, he
got the ball at his 41. He let his last pass fly, but Brunell never
quite expected that Johnson was back on the field, playing defense
and ready to intercept the Jaguars' hopes. &QL;

 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   Lotus Founder Mitch Kapor Admits Move to Boston Was a Mistake 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
In 1980, a twentysomething entrepreneur moved from Silicon Valley
to Boston and started a software company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp.,
recalled that fateful decision, as he discussed his plan to move
back here again to join Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in
Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I'd stayed on the West Coast, I might have made
something of myself,'' quipped Kapor, who will be bicoastal for
several months before replanting himself full time in San
Francisco's Pacific Heights.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to popularizing the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet that
made the PC a fixture in the business world, Kapor co-founded the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, the San Francisco nonprofit group
that focuses on Internet policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kapor has maintained a low business profile for years,
he has been an early private investor in several ventures that paid
large dividends. In 1993, for instance, before the Internet gold
rush began, he became one of the first outside investors in UUNet,
an early Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``My history is to find the next big thing early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapor was coy about where he intends to look for future scores,
but he did disclose his modus operandi _ it won't include poring
through the business plans that come in over the transom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real deals that get funded come from your network of
personal contacts,'' said Kapor, whose relationships go back to the
earliest days of the PC revolution.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THEY GOT MAIL?: Letters or phone calls are still a far-more
effective way to influence your congressional representative than
fax or e-mail, according to a new survey from OMB Watch, a
nonprofit political watchdog group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which pulls together a variety of recent research
into Congress' cyber-quotient, says most House and all Senate
members have some form of Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But to no one's surprise, many of those Web sites contain
outdated information. On the upside, nearly 60 percent of the sites
made it easy for browsers to e-mail comments to the member.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the e-mails are getting through doesn't mean
they're being heeded. Most members screen out and disregard
electronic messages from nonconstituents. And even when
representatives do acknowledge or reply to e-mails, the response
most likely will come by snail mail.
</P>
<P>
   The full text of the report can be downloaded at
 &LR; www.ombwatch.org &LR;   &LR; /ombw/npt/reports &LR;   &LR; /emailsurvey.pdf. &LR;   &QL; 
 &QL; 
LEGAL MYSTERY: Silicon Valley is still weighing the impact of a
California Supreme Court ruling last week. It allows out-of-state
residents to go into California courts to file class-action suits
that charge California companies with stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Such shareholder suits are the bane of high-tech execs, who feel
victimized by law firms that specialize in suing when a company's
stock drops unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past three years, Silicon Valley lobbyists have
persuaded Congress to change the rules under which such suits are
filed in federal courts. The most recent change, in 1998, required
that most class-action suits for stock fraud be filed in federal
courts _ where the rules of evidence were changed in 1995 to favor
Silicon Valley defendants.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1998 law left one loophole for lawyers who might like to
file fraud class-action suits in state courts like those in
California, where fraud laws still favor plaintiffs. Even under the
1998 reform, it is still legal for 49 or fewer plaintiffs to file a
class action in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Now Silicon Valley execs wonder if the California Supreme Court
ruling can be combined with that federal provision that lets 49 or
fewer plaintiffs file in state courts. If it's possible, it will
give plaintiff's attorneys a new loophole to file in state courts
where the rules of evidence in fraud cases favor their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Grundfest, a Stanford law professor who tracks this issue,
said lawyers could round up four dozen institutional investors,
even if they have offices in New York, and file class actions under
California's more-liberal fraud rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a risk here of undermining the 1998 reform, which was
to steer all these cases to the federal courts, so companies traded
on national stock markets will only have to conform to one set of
rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court ruling was won by the San Diego law
firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, which has long been
the most prolific filer of stock fraud suits against Valley firms.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss attorney Tom Dato said his firm has ``no
particular game plan'' to round up institutional investors to
become plaintiffs for stock fraud cases filed in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Dato noted that two state retirement funds, one in Missouri
and the other in Pennsylvania, filed friend-of-court briefs
supporting Milberg Weiss' contention that out-of-staters should be
able to file fraud class actions under California rules _ as long
as they number 49 or fewer. (Any suit with 50 or more plaintiffs
would be handled by federal courts.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're going to have to see whether the impact of this
case is significant,'' Dato said.
</P>
<P>
   Grundfest predicted that the Silicon Valley side would ask the
U.S. Supreme Court to review the California decision, in the hopes
of getting a ruling that only plaintiffs in California should be
able to file fraud class actions in California courts.

THE BIG, THE BOLD AND THE BIZARRE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - CES   By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     Chronicle Technology Editor 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR; ``Have you heard the pillow yet? You must hear the pillow,''
exclaimed Grant Nelson, a spokesman at the Pillow-Phonic booth at
the Consumer Electronics Show here.
</P>
<P>
   A pillow seems kind of, well, soft to qualify as an electronics
device, but this $59.95 ``audio-pillow relaxation system'' has more
to it than meets the eye (or ear).
</P>
<P>
   Nestled inside the hypo-allergenic fibers is a pair of digital
speakers. You plug a radio, or CD/tape player into a small jack and
_ voila _ you can listen to soothing nature sounds, subliminal
learning tapes or Counting Crows without disturbing your bedmate or
fussing with headphones.
</P>
<P>
   While the CES show has heavy-duty electronics galore _ 64-inch
rear-projection digital TVs, $16,000 stereo speakers, cars smarter
than most drivers _ it also has many products whose charm lies in
their more modest approach, such as electronic nose-hair clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Freeplay Energy Group's self-powered radios ($89) and
flashlights ($69). You just turn a crank to power them. Thirty
seconds of cranking gives you an hour of use. Freeplay usually
markets them to boaters and campers, but the CES crowd had a
different use in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perfect for Y2K,'' said two Silicon Valley engineers.
</P>
<P>
   For another variation on portable listening, there is the $99.95
Bike Jammer, billed as the first stereo for your bicycle. Shaped
like a foreshortened submarine, it snaps onto the handlebars and
includes a halogen headlight and a pair of speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the technologies at CES, the telephone is probably the
oldest, and the concept of stylized phones to match decors is
hardly new. Still, vendors managed to come up with some fresh
twists.
</P>
<P>
   Kash N Gold Ltd. seemed to have a slam-dunk with its Michael
Jordan phone. Shaped like a regular-sized basketball, it opens up
to reveal a basketball arena whenever it receives an incoming call.
Instead of a ring, you hear an announcer enthusiastically
introducing No.23, while lights flash, the crowd does the wave and
images of Jordan appear on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Uniden salespeople were proud to present the world's first
official Harley-Davidson phone, though it wasn't clear if the bulky
black-and-silver phone or the sleek black-leather-clad spokesmodel
was a bigger draw.
</P>
<P>
   Kash N Gold also has addressed the need for fun paper shredders.
There's a golf course model where you put the paper in the water
hazard, and the NFL football stadium model. It also carries remote
controls shaped like fishing reels and race cars, and boom boxes in
brushed-aluminum briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many variations on familiar themes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many electronics are so inexpensive that manufacturers can go
ahead and make them goofy,'' said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association, the trade group
that sponsors CES. ``Twenty years ago, a calculator cost $200 and
was the size of a laptop. Now, you can literally give them away. So
everyone's looking for a way to make things appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who found the Las Vegas desert heat unbearable
(although in January, you don't hear too many complaints), there is
U B Kool, a handheld gizmo that looks like an electric shaver. The
$49 ``electronic ice cube'' has a circular area slightly larger
than a 50-cent piece that gets cold _ about 40 degrees Fahrenheit _
when you press a button. ``Then you can rub it on your neck or
wrists to cool your blood,'' said the booth representative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the brochure's claim that it utilizes
``NASA-developed solid-state chip technology,'' he ventured, ``I
think it's the same way they cool the astronauts' space suits.''
</P>
<P>
   Another health-oriented item is PolluCorp's Pollumetre Air, a
pocket-size air pollution detector. Its brochure, too, had a
problem containing its enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helps you to better protect yourself from damage caused by
atmospheric pollution. Allows you to improve your quality of life
and to adapt your behavior according to the situation,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does that really mean?
</P>
<P>
   The device flashes a number indicating how much carbon monoxide
is in the air, measured in parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   If the number seems too high, you can go somewhere else. Or you
could just stop breathing.
</P>

L.A. LANDS NFL TEAM ... 53 YEARS AGO

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the year 2000 approaches, this space will highlight important
dates in Los Angeles sports history over the last century:
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 12, 1946: Less than a month after winning their first NFL
title, the Cleveland Rams are given permission by the league to
move the team to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Take note: The Rams are the first major professional sports team
on the West Coast, a place they eventually vacated for that garden
paradise known as St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland fans quickly embraced a new team, the Browns, of the
All-American Football Conference (some teams of which merged into
the NFL in 1950). The Browns, of course, eventually left Cleveland
also.
</P>
<P>
   Spot a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 15, 1967: In the first Super Bowl _ it's called that now
but wasn't at the time _ the NFL's Green Bay stomps all over the
AFL's Kansas City 35-10 at the Coliseum before 61,946 fans and two
TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 17, 1994: The Northridge Earthquake forces postponement of
the Lakers' game at the Forum against Sacramento. The Clippers
eventually have to move games against Cleveland and New York to the
Pond in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays this week: Tuesday: Former Dodgers outfielder Mike
Marshall (39); Thursday: former UCLA basketball player Swen Nater
(49); Friday: Former Angels second baseman Bobby Grich (50);
Saturday: Former UCLA star and Simi Valley High standout Don
MacLean (29), major-league pitcher and Van Nuys native Jack
McDowell (33). &QL;

BLACK AND HISPANIC LEADERS SEEK CONSENSUS ON SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that the state's highest ranking black elected
official has removed himself from next year's race for U.S. Senate,
a group of black and Hispanic elected officials, political
strategists and businessmen _ led by the Rev. Al Sharpton _ have
begun meeting to discuss uniting behind a single minority
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, who has failed twice before to win the Democratic
nomination for the Senate, said he was strongly considering trying
again. He said he would decide by April whether to seek the seat
being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, basing his decision on
the deliberations of the group of elected officials, which includes
legislators primarily from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Sharpton, who has also considered a
second candidacy for mayor of New York City in 2001, said, ``Right
now, I would say there is a 50-50 chance'' he would attempt a third
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions among the black and Hispanic officials _ all
Democrats _ come at a time when two of the party's strongest
potential contenders have decided not to run. Last month, State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall said he would not seek the Senate seat.
He made the decision after receiving what was tantamount to an
endorsement from Moynihan, who said the Senate should have a black
member. And last week, Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban
development and son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, also said he would
not run.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's meeting at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, which included two
dozen elected officials and an equal number of political tacticians
and business owners, was led by Sharpton and state Sen. Efrain
Gonzales Jr. of the Bronx. Gonzales said that several more meetings
were planned over the next few months. He and Sharpton said
McCall's withdrawal made it more critical that black and Hispanic
leaders focus on uniting behind a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we develop a new alliance of black and
Latinos,'' Sharpton said. He said the victories of Sen. Charles
Schumer and state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer were due in large
measure to the strong turnout by black and Latino voters. ``We have
seen what can happen when we come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sharpton sounded very much like a candidate. ``The fact
is that I am the only African-American to have run for the Senate
nomination and there are a lot of people who are urging me to
run,'' Sharpton said. ``With Carl McCall out of the race, I don't
know any others who have the statewide recognition that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   To many New Yorkers, however, Sharpton remains a highly
controversial political figure, a result of his seemingly perennial
involvement in racially charged cases. Last summer, for example, a
jury in Dutchess County ordered him to pay $65,000 to a white
former prosecutor whom Sharpton had accused of kidnapping and
raping a black teen-ager 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his race for the 1992 Democratic nomination for the Senate,
Sharpton placed third in a four-way race, receiving 14 percent of
the vote. Two years later, he received 26 percent of the vote
against Moynihan in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's meeting was attended by elected officials from
throughout the city, including Assemblyman Keith Wright, who is
chairman of the state's Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus;
state Sen. David Paterson of Manhattan, City Councilman Angel
Rodriguez of Brooklyn and Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. of the Bronx.

LORIN PRICE, THEATRICAL PRODUCER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lorin Price, a theatrical producer, died Dec. 28 at his home in
Tampa, Fla. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Price began producing in 1959, beginning off-Broadway with shows
like ``The Mime and Me'' and ``The Tiger Rag.'' His first Broadway
production was ``The Natural Look,'' a play about Helena
Rubenstein, which opened in 1967 with Gene Hackman, Brenda Vaccaro
and Jerry Orbach in the leading roles.
</P>
<P>
   His first big success was ``George M!,'' the 1968 musical about
George M. Cohan, with Joel Grey and Bernadette Peters. The show
received a Tony Award nomination for Grey, and a Tony Award for the
choreographer, Joe Layton. His credits also included ``Show Me
Where the Good Times Are,'' a musical adaptation of Moliere's
``Imaginary Invalid,'' in 1970, and ``Seesaw,'' a musical based on
William Gibson's play, ``Two for the Seesaw.'' Choreographed by
Michael Bennett and starring Michelle Lee, Ken Howard and Tommy
Tune, the show opened in 1973 and Bennett and Tune won Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced ``Free,'' a 1972 film about the Randalls Island
Rock Festival with Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and The Who.

UCONN WOMEN COME UP ONE GUARD SHORT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Geno Auriemma rotated players in and out until
they looked as if they had whiplash, but he never did find the
unifying piece, or point. Against the likes of Tennessee,
Connecticut looked to be one bird short of a championship flock.
</P>
<P>
   Against Chamique Holdsclaw and the three-time defending national
champions, UConn needed Sue Bird, recruited out of Christ the King
High School in Queens, just as Holdsclaw was by Tennessee, to bring
some direction, some city savvy, to a deep but inexperienced team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to playing against her, the same way
players in the NBA want Michael Jordan to stay,'' Bird said after.
``They want to get their rings through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fate, in the form of the anterior cruciate ligament in her left
knee, ran a backdoor cut on Bird. In a practice last month, the
5-foot-9-inch freshman blew out the knee, and her one sure chance
to play against Holdsclaw, who encased four state championship
trophies at Christ the King for Bird to look at when she
transferred in the year after Holdsclaw left. Also gone with the
untimely snap, in all likelihood, is Auriemma's chance of wresting
a championship from Coach Pat Summitt before Holdsclaw takes her
summertime dreams and quick pull-up jumper to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said going in we were one guard short, and we were right,''
Auriemma said after the Huskies lost the game, 92-81, and the No. 1
ranking, at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   It is much easier to beat a team like Tennessee on paper.
Auriemma's unyielding substitutions also play more to his all-court
pressure system than any one talent, but Bird, no relation to the
Indiana Birds, is a creative, offensive point guard. Conversely,
the play of her replacement and roommate, the freshman Keirsten
Walters, was tentative, to be kind about it, especially as UConn
tried to pull ahead with Holdsclaw on the bench late in the game
with four fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I took her out and said, `Go spend the next three
minutes finding your brain, and when you find it, I'll put you back
in,''' Auriemma said.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds harsh, well, this was about as big as it gets
outside the Final Four. One versus two. A sold-out arena. National
television (at least when the network had shown enough post-game
football replays). The appropriate amount of tension and passion,
even a near first-half fight as Tennessee's wonderfully aggressive
Semeka Randall fought on the floor for a rebound with Svetlana
Abrosimova, did a complete body flip and kicked Abrosimova in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of game, end to end, until Tennessee, at 76-76,
ran off 12 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone want their money back?'' Auriemma said.
</P>
<P>
   Not really, but Bird did express an interest in the
reacquisition of her uniform and mobility, in time for a possible
rematch next spring. The doctors have told her not to hope too
hard. Six months, they said. Bird said she has a friend who
recovered from similar surgery in five weeks. She is drawing
inspiration from her teammate Shea Ralph, a two-time victim. Kellie
Jolly, Tennessee's senior point guard, who graciously encouraged
Bird after the game, had her knee cut as a sophomore and made it
back in time to co-star with Holdsclaw in championship game No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to get back,'' Bird said, ``just to make a foul
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   All she could do yesterday was trail her teammates to the court,
stiff-legged, in tan slacks, a white pullover shirt and sleeveless
blue sweater. She took a seat in the row behind the UConn bench,
and watched Walters force too many passes, shoot too many air
balls. She watched Holdsclaw restore the carbonation to those shots
that were so flat last week against Rutgers at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw would have fared better financially had she left
college after her junior year and leveraged the now defunct
American Basketball League for a few hundred thousand from David
Stern's women's annex. But now that she stayed, she figures she may
as well bat 1.000, win a fourth title, let the Huskies inherit the
sport after she's gone, the way Bird took over at Christ the King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here, UConn owned Tennessee,'' said Holdsclaw,
who had 25 points, nine rebounds, four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt, who won a few trinkets before she convinced Holdsclaw
that Knoxville was ``just like New York,'' shot her star an
oh-really look.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it is with the prime-time players, who are too busy
achieving to consider what came before, or what comes next. Bird
said the sight of those trophies at Christ the King motivated her
to want ``to outdo'' Holdsclaw. In the stands yesterday was still
another Christ the King headliner, Clare Droesch, who just last
week scored more points in one game, 48, than Holdsclaw or Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Droesch is a high school sophomore. Her time will come. Bird, a
college freshman, said she is ``rehabbing like crazy,'' but the
medical odds are that she will have to settle for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will wait for her. They will win many more games
this season with their talent and depth. Auriemma will keep
rotating players at his dizzying pace, but he will not find the
player he needs to beat Tennessee on his bench. She is one row
behind it. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: KEYSHAWN JOHNSON'S EXCLAMATION POINT
</HEADLINE>
  (Previously budgeted as FBN-JETS-KEYSHAWN) 
(ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN  
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Keyshawn Johnson bailed out a lot of
people Sunday. He bailed out a Jets team that showed signs of
shrinking from its destiny, and he bailed out a defense that turned
careless and porous. He even bailed out Curtis Martin, his
offensive soulmate, whose second-quarter fumble could have put
Jacksonville back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great day on the strength of Johnson's statistics
alone: nine receptions that matched a New York Jets postseason
record, 121 yards and two touchdowns _ one on a 21-yard pass play
and the other a 10-yard reverse.
</P>
<P>
   This was a performance of Thorpean dimensions: Johnson caught
the ball, Johnson ran the ball and, at the end of a day when the
Jets completed one of the most spectacular resurrections in pro
football history, Johnson even intercepted the ball.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, with the Jets holding a 10-point lead,
Johnson lined up in the defensive secondary. When Mark Brunell
heaved a last gasp desperation pass, Johnson went up in a crowd.
For the few seconds the ball was airborne, Johnson was back in a
Los Angeles schoolyard playing the football version of King of the
Hill, everyone going for himself. Not Jets not Jaguars, the
toughest player comes down with the ball. Johnson came down with
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jets came off the field and entered their locker room
after their 34-24 victory, Johnson held the intercepted ball like a
trophy, an affirmation of everything he had done in three years.
The book, the bluntness, the braggadocio _ this ball represented
the exclamation point to a young career that shifted upward three
speeds on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn's the man,'' running back Curtis Martin said as he
left the stadium. ``
</P>
<P>
   But the defining play of this game, and maybe of Johnson's
three-year National Football League career, took place in the
second quarter. On second-and-15 at the Jaguars' 22-yard line,
Martin fumbled the handoff. The ball bounced right into the arms of
Jacksonville safety Chris Hudson who took off for the end zone.
Hudson was at midfield when, apparently possessed by some Jets'
demon of yesteryear, he attempted a lateral. The ball slithered
around on the turf until a streaking green jersey broke in and
covered it. The blur of green was Johnson. Johnson was blocking on
the play when he saw Hudson carrying the ball and the Jets
championship hopes with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm slow, so I said one thing I'm going to do,
is run,'' Johnson said. ``If they don't catch him, I'm going to
make sure I catch him somewhere down the line. When he went to
lateral the ball someone batted it and I was right there, but that
comes from hustling. If you don't hustle, you never know. They may
have the ball and the game's in a whole other situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, buried beneath a pile, had no idea that his blunder was
being erased. ``I didn't know where Keyshawn was,'' Martin said.
``When that ball comes out, it's like a fish being pulled out of
water. You're like `Where's it at, where's it at?' You can't find
that ball and the worst feeling is when you fumble and people are
laying on top of you and you can't get to that ball. You can't
think of anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martin finally found out that Johnson had recovered the
fumble, he went over and expressed his gratitude. ``I just said
`Thanks, man. You bailed me out.' I was elated that we got the ball
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's was one of those breakthrough performances that spoke
for itself but connected with fans who might never have watched a
pro game before, but who nonetheless could understand a great
performance.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson left the locker room, Tina Thompson, a classmate of
Johnson at the University of Southern California and now a star for
the Houston Comets in the Women's National Basketball Association,
came over to offer congratulations. For Thompson, the Jets' victory
was a revelation. This was her first professional football game and
the first time she had paid attention to how Johnson did his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that he was good because I saw him play several
games at USC,'' Thompson said. ``But this was special. He's sort of
like one of those Jordanesque-type players. Today, I watched the
details: He was blocking, on the fumble he was all the way in the
end zone and sprinted upfield to recover the ball. I was definitely
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was more familiar with Johnson, the human being. She
was not surprised by the storm he has caused with comments about
the team, his teammates, coaches and the news media. Many turned
out to be accurate, if unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very energetic, a very personable person,'' she said.
``He's just very honest. Sometimes the truth might not be so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Jets fans were delirious with joy, the barbs, the
criticism seemed far, far away. The bottom line was that Johnson
pulled the Jets closer to the top of a mountain that two seasons
ago seemed unconquerable. He did it with an all-around performance
that revealed a level of resolve that had to win over his most
vehement critics. Johnson is not the graceful swan-type receiver
who soars and glides. He is an angular, indomitable presence, who
has often been crowded by scrutiny and critics.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Johnson earned just a little more elbow room. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ All signs indicated Sunday that the Senate's
fragile agreement on how to conduct President Clinton's impeachment
trial faces serious obstacles, including a potential showdown over
whether to expand the case by permitting testimony by several
``Jane Does'' who have made claims about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the president's lawyers prepared to meet a noon deadline
Monday to file a written defense to the impeachment charges, key
players sparred over several major questions the Senate left
unanswered last week in its compromise blueprint for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the disputes, ranging from the possible Jane Doe
witnesses to whether the Senate's deliberations as jurors should be
open to public scrutiny, must be resolved before Clinton's fate is
ultimately decided, possibly in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the controversy, the White House announced that Clinton
intends to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress next
week, despite calls from members of both parties to postpone the
annual speech until after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of being diverted from addressing the
issues that are important to the country,'' said James Kennedy, a
White House spokesman. He said Clinton will deliver the address on
Tuesday night, Jan. 19, as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Under a tentative trial plan, Clinton would deliver the address
the same day his lawyers give opening statements to rebut charges
that the president lied under oath to a federal grand jury and
obstructed justice to try to conceal an extramarital affair in the
White House with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House ``managers,'' or prosecutors, who must file a written
brief by 5 p.m. Monday and respond to Clinton's brief by noon on
Wednesday, are scheduled to begin their opening arguments Thursday
at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would debate pretrial motions on Wednesday, but
neither side would say Sunday what motions, if any, they plan to
file. The motions must be filed Monday by 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 13 House managers who will present the case
against Clinton argued Sunday that it is crucial to compel Lewinsky
and perhaps the purported Jane Does to testify in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a South Carolina Republican,
cited a 1997 civil deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
harassment suit, in which Clinton said, ``I've never sexually
harassed anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some women out there who, if you believe them, would
make that a lie,'' Graham said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``If a
witness meets the criteria to help us explain that this is about a
persuasive, all-encompassing obstruction case, then I think, yes,
we should have the right to call any witnesses before the Senate
that can show that there's a pattern of obstruction of justice
here. This is very much the essence of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats oppose calling witnesses, particularly the Jane
Does, whose claims were never aired in the House impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bipartisan deal reached last week to conduct the trial,
the Senate would vote later this month on whether to grant the
House request for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But the compromise also provides for the witness vote to follow
a likely motion to dismiss the charges, which would make the
witness question moot if the charges were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a moderate Republican,
said Sunday he will oppose a motion to dismiss the charges and
support the House request to subpoena witnesses. ``I do believe
some witnesses will have to be called,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, who meets regularly with three other GOP moderates from
New England whom Democrats would need to help them dismiss the
charges later this month, all but closed the door on the
possibility. ``I think that we want to hear this case out,'' he
said, ``and I think I'd be surprised if a motion to dismiss at that
early stage prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several House managers said they plan to seek testimony from
Lewinsky and as many as nine other witnesses. They said the list
may include Kathleen Willey, who claimed Clinton groped her near
the Oval Office in 1993, and a woman identified as ``Jane Doe
Number 5'' in a report by the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote in the Starr report says Jane Doe Number 5 signed an
affidavit on Jan. 2, 1998, in which she denied that Clinton made
``unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies.'' The
footnote adds: ``On April 8, 1998, however, Jane Doe Number 5
stated to Office of Independent Counsel investigators that this
affidavit was false.''
</P>
<P>
   Although senators in both parties said they will prevent the
trial from becoming a sexually graphic spectacle, they remained
sharply divided over the need for witnesses, even Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Monica Lewinsky can add one iota of additional
information,'' said the Senate Democratic leader, Thomas A.
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans expressed strong support for calling
witnesses, increasing the likelihood the issue will be resolved on
a party-line vote, as was nearly every dispute in the highly
contentious House proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it is hard to have a trial without witnesses,''
said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who is chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But if the trial drags on because witnesses are subpoenaed,
``all bets are off'' on maintaining bipartisanship, said Senator
John B. Breaux of Louisiana, the chief deputy whip for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one Democrat already appeared to have abandoned the
bipartisan spirit. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa called the House case
against Clinton ``a sham and a pile of dung.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch accused Harkin of ``really denigrating the process.''
</P>
<P>
   If those kinds of sentiments surface in the Senate's final
deliberations, the public would not see them under the current
rules, which require the talks to be held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin plans to file a motion to open the deliberations, a
change that would require the approval of a two-thirds majority, or
67 senators. ``The best political disinfectant is sunshine,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who is
chairman of the Rules Committee, predicted the deliberations would
remain private. ``We are much better able to . . . reach
compromises when we are not under the glare of the camera,''
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's State of the Union address, the timing even
divided such close Democratic allies as California Senators Dianne
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said it would be ``almost schizophrenic'' for senators
to sit in judgment of Clinton during the day and watch him address
the nation that night.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said: ``The people deserve to hear from their president. I
hope he will go on and do it.''

GORE PLANS TO OUTLINE PLAN TO FIGHT URBAN SPRAWL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration will outline plans
Monday to fight urban sprawl and ease traffic congestion by
boosting federal spending on open-space land purchases,
transportation programs, and regional planning by $1 billion or
more next year, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will ask Congress to fund the plans when he
submits his budget on Feb. 1 for the next fiscal year. Vice
President Al Gore will discuss details of the proposals in a speech
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is all but certain to run for president in 2000, has
said communities that become more ``livable'' and less congested
will have the economic advantage of attracting more businesses and
workers. The November elections revealed signs of public support
for similar programs, as state and local ballots included 200
measures aimed at preserving watersheds, parks, farmland, and other
open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   According to White House aides, Gore will announce plans to seek
$700 million over five years, including about $125 million next
year, to allow cities and towns to issue bonds to protect parks,
wetlands, or farmland threatened by development. Communities could
also issue the bonds to buy land to protect drinking water or to
clean up industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   The federal money would allow communities to issue bonds worth
$9.5 billion, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also announce plans to ask Congress for $6.1 billion
for public transit, nearly 5 percent or $300 million more than
called for under a long-term funding plan approved by Congress last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president's budget will ask for increases in a
group of transportation planning programs. They include a plan to
spend $1.6 billion next year, or $341 million more than anticipated
by Congress, to help state and local governments improve air
quality by creating new carpool lanes, bike paths, and traffic
monitoring systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton budget will request $50 million to help communities
share information from their fingerprint, sex offender, and
domestic violence offender registries, and to automate their
criminal history records. The budget will also call for $50 million
to support regional planning projects that involve multiple cities
or towns, and for $10 million in competitive grants for communities
that want to include more citizens in their planning process for
building new schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also announce plans to ask Congress for nearly $40
million to help communities buy new mapping software that the
administration considers to be an important tool in regional
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Known in the White House as Gore's ``livable communities
agenda,'' some elements of the proposal have not been settled.
Aides said the total price tag would be close to $1 billion and
possibly as much as $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, as much as $3 billion a year had been proposed but
drew opposition from the White House Office of Management and
Budget, which considered it too extravagant, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Tracie Seder-Hines of Waltham, who is working on open-space
issues in Eastern Massachusetts, will take part in Gore's
presentation Monday, a White House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The next fiscal year does not start until October, but Congress
will begin work on the budget shortly after Clinton submits it next
month.

FOR STATUS' SAKE, KEEP FRANCIONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The suitors are calling and, frankly,
they're getting more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, it was Colorado. Last month, Iowa and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a college football coaching vacancy, especially since
the Sun Bowl, and I'll show you Dennis Franchione's name somewhere
on the must-be-interviewed list.
</P>
<P>
   For TCU, this is flattering, but the university would be wise
not to make Fran the February foldout in the alumni magazine.
</P>
<P>
   TCU can't let Franchione get away. It needs to move more than
quickly to place Fran under contractual lock-and-key.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Boulder, Colo., over the weekend prompted
Franchione's name to surface yet again. Boy-wonder, self-extoller
Rick Neuheisel, after four seasons, took the money and ran to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Neuheisel's last two regular seasons in Boulder, he was
12-10. But that didn't stop the Huskies from offering Neuheisel a
seven-year deal at $1.5 million per year, plus a big house.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll get to the numbers later. Speculation began almost
immediately in Colorado that the Buffs might be interested in
interviewing Franchione, Gary Barnett of Northwestern, Sonny Lubick
of Colorado State and Gerry DiNardo of LSU.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Sun Bowl might prove to be a lot more
expensive to TCU than it ever dreamed. You get this vision of
athletic directors around the country seeing the Sun Bowl score
flash on their TV screens and saying, as they reach for a pencil,
``Hmm. And what exactly is the name of that TCU coach?''
</P>
<P>
   The interest is richly deserved. It is hard to imagine how, week
in and week out, any coach in the country could have done a better
job of getting his team ready to play. And he did it all while
redshirting 20 underclassmen and without a blue-ribbon quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He is a bright and decent man, well-liked by his players, though
they were coming off an esteem-draining 1-10 season. He seems to be
exactly the kind of person that TCU needs running its football
program.
</P>
<P>
   But there's the catch. Franchione has been with the Horned Frogs
only one season _ and a 6-5 season, at that. And now the school is
forced to make a decision that might affect the next eight to 10
years _ at no small expense.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's base salary is around $300,000, with added perks
that reportedly bring it to the $450,000 range. Based on the recent
deals signed by Mack Brown at Texas and Hal Mumme at Kentucky,
Franchione would not be out of line in asking for an eight-year,
$6.5-million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the TCU administration not have much choice, it
had better act quickly. Operators at Colorado _ and who knows where
else? _ are standing by.
</P>
<P>
   To lose Franchione would send a distressing signal to Frogs fans
and recruits. Picture the image left at Tulane, where a 12-0 record
wasn't enough to keep Tommy Bowden from bolting to Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   TCU wants to be a football destination, not just another truck
stop. It already faces the stigma of being a football orphan,
abandoned twice in the past two conferences to which it belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, now that the New Year's Eve champagne and euphoria from
beating USC have worn off, the Frogs are still at the same
crossroads. They need to keep their football coach, and they need
to find a new league.
</P>
<P>
   That explosion you saw over University Drive last week wasn't
the chemistry lab. That was TCU basketball coach Billy Tubbs,
learning that the Western Athletic Conference still doesn't have a
TV contract or an automatic NCAA bid and that the league tournament
is probably going to be held in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Gee. Why not Fresno, when you get right down to it?
</P>
<P>
   When the next round of conference realignment comes _ and people
are waiting for Notre Dame to start the line of dominoes _ TCU
wants to be brandishing the image of a big-time football and
basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs stands as a neon emblem of TCU's commitment. And so could
Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   TCU can't let him get away. A big-time program calls for a
big-time splash. If their dreams are real, TCU administrators can't
be scared to offer Franchione a Mumme-sized contract, nor shy about
blabbing the financial details afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Be quick, Frogs. Operators are standing by.

THE WORRY FOR JONES IS FINDING A REAL TEST
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ With few viable opponents on the horizon, Roy
Jones Jr. may want to consider another sport. Bowling perhaps. He
is halfway there anyway. His promoter, Murad Muhammad, sets up
opponents and Jones knocks them down. Replace the human pins with
wooden ones, and Jones will have nearly completed the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he dispatched Richard Frazier, a 39-year-old New
York City police officer who was the No. 1 contender for Jones'
World Boxing Council light heavyweight title, here last Saturday
night, opponents were lining themselves up for Jones. The postfight
news conference at the Pensacola Civic Center was more like a
boisterous fraternity mixer than an opportunity for reporters to
talk to Jones about his second-round technical knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Collins had traveled from Ireland to declare his desire to
fight Jones. David Telasco, his hair cascading down on his
shoulders, kept screaming that Jones was ducking him. But Michael
Nunn, another would-be opponent, was conspicuous by his silence. In
this case silence could be golden, because Jones, the cash cow of
the light heavyweight division, hates loudmouths who try to berate
him into matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered this man a fight last winter,'' Jones said of
Telasco. ``He said he wasn't ready for the fight. If he had taken
the fight then, I wouldn't be dealing with this garbage now. He had
his shot. He missed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier was not left standing on the dock. He took a ride worth
$350,000. But his presence in the ring against a world-class boxer
like Jones left many people wondering how he even got to the pier.
Frazier's promoter, Don King, and his manager, Grant Phillips,
finagled Frazier into the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was indeed ready to fight Telasco, but all of a sudden
Frazier popped up as the mandatory WBC challenger. Jones had to
take the fight against Frazier or risk losing his WBC title belt.
To compound matters, the World Boxing Association sanctioned the
bout against Frazier, but does not believe that Jones has satisfied
its requirement for a mandatory defense. Its No. 1 contender is
Dario Matteoni.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones, who wants to keep both his titles and fight a
unification bout against Reggie Johnson, the International Boxing
Federation champion, is stuck with another bowling match against
Matteoni. And HBO, which has an exclusive contract with Jones and
broadcast the Jones-Frazier match last Saturday night, is faced
with broadcasting another Jones mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said he was not able to determine just how good Jones is
because the bout was stopped so soon by referee Armando Garcia.
Jones had knocked Frazier down in the first round with a glancing
right hand, although Frazier said he slipped on an advertising sign
on the ring apron. So Jones clipped Frazier again in the second
round, catching him with a left to the temple that sent Frazier
down on his back with his legs raised in the air. Frazier got up to
beat the 10 count, but Garcia felt that Frazier could not continue
and stopped the bout at 2 minutes 59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Frazier said. ``I came to fight. I
had a game plan to fight and I was never able to get into it. I
think it was stopped too early. He wasn't hurting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from a television replay, it did appear that Garcia
stopped the fight too soon. But he probably saved Frazier from a
severe beating and the viewing audience from having to sit through
a once-sided 12-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said he will take a few days off from his job at the
26th Police Precinct in Harlem, in New York City, and then continue
to train for his next bout. Who knows, he could be the IBF's No. 1
contender next week.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Mosley, the IBF lightweight champion, was also in a
mismatch of sorts. But his opponent, Golden Johnson, lasted longer
than Frazier did against Jones. Mosley knocked Johnson out at 2:59
of the seventh round. Mosley dropped Johnson four times in the bout
_ three times with body shots. The final body shot sent Johnson
down to one knee and he stayed there for the count of 10. A former
short-order cook, Johnson had had his fill of Mosley chopping on
his ribs with left hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley's list of future opponents is not nearly as dreary as
Jones'. There is talk that Mosley could step into the ring against
Ivan Robinson, who fought two memorable bouts against Arturo Gatti
last year. Mosley would also like to unify the lightweight division
with bouts against the other world champions: Cesar Bazan, the WBA
champion, and Jean Baptiste Mendy, the WBC champion.

IT'S ALL JESSE VENTURA'S FAULT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NBA fans breathlessly await Michael Jordan's
decision: Will he return to play one more year?
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who have more important issues: Will he
run for president in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   With a Web site that can be called both super-official looking
and very superficial, the Draft Michael Jordan for President
campaign (http://www.mj2000.org/) and its registration counterpart
(http://www.stradigi.com/mjforum.htm) would be one the best pieces
of parody going on the Internet. Except, unfortunately, it's deadly
serious.
</P>
<P>
   They state the site is ``paid for by MJ2000'' and ``is not
authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.'' So Jordan
doesn't know about it, probably. Which is why it's there _ to get
enough people to fill out survey forms so the results can be sent
to Jordan to make him ``think seriously about running'' for the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hesitate about giving out credit-card information on the
Web? Giving out personal information to those organizing this site
should be more frightful.
</P>
<P>
   Since they won't take Political Action Committee (PAC) money,
they're signing up volunteers and soliciting contributions. A $23
pledge gets you an ``Air Force 2000'' membership certificate, an
``I Like Mike'' bumper sticker, one straw-poll vote for MJ's
running mate (how about Bugs Bunny?) and your contribution will be
``acknowledged'' on the MJ2000 Web site. Just so you know this is
well intentioned, they only accept contributions up to $100, which,
if so inclined, gets you all of the above plus a coffee mug and
bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the site makes itself useful by including a
link to the Rock The Vote site (www.rockthevote.org) so you can get
registered.
</P>
<P>
   If only Bill Bradley had this kind of enthusiastic support.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!No cherry-picking allowed: Online auction site eBay
(http://www.ebay.com) will end bids today at noon on several
historic home run balls it has to dangle out there from Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Henry Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum bid of $100,000 is required for offers on McGwire's
70th home-run ball and Sosa's 66th, both hit last year, as is
Aaron's 755th, the last of his career. You can't register today _
that had to be done last week, with proof from a financial
institution that you had the juice to back it up. Nor going to the
special page (http://pages.ebay.com/aw/homerun-ball.html) can you
watch the scramble since, to protect privacy, neither the bidders
nor the amounts bid are displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The top three bidders on each item, as well as other home run
balls from McGwire and Sosa, will be notified shortly before the
Guernsey auction house starts its live auction Tuesday in New York.
Their bids will be used as starting prices and they can continue
bidding by proxy on the Internet against those at the auction in
person. &QL;

JETS FANS EXULT AFTER A DECADES-LONG VIGIL
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ At the pre-game tailgate parties in the
Giants Stadium parking lot, the New York Jets fans were intoxicated
Sunday, some on beer, many others on a home game at long last in
January.
</P>
<P>
   They have suffered so long. Not since 1991 have the Jets made
the playoffs. Under Coach Rich Kotite in 1995 and '96, the
franchise hit an all-time low with a combined 4-28 record.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The Jets are one victory from the Super Bowl after
their 34-24 victory Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   The fans came from the East End of Long Island, eastern New York
and eastern Pennsylvania and elsewhere. And Sunday all those cold,
empty, painful afternoons were forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Demorest Knapp, 60, was a fan when the team was known as the New
York Titans of the American Football League. He was in Miami for
the Super Bowl victory over the Baltimore Colts in '69. He was
there for all the losing, for the move from Shea Stadium, in
Queens, to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an ordeal,'' said Knapp, who makes the
two-hour commute from Shoreham on Long Island for every home game.
``In those years, I've gone from heaven to New Jersey. Now I'm
almost back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot before the game, Jason Freewell demonstrated
his joy by trying to do a backflip off his pickup truck. (He could
not.) Allen Johnson's lips looked blue as he partied in the parking
lot, his naked torso painted green.
</P>
<P>
   At the kickoff, Brian Thompson, 42, was in his seat, his lips
wrapped around a wine skin. The first play went for 17 yards; it
looked as if Bad Luck would get no playing time. But after 30
miserable years, you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Six plays later, a touchdown pass from Vinny Testaverde to
Keyshawn Johnson had the fans bubbling about a trip to Denver for
next Sunday's American Football Conference Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine it, you just can't,'' said Thompson, a New
Jersey native who has never had much to root for. He does not like
baseball, or understand the lure of hockey, and the football
Giants, well, ``those guys belong to the cigar smiling button-up
types who drink Scotch at halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 78,000 Jets fans here, and a handful of
Jacksonville fans. Two of those poor souls were showered with beer,
and it froze in the 26-degree air.
</P>
<P>
   The second half became a blur as a group of men from Queens
watched it through the bottoms of their plastic beer cups: a
Checker cab mechanic, Lou Pepe, 31; a glazier, Matt Aurigemma, 31;
a mailman, Mike Laruccia, 31, and a police officer, Paul Notholt,
35, all sat in the top tier of the western end zone. It is where
the fanatics sit.
</P>
<P>
   A fumble occurred in the fourth quarter and Laruccia screamed,
``Hold the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 31-24, the Jets lined up for a field goal with 24
seconds left. Aurigemma chewed on his tongue as if it were a piece
of beef jerky.
</P>
<P>
   The kick went up. The kick was good. Jets 34, Jaguars, 24.
</P>
<P>
   Aurigemma disappeared under a pile. ``I'm buying the drinks,''
he screamed. ``I'm buying the drinks.''

BAGHDADI, PARTNER IN EGYPT'S 1952 COUP, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abdel-Latif Baghdadi, an energetic Egyptian air force officer
who helped Gamal Abdel Nasser oust Egypt's last sovereign, King
Farouk, in 1952 and then held key posts in Nasser's government,
died late Friday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   He was hospitalized on Friday for complications from liver
cancer, said The Associated Press, which reported his death on
Saturday. Where he died and where he resided at the time of his
death were not immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdadi, who rose to the rank of wing commander in the air
force, worked closely with Nasser, an Egyptian army officer who
headed the Free Officers movement that overthrew King Farouk.
Nasser held power through the 12-member Revolutionary Command
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdadi, known as a hard worker who got things done quickly,
was a leading member of the council and was long believed to be
next to Nasser in authority.
</P>
<P>
   The French author Jean Lacouture once called Baghdadi ``a robust
manager'' who lacked ``stature comparable to Nasser's.''
</P>
<P>
   A state funeral for Baghdadi was held Sunday in a Cairo suburb.
The ceremonies were attended by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
and other high government figures. On Saturday, Mubarak issued a
statement saying that Baghdadi had ``served his country with
devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghdadi was born in Lower Egypt late in 1917 and excelled at
Egypt's military academy and its air force academy. After the
revolution, in 1953, he became president of a court that tried
prerevolutionary political figures. He was also minister of war in
1953 and 1954, speaker of the Egyptian republic's first Parliament
in 1957, and a vice president from 1958 to 1961 of the short-lived
United Arab Republic, formed by the union of Egypt with Syria.
Other posts he held included minister of planning in the early
1960s and vice president in a presidential council _ which advised
Nasser _ for a period ending in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   After policy differences with Nasser, who became Egypt's
longtime strongman and the first president of Egypt _ from 1956 to
1970 _ Baghdadi left Nasser's government in 1964 and disappeared
into the political shadows.
</P>
<P>
   He fell out with Nasser largely over Egypt's involvement in
Yemen's civil war, which Baghdadi called ``Nasser's Vietnam.''
Baghdadi wanted a more circumspect policy of ``Egypt first.'' The
two men are said to have reconciled before Nasser died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Baghdadi and nine other Egyptians who had been
prominent earlier in the government sent a note to Anwar el-Sadat,
who succeeded Nasser as president, criticizing the Sadat government
for ``over-dependence on the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about Baghdadi's survivors was not immediately
available.

`DILBERT' CREATOR GETS DOWN TO THE BUSINESS OF ANIMATED SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There's more than a little irony in a
television network's seeking salvation from a guy who got rich
poking fun at big business. But if Scott Adams, creator of the
``Dilbert'' phenomenon, can reverse the fortunes of UPN, the
bespectacled hero of cubicle-bound working grunts may replace
Leonardo DiCaprio as king of the world, at least on the Good Ship
UPN.
</P>
<P>
   Though teensy-weensy by network standards, UPN qualifies as a
substantial corporate entity by any benchmark. Launched four years
ago at about the same time as its main rival, The WB, it is a
cooperative venture of BHC Communications (a unit of Chris-Craft
Industries Inc.) and Paramount Television Stations Group (a
subsidiary of Viacom Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   But aside from ``Star Trek: Voyager'' and a couple of other
shows, UPN has a lot of stink bombs that nobody watches. At the
moment, it loses more money in a week than, say, Mike Holmgren will
make in a year as an employee of Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen.
Lacking a high-tech tycoon's billions, UPN is hoping a low-tech
former bank teller/computer programmer/phone company engineer will
show it the way to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he senses no desperation among UPN executives, no
indication that the jig is up if its new animated ``Dilbert''
series doesn't do for UPN what ``The Simpsons'' did for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just working on the show,'' Adams said, ``and if it's
good, good things will happen for everybody involved, and that's
all we can concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams gets to see his creation come alive Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   More sound sound bites from the ``Dilbert'' creator:
</P>
<P>
   On why Dilbert looks the way he does: ``It's for more simple
reasons than you'd think. I'm just a really bad artist.''
</P>
<P>
   On the corporate world of TV: ``Nothing down here is like the
real world. `Dilbert' exists because it's about common experiences
exaggerated. ... Everything down here starts out exaggerated and
gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   On his effect on corporate America: ``The only effect that I
hear about is that people use the comic strip to mock their boss.
... You clip it out and slide it under the door and run away, kind
of like putting the poop in the flaming bag on the porch.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS anchor Dan Rather heads the new ``Sixty Minutes II'' team,
which goes into action Wednesday. But even though he's 67 and the
managing editor of ``CBS Evening News,'' Rather knows his place.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there might be some spirited competition for juicy
stories with the members of the venerable Sunday version of ``60
Minutes,'' Rather said: ``Here's the way it works. Mike Wallace
gets what he wants. ... The ones he doesn't want to do or doesn't
know about, then the rest of us have the right to squabble over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rather's new teammates is longtime CBS correspondent Bob
Simon, a regular contributor to the Sunday show who is
comparatively boyish by ``60 Minutes'' standards. Only 57, Simon
said, ``For the last several years, my two favorite places in the
world have been `60 Minutes' and the nursing home where my
father-in-law stays, because they're the only places where I'm
occasionally called `young man.'''
</P>
<P>
   We say we want more channels, but will we actually watch them?
According to ABC's research department, when a household has 26 to
30 channels, the average number of channels watched is 11.3. When
the choices are 71 channels and above, the average number of
channels watched increases to only 15.3.

VIKINGS SPRINT INTO THE NFC TITLE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Jake Plummer's first four passes in the biggest
game of his life were something out of a nightmare. Passes No. 1
and No. 2: badly overthrown incompletions. Pass No. 3: a
beautifully thrown ball to Minnesota safety Robert Griffith.
Plummer, the Arizona quarterback, liked Griffith so much, he found
him again on the next series on his fourth pass.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer would recover from his disastrous start and Arizona's
minus-1 yard of total offense in the first quarter Sunday _ the
only place to go after that kind of start is up _ but it would be
too late. Minnesota took a second-quarter lead of 17-0, and then a
halftime lead of 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, the comeback kid, had the Vikings right where he wanted
them, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Playing the Vikings is like being in the Olympic
200-meter sprint, with Minnesota the equivalent of Michael Johnson.
For an opponent to have any chance of winning, staying close early
is a necessity; otherwise, on this slick artificial turf, the
Vikings will blow past as if they are on jet-propelled roller
skates.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota beat the Cardinals, 41-21, before 63,760 at the
Metrodome and advanced to the National Conference title game
against Atlanta because the Vikings were again successful with
their three-pronged formula: smart coaching, speed and big plays.
</P>
<P>
   The smart coaching came when the Vikings used 15 different
formations in their first 15 plays, adding brilliant wrinkles like
a direct snap to running back David Palmer with quarterback Randall
Cunningham playing decoy wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The speed was evident in a defense that smothered Plummer,
chasing him all over the field. At times he looked slower than the
270-pound linemen trying to ruin his day.
</P>
<P>
   The big plays? Where else: Randy Moss, the Vikings' Pro Bowl
wide receiver, beat Aeneas Williams, the Cardinals' Pro Bowl
cornerback, for a 45-yard completion in the second quarter. That
play led to Minnesota's second touchdown, a 15-yard pass from
Cunningham to tight end Andrew Glover. In the third quarter, Cris
Carter caught a pass for 45 yards, leading to a 20-yard field goal
by Gary Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   With their dominating performance against Arizona, the Vikings
gave the Atlanta Falcons lots to think about when the two teams
meet here next Sunday in a game that will feature two of the best
offenses in football. But it is the Vikings that are the most
dangerous team in the conference and, perhaps, all of football.
When they are on a roll, the Vikings, who are 16-1 this season,
cannot be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's true,'' Vikings cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said.
``Once we get into our groove, playing our A-plus game, you can't
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Glover: ``In 20-something games, we've only lost once. When
we're at home, we're impossible to beat. Only the Vikings can truly
beat the Vikings.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota players are not being cocky with those statements _
they are factual. This team is built so that if the offense gets
ahead, the defense comes hard, as it did against Plummer, who
completed 23 of 41 passes for 242 yards, and the two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And the Vikings' offense always seems to get ahead because it
has more weapons than any other team in the league. Beyond Moss
(four catches for 73 yards), Carter (five catches for 82 yards) and
Cunningham (17 of 27 for 236 yards and three touchdowns), there are
other weapons in the arsenal. Robert Smith had 19 carries for 124
yards, a post-season team rushing record. Glover had several key
catches. Fullback Leroy Hoard had touchdown runs of one, 16 and six
yards, becoming the first Viking to score three touchdowns in a
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we couldn't stop their offense,'' Arizona safety
Tommy Bennett said. ``If you can't stop the run, it opens up the
pass. They have four outstanding receivers. Cunningham has a lot of
go-to guys, and it's hard to stop all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The place-kicker Mitch Berger had five touchbacks, breaking Fred
Cox's team playoff record of three against Dallas in 1973. Those
kicks into the end zone were important because Arizona's Eric
Metcalf, one of the game's most dangerous return men, did not
become a huge factor.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer tried to revive the Cardinals, but he was too excited
early and bothered by the crowd noise. ``It was loud, you know, it
was a different situation,'' he said. ``We have not been in a
situation this loud. The first interception was a case of me being
young and hyped up and wanting to make a big play when I should
have been patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times Plummer wanted to check with the offensive
coordinator Marc Trestman about changing a play, but Plummer could
not hear what Trestman was saying, even though Trestman's voice was
piped into Plummer's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer still made the game interesting in the third quarter. He
cut the score to 24-14 after leading the Cardinals on an 80-yard,
14-play drive. Plummer was 7 of 8 passing for 57 yards during the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Minnesota's turn. The Vikings scored on Anderson's
20-yard field goal, and after Plummer fumbled a snap that was
recovered by Antonio Banks at the Arizona 20-yard line, Cunningham
went to Moss on a crossing pattern in the end zone for a 2-yard
score.
</P>
<P>
   In less than six minutes, the Vikings had scored 10 points to
take a 34-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a week of speculation about whether the Falcons can
stop perhaps the best offensive football team ever. The Cardinals,
with a good defense, did not come close. Arizona coach Vince Tobin,
who wore a stunned look on his face after the game, was asked if he
had just played a juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what a juggernaut is,'' he said, ``but I know one
thing, they've got a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The understatement of the week. &QL;

NEW YORK STATE TEST SETS SCHOOLS TO CRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks, the new New York state reading, writing
and listening test has spurred a frenzy of cramming more often
associated with getting into law school than with passing fourth
grade. Schools have virtually suspended their normal curriculums to
administer practice tests and help pupils brush up on concepts like
``the main idea,'' ``topic sentences'' and ``supporting details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a hurricane is coming,'' Gary Lincoff, the father of
a fourth-grade boy on Manhattan's Upper West Side, said last week,
shaking his head ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the three-day test begins Tuesday in New York
City's school districts, and most others, and while many educators
fear scores will be low, State Education Commissioner Richard Mills
said that outcome would not necessarily be a bad thing. The test is
part of a long-term state plan to shake up and transform the
education system by returning to the basics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that scores will be low,'' Mills said last week. ``The
standards are deliberately higher.'' But he added: ``These are the
basics that all fourth graders and other children need to have.
It's one of the strategies to change things for the better. I am
expecting superintendents and boards, principals and teachers to
examine these results and examine their practices and make
appropriate changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, New York has become a leader in the
national movement to establish stronger curriculums and to create
tests to measure their effectiveness. Only last week, a national
survey by Education Week magazine ranked New York first in the
country in holding students accountable to rigorous academic
standards and testing.
</P>
<P>
   The old fourth-grade test required pupils to read sentences or
short passages and fill in missing words using a list of
multiple-choice answers. The new test moves from a focus on simple
reading to an expectation that by the middle of fourth grade,
pupils can understand and write about complex passages and about
themselves, using correct spelling. This puts the test at odds with
much of progressive-education theory and the whole-language
movement, which assume that students will eventually pick up the
mechanics of writing at their own pace.
</P>
<P>
   It also puts a burden on New York City schools, which have
historically lagged behind the statewide average on basic test
scores. In addition, many city schools have been struggling to meet
the easier standards of the old test. In New York City, the failure
rate on the old test was 35 percent in 1998, compared with an
average of just 6 percent in the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a philosophical level, I think it's a good test,'' said
Robert Riccobono, superintendent of Community School District 19 in
East New York, Brooklyn, an impoverished district in which 53
percent of the pupils failed the old test in 1998, scoring at least
a year behind grade level. ``But on a practical level, it scares
the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the fourth-grade test was the first step of a drive
toward higher standards statewide. In June, fourth graders will
begin taking a new state math test, and eighth graders will begin
taking a new state math and English test.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beginning with the class of 2003, all high school students in
New York state will be required to pass five subject exams, called
Regents tests, with a score of at least 55 percent before they can
receive a diploma, said Alan Ray, a spokesman for Mills. In 1997,
only 24 percent of high school students in New York City who
graduated within four years had earned Regents diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 165, a school with a largely immigrant
population on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, information about
the skills demanded by the new test has quickly filtered throughout
all grades. Almost every class, from kindergarten on up, is filled
with exercises in spelling and grammar that once would have been
dismissed as stultifyingly old-fashioned. ``I came in with a much
more liberal, open-ended approach to things,'' said Evangeline
Avlonitis, a fourth-grade teacher. ``But I think we need to get
back to a lot of these basics.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her pupils, Jennifer Peguero, agreed. Last week her class
took a series of timed practice tests. After listening to a fable
about a miser, Jennifer had to explain the maxim ``Without wisdom,
wealth is worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer carefully wrote 17 lines, printing neatly, indenting
her two paragraphs, beginning sentences with capital letters and
ending them with punctuation marks, including two emphatic
exclamation points after the sentence ``What a selfish old man!!''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was kind of, like, stuck,'' Jennifer said. ``Now I
feel proud because I worked so hard, and what I wrote came from my
heart.''

MEMO TO ACTORS: LEARN TO MASTER THE ESSENTIALS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We like to talk about actors in terms of clean, well-lighted
oppositions. When Willa Cather was a stern, very smart young drama
critic, she compared the flamboyant (and to her narcissistic) art
of a Sarah Bernhardt with the luminously self-contained (and to her
transcendent) art of Eleanora Duse. Display vs. mystery; the force
of the lurid vs. the force of the pure.
</P>
<P>
   When Gilbert Seldes wrote about performers in his kinetically
intelligent book ``The Seven Lively Arts,'' he called the
difference between those who lose every identifiable part of
themselves in a role and those who dominate it with their
personality the difference between actors and players.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is still true. Maggie Smith is all display;
Vanessa Redgrave courts mystery. Meryl Streep is an actress; Goldie
Hawn is a player. But thinking about some of the young film
actresses getting attention, awards or awards nominations right
now, let us consider some other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   THE BODY. Yes, we've been in the age of the talking picture
since 1927, and yes, the beauty of an actor's face in close-up will
never die. Nevertheless, we need more actors who use their bodies
with total skill and utter abandon, actors (and players) who bring
a complete physical language to every role.
</P>
<P>
   Any director knows the evocative power of an object or a
landscape (a certain slant of light on a street corner, a plate of
half-eaten food on a table). How often do you feel the same power
from watching something as simple as the way an actor strikes a bed
with her leg when she is speaking?
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of Patricia Clarkson in ``High Art,'' the dark
little film written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko for which Ally
Sheedy just won a best actress award from the National Society of
Film Critics. She earned it. She is spooky, cynical, childish and
jaded all at once.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a movie about lethal entanglements. It depends on
ensemble work, and Ms. Clarkson and Radha Mitchell are uncannily
good as the two women bound up with her through heroin, sex and art
that longs to be cutting edge. When Ms. Clarkson, playing a skinny
Teutonic junkie _ a kind of sub-Marlene Dietrich, sub-Nico actress
who once worked for Fassbinder _ hits the bed with her thin,
feral-looking leg, it's as if she is saying: ``I'm spoiled. I'm in
a rage. I'm hopeless, and don't you ever forget that you are,
too.'' The gesture is as strong as anything she actually does say.
</P>
<P>
   It's a predictable cultural fact that in roles for women, social
lawlessness, sexual rebellion and emotional despair are the best
incentives for physical expressiveness. We're talking about drug
addicts, prostitutes and thieves, even spirits: not just the
actresses in ``High Art,'' but Thandie Newton as the devouring
ghost in ``Beloved'' or Courtney Love as a rabble-rousing heroin
addict in ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' and Queen Latifah as an
Uzi-loving bank robber in ``Set It Off,'' both 1996 films. (It's no
accident that Ms. Love and Queen Latifah come from the world of
rock and rap, where you don't have an act if you don't have a body
that flaunts itself as much as your voice does.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was not ever thus. What's a better medium for canny
physical abandon than comedy? It's our bad luck to be in a thin and
anxious age when it comes to film comedy. Meg Ryan is pert and
predictable enough to have come out of a little music box. Cameron
Diaz is the comic equivalent of a pleasing backup singer. Julia
Roberts needs better material. And someone should look at ``Jerry
Maguire'' and ``The Whole Wide World'' again, then start writing
full-bodied romantic comedies for Renee Zellweger. Her limbs and
nerve endings are always in readiness. When they move, they take
you by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE. Give actors a text, and some will play it with
perfect grace and propriety, while others will insist on finding
riskier ways through and into it. It's a question of rhythm,
phrasing and range. Take Gwyneth Paltrow in ``Shakespeare in Love''
and Cate Blanchett in ``Elizabeth.'' Both play women of privilege
and at least surface propriety in Elizabethan England, women who
are also at odds with conventions of power, duty and love. Ms.
Paltrow is lovely to look at and offers pleasant easy listening.
All of the notes adding up to a character are struck cleanly and
gracefully. But couldn't passion and romantic grief profit from
more daring, less awareness that one must look one's best at all
times?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett's performance is moodier and wilder; there are
rhythmic ruptures, pauses and rushes in her interpretation, which
bring darkness as well as light to her character. And don't tell me
this difference depends on the fact that ``Shakespeare'' is a
romantic comedy and ``Elizabeth'' a romantic melodrama. Romantic
comedy is supposed to be built on rhythms and emotional shifts that
take the audience as well as the other characters by surprise. We
know the basic story of Queen Elizabeth's life, and melodrama
thrives on forcefully struck emotional poses, but Ms. Blanchett
gives us the intimacies behind them and lets our feelings toward
her character keep changing.
</P>
<P>
   STILLNESS. What an underrated quality stillness is. It is partly
the ability to listen and make listening an action that has
consequences for the speaker. (Listening can seduce, soothe, repel,
enlighten or condemn, after all). And it is partly the ability to
ground a scene, to help the other actors stay aligned and
concentrated, whatever goes on.
</P>
<P>
   When an actor really knows how to be still, we feel her taking
in all the other emotions on screen and holding onto them for us,
clarifying their meaning. Think back to Susan Sarandon in in
``Thelma and Louise'' and ``Dead Man Walking.'' Return to the
present and watch Radha Mitchell as she picks her way through
cynicism and desperation in ``High Art.''
</P>
<P>
   If you savor lessons from older masters, watch Judi Dench in
``Shakespeare in Love'' and Mary Alice in ``Down in the Delta.''
And if you failed to see ``Beloved'' (you probably did), wait for
the video release, then watch the painfully acute receptivity of
Kimberly Elise as a young woman who sees so much and can do so
little.
</P>
<P>
   The actress who seems to possess these qualities in the greatest
abundance right now is Emily Watson. Watch her in Lars von Trier's
``Breaking the Waves,'' as a young Scottish woman in the grip of
religion, eros and sacrifice, or in Anand Tucker's ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' as the English cellist Jacqueline du Pre, trying first to
live with a great and burdensome talent, then with a murderous
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson is blessed to be offered and smart to choose such
good scripts and directors. (Von Trier is more than good, he is
extraordinary.) She joins her physical and vocal resources to naked
feeling in a way that is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to the willingness to push yourself into emotional
territory that may scare you as much as it scares your audience.
It's the most mysterious and the finest quality an actor can have.
Let's call it fearlessness.

JEWS CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITIC STATEMENTS BY RUSSIAN OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most are old enough to have defied Hitler, either as
Soviet soldiers or soldiers' wives. By keeping their heads down,
they survived the anti-Semitism that became government policy
during Stalin's last yers. They silently endured the subtle
discrimination against Jews that permeated modern Soviet society
and even the blossoming of overtly anti-Semitic movements during
the years of perestroika.
</P>
<P>
   Now safe in new lives in the United States, some 1,000 Jewish
immigrants from the former Soviet Union gathered Sunday in Brooklyn
to warn of a rising tide of officially tolerated anti-Semitism in
Russia that could threaten those left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you still have relatives there, have them come,'' said
Bella Zelkin, the community liaison for the New York Association
for New Americans, one of more than a dozen New York City Jewish
and Russian organizations that called the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The situation, she said, resembles the atmosphere in Eastern
Europe during the rise of Nazism in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who say, `It's not affecting me personally' are
like those who were holding on before the war,'' Ms. Zelkin said.
``They all were killed. The ones who closed their eyes and went
ahead and got out, they survived.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last few months, prominent figures in the Russian
Communist Party have joined nationalist politicians in openly
blaming their country's troubles on Jews, specifically on people of
Jewish ancestry who have worked in the government of President
Boris Yeltsin. While Yeltsin has condemned such statements,
Communist leaders have blocked efforts to censure parliamentarians
who make statements that criticize Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that provide assistance to immigrants from the former
Soviet Union said they had not yet seen an increase in the number
of Jews seeking to emigrate in response to the political atmosphere
in Russia. The exact number of Jews or people of Jewish ancestry
remaining in Russia and the former Soviet republics, like Belarus
and Ukraine, is not known, but some Jewish agencies estimate the
number is somewhere around 700,000. About 400,000 Jews from the
former Soviet Union have immigrated to the New York region in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants at the gathering _ most elderly and bent by
arthritis, some wearing rows of faded World War II military medals
on their coats _ demanded that the United Nations, the White House
and Congress respond more forcefully to those officials responsible
for making or tolerating anti-Semitic statements.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution drawn up by the organizers of the meeting said
Russian political figures who fail to condemn anti-Semitism, like
Gennadi Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, should not be
allowed to enter the United States. The resolution also calls for
linking American aid to Russia to its observance of religious
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned a lesson from the past,'' said Leonid Stonov,
president of the American Association of Jews From the Former USSR,
at the standing-room-only gathering in the heavily Russian Brighton
Beach section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of the lesson was 6 million lives.''

JAGUARS LIKE JETS' BALL CONTROL AND THEIR CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Having upset the Denver Broncos two
years ago, the Jacksonville Jaguars know what it's like to win a
playoff game at Mile High Stadium. After losing Sunday to the New
York Jets, 34-24, several Jaguars said they liked the Jets' chances
against the Broncos in next weekend's American Football Conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think the Jets can beat them,'' said offensive
tackle Tony Boselli, whose Jaguars won at Denver, 30-27, two years
ago but lost, 37-24, in the 1998 regular season. ``The Broncos are
beatable, there's no doubt in my mind. We played pretty good today,
especially in the second half, and the Jets still held us off. I
think the Jets are playing with a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Kevin Hardy said the Jets' offense could make it hard
on the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hold the ball in Denver for as long as they did
against us today,'' Hardy said, ``it would be hard for anyone to
beat them. Denver is good, but I'm not going to count the Jets out.
You've got to stop them and get them off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``At all the crucial times, we couldn't stop the Jets. They
moved the ball up and down the field all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin would not take sides in the
Jets-Broncos matchup, but he recognized in the Jets a self-assured
team playing a dominating style of football. And Coughlin praised
the Jets' coaching staff, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out in the first half and were almost
mistake-free,'' Coughlin said. ``That's when they took some control
of the game. They had a fumble, but they converted seven of nine
third downs in the first half. That's a good football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second quarter, we couldn't get the ball back from
them.'' The Jaguars had the ball just 51 seconds in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat them, you have to stop them,'' Coughlin said. ``I was
standing there saying, `Somebody stop them.' And we couldn't. Their
offensive balance gives them a tough attack to stop. They prove
they can run it, and then they throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's also a good bunch of coaches. They prepare well. They
showed us a number of new things today. We adjusted, but there were
some new wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor, the Jaguars' star running back, rushed for 86 yards
on 20 carries, but he had just 26 yards on nine first-half carries
as the Jets sprinted to a 17-0 lead. Taylor said the Jets would
probably have to do something similar against Broncos running back
Terrell Davis to win next Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets today didn't give up many big plays on the ground,''
Taylor said. ``They cut you off before you could cut back. They'll
probably try to do the same thing against Denver. If they can get a
big lead like they did today, maybe they can make Denver
one-dimensional. That's what they did to us for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Jaguars, however, liked the Jets' chances in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give the Broncos the advantage,'' cornerback Dave
Thomas said. ``Whenever you can run the football as well as Denver
runs the football, you have the edge. The Jets played well, but
they had an advantage on us today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were well-rested and you could tell. We came out a little
flat and made mistakes. Plus, Denver will have its crowd with them.
Playing at home always helps.''  &QL;

DUVAL PADS HIS REPUTATION AS THE WORLD'S BEST GOLFER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ He dominated this weekend. He has been the PGA
Tour's biggest winner over the last 15 months. And after watching
David Duval win Sunday for the eighth time in his last 27 starts,
even more of his peers were convinced that Duval is the world's
best player.
</P>
<P>
   Duval played at a different level during the season-opening
Mercedes Championships, as the rest of the field played for second
place. Starting today's final round with a five-shot lead, Duval
was never threatened. People wondered not whether Duval would win,
but by how much he would win.
</P>
<P>
   So as Duval began 1999 with a virtuoso performance, others
marveled at a player who keeps adding to both his reputation and
his bank account. Shooting a final-round five-under-par 68, Duval
finished at 26 under for the tournament (266) and cruised to a
nine-stroke victory at the Kapalua Plantation Course, well ahead of
Mark O'Meara and Billy Mayfair, who tied for second place at
17-under 275.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's current winning pace is the best since Nick Price won
nine events in 15 months during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. By
winning, Duval opened the season by winning the $468,000
first-place check, plus a new Mercedes-Benz SL 500 roadster. There
are worse ways to spend a week in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   But while Duval will surely enjoy the car and the money, nothing
seems to alter his determination to be the best player he can be.
And many are convinced he is already the best there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's no question he's the best in the world,''
said Fred Funk, who finished tied for fifth place. ``I really don't
think David feels pressure anymore. He's just going to beat you
with pure talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at his game, there's absolutely no weaknesses.
He's tremendously long, he's tremendously straight, a great iron
player, great wedge player, really good chipper, and a really good
putter. He's in a different league.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour's opening event featured an elite 30-man field, limited
to players who won at least once last year. By winning Sunday,
Duval became the first player to qualify for next year's Mercedes
Championships, but Duval has bigger goals in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Since winning his first event at the 1997 Michelob Championship
at Kingsmill in Williamsburg, Va., his appetite for victory has
been insatiable. Duval won his final three starts in 1997, he won
four events in 1998, he won last year's money title, and he started
this year by picking up where he left off. A major championship is
the biggest piece missing from Duval's resume, but tying for second
place at last year's Masters only made Duval hungrier to achieve
that goal. And in the meantime, he seems intent on winning as much
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously playing quite well,'' said Duval, in an early
candidate for the understatement of the year. ``Poor shots or
mis-hits never really enter your mind. The confidence just kind of
feeds on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case all weekend, as Duval showed the completeness
and coolness that make him so consistent. Duval rarely hits poor
shots, and it is more rare for him to lose his temper. While Duval
is one of the game's longest hitters, he spends more time working
on his short game, intent on saving strokes even when he makes a
mistake. Duval makes the game look easy, but his talent is the
residue of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the off season, all I ever do is hit 50 or 100 balls a
day, then I chip, hit wedges,'' said Duval. ``It can just save you.
Everybody talks about how important it is, but I don't think you
can emphasize it enough. I'm pretty handy with a wedge, and I can
putt well. So what if I have to pitch out 80 yards? I have a pretty
darn good chance of getting up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara shot a five-under-par 68 Sunday, while Mayfair shot a
71, but Duval turned the tournament into a runaway by shooting a 67
in the first round, tying the course record with a 63 in the second
round, and shooting a splendid 68 in the third. Funk played with
Duval in Sunday's final group, and he came away impressed, calling
Duval the best driver in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to put Greg Norman in that category, but he's longer
than Norman, and just as straight,'' said Funk of Duval. ``I think
total driving, he's probably the best in the game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of starting Sunday with a huge lead only made Duval
more relaxed. He almost lost a seven-stroke lead at Tucson, Ariz.,
in the final round last year, falling into a tie with Justin
Leonard, before winning by a stroke. But Duval learned from that
experience, just as he seems to learn from everything. ``I feel
more comfortable in that position now,'' said Duval. ``Actually, I
wish I could have led by more.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval will not play at the Sony Hawaiian Open this week, and he
plans to take a week off to go skiing and snowboarding in Idaho. It
was a vacation well earned. And it was an impressive start to the
new year for a player who only seems to get better.

LADY VOLS END CONNECTICUT'S REIGN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Connecticut had floated above the women's
college basketball universe for almost two months. Since the middle
of November, the Huskies woke up each day knowing that they were
the top-ranked team in the country. At least technically.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Huskies rampaged past opponents by an average of 40
points, they understood that their ranking would really be
validated by defeating Tennessee. That luscious opportunity finally
came Sunday. Time for UConn to make it official by beating the
school that has won the last three national championships. Time for
UConn to throttle the No. 2 team, technically, and continue dancing
toward March.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies stumbled and staggered in the final minutes of a
captivating game and lost to the Lady Vols, 92-81, before 10,027
fans at Gampel Pavilion. UConn will not wake up on Monday morning
as the No. 1 team in the country after Semeka Randall, Chamique
Holdsclaw and Tamika Catchings combined to stop the Huskies, erase
Connecticut's 54-game home winning streak and surely swipe the top
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along that until you beat Tennessee and
beat them in March, they're the best team in the country,'' said
UConn coach Geno Auriemma. ``The only reason we were No. 1 is
because they lost their second game. We got a chance to see the No.
1 team. We stared them in the eyes for 37 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough. UConn blinked and Tennessee's eyes bulged.
With the score tied, 76-76, and a wonderful finish seemingly about
to unfold in a wonderful game, Teresa Geter made a 10-foot jumper
to put the Lady Vols ahead with 3 minutes 16 seconds remaining.
Shea Ralph could not handle a pass on UConn's next possession and
then Catchings made a huge shot by nailing a 3-pointer over a
tentative Swin Cash that widened the bulge to 81-76.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Catchings' sixth 3-pointer of the season. It
bewildered the Huskies, who never recovered as Tennessee reeled off
12 straight points and, suddenly, a tight game that had been tied
eight times had turned into another rout for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late minutes of the game, we stepped up and we made big
plays,'' said Tennessee coach Pat Summitt. ``In order to win big
games, you have to make big plays. I felt we had the players who
did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Catchings (18 points) made the biggest shot of the afternoon,
but Holdsclaw and Randall split 50 points and also split time in
guiding the savvy Volunteers (13-1) over the younger Huskies
(13-1).
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, her body hunched over and her mouth slightly open,
had 10 points before the game was 4 minutes old and, unlike the
UConn guards, always played under control. Randall, who plays like
a pit bull and who was booed every time she touched the ball after
she wrestled with Svetlana Abrosimova for a rebound, celebrated
more on the court than most people do on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's emotional when she gets on the bus,'' Summitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Randall had reasons to be emotional in a game that was the
marquee contest of the women's season, a game that was nationally
televised and caused Connecticut to distribute 214 news media
credentials. That was Randall with a jumping kick that would have
made David Carradine proud after giving the Lady Vols all of a 4-2
spread. That was Randall enjoying the booing she received after
tussling with Abrosimova (11 points), who played sluggishly after
hitting her head on the floor. Ralph was also held to 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to let go and she didn't want to let go,''
Randall said of her scuffle with Abrosimova. ``We rolled over for a
few. It guess it was a WWF match.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was close to it. It was fierce, frenetic and
physical and, most of the time, it resembled a game in New York's
Greenwich Village. Summitt decided to run with the deeper Huskies
and the strategy worked. The Huskies shot just 41 percent from the
field, inexplicably missed at least 10 layups and swished five of
18 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always disappointing to lose a game at home,'' Ralph
said. ``At the same time, it's only January. We don't play here for
the national championship. Honestly, that's all we're worried
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before the game, some fans circled Gampel Pavilion
holding signs that read ``I Need Tickets.'' One man told a
desperate teen-age girl that he would sell her two tickets for
$1,000. The girl gasped and walked away. Connecticut even imported
the ring announcer Michael Buffer to introduce the Huskies and
shout, ``Let's get ready for round ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were ready, but Tennessee was a little better when it
mattered most. Stay tuned. Summitt hinted that the Lady Vols and
UConn could meet for the national title in two months. Auriemma
pondered a different script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we will get another chance to play in a game like
this in March,'' Auriemma said. ``Hopefully, someone will kick
their behind and we won't have to play them.'' &QL;

POLICE OFFICER WHO INTERROGATED BIKO IS DENIED AMNESTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating for all needing)  (ms) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ A former police officer who said he helped tackle
the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko and smash his head into a
wall when Biko was in custody in 1977 has been denied amnesty by
the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has not yet released its findings, but George
Bizos, a lawyer for the Biko family, said it had ruled that no
amnesty could be granted because the police officer had not
admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gideon Niewhoudt, and the four other officers
involved in Biko's interrogation told the commission that Biko had
attacked them after he had been forced to stand. They said they had
been defending themselves when they jumped on him.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the incident, Biko, naked, disoriented and suffering
from severe head injuries, was driven 750 miles across South Africa
for medical treatment. He died before he got any, on Sept. 12,
1977.
</P>
<P>
   His case outraged the world and helped galvanize the
anti-apartheid movement. Although an investigation at the time
cleared the police officers of any wrongdoing, it became clear that
an obviously injured Biko had spent days manacled to window bars
before dying alone on the floor of a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened to him has been an enduring secret. When
the five officers involved in his interrogation applied for amnesty
in 1996, many South Africans hoped they would finally hear a full
explanation of how Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness
Movement, had died.
</P>
<P>
   But few were satisfied with the version of events the five
police officers put forward during weeks of testimony to the Truth
Commission in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the question of whether Niewhoudt, who is in jail
for other crimes, is believable, the commission's decision focuses
on an issue that was particularly galling to the Biko family: None
of the police officers accepted blame for Biko's death or confessed
to any criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In theory the verdict leaves Niewhoudt vulnerable to criminal
prosecution. But such a prosecution seems unlikely. Legal experts
say proving intent to kill for a murder charge would be extremely
difficult. And a lesser charge of manslaughter would not be
possible because of a 20-year statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Mdu Lembede, confirmed that the commission had made
the ruling in the Niewhoudt case. It was apparently made on Dec. 15
but was not released to the public because it came as the Christmas
holidays began. Lembede said the text of the ruling would be
available on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Applications for amnesty made by the four other officers are
being considered by a different panel and are probably not ready
for decision yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has received more than 7,000 applications for
amnesty and still has many high-profile cases to deal with, like
those of the two men convicted of killing popular leader Chris Hani
on the eve of the 1994 elections, or some of the more notorious
police officers of the apartheid era. They include Col. Eugene de
Kock and Craig Williamson, who masterminded gruesome assassinations
of liberation activists.
</P>
<P>
   In general the commission has signaled its intention to forgive
rather than punish the most heinous crimes of apartheid. Among
those to have gotten amnesty is a police officer who organized a
nighttime raid on political activists that killed 11 people, most
of them women and children attending a wake.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also granted amnesty to the young men who stoned
an American student, Amy Biehl, to death in 1993 when she drove
some friends home to a black township.
</P>
<P>
   Created as a way to put South Africa's brutal past to rest, the
commission has the power to grant amnesty in return for
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   During the police officers' amnesty hearings, a few new details
about Biko's death emerged. The officers admitted they had lied
about which day Biko had received a head injury because they had
not followed regulations about seeking medical help. But they
continued to maintain that the death had been largely the result of
an interrogation gone awry because of Biko's belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   Biko's relatives have fiercely opposed amnesty for the officers,
saying after the hearings that they still did not think the truth
had come out.
</P>
<P>
   Bizos said Sunday that because the commission's ruling did not
deal with the question of whether Niewhoudt finally told the truth,
it was not wholly satisfying. But, he added, perhaps that did not
matter. ``The world's jury has already decided.'' he said.

HALF MAKES BRUINS HAPPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the second half of their victory at Oregon, the Bruins shot
43.3 percent from the field. They made two shots outside of 10
feet. They scored just 28 points, and _ get this _ they made 1 of 5
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But in one important respect it was their best half of the
season. Against a stingy man-to-man defense in a raucous arena, the
Bruins executed their halfcourt offense with unprecedented poise
and efficiency. And that, not their size or depth or athleticism,
is the most important ingredient to surviving on the rugged Pac-10
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win here in the clutch is a character-builder for the young
guys,'' said the old guy, sophomore Baron Davis, who led the Bruins
with 22 points. ``Now we can go back on the road with the same
mentality. When we go to a better place, like Stanford or Arizona,,
we've got to play halfcourt, and (Saturday) we showed we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were impatience incarnate Thursday at Oregon State,
mistaking open shots for good shots. Saturday, they played with a
``Hoosiers'' mentality _ i.e.: when coach Gene Hackman orders five
passes before a shot _ and bypassed open 15-footers to get open
five-footers.
</P>
<P>
   Of their 13 second-half field goals, nine came in the halfcourt
offense. In addition, they committed just two turnovers in the
second half. It was as close to Stanfordesque precision as UCLA is
likely to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we executed well under pressure
circumstances,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Board work: Freshman forward JaRon Rush continues to struggle
with his jumper. He made 4 of 23 shots over the weekend and was 0
of 10 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   But Rush is compensating for poor shooting with hustle _ at
Oregon, he made two diving deflections in the second half that led
to Davis baskets _ and superb rebounding. At 6-6, he has become
UCLA's most effective rebounder, averaging 10.7 in three Pac-10
games and corralling 24 rebounds in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the shots Baron and Earl (Watson) put up, somebody's
got to rebound,'' Rush said with a slight smirk. ``I put up a lot,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs and ups: Freshman big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso
typified UCLA's inconsistent weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At Oregon State, they made 1 of 13 shots (combined), grabbed 10
rebounds and scored three points. At Oregon, with improved patience
and settled nerves, they made 10 of 19 shots, grabbed 13 rebounds
and scored 20 points. Gadzuric also made the winning basket, a
tip-in of Moiso's miss with 1:28 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking too much about what I should do when I get the
ball,'' Gadzuric said of the Oregon State game.
</P>
<P>
   Calming down: Watson moved from point guard to wing guard when
Davis returned from his knee injury a month ago and the adjustment
hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Watson isn't a pure wing guard; he doesn't have the size or
shooting skills. When he plays with a scorer's mentality _ as he
did at OSU, taking 17 shots _ the offense sputters. When he waits
for opportunities in the flow of the offense, he's a solid wing
player.
</P>
<P>
   Watson played one of his most controlled games of the season at
Oregon. He did not force shots or passes, made 3 of 8 field goals
and had one turnover, matching a season low.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has committed three turnovers or less in five games this
season: Kentucky, Oklahoma State, Loyola Marymount, Arizona and
Oregon. It's no coincidence those are UCLA's five best games.
</P>
<P>
   Reason to worry: In style, if not talent or environment, the
UCLA coaches were more concerned with Oregon State than Oregon. The
Beavers employ a compact zone defense and prefer a dull, grinding
tempo _ two things that have always confounded the go-go Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``With coach (Eddie) Payne, they're so deliberate,'' Bruins
assistant Michael Holton said. ``We spent time preparing for that
and trying to do things to force the tempo.''

CONGEALED COOKING OIL LATEST HOT TICKET ON BLACK MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It is on your french fries. It is on your
burgers. It is grease, but to thieves, this goo is liquid gold.
</P>
<P>
   So significant is this crime that a new law that took effect
Jan. 1 allows CHP officers to search trucks without probable cause
if they believe inedible kitchen grease is being illegally
transported.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps nowhere else in Los Angeles is grease more of a hot
commodity than the suburban San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Fernando Valley is the area that we're experiencing
the largest theft of grease,'' said Ray Kelly, executive vice
president of Baker Commodities, a grease collection company in Los
Angeles that lost $250,000 to theft last year.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, an average of 6,000 pounds of grease is stolen from
the valley-area restaurants that Baker services, probably because
of the high number of fast-food restaurants here, said Ed Murakami,
vice president in charge of quality control at Baker Commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Grease renderers and recycling companies lose millions of
dollars a year to the thieves, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant problem,'' said Douglas Hepper, a staff
veterinarian with the meat and poultry inspection branch of the
California Department of Food and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lamplighter Restaurant, owner Martha Loranger said her
two eateries in North Hollywood and Sherman Oaks in the San
Fernando Valley are frequently hit by the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   She knows they have struck when she does not receive a check
from the rendering company for her used oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on and off all the time. This year, the locks have been
broken a lot. People are hard up for cash,'' she said. ``It's just
like stealing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's grease doesn't mean it's any less of a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hamp, who owns a Johnny Rockets restaurant in suburban
Encino, said his place was hit by thieves about nine months ago --
on the night before the legitimate hauler was scheduled to pick up
his 50-gallon container filled to the rim with frying oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy! At least it's not being wasted, but if you're not
a legitimate company, then you shouldn't be involved in the oil,''
Hamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting restaurants at night, the thieves pump out gallons of
the glop to later turn over to licensed grease haulers. The haulers
typically pay the thieves about 4 cents a pound -- or about a third
of the 13-cent going rate for grease -- once it's been recycled,
industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate licensed hauler then turns the grease over to
collection sites that recycle it to sell worldwide as energy foods
to cattle and poultry farms and feed mills, Hepper said.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is also sold to businesses that produce shoe creme,
rubber products, some cleaning compounds and dog food, Hepper said.
</P>
<P>
   Four cents a pound might not sound like much, but multiply that
by the 300 pounds that one busy McDonald's restaurant can produce
every day, and it's not chump change. Especially if thieves hit a
dozen places a night, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   All the bandits need are a pickup truck and hydraulic lifter to
steal 55-gallon grease barrels from smaller restaurants, said Ross
Massey, a senior special investigator for the California Department
of Food and Agriculture, which licenses legitimate grease
renderers.
</P>
<P>
   The more elaborate thieves, who often have worked for larger
legitimate companies, may have equipment capable of pumping grease
from 1,000- to 2,000-pound containers at bigger restaurants, Massey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come with torches and cut the lock off. This is how
desperate they are,'' he said. ``No lock can prevent them from
stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1995, it has been illegal for any unlicensed
person to haul inedible kitchen grease. But the California Highway
Patrol's hands were tied when it came to enforcing that law because
grease theft was not specified in the vehicle code. The new law
closes that loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually amends an existing law by adding inedible kitchen
grease,'' Hepper said.
</P>
<P>
   Now once a truck is stopped, the driver must show paperwork that
proves he or she is licensed to transport the slick stuff, said
Nanci Kramer, a CHP spokeswoman based in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   If no license is produced, the driver faces a misdemeanor
offense and up to a $1,000 fine per violation, imprisonment for up
to a year or both, Kramer said. The second offense calls for a fine
of up to $10,000 and one year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The next hurdle is familiarizing officers with the amendment and
educating authorities about the seriousness of the offense,
industry experts agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The subject still draws laughs of disbelief from the public and
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Officers say they have bigger fish to fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're usually more concerned about murders,'' Kelly said.
``They say, What do you mean they stole a barrel of grease?''
</P>
<P>
   Massey prepares the grease theft cases to present to the
District Attorney's Office on behalf of the state Department of
Food and Agriculture and encounters skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the grease to the DA's Office and they say, Grease? I
have to be a real salesman to sell the case.''

AUDITORS GIVEN NEW RULES TO PREVENT BIAS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning in July, auditors must disclose any relationships they
have with the public companies they audit that could weaken their
independence, according to new rules approved by the Independence
Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, approved last Friday, were the first to come from the
board, which was created by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in 1997 because of concerns about the growing number of ties
between some auditors and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors must be independent because they are expected to give
unbiased opinions on whether companies' financial statements are
fair and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, an accounting firm must write a letter to a
company's audit committee describing any relationship that could be
considered a possible conflict of interest. Examples might be
consulting work for the company, employment of former auditors at
the company, or any financial interest that auditors have in the
company. The auditors must explain why the relationships have not
affected their objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules apply to the audits of companies that have fiscal
years ending after July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The standards board is now considering a proposal to prevent
auditors from going to work for their audit clients for a period of
time. An alternative proposal would let an auditor accept a job
with a client immediately but require the former employer to
increase its safeguards to insure that its audit work was not
affected by the job change.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators have been pressing the standards board to
move quickly to tighten the independence rules. The regulators say
they are concerned about the growing amount of consulting work that
the accounting firms are doing for their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators say they have found more cases recently in which
accountants have violated the current independence rules. For
example, at some companies, accounting firms' consultants have
determined how much value should be assigned to certain assets. The
same firms' auditors have then reviewed those values during annual
audits, so that they are reviewing their own work, which is a
violation of the rules.

Apple.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My companion and I had been waiting for a legal two-day parking
spot to become available on the Upper East Side. We sat in our car,
hoping someone would leave. After an hour, we suddenly spotted
brake lights and knew a car was moving. It was a half-block from
our position.
</P>
<P>
   I jumped from our car to run and hold the spot. As soon as I
stood in the middle of the empty space and my companion began to
back our car down the street, another car wheeled around the
corner. The driver saw me standing there and quickly nosed his car
toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!'' I shouted. He shouted back, ``This is New York, and
you can't save spots!'' I didn't leave my spot, but I began to
plead with him, telling him we had been waiting more than a hour
and wouldn't he please move on. My companion saw us shouting and
jumped out of our car and began shouting also.
</P>
<P>
   We were getting nowhere. The driver threatened to run me down.
My companion shouted to the driver, ``If you take that spot, I'm
going to hem you in.'' The other driver stopped shouting. He rolled
down his window as my companion rushed back to our car. He said in
a plaintive voice: ``Hem? What does he mean, he'll hem me in?
What's hem? What's hem?''
</P>
<P>
   I know a good thing when I hear it. I quietly answered, ``If you
know what's good for you, you'll let us have this spot before he
starts hemming.'' Before he drove off, the driver shouted out to my
companion, ``I'll leave, but for her sake, not yours.'' So we were
able to sleep late next morning without moving our car _ all
because of a word I thought everyone knew.

   Zelda Randell was rushing to Pennsylvania Station when she
spotted the panhandler at Broadway and 45th Street. ``Free the
whales, free the whales,'' he called out. He continued: ``Free
Willie, free Willie, free Willie. My name is Willie!'' When the
smiles and laughter subsided, Willie's financial situation improved
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Heywood Hale Broun was on a Columbus Avenue bus when he observed
an elderly couple boarding. They settled in opposite him, and the
man addressed a couple of remarks to his partner without getting a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' he said. ``You don't like talking to
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking to you,'' she replied. ``I just don't
like listening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed and relapsed into silence.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of fresh red roses, the stems tightly wrapped in silver
foil, rested on the taxi's divider between driver and passenger.
``Beautiful roses,'' said Carol Shedlin, the somewhat surprised
passenger. ``Yours,'' the driver replied. ``I always buy a dozen
roses for passengers to enjoy and give them to my last fare of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As someone who gets around town on a bicycle, I don't expect
cabdrivers to give me any kind of break. I know they'll cut me off,
honk their horns at me, yell something offensive as they pass, stop
suddenly in front of me to pick up or drop off passengers _ all the
stuff that brings on road rage. It's only recently that this
behavior stopped bothering me. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   First there were the words shouted by a passing cabby which, as
usual, I ignored until I realized the last word I heard was
``gloves,'' as in ``You dropped your gloves.'' Sure enough, the
pocket where my gloves had been was empty. As I pedaled back, a
second driver delivered the same message, and so did a third.
</P>
<P>
   My gloves were lying on the pavement a block north. As I
remounted and got back onto taxi-ridden lower Fifth Avenue, I
realized something had changed. Those yellow cabs with their
hard-charging drivers were no longer the enemy. I now saw them as a
bunch of people chasing a buck as best they could while still
caring whether an aged bike rider retrieved his gloves.

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   It was a Saturday afternoon, the train was relatively empty and
I had settled down in my corner subway seat on the Broadway line,
opened the paper and prepared for a half-hour of reading.
</P>
<P>
   I scarcely noticed the arrival of three tall post-teen-age males
until I became aware that a match had been struck and there was a
flame. For a moment, the anti-subway anxieties of my suburban
middle-aged peers passed through my mind. Maybe I should start to
drive into the city or use Metro North trains. What were those guys
up to? I put down my paper to take a good look.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them had finished lighting the pink candles on top of a
pack of Twinkies. They presented it to the third, singing ``Happy
Birthday'' at the top of their lungs. The trio got off at the next
stop, munching the Twinkies.

SCHUMER TAKES SENATE OATH FOR A SECOND TIME
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of pomp and celebration by a political party
that has little to cheer about this decade, thousands of New York
Democrats assembled at Lincoln Center Sunday to whoop and cheer as
Charles E. Schumer was sworn in _ for a second time _ as New York
State's new junior Senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Chuck Schumer _ doesn't that have a nice ring to it?''
said Vice President Al Gore, who flew to Manhattan to administer
the oath to Schumer at Avery Fisher Hall for an audience that
commemorated the moment with a 30-second burst of flashbulbs. The
state's Democratic leaders, many of whom are beginning to consider
Gore's own political future as he steps up his presidential bid
this year, responded to the vice president with warm applause as
Schumer's wife, Iris, and daughters, Jessica, 14, and Alison, 9,
laughed and clapped on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   There was a certain familiarity to the event for anyone who has
been following the recent career of the former nine-term
congressman from Brooklyn. Schumer was sworn in at a ceremony in
Washington last week _ placing his left hand on the same Bible,
which he had saved from his bar mitzvah, as he used Sunday, and
taking the oath from the same vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The event's moderator, Robin MacNeil, the retired television
journalist, referred to it as Schumer's ``second annual
inauguration.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were differences. Last week's event on Capitol Hill
was attended by 50 or so people and was sponsored by the National
Soft Drink Association. Sunday's was attended by more than 2,000,
and was sponsored by the state Democratic Committee. The crowd
heard performances by the Boys Choir of Harlem, T.S. Monk Jr. (the
son of the jazz pianist and composer), and Itzhak Perlman, the
violinist, who played American standards. William Kennedy, the
Albany novelist, gave a reading.
</P>
<P>
   And Schumer, speaking to an audience that clearly was unhappy
with events in Washington _ Rep. Jerrold Nadler, among President
Clinton's most public defenders on the House Judiciary Committee,
received a standing ovation as he walked into the room _ warned
against what he described as a ``corrosive partisanship'' that he
said was making young voters cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``What began 25 years ago with Watergate as a solemn and
necessary endeavor to restore the public trust has now grown beyond
our control,'' Schumer said. ``We are in danger of criminalizing
our differences _ of using scandal and innuendo to win at the gavel
what we can not settle at the ballot box. Instead of great debates
about the future of our Republic we have new politics of fear and
smear, where the loyal opposition is too often bent on personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer made only an indirect mention of Alfonse M. D'Amato, the
three-term Republican he handily defeated last year, and the Senate
campaign. It came when, in listing his priorities as senator, he
stressed the need to unify the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstaters must not let politicians demonize downstate _ such
attacks do not create one new job,'' Schumer said. D'Amato sought
to portray Schumer as hostile to upstate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer went out of his way in the speech to telegraph his
concern about the problems of upstate New Yorkers. ``I know the
pain you feel because the nation's economic boom has left you
behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing in drew a wide representation of Democrats from
across the state, including most of the congressional delegation,
with the exception of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even some
Democrats who had not supported Schumer, including Edward I. Koch,
the former mayor of New York. ``They invited me, so I came,'' Koch
said on Sunday night.

WHEN SAFETY COLLIDES WITH REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vina Drennan's impassioned plea to the City Council
on Friday made the evening news and the morning papers. But her
testimony at the public hearing on fire sprinklers was perhaps not
as instructive as what she said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Drennan, a board member of the National Fallen Firefighters
Committee, has devoted herself to the cause of fire safety since
1994, when her husband, firefighter John Drennan, was burned in an
apartment building in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan and died
40 days later. In her testimony, she recalled the long vigil with
him at the burn unit of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
and spoke of the ``twisted bodies'' and ``melted skin'' she had
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge anyone who says we cannot afford a sprinkler
system law to visit the burn unit,'' she angrily told the council.
``We can change this. I hope you have the courage to stand up to
the forces that have blocked sprinklers in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   After testifying, Mrs. Drennan patiently explained to reporters
outside the chamber that sprinklers could save lives not only in
high-rises but also in houses. ``I suggest it very strongly for
homeowners,'' she said. ``For the same cost as wall-to-wall
carpeting you can have a sprinkler system.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she was asked another question: Had she installed
sprinklers in her own home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said, ``I gave it some thought after what happened
four years ago.'' But by the time of her husband's death, Mrs.
Drennan said, the last of her children were nearing college age,
and she expected to move out of their house on Staten Island within
a few years, so she decided not to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house was emptying out, and there were tuition bills to
worry about,'' she said. ``But when I sold it this fall, I
recommended that the buyer install it.'' Mrs. Drennan herself moved
into a Manhattan apartment without sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   How could a passionate advocate of sprinklers choose to risk
living without them? Why couldn't she stand up to the ``forces''
blocking them in her own house? Because sprinklers are fine in the
abstract _ hailed by experts, rewarded by discounts on homeowner
insurance policies _ but problematic in the real world, especially
in old apartments and houses that require expensive retrofitting.
</P>
<P>
   Some esthetes find sprinklers hideous. Some people worry about
their going off accidentally or being set off by vandals (a
particular concern in New York's landlord-tenant war zones). And
some, particularly those who already pay for an array of
only-in-New-York requirements for fire safety, would rather spend
their money on other things, like college tuition bills.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most zealous fire-safety expert couldn't fault Mrs.
Drennan for investing in college rather than sprinklers. One of the
many advantages of being a college graduate is that you're less
likely to die in a fire. The two chief distinguishing features of
fire victims _ the two risk factors more important than anything
else _ are poverty and lack of education.
</P>
<P>
   As a homeowner, Mrs. Drennan considered the kind of tradeoff
that tends to be ignored by safety advocates, particularly ones who
rent. The tenants who testified on Friday _ survivors of the fire
in an Upper West Side high-rise that inspired the furor over fire
safety _ demanded a sprinkler system in their building, but
afterward they bristled when told of estimates that it might
increase their rent by $50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already paying enough rent that the landlord can afford
to install the sprinklers,'' said one tenant, Anna Bager. Others
insisted that the cost wouldn't be more than $5 a month. Obviously,
they had not written many checks to contractors lately. Those
accustomed to such bills dread the prospect of tearing up old
buildings to put in sprinklers. Landlords and developers say the
most reasonable approach would be to mandate the sprinklers only in
new construction, and then only if the city offsets the new cost by
eliminating some of its old fire-safety requirements that would
become superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   The more Mrs. Drennan talked about her own home, the more
sympathetic she sounded to the building owners' position. ``I'd be
happy if we can just get a law for sprinklers in new
construction,'' she said, ``and maybe offer some voluntary
incentives to put sprinklers in other homes. I'm pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying, thou shalt have a sprinkler in every home,
let people choose for themselves.''

`CIVIL ACTION' WINS JUDGMENT AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``A Civil Action'' scored a winning verdict at
the nation's multiplexes with an estimated $14.5 million at 1,802
theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney release, starring John Travolta as an attorney
battling corporations over tainted drinking water, performed better
than expected during what is often a slack time for moviegoing. The
drama posted the third-best January weekend numbers, behind the
1997 re-release of ``Star Wars'' and last year's sensational
``Titanic'' grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audiences responded well to a serious, well-done movie,'' said
film analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``It's also amazing that Travolta
continues to draw like this after having been in so many films with
such a diversity of roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane said the audience for ``A
Civil Action,'' a co-production with Paramount, was split evenly
between males and females with 75 percent over 24 years old. ``We
think word of mouth is going to broaden the audience
significantly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
called the performance ``very promising'' and predicted ``A Civil
Action'' would take in $88 million by the end of its run. ``It's
rare for films that aren't holiday holdovers to perform well at
this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action,'' which opened on Christmas at two theaters to
qualify for Academy Award consideration, will face serious
competition next weekend from the widened release of 20th Century
Fox's war drama ``The Thin Red Line,'' another Oscar contender. The
latter performed well over the weekend with $1.1 million at only 61
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Patch Adams'' led the rest of the
pack with $12.8 million at 2,770 theaters to top $83 million after
17 days. `` `Patch Adams' has terrific legs,'' Rockwell said. ``Put
Robin Williams in the right vehicle and he's unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' fourth weekend of ``You've Got Mail'' delivered a
third-place finish with $8.3 million at 2,749 sites and has crossed
the $90 million mark. It edged Sony's third weekend of ``Stepmom''
with $8 million at 2,358 screens, which gave the family drama $62
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG's fourth weekend of ``The Prince of Egypt'' came
in fifth with $5.8 million at 2,947 theaters for a 46 percent
decline. Grosses for family films fell off significantly with
children back to school following the holiday break.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Mighty Joe Young'' took in $4.7
million at 2,559 sites, down 42 percent, and its eighth weekend of
``A Bug's Life'' followed with $4.5 million at 2,500 screens, off
49 percent. The latter has totaled $142.7 million, making it the
68th highest domestic grosser ever.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's third weekend of ``The Faculty'' came in eighth with
$4.2 million at 2,365 theaters, followed by its widened release of
critical favorite ``Shakespeare in Love'' with $4 million at only
632 screens. ``Shakespeare,'' a major contender for Oscar
nominations, has nearly $15 million after a month in limited
release.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' took
the 10th spot with $3 million at 2,161 theaters, edging Disney's
eighth weekend of ``Enemy of the State'' with $2.9 million at 1,576
locations, although those slots could be reversed when final
figures are released today. ``Enemy'' crossed over the $100 million
mark Saturday, becoming the 13th movie released in 1998 and 180th
of all time to reach the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount showed sneak previews of football drama ``Varsity
Blues'' on Friday at 880 theaters and reported strong responses for
the film, which opens Friday at 2,100 theaters. ``We think `Varsity
Blues' will surprise a lot of people,'' Bucksbaum, noting that it
is the first of about 20 films targeted at the teen-young adult
audience due out in the next 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That many films for that audience could be a little bit of
overkill,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening Friday will be MGM's drama ``At First Sight'' with
Val Kilmer and a pair of thrillers -- DreamWorks' ``In Dreams''
with Robert Downey Jr. and Universal's ``Virus'' with Jamie Lee
Curtis. Paramount will also expand Oscar contender ``A Simple
Plan'' to 600 screens.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's overall business totaled $87 million, down 19
percent from the same weekend last year when the fourth weekend of
``Titanic'' topped $28 million.

TOYOTA PRESIDENT IS CHOICE TO LEAD TRADE GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a development that surprised corporate Japan, the
Japan Federation of Employers' Associations made clear its
intention late Friday to elect Hiroshi Okuda, the dynamic president
of Toyota Motor Corp., as its new chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota moved quickly to say that Okuda would continue to have a
significant role in its operations. ``He should not retire from the
company management,'' Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota's chairman, said on
Saturday, according to the Kyodo News Service. ``We need him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to see how Okuda will wear both hats. The
federation, known here as the Nikkeiren, faces its biggest
challenge since World War II, with Japan's unemployment rate
climbing as the nation's recession persists. Last month, the
unemployment rate reached 4.4 percent, not high by global standards
but almost double the rate Japan is accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   And Toyota, while one of the most financially sound and
efficient companies in the world, is confronting a persistently
weak domestic car market at home and an ever more competitive
market abroad, thanks to global overcapacity in the auto industry
and the unexpected strengthening of the Japanese yen against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The company is pushing its auto-body manufacturing affiliates to
cut capacity, opening a major new production plant in France and
realigning its domestic sales network.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda, who is currently vice chairman of the Nikkeiren, has
expressed his willingness to take the top position from Jiro
Nemoto, the current chairman, who is expected to leave the job this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Toyoda told reporters on Saturday that since the company
intended to adopt a holding-company structure later this year,
Okuda might become chairman of Toyota Motor. He characterized that
job as more akin to the role a chief executive plays in an American
corporation. In Japan, that role is usually taken by the president,
the title Okuda now holds.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestion that Okuda, whose candor is the bane of his
public relations staff and the delight of the global investment
community, will have less of a hands-on role at Toyota is likely to
shake investor confidence. He has pushed the hidebound company hard
to be at the forefront of new automotive technologies and trends
and has worked to increase its return on equity.

ASCEND TO SELL STRATUS UNIT TO INVESTCORP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ascend Communications Inc., a maker of advanced data
communications equipment, will formally announce on Monday that it
is selling its Stratus Enterprise Computer Division for more than
$100 million to a group led by Investcorp, the Middle East
investment group.
</P>
<P>
   The division was acquired by Ascend when it bought Stratus
Computer Inc. for about $800 million in October. Ascend, of
Alameda, Calif., announced then that it would sell all
non-telecommunications business units, including enterprise
computing and software operations. The new company, which will
restore the name Stratus Computer and be based in Marlboro, Mass.,
provides servers to large businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While the sale does not rival recent huge mergers, it is
noteworthy because it is one of the few times a financial buyer
like Investcorp has invested in the often treacherous world of
technology. Financial buyers, renowned in the 1980's by the likes
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., take stakes in troubled
companies, shore them up and either take them public or sell them.
But these buyers have often shied away from technology producers
because product life cycles are quite short and earnings
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Stadler, a member of Investcorp's management
committee, said his company was interested in the division because
of its 18-year history and its dependable customer base, which
includes banks, brokerage firms and airlines. But the deal does not
signal a wholesale push by Investcorp into the technology arena.
``This falls into a specific case,'' he said. Investcorp has
previously bought into prominent companies including Saks Fifth
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough financial buyers looked at Stratus to suggest that
technology is an area they are now more willing to explore. Ken
Fehrnstrom, vice president for business development at Ascend, said
several financial buyers were interested in the division, along
with others who wanted the technology but not necessarily the
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fehrnstrom said his company expected to announce the sale of two
other software divisions received in the Stratus acquisition by the
end of this month.

SILVER CHARM SCORES SMART VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Trainer Bob Baffert recently added a layer to the
Silver Charm legend by calling him ``the most intelligent horse on
the planet.'' Presumably, if racehorses unionize, the 1997 Kentucky
Derby winner will be their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Silver Charm will settle for being their leader on
the racetrack, a job for which he was confirmed Sunday in a
sensational, stretch-running victory over a small, classy field in
the $200,000 San Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The win confirmed not only that his increasingly muscular body
is a running machine. It showed he can win from far off the pace.
It showed he's as bright as Baffert proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it showed that Silver Charm is California's most popular
horse _ the crowd of 20,706 was nearly double last year's San
Pasqual-day attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm began his 5-year-old season already rated the
nation's leading older thoroughbred following the retirements of
likely '98 Horse of the Year Skip Away and Breeders' Cup Classic
winner Awesome Again.
</P>
<P>
   And with no competition in sight, Silver Charm's owners are
asking him to do a lot in '99: race four times at three tracks in
two countries before the end of March; be the first thoroughbred to
earn $10 million; and, while he's at it, bring home his first Horse
of the Year trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that looked a little ambitious halfway through the 1
1/16-mile San Pasqual, when Silver Charm failed to repond to jockey
Gary Stevens' initial urging and dropped 8 { lengths behind
slow-moving leaders Crafty Friend and Dramatic Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, Baffert and owners Bob and Beverly Lewis admitted later
they feared the worst, that Silver Charm was about to repeat his
last-place finish in a race at Del Mar last summer, his only
out-of-the-money finish in a 20-race career.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Silver Charm was outsmarting 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``I niggled at him (again) at the half-mile pole, and it was
like he was saying, `You're finally figuring it out, jock,' ''
Stevens said. `` `You don't have to move on me that early.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Farther behind than he'd been in any of his first 11 victories,
Silver Charm launched his rally on the turn for home, collared the
battling pacesetters in midstretch under a Stevens hand ride,
opened a clear lead and held off a charging Malek by 1 \ lengths.
Silver Charm was clocked in 1:41.78 on a fast track and paid $2.60.
</P>
<P>
   Malek, the '98 Santa Anita Handicap winner, finished 3 { ahead
of third-place Crafty Friend as Dramatic Gold and Young at Heart
completed the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inhaled those horses, and probably won as easily he's ever
won a race,'' said Stevens, who's been aboard for all of Silver
Charm's major victories, including the Derby, Preakness and '98
Dubai World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The $120,000 winner's purse Sunday raised the gray horse's
earnings to $6,633,006, pushing him past John Henry and into fourth
on the all-time list. Cigar's record $9,999,815 is in reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There (can be) no doubt in anybody's mind this is a great
horse,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   How great, we'll find out soon enough. Silver Charm's itinerary
includes the Jan. 31 Donn Handicap in Florida, the March 6 Santa
Anita Handicap and the March 28 Dubai World Cup in the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes he doesn't lead a strike for a lighter workload
before then.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bob Baffert's sixth winner at Santa Anita put him in a
tie with Bobby Frankel and Ron McAnally atop the trainer
standings.... Silver Charm was Gary Stevens' third winner of the
day.... In one of the hotter 3-year-old maiden races of the meet,
The Thoroughbred Corporation's Treasure Hunt and Corey Nakatani
survived a speed duel only to be disqualified to third for
interference, and 505 Farms' High Wire Act and Stevens got the
victory at 9-1. Nakatani faces a suspension.... Next big race at
Santa Anita is Saturday's San Fernando Stakes for 4-year-olds,
including Malibu winner Run Man Run, Artax and Event of the
Year.... What would Freud make of this remark from Baffert about
Silver Charm? ``I'm going to have trouble sleeping tonight,
thinking about having a horse like this in my bed _ I mean my
barn.''

SOURCE: FORD IS CLIPPERS FAVORITE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Make a wish and blow out the candles, Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're wishing to become coach of the Clippers, be
prepared to supply your own icing. Ford couldn't be reached for
comment Sunday, so he avoided the threat of a jinx.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source close to Ford, the former Milwaukee Bucks
coach who turned 50 today has become the heavy favorite to replace
the fired Bill Fitch and inherit a 17-65 team. The Clippers, who
promised to hire a new coach at the ``beginning'' of this week,
could make it official today. Or Tuesday. Or Wednesday. The fat
lady's schedule is of little consequence to Clippers owner Donald
T. Sterling, who shut down the Danny Manning-for-Glen
Rice-and-Willie Burton deal at the last minute five seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   A similar maneuver in the imminent Ford hiring would please Jim
Brewer, the ex-Clippers assistant whose name had been prominent
around NBA campfires as the leading candidate to replace Fitch. The
third name on the Clippers' rapidly maturing short list is that of
Eddie Jordan, whose efforts in Sacramento got him canned at the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   When contacted Sunday at his home, Brewer said the Clippers
still hadn't communicated their intentions to him over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer spent part of Saturday night watching his son, Jim, play
in a game for Long Beach City College's unbeaten team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about my chances,'' Brewer, who assisted
Fitch the last four seasons, said then. ``But we'll just have to
wait and see. I would relish the opportunity to coach the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Clippers hire someone else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about that. Obviously, I'd be very
disappointed. But I've gone through the process, and I understand a
little more about what is involved in making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   That would put him way ahead of most Clippers observers and some
of their players.
</P>
<P>
   One Clipper, who preferred keeping a low profile on the issue,
said Brewer would be a popular choice with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the guys, and with a short time to prepare for the
season, bringing him in would make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to quit recycling some of the usual coaches
and give someone new a chance,'' said another Clipper, firing under
the cloak of anonymity. ``The game has changed from when they first
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford became available for the Clippers gig when he was fired
after the Bucks finished 36-46 last season. During two seasons in
Milwaukee, Ford's teams were 69-95. But he does have a history of
success. In five seasons as coach of the Boston Celtics ('90-'95),
Ford was 222-188. His first two Celtics teams won Atlantic Division
titles but lost in the Eastern Conference playoff semifinals.
Thanks to career-ending back problems, Larry Bird played in only
105 games over that two-year span, while injuries limited superstar
Kevin McHale to 124 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons as an NBA head coach, Ford's record is 291-283,
a winning percentage of .507.
</P>
<P>
   He has pursued the Clippers job even though he completed only
two years of a three-year deal with the Bucks, who would be
obligated to compensate an idle Ford for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ford didn't have enough ideas to prevent the Milwaukee purge,
even though the Bucks' starting lineup included Terrell Brandon,
once accused by Sports Illustrated of being the NBA's premier point
guard, scoring fiend Glenn ``Big Dog'' Robinson, and Jesus, a.k.a.
Ray Allen, co-star of Spike Lee's joint ``He Got Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford had some game in his day as well. He teamed with Howard
Porter to lead Villanova into the 1971 NCAA championship game,
which it lost to UCLA. He averaged 9.2 points per game in a 10-year
NBA career that began in Detroit and ended in Boston. Ford helped
the Celtics win the NBA title in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The coach of that team was Bill Fitch.

A FRESH FACE FOR THE CURBSIDE CHAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They came from Long Island City.
</P>
<P>
   Hooded figures of stainless steel _ 7{ feet tall, with tapered
legs and rounded flanks _ began to multiply on the sidewalks of
Manhattan last year. Most had telephones inside. A few did not.
</P>
<P>
   Their arresting design won both admirers, who thought them
sturdy and innovative, and detractors, who thought them bulky and
intrusive. They also left a lot of New Yorkers wondering what had
become of street phones.
</P>
<P>
   First, directories disappeared from the booths. Then the booths
disappeared. Operating companies multiplied. Enclosures turned into
billboards. Phones sprouted from the sides of delis. And new
designs emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're springing up like mushrooms, and some of them look
like portobellos,'' Elizabeth Starkey, a member of Community Board
7 on the Upper West Side, said of the stainless steel enclosures,
installed by Telebeam Telecommunications Corp. of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   More changes are in store as city regulators fashion a new
franchise system that would affect what phones look like, where
they stand, who runs them and how they are used for advertising.
Applications are pending for 19,965 new phones, in addition to the
32,239 already on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art is balancing our top priority _ improvements in
operability and cleanliness _ while at the same time keeping a
vibrant, diverse industry that will service all areas of the
city,'' said Allan Dobrin, the commissioner of the city's
Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, which
regulates the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the city should also pay more attention to
aesthetics, planning and the public environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am quite concerned about telephone booths,'' said Reba White
Williams, who resigned last month as president of the New York City
Art Commission, which reviews the design of structures on public
land and approved the Telebeam enclosure. ``It seems as though
wherever there is a vacant spot, anybody can put up a telephone
booth without any consideration of how it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the city does not have aesthetic guidelines for
street telephones, although the telecommunications agency is
considering the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Municipal Art Society worries about the proliferation of
street phones, said Vanessa Gruen, the director of special projects
at the civic group. ``It's purely a method of getting advertising
on the sidewalks,'' Ms. Gruen said, ``especially when you have cell
phones. The public service is really to be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, street phones were entrepreneurial from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   New York Telephone Co. installed the first outdoor booths in
1960. (Yes, 1960. Those phone booths you recall from
black-and-white movies were indoors: nightclubs, train stations,
drugstores.) The company figured that pedestrians were a lucrative
market. ``One in every two telephone calls is made on impulse,'' a
phone company executive, Robert Simpson, explained at the time.
``With millions of people walking the streets, we were sure there
was a use for curbside phones.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was less sure. ``People are not used to
telephoning in the street,'' the newspaper observed cautiously in a
news article on May 3, 1960.
</P>
<P>
   They got used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Glass-and-metal curbside booths with folding doors quickly
became as familiar a fixture in New York as the red cabins once
were in London. But the booths did not last long. They were
vandalized and turned into shelters, urinals and drug dealers'
offices. In the 1970s, New York Telephone began replacing them with
an open-air enclosure known as the Adco 120, made by Acoustics
Development Corp. of St. Joseph, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Kent learned this the hard way in ``Superman'' (1978),
when he dashed out of the Daily Planet building and found a skimpy
enclosure that was unusable as a changing room.
</P>
<P>
   After the breakup of American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. in 1984,
independent companies installed thousands of phones on the sides of
buildings. The performance and maintenance of these phones went
largely unregulated until 1996, when the city began to require
registration. There are now nearly 24,000 registered independent
phones, in addition to nearly 8,600 operated by Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   All public pay phones in New York are soon to be governed by
franchises, which the telecommunications agency expects to award
this year. In the meantime, it has issued about 500 interim
permits, including those to Telebeam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure the contract is as fair as it can be to a
diverse industry _ from Bell Atlantic with 8,600 phones to Joe
Telcom with one phone,'' said Larry Allison, assistant commissioner
of the telecommunications agency.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions are these: Will companies pay a flat rate or
a percentage of revenue to the city? How will advertising be
managed? What level of maintenance and service will be required?
How can the city guarantee that phones are installed in poorer
neighborhoods? And should the city impose design standards?
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is the appearance of enclosures near
designated landmarks or within historic districts. Jennifer Raab,
the chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said the
agency is discussing the development of rules for these situations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That the design question is being asked at all is a tribute to
Telebeam, which opened New Yorkers' eyes to the idea that phone
enclosures can cut a high profile in the streetscape, although
Telebeam's chief executive, Raymond Mastroianni, said that was not
his goal.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 of the structures, designed by Rudy Fabiano, have been
installed. They bear the AT&AMP;T logo because that is the carrier
Telebeam uses. Enclosures without phones await a dial tone, which
can be supplied only by Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have put up Adcos and heard nothing from the
community,'' Mastroianni said, ``but we went out of our way to put
something nicer on the street. I wanted to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The structure is wide enough for a caller in a wheelchair. It
can accommodate a public-access computer terminal, which
Mastroianni hopes to install in the future. The legs are strong
enough to support ad panels without buckling, as some enclosures
do. And stainless steel is used to resist graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Street phone design has to take into account maliciousness and
carelessness. That is why, for example, the shelves in enclosures
are slanted or made of widely spaced bars. ``Anything that's a flat
surface in New York, people think, `This is my new counter,''' said
Gerard Doolan, director of sales in the public communications
division of Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   One form of vandalism for which there is no design cure yet is
the pasting of stickers on enclosures, mostly by towing companies
and escort services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to sue these people in small-claims court,''
said Larry Ginsburg, the chief operating officer of New York City
Public Telephone Co. of Brooklyn. Its enclosure across the street
from St. Patrick's Cathedral, at Fifth Avenue and 51st Street,
recently carried the illegally pasted-on message: ``Gorgeous!!
Models drop their undies for you!!!'' A phone number followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a war out there,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been joined by Commissioner Jules Polonetsky of
the city's Consumer Affairs Department. He sent letters to
towing-company owners last year warning that illegal stickers would
subject them to fines and possible suspension or revocation of
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the campaign against more aggressive vandalism, such as
coin-box robbery and destruction of street phone equipment, Doolan
conceded that it could be difficult to engage the authorities in an
all-out effort. He said he cannot quite imagine a police officer
coming home and boasting: ``You know what I did today, honey? I
arrested a guy for beating up a phone.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MINNEAPOLIS _ They come at you with an arsenal as frightful as the
weather outside, a blue norther dressed in purple but with more
shivers, chills and bone-numbing gusts.
</P>
<P>
   They come at you as if these were not the tense times of the NFL
playoffs, nor even football. They come at you and make your head
spin with their tricks, their high-flying acrobatics and all that
magic.
</P>
<P>
   You forget about the glory days of the grunt-and-grind Minnesota
Vikings _ those bygone times when the most popular players were
defensive linemen and the coach was Bud Grant, an expressionless
man with an expressionless team. The game was three yards and a
cloud of ice shavings.
</P>
<P>
   These Vikings make you believe the Lakers decided to return to
Minneapolis, bringing Showtime along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   They come at you with wiry quarterback Randall Cunningham
running the break, his knees popping up and down, up and down, like
a kid running through high grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so much fun,'' Cunningham gushed. ``Because of the
guys on this team, the way we can do things, I just play. I just
have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   They come at you with Randy Moss, Jake Reed and Cris Carter,
spectacular receivers running all over the place and making
defenders look like a bunch of 12-year-olds at a rodeo calf
scramble, trying to figure out just which way to run.
</P>
<P>
   They come at you with Robert Smith slicing back and forth,
churning up yardage behind an offensive line that doesn't so much
slice as it does puree.
</P>
<P>
   They make it all look so careless and free, like Magic Johnson
pitching an alley-oop or Mary Tyler Moore tossing her beret into
the Minneapolis skyline.
</P>
<P>
   They make you think it couldn't possibly get any better or more
fun. It couldn't possibly become more creative for them or
dangerous for opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday afternoon, it did. While everyone was watching
Showtime, the Arizona Cardinals got Kurt Rambised.
</P>
<P>
   That was Leroy Hoard scoring three touchdowns. That was Andrew
Glover catching a big early touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team decides they want to defend one part of our offense,
they can't do it for long,'' Minnesota coach Dennis Green said.
``We have some weapons and things we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41-21 final score of the Vikes' NFC playoff semifinal win
over the Cards might look like just another Minneapolis Lakers
ho-hummer: Moss going deep. Carter going deep. Smith going long.
</P>
<P>
   And, well, those guys did all those things.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals clearly tried to shut down Moss and Carter.
And at least early on, they did it with some success as All-Pro
cornerback Aeneas Williams gave Moss a rough time and deep safeties
cut off Carter at the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards' defense also tried to keep Cunningham in the pocket
and Smith inside the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But when the game was being won _ we're talking the first half
here _ it was Hoard scoring two of the Vikes' first three
touchdowns and Glover registering the third on a beautiful
third-down catch between defenders.
</P>
<P>
   And twice during those three drives, utility back David Palmer
lined up at quarterback as Cunningham split wide like a receiver,
with Palmer converting a first down both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team tries to overlook anyone on our offense,'' Glover
said, ``they could be in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you have the scouting report for next week's Vikings
conference final against the Atlanta Falcons, which will be played
here in the land of arctic blasts outside and Miami mambos in the
Metrodome. The Dirty Birds could be in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have playmakers, and they're not always the same guys,''
Green said. ``Sometimes, you never know who's going to get the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Cardinals never did. They fell behind 17-0 before
Moss, who eventually wound up with four catches, 73 yards and a
touchdown, even touched the ball once.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals ace quarterback Jake Plummer also threw a pair of
interceptions in the first half, and nothing hurt the Cards' cause
more than a running game that read like the local weather forecast
_ minus-two, minus-four, minus-six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody on this team can honestly say that
they've been on a better offensive team than this one,'' Hoard
said.
</P>
<P>
   But one player in the locker room did say something that might
be even more frightful than the weather and the Vikings were on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't believe we were on today,'' Cunningham said.
``At least not all the way on. I think we can play better. I know
we can.''

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As much as the New York Jets dominated
the Jacksonville Jaguars, they had trouble putting away the
underdogs Sunday at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Jaguars appeared down and out, they kept springing
up with improbable plays to bounce back into their AFC divisional
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, this was no contest. New York led in rushing
yardage 151-95; passing yardage 284-156; time of possession
39:16-20:44; and takeaways 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the final score was Jets 34, Jaguars 24. And the difference
was only seven points until John Hall kicked a 30-yard field goal
with 24 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we put them away at times, but it turned out we
didn't,'' Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells prides himself on maintaining
discipline, and he was critical of ``stupid plays'' that allowed
the Jaguars to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them too much room to breathe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was after the Jets had the Jacksonville defense panting
for breath on the game's first drive.
</P>
<P>
   The gale-like wind that had been forecast did not materialize.
The temperature was 26 degrees, but the sky was mostly sunny and
the wind moderate most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   With conditions conducive to passing, the Jets took to the air.
Vinny Testaverde completed all four throws on a 70-yard drive that
ended with a 21-yard scoring pass to Keyshawn Johnson, who beat
cornerback Dave Thomas cutting across the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, a 52-yard field goal by Hall gave
the Jets a 10-0 lead. Seconds later, Jets cornerback Otis Smith
made a leaping sideline interception off Mark Brunell, and the Jets
appeared ready to bury their opponent early.
</P>
<P>
   New York drove to the Jacksonville 22, but Curtis Martin
fumbled, and safety Chris Hudson recovered and returned it 47
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson then showed that the Jets did not have a monopoly on
stupidity. He tried to lateral the ball, and Johnson, who had
hustled downfield to follow the play, recovered it. The Jets
capitalized, with Johnson scoring on a 10-yard end around for a
17-0 lead with 33 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   As time was about to expire, Brunell lobbed a bomb down the left
sideline. Jimmy Smith pulled down the 52-yard pass for a touchdown,
and Parcells was furious with safety Jerome Henderson for his late
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there was no excuse for that,'' Parcells said. When
reporters asked what he told the player, the coach said: ``You
couldn't repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Corwin Brown intercepted to set up another
Jets touchdown. Johnson, who had nine receptions for 121 yards,
made an over-the-shoulder catch for 23 yards to the one-yard line.
On third down from the one, Martin scored for a 24-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the Jaguars resurrected themselves, with Reggie
Barlow returning the ensuing kickoff 88 yards to the four.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth-and-three, the Jaguars went for the touchdown. The
gamble worked, as Brunell threaded a pass to a double-covered
Keenan McCardell, pulling the Jaguars to 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville could not sustain momentum, however, because Martin
(36 carries for 124 yards) kept grinding. The Jets went up 31-14
with a second one-yard touchdown by Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But again, the Jaguars came back. Jimmy Smith scored on an
artful 19-yard comeback reception in the end zone on third-and-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big play,'' Parcells said. ``It kept them in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fumble by receiver Wayne Chrebet, the Jaguars' Mike
Hollis kicked a 37-yard field goal to cut the lead to 31-24 with
6:38 left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets drove to the 14-yard line before committing another
costly error. Testaverde, on second-and-seven, sailed a ball into
the hands of Jaguars rookie safety Donovin Darius, who was on his
knees just inside the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then came another mental miscue. Darius hesitated, coming out of
the end zone, then backing into it and finally getting tackled at
the half-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got up, I couldn't see,'' Darius said. ``A guy in
green was running at me, and I didn't know if I was in the end zone
or on the one. I wanted to make a play, so I started running.''
</P>
<P>
   With 2:24 left, the Jaguars had time, but they had no field
position, and they lost the ball on downs, effectively ending the
game.
</P>
<P>
   So now, for the first time since the 1982 season, the Jets
advance to the AFC Championship Game, in Denver on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets have a very sound offense and defense,'' Jaguars
All-Pro offensive tackle Tony Boselli said. ``I think they can beat
Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells sounded less optimistic. ``The way Denver played
yesterday (blasting Miami 38-3),'' he said, ``it would be hard for
us to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jets skeptics wonder if the team is too inexperienced. Before
Sunday's game, only 19 of their players had appeared in a
postseason game. The nervousness showed, but Parcells said, ``I
don't think it was inexperience. It was stupid plays.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
When he became NBA commissioner in 1984, David Stern had a vision
of what the league could be.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long before that, the league had been mired in drug
scandals, and the NBA Finals, now one of the premier showcase
events in professional sports, were tape-delayed on late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern looked at players such as Magic Johnson, Larry Bird
and Isiah Thomas _ players whose flair for the game could be
packaged and sold _ and saw a sport fans around the world could
embrace. More important, Stern thought it was a game corporate
America could embrace.
</P>
<P>
   And they did.
</P>
<P>
   Stern sold the league, and he did it by selling the players.
Johnson, Bird, Thomas, Julius Erving and later Michael Jordan,
Grant Hill and Shaquille O'Neal became icons, not only on the court
but off the court as well _ on billboards, magazines, movies and
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Stern understandably took pride in his creation, not only
because of the phenomenal success it enjoyed but also because it
had been untouched by the labor problems that seemed to plague
every other professional sport in the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But it was just a matter of time before the players began to
believe the hype Stern was selling. They understandably began to
believe they were the game, and Stern's creation suddenly became
Frankenstein's monster.
</P>
<P>
   The league's partnership with the players began to erode, coming
to a head last year, when the NBA locked out its players July 1.
The work stoppage would last six agonizing months before Stern and
Billy Hunter, executive director of the National Basketball Players
Association, hammered out an agreement mere hours before the
remainder of the 1998-99 season was to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   So with the league gearing up to play an abbreviated schedule of
approximately 50 games, Stern is almost back where he started _
having to sell the NBA to a public that doesn't seem to care much
for it. And he might have to sell the NBA without its biggest star,
should Jordan retire after winning his sixth championship last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Can Stern work his magic again? He thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how big of (an image) hit we've taken,'' Stern
said. ``I know we've taken a big hit, but (compare it to) a serious
illness _ some people are up and walking very soon in robust health
on short term, and some it takes much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a variable that is not preordained. I think it (the
NBA's recovery) depends on whether what we achieved in this is
viewed by our fans as having been worth the sacrifice, and whether
we use the opportunity to reconnect in serious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Will fans believe the lockout was worth the sacrifice?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to be a question of time,'' Stern said. ``I
can tell them that if they're really fans of sports, they know that
the notion of a few players making all the money, and the rest
being extras, like it would be in Hollywood, is not a sports model,
because sports is about teamwork and value down the line, and
that's what we tried to do here, once and for all, and we wanted to
give teams the opportunity to succeed, not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think with this fine-tuning we're into now we have a system
that has done that. If teams can't do well, don't blame their
heavenly stars. Our fault lies not in our stars but ourselves. Over
a period of time, if a team doesn't succeed under this system, then
management has to answer for the failure.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges Stern envisions is reconnecting
with the players, many of whom might distrust the league for what
they consider to have been hardball negotiating tactics. Stern says
he is distressed when he thinks about how the partnership between
the league and the union has eroded, and he intends to rebuild that
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, interestingly enough, one of the things Billy Hunter
and I talked about during breaks in the negotiations was that we
would, in fact, get through this eventually,'' Stern said, ``and
when we did, there were many things the union and the league were
going to be much more aligned on than opposed on, and that has to
do with marketing, globality, and player conduct and player
interaction with fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I take Billy at his word on this, that we're going to do
some things _ I don't know what they are and can't say what they
are _ but I just know that if we can reaffirm the partnership, it's
not going to be a marketing ploy. Our fans are going to see some
fundamental shifts in attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Which apparently means the NBA is cleaning up its act. Stern
hopes there will be fewer stories about poor player conduct, on and
off the court, and more instances of players cooperating with fans,
helping to rebuild the fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important issue now is to use the depths of our
despair at losing the season to lead the way in changing the
attitudes of teams and players toward each other and toward the
fans,'' Stern said. ``I believe that our teams are complicit in
setting standards. I don't mean in punishing players, as little
kids, but in level of expectation of what the product is, and what
your obligations and commitments are to your fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those obligations and commitments come from players and teams
working together, and the union and the league. For reasons I can't
quite divine, for the last few years we've been stepping back from
that. Part of it, I think, was attributable to the union
necessarily trying to build its base and rally the players. In so
doing, it portrayed the teams and the league as the enemy. They
were the adversary in a collective-bargaining sense, but when you
focus on it you see that that has its own corrosive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get together and say this is the right way for us,
collectively, to behave toward the fans, and we'd better make sure
it gets done. We are going to sit down with Billy Hunter, and we're
going to be on the same side of the issue. We're going to say,
`Let's talk about what responsibilities come with being a player in
the NBA, what commitments and responsibilities come with being an
employee of the NBA or a team or a commissioner, and let's define
those.'''
</P>
<P>
   That would depend on players being willing to cooperate, which
hasn't always been the case.
</P>
<P>
   And should Jordan retire, that would leave precious few players
who are willing to assume the role of ambassador or _ dare we say
it? _ role models. Hill, Tim Duncan, Keith Van Horn and Kobe Bryant
are a few who are being groomed, but Stern said there will be more.
There always are.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players (could be role models), a lot,'' Stern said.
``When one looks out there, it's not even fair to mention names,
but when you look at a number of our players, you're looking at
solid citizens. What happens is the media focuses on people who are
different, because they make better copy. People think that becomes
the norm, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is his message to NBA fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Step back a little bit, give us some room, and judge us
harshly if we don't win you back,'' Stern said. ``But at least give
us the opportunity to do that.''

<P>
   DENVER _ Before the New York Jets travel to Denver this week for
Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Broncos, there are a few
statistics they should know about the defending Super Bowl
champions:
</P>
<P>
   In their 38-3 divisional playoff victory against Miami on
Saturday, the Broncos tied a team record for most points scored in
a playoff game and set a team record for fewest points allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the playoffs, the Broncos have won 18 consecutive games
at Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are 3-0 in AFC Championship Games at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done yet,'' Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton said
Sunday. ``We have to look at the big picture. This is one piece of
the puzzle. This is not it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and coach Bill Parcells will bring a seven-game winning
streak into Mile High Stadium. When Parcells coached at New
England, the Broncos obliterated the Patriots 37-3 and 34-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you always get a little juiced up when you are going
against a coach who has had a lot of success, a coach who has a
couple of Super Bowl rings,'' Denver coach Mike Shanahan said about
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Broncos watched the Jets' victory over Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a great man leading them,'' Braxton said. ``Parcells
has won everywhere he's gone. There's no reason to think he
wouldn't win there, but it's surprising that he did it so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did in 1997 when they won their first Super Bowl,
the Broncos lost two of the last three regular-season games but
excelled when the playoffs began. Their conquest of Miami removed a
lot of doubt about their ability to refocus and play as well as
they did before they got caught up in becoming the first 19-0 team
in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an empty bandwagon,'' Pro Bowl center Tom Nalen
said. ``There weren't a lot of people who gave us a chance to play
a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have their sights set on Super Bowl XXXIII at
Miami's Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they play the next two games like they played this one,
they'll win the Super Bowl,'' Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos scored on their first three possessions against the
Dolphins. They outgained Miami 424 yards to 252, including a
rushing advantage of 250-14. Running back Terrell Davis, voted the
league's Most Valuable Player on Saturday, carried 21 times for 199
yards and scored two touchdowns. Naturally, Davis doesn't expect to
average 9.5 yards a carry every week.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback John Elway completed 14 of 23 passes for 182 yards
and a touchdown and was not intercepted. He beat Miami quarterback
Dan Marino for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win and we're in,'' cornerback Darrien Gordon said about
reaching a second consecutive Super Bowl. ``With Terrell carrying
the load and with John playing the way he is, it's going to be
tough to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Denver was so dominant in the 35-point victory _ the
largest in franchise history _ over Miami that Shanahan should
preserve his game plan and use it again against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, we have a different game plan,'' Shanahan said.
``We change our schemes and formations from game to game. We'll put
in a few new wrinkles for the (Jets) game.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about the Broncos' performance wasn't
the explosiveness of the offense. It was the way their
much-maligned defense smothered Miami, especially against the run.
The Dolphins averaged 1.1 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was 26-of-37 for 243 yards and no touchdowns. He was
intercepted twice. Denver's defense forced three turnovers,
including end Neil Smith's 79-yard fumble return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season,'' Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski
said, ``it seemed like people were saying, `Well, the defense is
the weakness.' Together in the room last week as a defense, we said
if we lose it, it's not going to be the defense that does it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who took the field had a certain attitude. We were
going to attack them, we were going to hit them, and we were going
to get them off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski promises a similar effort against the Jets and
quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play physical; we're going to knock the
you-know-what out of anybody who touches that football,''
Romanowski said. ``That's the mentality we have. It was just
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Added receiver Rod Smith, who had a 28-yard touchdown catch,
``We won't rest until we've got another Super Bowl ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the bad blood between the Broncos and Dolphins, there
wasn't any sympathy for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them (Dolphins) how it felt to have a Super Bowl at
your house and not be invited,'' Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe
said. ``They didn't take too kindly to that. I also told them to
tell Jimmy (Johnson) to have his office (at the Dolphins' practice
facility) ready because we're going to need to break down film.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ For an entire regular season, the Minnesota Vikings
fired warning shots at the rest of the NFL in machine-gun fashion.
On Sunday, they took a different approach in sending a red alert to
folks in Atlanta.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quick-striking Vikings? Not this time. The team that set a
single-season scoring record and became notorious for its quick and
painless conquests instead took its sweet time against Arizona,
controlling the ball and, ultimately, the Cardinals with a 41-21
victory at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The point total again was impressive. But how the Vikings got
there was vastly different from the bombs-away mentality that has
been their calling this season. In this win, Minnesota had three
drives that each knocked more than seven minutes off the clock,
including the opening thrust of the game that used half of the
first quarter. It proved that the Vikings have a little smash-mouth
to go with their Showtime reputation as an explosive offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only know one way, and that's to try to put the pedal to
the metal,'' said running back Robert Smith, who had 124 yards on
the ground and combined with Leroy Hoard to make life miserable for
the Cardinals. ``But today, we ran the ball better than we have in
a long time. And that was a big key in this win.''
</P>
<P>
   One of many. With the Cardinals intent on slowing the Vikings'
vaunted receiving threats, the running game was opened up.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took what the defense allowed it, and as a result the
Vikings will try to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time
since 1976 when they host the Atlanta Falcons next Sunday in the
NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, any fans holding out hope that the Dallas
Cowboys actually were a great team this year and just got beat by a
charmed-life bunch of Cardinals could forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals simply got outclassed. Minnesota had more players
who made more plays. And it started in the trenches, where the
Vikings are very good but receive little recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I've been here (six years), we've never had a
better performance by our offensive line,'' said Vikings offensive
coordinator Brian Billick. ``Not in any game, much less a playoff
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick, the architect of the Vikings' scoring machine, got no
argument from his adversary, Arizona defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got great athletes on their offensive line who are
big,'' McGinnis said. ``That's exactly what you look for in a line.
We couldn't get them into any third-and-long situations. And any
time it's third-and-short, it's hard to stop an average team, much
less a very good team like this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings left no doubt they are a very good team. They
approached their playoff opener with some trepidation. After a 15-1
regular season and a bye week while the Cardinals beat the Cowboys
20-7 in the wild-card round, the Vikes weren't exactly sure what to
expect from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to get the answer. They took the opening
drive and stuffed it down Arizona's throat, going 80 yards in 13
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first drive was really crucial,'' said Vikings safety
Robert Griffith. ``When our offense takes more than seven minutes
off the clock, and we (the defenders) get that much rest, it's a
big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Minnesota coach Dennis Green: ``If you look around the
NFL, the teams that can run the ball usually win. The teams that
can play good run defense normally win, too. Running the ball in
crucial situations _ we did it. And we prevented them from doing
it. So that was a key part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who came into the game as 16-point underdogs,
knew they had to keep Vikings receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter
under wraps to have a chance of pulling off an upset. They
succeeded at times. But with their attention affixed on the
wideouts, Smith and Hoard had easy pickings busting through the gut
of the Arizona defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hoard had three touchdowns _ two rushing and one on a 16-yard
pass from Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   With the running game working so well, Cunningham didn't have to
force the aerial attack. He was an efficient 17-for-27 for 236
yards. The longest of his three touchdown throws was 16 yards to
Hoard, who put the Cards in a 24-7 hole just 24 seconds before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was nearly flawless for the Vikings. In the first
quarter alone, they ate up 14:06 of the clock with two long drives.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of them resulted in points; the second was aborted when
Cunningham was intercepted by Aeneas Williams in the end zone.
Cunningham was trying to hit Moss on a slant pattern, but Williams
outpositioned Moss and returned the pick to the Cardinals' 46.
</P>
<P>
   That outburst was the only thing the Cardinals did right in the
early going. And it merely delayed the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Arizona tried to flex a little muscle and heart by
drawing within 34-21 early in the fourth quarter, the Vikings
responded by keeping the ball for 7:12 on the ensuing drive,
effectively suffocating the Cardinals' last gasp with a six-yard TD
run by Hoard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed they were able to run the ball as well as
they were, because I think that's where your defense has to start
every game you're going to play,'' said Arizona coach Vince Tobin.
``No matter how good of skilled receivers people have, you have to
stop the run, because that's going to dominate the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we were making some scores and getting back into the
game, they were able to run the football. And we tried everything
that we had in our defensive arsenal. None of it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the Atlanta Falcons another thing to worry about in the
NFC Championship Game.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ It may be too soon to label it a changing of the guard,
but Atlanta's divisional-playoff victory over San Francisco on
Saturday ensured the NFC will have some new blood in the Super
Bowl.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas and Green Bay were eliminated over the wild-card weekend.
Since Washington represented the NFC after the 1991 season, either
the Cowboys, Packers or 49ers reached the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell by this locker room that there's somewhat of a
train-wrecked feeling,'' 49ers quarterback Steve Young said. ``I
don't think there's anyone in here that didn't think we were going
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta knows San Francisco's rsum well, having played perennial
division doormat for the 49ers to trample over. But Saturday's
20-18 Atlanta win soothed 32 years of frustration, sending the
Falcons to the NFC Championship Game for the first time in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating the team that has been the bane of our existence is
just incredible,'' Falcons defensive end Lester Archambeau said.
``I think it's fitting that the road to the championship game had
to go through San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only two years ago that coach Dan Reeves entered the
picture in Atlanta to take the reins of a 3-13 team. And like the
corporate raider who guts dying companies and then rebuilds them,
Reeves eliminated the dead weight and restructured from the core
out.
</P>
<P>
   The results have come more quickly than even he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dreamed about it a lot, but we were not sure it was a
reachable goal,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said of getting this
far. ``It's been a season of modifying goals all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was only the third playoff victory in Falcons
history. They had reached the playoffs only five times previously
and hadn't won a postseason game since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the old Atlanta. Under Reeves, the Falcons have a
10-game winning streak and a 15-2 mark this season. They are 21-4
since the midway point of last season, when the turnaround began,
and 22-11 overall with Reeves at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun is just starting around here,'' tight end O.J.
Santiago said. ``When you're 14-2, you expect to win the first
playoff game. The real test will come next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The test will come in Minnesota against the Vikings, who became
only the third team in NFL history to go 15-1 in the regular
season. The other two, the 1984 49ers and 1985 Chicago Bears, both
won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Each playoff game this season has come down to which team runs
the ball more effectively, which should give Atlanta a solid chance
against Minnesota's high-powered offense. The Falcons have the No.
2 run defense in the league and held the 49ers' No. 1-ranked
offense to only 46 yards rushing, an impressive feat even though
Garrison Hearst was in for only one play before breaking his
fibula.
</P>
<P>
   With Jamal Anderson starring in their ground attack, the Falcons
managed 136 yards rushing Saturday. Anderson, who finished second
in the league in rushing to Denver's Terrell Davis this year, had
his 13th 100-yard game of the season, netting 113 yards and
Atlanta's only two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get enough of this feeling,'' said Atlanta
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who played in four Super Bowls with
Buffalo. ``You look at the other teams that are at home. Those guys
would give their whole salary to be where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't go any further, it would still go down as an
amazing season for the Falcons and a huge building block for the
future. But there's only one future the Falcons are pondering right
now, and it would culminate Jan. 31 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable turnaround for this team,'' running back
Gary Downs said. ``This team has been building for two years. We
learned how to win.''

DENVER _ Pick a play, any play.
</P>
<P>
   There is Terrell Davis gathering in the ball on a toss to the
right side from John Elway, and then the fun starts. He takes a
lightning-quick stutter-step in one direction, and suddenly the
Miami defense is skidding out of control like 11 cars with bald
tires trying to stop on a patch of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sees an opening and moves to it. Never mind the Dolphins.
On this afternoon, the sea life that comes to mind is an eel, as
Davis slithers quickly through the crack. Safety Calvin Jackson
grabs nothing but air, then one last juke and cornerback Sam
Madison is so faked out that you half expect the rest of his body
to tear loose from his ankles, and Davis finishes up his 20-yard
sprint in the end zone, giving the fans the Mile High salute.
</P>
<P>
   There is Rod Smith, the quieter contrast to Shannon Sharpe's
constantly moving mouth, running under key passes thrown by Elway.
This one is also in the first quarter, and it's an out pattern to
the left side of the field, a frozen rope but just slightly short
of its mark.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sees the ball and comes back to it. Or more accurately, he
launches himself straight up into the air and seems to hover above
the spot like one of those traffic helicopters over a freeway.
Madison, the tough corner, almost runs straight through him. But
Smith simply bends his body in half, drapes over Madison's left
shoulder and hauls in the catch for a 15-yard gain and a first
down.
</P>
<P>
   There is Neil Smith bending over and picking up a ball fumbled
by Dolphin Oronde Gadsden at the Miami 21-yard line, turning,
pausing and seeming to think to himself: I have to run that far?
</P>
<P>
   So he did. Though calling it running would be an inaccuracy for
every living member of the animal kingdom this side of the
hippopotamus family. Smith lumbered and he labored and he struggled
and he staggered. He seemed to stop for a lunch break near the
Miami 30, then finally left equally slow Dolphins center Tim Ruddy
in the thin air and completed his 79-yard Marco Polo overland
journey for the outrageous cap on Denver's 38-3 flogging of the
Dolphins on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The point isn't that Denver held a mile-high fish fry or that
Miami traveled to the Rockies and played like a collection of
sea-level sissies. This was, as coach Jimmy Johnson admitted
afterward, a Dolphins team that was beat up and bruised and entered
the game with a tank that was already empty from its wild-card
struggle a week earlier with Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   What's important is that after losing their bid for an unbeaten
season and going through what has become their now-customary
December swoon, the Broncos are back and clearly the team to beat
for the Super Bowl XXXIII title.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Vinny and the Jets or any of that Big Tuna mystique.
Forget about the air raids by the Vikings' Randall Cunningham and
Randy Moss or the ground game of Atlanta's Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   When the Broncos are on top of their game, they are like a trip
to the circus. There is always something incredible going on, and
nobody can keep up with the action in all three rings and the
overhead trapeze, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are 10-2 in home playoff games and never have lost
in three previous AFC Championship Games played at Mile High.
What's more, after using the week off from the wild-card round to
get themselves rested and get their confidence readjusted, they are
once again looking like a road grader, capable of flattening
everything in sight. They are also on a revenge tour, of sorts.
First, it was getting back at Miami for that Dec. 21 loss. Now,
it's the Jets and their Noo Yawk accents who'll serve as stand-ins
for the perfection-breaking Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Elway took the Broncos on touchdown drives on each of their
first three possessions of Saturday's game and quickly ended any
wild notion the Dolphins might have had of an upset. This was as
complete, as dominant as the Broncos may have looked since Week 2
of the season when they went 5-for-5 on first-half drives and hung
up 35 points on the Dallas Cowboys before the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway vs. Dan Marino. Dan Marino vs. John Elway. Want to
know who's better? Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the 2,000-yard rusher and the 1998 Most Valuable Player,
is the one who separates the Broncos from everybody else. He pounds
and he slashes and he makes jaws _ and defenders _ drop and he
gives all of the other parts of the Denver attack a chance to
shine. He also allows the offense to control the ball so much that
Denver's only weak spot _ its secondary _ is never exposed for too
long.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a play, any play.
</P>
<P>
   They are, loose, confident and at home on their own ranch, the
Broncos galloping toward another Super Bowl.
</P>

REDSKINS SAID TO BE SOLD FOR $800 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Rewrites 1st 4 grafs.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins and their new stadium were sold Sunday
to a group headed by Howard Milstein, co-owner of the New York
Islanders hockey team, for $800 million, a record price for a
domestic sports franchise, according to two people involved in the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The sum to be paid to the estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke,
the former owner of the team, by Milstein and his partner, Daniel
Snyder, exceeds the $530 million paid by Al Lerner last August for
the expansion Cleveland Browns football team, the previous record
sales price. The Browns' price tag included a $54 million
contribution toward building the team's new municipally owned
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The price paid for the Redskins reflects the cash flow generated
by Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, which just completed its second season
of operation. Cooke stadium has 15,044 club seats, which cost $995
to $2,500 each annually, and 280 luxury suites that rent for
between $45,000 and $160,000 each per season. The Browns' stadium
will have fewer luxury suites and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins receive revenue from all tickets sold, parking and
concessions. Their sale will be formally announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein, who bid unsuccessfully for the Browns, will have to
sell all or part of the 45 percent stake in the Islanders that he
owns with his brother, Edward, to comply with the National Football
League's cross-ownership rules.
</P>
<P>
   When he sought to buy the Browns, Milstein said that if he got
the team, he would sell his family's ownership in the Islanders to
the team's co-owner, Steven Gluckstern. He is expected to follow
that course now.
</P>
<P>
   Milstein's family is worth billions of dollars, from New
York-based real estate and banking empires. Snyder owns a
Washington communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reflecting the cash flow at Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium, the $800 million purchase price was influenced by the
Browns' sale price, the $700-million-a-year guaranteed to each NFL
team owner from the new television contracts, and the size and
influence of the Washington market, which is nearly one-third
bigger than Cleveland's.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money produced by a stadium is the economic factor
that divides the richest teams from the rest and makes franchises
leap in value. It was why a successful team like the Minnesota
Vikings, which does not generate huge wealth from the municipally
owned Metrodome, sold for a modest $250 million last year to Red
McCombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Milstein-Snyder group defeated three others, including one
formed by John Kent Cooke, the son of the late owner, that was
described as very strong by the people involved in the sale
process. Other bidders included John McMullen, the owner of the
Devils, and Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems and Sam
Grossman, an Arizona shopping center magnate.
</P>
<P>
   By the terms established by the Cooke estate, Milstein and
Snyder are acquiring the team's stock, a transaction that will
funnel the proceeds tax free to a charitable foundation set up by
the estate.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' sale, by comparison, was an asset purchase. The
Redskin process, compared with that of the Browns, was quiet. The
estate imposed severe confidentiality restrictions, rules that were
stern enough so that bidders like McMullen and Dolan denied they
were bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With the Browns, the league controlled the process, inviting the
bidders to meetings covered by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   League approval of Milstein and Snyder should take 60 to 90
days, but the time span could be shorter because NFL owners are
already familiar with Milstein. It is not known whether that time
frame will preserve the job of Redskins coach Norv Turner, whose
team went 6-10 last season. Had John Kent Cooke acquired the team,
Turner's future was believed to be more secure.

POLICE OFFICER WHO INTERROGATED BIKO IS DENIED AMNESTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating for all needing)  (ms) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ A former police officer who said he helped tackle
the anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko and smash his head into a
wall when Biko was in custody in 1977 has been denied amnesty by
the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has not yet released its findings, but George
Bizos, a lawyer for the Biko family, said it had ruled that no
amnesty could be granted because the police officer had not
admitted to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gideon Niewhoudt, and the four other officers
involved in Biko's interrogation told the commission that Biko had
attacked them after he had been forced to stand. They said they had
been defending themselves when they jumped on him.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the incident, Biko, naked, disoriented and suffering
from severe head injuries, was driven 750 miles across South Africa
for medical treatment. He died before he got any, on Sept. 12,
1977.
</P>
<P>
   His case outraged the world and helped galvanize the
anti-apartheid movement. Although an investigation at the time
cleared the police officers of any wrongdoing, it became clear that
an obviously injured Biko had spent days manacled to window bars
before dying alone on the floor of a prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened to him has been an enduring secret. When
the five officers involved in his interrogation applied for amnesty
in 1996, many South Africans hoped they would finally hear a full
explanation of how Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness
Movement, had died.
</P>
<P>
   But few were satisfied with the version of events the five
police officers put forward during weeks of testimony to the Truth
Commission in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sidestepping the question of whether Niewhoudt, who is in jail
for other crimes, is believable, the commission's decision focuses
on an issue that was particularly galling to the Biko family: None
of the police officers accepted blame for Biko's death or confessed
to any criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In theory the verdict leaves Niewhoudt vulnerable to criminal
prosecution. But such a prosecution seems unlikely. Legal experts
say proving intent to kill for a murder charge would be extremely
difficult. And a lesser charge of manslaughter would not be
possible because of a 20-year statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Mdu Lembede, confirmed that the commission had made
the ruling in the Niewhoudt case. It was apparently made on Dec. 15
but was not released to the public because it came as the Christmas
holidays began. Lembede said the text of the ruling would be
available on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Applications for amnesty made by the four other officers are
being considered by a different panel and are probably not ready
for decision yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has received more than 7,000 applications for
amnesty and still has many high-profile cases to deal with, like
those of the two men convicted of killing popular leader Chris Hani
on the eve of the 1994 elections, or some of the more notorious
police officers of the apartheid era. They include Col. Eugene de
Kock and Craig Williamson, who masterminded gruesome assassinations
of liberation activists.
</P>
<P>
   In general the commission has signaled its intention to forgive
rather than punish the most heinous crimes of apartheid. Among
those to have gotten amnesty is a police officer who organized a
nighttime raid on political activists that killed 11 people, most
of them women and children attending a wake.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has also granted amnesty to the young men who stoned
an American student, Amy Biehl, to death in 1993 when she drove
some friends home to a black township.
</P>
<P>
   Created as a way to put South Africa's brutal past to rest, the
commission has the power to grant amnesty in return for
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   During the police officers' amnesty hearings, a few new details
about Biko's death emerged. The officers admitted they had lied
about which day Biko had received a head injury because they had
not followed regulations about seeking medical help. But they
continued to maintain that the death had been largely the result of
an interrogation gone awry because of Biko's belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   Biko's relatives have fiercely opposed amnesty for the officers,
saying after the hearings that they still did not think the truth
had come out.
</P>
<P>
   Bizos said Sunday that because the commission's ruling did not
deal with the question of whether Niewhoudt finally told the truth,
it was not wholly satisfying. But, he added, perhaps that did not
matter. ``The world's jury has already decided.'' he said.
