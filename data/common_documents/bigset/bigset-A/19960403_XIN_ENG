<HEADLINE> GCC Strives to Establish Unified Customs Tariffs System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Secretariat is currently working on formulating a unified
customs tariffs scheme toward non-GCC members, the Kuwait News
Agency (KUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The GCC Assistant Secretary General for Economic Affairs, Abdul
Latif Al-Meqrin, told KUNA today that the secretariat had been
looking for a new formula to replace the current goods'
classification method.
</P>
<P>
Meqrin said the secretariat was keen on formulating the new
scheme to be presented to the upcoming meeting of the GCC finance
and economic committee due to be held in early June.
</P>
<P>
Meqrin, who was speaking after a meeting of the trade and
commerce chambers in the GCC, said the secretariat was committed
to the outcome of the GCC Muscat Summit, which was held in Oman in
December 1995, during which the leaders demanded that the customs
tariffs scheme be drafted by mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the GCC's unified tariffs is the main part
of an economic pact aimed at creating a common market, which could
give birth to one of the biggest consumer blocks in the world,
with imports of more than 50 billion U.S. dollars and a gross
domestic product (GDP) of some 200 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
A GCC technical committee completed categorizing 970 out of
1,278 goods according to the three main international categories.
</P>
<P>
Meqrin said if the committee failed to reach the desired
formula, it would stop its meetings. But if the formula was
agreed upon by the GCC finance ministers, it would be referred to
the forthcoming GCC summit.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the Saudi Chambers of Trade and
Commerce, Abdullah Al-Dabagh, said it was very important to
establish a unified customs tariffs scheme in the GCC to confront
the world economic challenges.
</P>
<P>
Dabagh said if the scheme was not attained, "the GCC States
will not be effective enough in their meetings with international
economic powers."
</P>
<P>
The GCC "cannot establish its economic regional bloc unless it
establishs the custom union. Our trade partners will not
seriously deal with us if the bloc is not founded," added Dabagh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meqrin said the GCC Secretariat had briefed the
heads of the commerce chambers on the power link-up among the GCC
member states, which had already been endorsed by the GCC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Muscat summit had endorsed the power connection project and
called on the private sector to finance it. Its primary cost was 2
billion dollars and is expected to save 24 billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the GCC finance and electricity undersecretaries
had assigned the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consultancy to
study the feasibility of the project.
</P>
<P>
Meqrin said the Bahraini Chamber of Commerce had proposed the
establishment of a Gulf Bank to finance Gulf projects, but the
participants showed disagreement. They argued that there were
other Gulf financial institutions that could do the job instead.
</P>
<P>
However, a committee comprising the secretaries general of the
GCC trade and commerce chambers was formed to discuss the
possibility of holding a meeting among factories' owners in the
Gulf and their European counterparts, Meqrin said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Children's Education Deteriorated in Tanzania: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is experiencing a
deteriorating period for children's education, a senior official in
the Ministry of Community Development,Women and Children Affairs
has noted.
</P>
<P>
In a paper on the children and women situation in Tanzania
prepared for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) high
level review meeting, which was held here today, Ms. Priscilla
Ole Kambaine, Director of Women and Children Affair in the
minstry said that the situation was illustrated by declining
school enrolment rates, increasing number of school dropouts and
poor perfomance rates, particularly for girls.
</P>
<P>
She said, school aged children enrolled in primary school
declined from 96 percent in 1980 to 74 percent in 1994 and that
the proportion of children enrolled in a grade corresponding with
their age declined from 70 to 53 per- cent.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the fact has put Tanzania at a level
almost equivalent to other sub-Saharan countries and far from the
goal of universal primary education.
</P>
<P>
She said that dropouts rates increased from 17 percent in 1976
to 34 percent in 1986. The main reason for school dropouts is
poverty or inadequate means to meet the costs of schooling, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Link Between BSE and CJD Not Confirmed by  WHO Expert Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Doubts remain about a link between
mad cow disease and a new fatal human brain disorder as an
international expert meeting here ended Wednesday with a vague
conclusion and advices to minimize any human risk arising from
eating beef.
</P>
<P>
"A link has not yet been proven between the newly-recognized
variant of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (V-CJD) in the United Kingdom
and the effective exposure to the BSE agent", concluded the April
2-3 symposium organized by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
But circumstantial evidence suggests exposure to BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathies, namely mad cow disease) may be the
most likely explanation, it was added.
</P>
<P>
To verify the link needs further studies, on both V-CJD and
BSE, according to WHO at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
BSE, or Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE)
occurring in cattle, was first identified in 1986 in UK and has
since caused over 160,000 cases there and over 100 others
elsewhere in Europe. The BSE agent is allegedly attributed to 10
cases in UK of its human equivalent, V-CJD, including eight
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The suspected link was officially announced by London on March
20 and has since provoked public panic and a ban on British beef
importation by many countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
It was reiterated at Wednesday's news conference that the 10
V-CJD cases, if any link with BSE true, were most likely
contracted before 1989 when the British government launched
sanitary measures to check the cow epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The steps taken regarding cattle feed and the removal of bovine
offal from market along with other precautionary measures at farm,
slaughter and meat processing levels, are deemed by WHO as
effective, if strictly implemented, in containing BSE and
consequently reducing any human risk of contracting V-CJD from
eating beef.
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations to minimize any human risk, WHO
suggested no part of animal showing signs of TSE -- which occur in
several animal species, nor tissues likely to contain TSE agent
should enter any food chain, human or animal.
</P>
<P>
Affecting animals' nervous system, TSE agent is often found in
such related tissues as brains and spinal cord and also in lymphs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, said WHO, all countries should ensure the killing and
safe disposal of TSE-affected animals and ban the use of ruminant
tissues in ruminant feed.
</P>
<P>
WHO also urged efforts towards rapid TSE diagnosis. According to
experts at the news conference, testing technology need to be improved
so as to identify TSE infections as early as possible. It often takes
four to five years for an animal to develop TSE after being infected.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed any human risk could be reduced to minimal with
the measures they recommended being strictly carried out. However,
they said, complete safety is not possible.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary and medical experts attending the WHO meeting considered
milk and milk products are safe as milk does not transmit BSE agent.
So are gelatin and tallow produced under effective rendering
procedures, which, they said, can inactivate the BSE infectivity.

</P>
<P>
"The government believes that the climate of tension and
friction in relations between Greece and Turkey must change and be
replaced by one of calm and the strengthening of ties and
friendship and cooperation,"government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added however that this could not be achieved
through "phrasal compliments", particularly when the latter were
accompanied by actions to the contrary.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanese Government Reiterates Ban on Street Demonstrations (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Responding to a decision of labor
unions to stage a protest sit-in coincidently with French
President Jacques Chirac's visit to Lebanon, the Lebanese
government tonight reiterated a ban on street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lebanese government also announced that it was
determined to continue the dialogue with the General Workers
Confederation (GWC).
</P>
<P>
The powerful GWC, which groups various trade unions with an
estimated membership of 400,000, took the decision last week to
stage the protest sit-in in front of the parliament building on
April 4, to coincide a scheduled address to be made by Chirac in
the 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a notification handed to the Interior Ministry, the GWC
said that it would carry out the action "in protest against the
government's failure to meet demands of the workers and the
people."
</P>
<P>
In another notification to House Speaker Nabih Berri, the
confederation said that it "sees in the Council of Deputies (the
parliament) the competent authority capable to correct the track
of the government and its intention to ignore the righteous
demands."
</P>
<P>
The GWC is demanding a 76 percent rise in wages in private and
public sectors and a doubling of the minimum wage level to
500,000 Lebanese pounds (313 U.S. dollars) from the present 250,000
Lebanese pounds.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the government to scrap the three-year-old
demonstration ban and suspend the implementation of a
controversial law on organizing the country's private broadcast
media industry.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a regular session of the Council of Ministers,
government spokesman and Information Minister Farid Mkari
stressed that that the demand raised by the labors for a wage
increase should be resolved by a dialogue with the employers in
which the government could play a role of "arbitrator."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the GWC for a stop of the dialogue and the
decision to stage the sit-in on the occasion when Lebanon is
receiving its state guest.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the measures the government would take
to confront the sit-in, the information minister reiterated the
government's "well-known and clear" decision of banning street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that his government would continue the dialogue
with the GWC until a solution is achieved satisfying all the
sides. "But if the GWC insists on the sit-in, the government is
against this sit-in especially at a time when the country is
receiving its state guest."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lebanese Defense Minister Mohsen Dalloul
stressed today that the army would work to guarantee a successful
visit of French President Chirac to Lebanon and would "not allow
anyone to ruin the safe circumstance of this visit."
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon is making efforts to eliminate the Israeli
occupation and Chirac's visit would help reach this goal.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Berri said earlier that the sit-in planned by the
GWC "is tantamount to collaboration with Israel to undermine
Chirac's visit and this is completely unacceptable during this
historic visit."
</P>
<P>
He said he would order security forces to stop the labor
protest Thursday in front of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the GWC is facing an increasing pressure
to put off the sit-in or change the venue in order to avert an
embarrassment during Chirac's visit, the first by a serving French
president since Lebanon gained independence from the French
mandate in 1943.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's three top leaders, President Elias Hrawi, House
Speaker Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri held this morning
their third meeting in one week to weight a united stand on the
labors' move.

contribute further to the existing good ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president praised Shevardnadze as a "great
statesman who has a great knowledge of world and regional
affairs," adding that "The close cooperation of Turkey and Georgia
on regional issues is closely tied up with the close interests of
the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that apart from political issues, he will hold
talks on economic cooperation with his Georgian counterpart
Shevardnadze, saying that a host of agreements would be signed
during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said
Monday that Demirel and Shevardnadze would also discuss the
Soupsa-Ceyhan oil pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
The projected pipeline from the Georgian port of Soupsa to the
Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan is an alternative route for
transporting oil produced in the Caspian region.

<HEADLINE> Finance Policy Will Not Change, Says S. African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's finance policy
would remain unchanged as incoming Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
steped into the shoes of his predecessor Chris Liebenberg on
Thursday, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Cape Town residence,
Mandela said Manuel would follow exactly the same policies
initiated by his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the sharp fall in the local currency rand on the
financial market, Mandela said the currency had been low for some
time.
</P>
<P>
Manuel, former Trade and Industry Minister, was appointed to
take over Liebenberg's post in a cabinet reshuffle announced by
Mandela on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outgoing Finance Minister Liebenberg said he was
not worried about the rand's weakening against major foreign
currencies, saying the fundamentals were still in place.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg said South Africa was not going to throw away its
foreign reserves defending the rand.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuations in the value of the currency were to be
expected, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said the rand was off its earlier all-time
lows against the dollar by midday on Wednesday, but remained weak
in an extremely volatile market.
</P>
<P>
The local unit hit an all-time low of 4.11 to the dollar in
intra-day trade, before recovering to 4.09 at midday. It closed
at 4.0075 on Tuesday. The previous record low was 4.03, reached
on February 21 amid rumours Mandela was ill. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Tries to Ease Beef Crisis Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- British Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg told the parliament this afternoon that the
government was taking measures to ensure that slaughterhouses
would begin processing beef again, which has been interrupted by
the wave of the mad cow disease scare for past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is being attacked by both the European Union
and British farmers for failing to act quickly and decisively
enough to eliminate BSE, known as the mad cow disease, said that
public confidence in British beef is beginning to return.
</P>
<P>
He told the House of Commons that government officials are
working on a quality assurance scheme based on identifying
BSE-free Herds.
</P>
<P>
Hogg accused the EU of offering an "unhelpful"response to the
beef crisis and refusing to lift its worldwide ban on British beef
exports.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the British government is still holding a
difficult bargaining with the EU on how to overcome the beef
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The British government is reported to have won the EU backing
to destroy more than four million older cattle in the next six
years and remove them from the food chain.
</P>
<P>
But the EU criticized Britain for refusing to provide detailed
figures on the incidence of BSE in the UK to other EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
The EU is considering paying 70 percent of the cost of
Britain's slaughter program, instead of the 80 percent demanded by
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mean while, Germany and Belgium are opposed to the proposal that
the EU would buy up meat from British bulls and steers at
competitive prices to prop up the market.
</P>
<P>
Germany also insisted that the only solution that would satisfy
the Bonn government would be for Britain to slaughter all herds
with any record of BSE infection.
</P>
<P>
Britain now is given until April 30 to produce comprehensive
plans for the selective culling of herds positively identified
with BSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 3 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Charles Millon left Riyadh this afternoon, winding up a two-day
visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference this morning, the French minister
said he has had lengthy talks with Saudi Defense Minister Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz on matters of mutual concern to the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Millon added that during the talks he had expressed "France's
conviction that Saudi Arabia was maintaining regional balance of
power as well as security."
</P>
<P>
He said that "France is pleased with the efforts done within
the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and with
the GCC role in maintaining balance of power and security in the
region."
</P>
<P>
According to the Saudi Press Agency, their talks also covered
ways of combating terrorism, the outcome of the Sharm el-Sheikh
summit conference during which Saudi Arabia and France held
identical views, the situation in Iraq, and matters related to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Millon said he had expressed his country's hope that Iran would
regain its position in the international community. But, he said,
this would require that "Iran be committed to a clear-cut policy,
averting any practices that distort public order in the region and
avoiding such behaviors as giving rise to the present criticism
and creating tension in the region."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the sealing off of Palestinian territories
by Israel, the French minister spelled out "the necessity of
maintaining the peace process through negotiations," adding that
his government will "spare no effort to see the negotiations
resumed under the best possible conditions."
</P>
<P>
The French defense minister arrived in Riyadh Tuesday on his
second visit to Saudi Arabia in less than six months.

<HEADLINE> Oil Revenues of OPEC Member States Increase in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The revenues of the OPEC member
states from oil sales reached 141.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995,
recording an increase of 13 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC), the oil revenues of the members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were 124.9
billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase in revenues was due to a rise in oil prices and
exports, the state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the only OPEC member whose oil revenues dropped last
year, the report said. Its oil revenues decreased by 8.1 percent
from those in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that all OPEC members, with the exception
of Iraq and Libya, increased their oil exports in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia earned an estimated 48 billion dollars from oil
sales last year as compared with 43.4 billion dollars in the
previous year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
OPEC expects oil prices to drop if Iraq accepts a U.N. offer
which will allow it to sell a certain amount of oil to purchase
badly-needed food and medicines, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has called on both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to
shoulder their responsibility to deal with a possible return of
Iraq to the world oil market.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Attacks Terrorist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Legal Affairs Minister Remm
Mushota today described death threats to ministers from a secret
group called Black Mamba (poisonous snake) as a move by
desperate people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Zambia television, Mushota said Zambians should look
for democratic ways of gaining political power rather than by threats
because the latter would spoil the good image the country had enjoyed
ever since.
</P>
<P>
Mushota noted that such threats would give a set back to the
government's efforts to attract investment both from local and
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the government had some information that opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP) and Zambia Democratic
Congress (ZDC) were behind the secret group.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government did not want to intervene with the
professional investigations of the police.
</P>
<P>
But earlier, the two opposition parties outrightly denied their
linkage to Black Mamba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister reiterated that the government would still
go ahead to recommend the adoption of the draft constitution by
parliament because there was no legal provision in Zambia for a
constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 10 ministers and deputy ministers as
well as speaker of the national assembly have received the death
threats sent by Black Mamba through anonymous letters.
</P>
<P>
The group threatened to eliminate ministers and the speaker if
they insisted on adoption of the draft constitution by
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties and other organizations have demanded the
government to adopt the new constitution through a constituent
assembly and a national referendum.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Water supply was partially resumed
in the Angolan capital Luanda today after a two-week suspension.
</P>
<P>
Water supply in Luanda was suspended on March 18 after
succesive rains destroyed high-tension transmission lines in
the city.
</P>
<P>
To overcome difficulties caused by the water suspension, the
city government assembled a number of tank trucks to carry water
for the citizens. However, the water supplied was obtained from
rivers and it could not meet the demand of the citizens since it
was limited in quantity and inferior in quality.
</P>
<P>
As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel
generators in the city's running water plant to ensure
power supply. But the plant could not operate at its full
capacity, due to the shortage of power. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK to Impose Tougher Sentences on Persistent Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government unveiled
this afternoon new plans to introduce tougher sentences for
persistent offenders.
</P>
<P>
In order to crack down on the mounting crime, British Home
Secretary Michael Howard told the parliament that those repeatedly
committing sexual and violent offences would get life terms, while
early release would be abolished automatically.
</P>
<P>
People convicted of dealing in hard drugs on more than three
occasions would get a minimum term of seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
And persistent burglars would be jailed for a minimum of three
years, along with seizing their assets.
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament that he wanted to ensure that criminals
were properly punished and he promised +honesty in sentencing+.
</P>
<P>
That means, he explained, that in future there will be no
automatic early release and prisoners will have to earn remission
by their good behavior.
</P>
<P>
The home secretary, who launched a white paper detailing the
above said plans, said that it is expected that the prison
population will rise by 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the changes in sentencing will have to be phased in,
to allow a dozen new prisons to be built.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that he plans to introduce a bill on this issue in
the next session of parliament.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The trial of senior officials
of Ethiopia's former Mengistu regime will resume here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Central High Court were quoted by the
Ethiopian News Agency today as saying that the court will listen
to prosecution evidences on the genocide and crime against
humanity they were accused.
</P>
<P>
The trial of former government officials and military officers
started on December 13, 1994. Of the 66 former government
officials and military officers, including former president
Mengistu Haile-Mariam and former acting president Tesfaye
Gebre-Kidan, 45 were brought into dock.
</P>
<P>
Those who were on trial in absentia include Mengistu and
Tesfaye. Mengistu is living in exile in Zimbabwe while Tesfaye is
now hiding in the Italian embassy here for asylum.
</P>
<P>
The charges filed by the special prosecutor range from
genocide to abuse of power committed by the officials
individually or collectively as members of the then ruling
Military Council.
</P>
<P>
According to an over 200-page dossier distributed to the
defendants and their defense lawyers on November 28, 1995, the
charges leveled against the defendants included among others the
detention of 2,394 civilians and the confiscation of property
worth about 11 million Birr (less than 2 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The court was adjourned from February 13, 1996 at the request
of the special prosecutor who wanted to have enough time to
collect full evidences and due to the absence from court by two
of the defendants because of illnesses.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Promises Referendum on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government has promised
here today to hold a national referendum on the crucial single
currency issue if the Parliament decides to take Britain into the
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told a press conference today
"We have decided to make a commitment in our election manifesto
that if the government decided to join a single currency during
the course of the next parliament, that decision would be subject
to confirmation in a referendum."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said that the government believed a referendum would be
necessary as the currency issue would not be resolved at a general
election.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet would first decide on whether to join, with the
decision passed to Parliament if ministers decided to go in, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the all-party European Movement said that it would
spearhead the fight for a "yes" vote. Former minister Edwina
Currie said she was very pleased that the government "however
grudgingly," was moving towards a single currency.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Prime Minister John Major hopes the the
referendum pledge will heal deep splits in the Conservative party
over its European policy, enabling it to concentrate on preparing
for the election to be held in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The European Union hopes to launch a single European currency
in 1999, but many Conservatives consider joining the single
currency as a dangerous move towards a federal Europe with power
concentrated in Brussels.

NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Unknown gunmen attacked Makamba,
a town in southern Burundi today, killing at least one people and
ransacking a hospital, the relief organization Doctors without
Borders (MSF) said.
</P>
<P>
A doctor was killed and all medical staff fled in the attack,

</P>
<P>
MSF said it was unclear how many people were killed and
wounded. It disclosed that its medical team had left the town but
would like to return as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that similar attacks on Karuzi, a region north of
Makamba, had compelled 12,000 people to escape to nearby refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
It hinted that the raids were made by Hutu rebels and urged
them to spare civilians and respect the neutrality of medical aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers accused Hutu rebels of killing at least 100
civilians in recent attacks in southwestern Burundi. Survivors in
the small central African state complained that hundreds of
civilians may have been slaughtered, including women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people have been killed in the small central

HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Resolving the twin issues of land
ownership and black economic empowerment will be the priority of
the government after the recent presidential election, Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge said today.
</P>
<P>
He told foreign diplomats here that resolving the issues of
black land hunger and black empowerment in business, as
highlighted in President Robert Mugabe's election campaign, were
not an electioneering gimmick but would now be the government's
major preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
As for black economic empowerment, better known as
indigenization, Mudenge said the government wanted to create
opportunities for black people to find a meaningful role in the
economic life of their country, which was denied them in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"I need to make it known, in case there are misunderstandings
that as far as both questions are concerned, the government does
not seek revenge, victimization, or any form of racist treatment
against the white members of our community. We have no intention
of robbing Tom to give Jack," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"There is, therefore, a great need to look after their
particular needs to create a more equitable distribution of
wealth in the country," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, ruled by British settlers for almost 90 years until
independence in 1980, still has a skewed land ownership pattern
with most of the country's agricultural land owned by some 4,500
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would always try to improve on the
achievements to date in the area of good governance, the rule of
law, protection of human rights and the quest for justice.
</P>
<P>
On the international scene, Mudenge said, the end of the cold
war had improved the world situation and created conditions for
slowing down the arms race.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Zimbabwe will next week sign the convention
making Africa a nuclear free zone, he said, adding that Zimbabwe
is also in the process of ratifying the chemical weapons
convention.

<HEADLINE> European Monetary Union under Threat, Says Bank Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The launch of a single European
currency in 1999 is under threat because of the recent slowdown in
Europe's economies, the Governor of the Bank of England Eddie
George conceded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting in Frankfurt of the European Monetary
Institute (EMI), the forerunner of the planned European Central
Bank, George highlighted the poor record of member states on
curbing public deficits, one of the key convergence targets of the
Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
This has been caused by higher than planned levels of public
spending as governments in several European Union economies have
been caught in the trap between lower tax revenues and burgeoning
social security payments, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EMI's annual report, published Tuesday, accepts that in the
large majority of the 15 EU member states, public deficits were
well in excess of the levels needed to meet the criteria for a
single currency.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia, who
have been vowing to topple the Afghan government led by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, today offered to negotiate with Rabbani's
regime, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri, who was on a
one-day visit to Kabul, was quoted as saying, "The number two of
the Taliban, Mohammed Rabbani, told us his movement was ready to
negotiate".
</P>
<P>
"They say they are ready to talk tomorrow, and these words are
in the mouth of the Taliban for the very first time," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban are ready to talk and President Rabbani is
ready to talk, this is already something," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said if the Taliban's offer for talks is serious, it
will be a significant change in its policy.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Taliban had refused to hold negotiations with the
Rabbani's government and repeatedly said it would not consider
sharing power with any other factions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on SEZ's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng urged special
economic zones to speed up their adjustment of product mix,
advancing new and hi-tech industries, and developing
higher-quality products to increase competitiveness both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during Li's visit to Shenzhen, Zhuhai and
Zhongshan cities in south China's Guangdong Province, from March
30 to April 3.
</P>
<P>
Li was accompanied by Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Xie Fei,
Guangdong Party Secretary and a member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that since the initiation of the opening up
and reform policy more than a decade ago, the economy in the
special economic zones and open coastal areas has been growing
rapidly and both the "hard" and "soft" environment for talents
and for investment has improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
He noted that speeding up the pace of product mix adjustment
and improving products is imperative. Equally important is
encouraging ordinary processing industries to move to the central
and western parts of the country to develop new and hi-tech
industries, increasing development strength by using both domestic
and foreign funds, and applying advanced technology and management
expertise.
</P>
<P>
Li called on more prosperous areas to develop higher-quality
products and pillar industries, to set up a number of enterprise
groups to improve overall quality and efficiency, and make even
greater progress in developing an export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the coastal open areas should place cultural
and ideological progress in a more eminent position while
promoting material development.
</P>
<P>
Booming areas should still give free rein to the pioneering
spirit which was popular in the special economic zones at their
early stage, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that efforts should be made in enhancing
education to raise the quality of the whole people, improving all
facets of social security, and creating a better social
environment for investment, work, and living.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that the special economic zones should
serve as examples in economic construction, opening-up, reforms,
and in cultural and ideological progress as well.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the local customs, Li said it is necessary
to increase customs officials' competence and bring up to date the
equipment so as to beef up crackdown on smuggling activities with
coordinated efforts by relevant departments.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Groups Condemn Police Brutality in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Civil rights groups and Latin
American communities Tuesday condemned police officers' clubbing
of two Mexicans in California, calling it a pattern of violence and
racial abuse among law-enforcement officers not only in Southern
California but across the nation as well.
</P>
<P>
Two police officers were video-taped clubbing two suspected
illegal immigrants from Mexico Monday after a high speed chase in
Riverside County.
</P>
<P>
A white Sheriff's deputy, wielding a baseball-bat-like baton,
clubbed a man on the back and shoulders, even as the man fell,
face down, on the ground. He also beat a woman in the back with
the baton, then grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the
ground. At least another white deputy struck her with his baton.
</P>
<P>
The woman was identified as Leticia Gonzalez, 32, of Xochexa,
Mexico and man as Enrique Funez, 30.
</P>
<P>
The clubbing was video-taped by TV news helicopters and aired
on nationwide TV networks, provoking furious public condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Latinos demonstrated outside the Federal Building in
Los Angeles, declaring the beating an example of "institutional
violence against the Latino community."
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is an ugly reminder of the violent hate
crimes that several police officers engage in to manifest their
hatred towards minorities," said Hector Brolo, national president
of the Mexican American Political Association.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union reprimanded the Sheriff's
Department of Riverside County for "woefully deficient" efforts to
diversify its force. Although Latino population topped 25 percent
in the county two years ago, only 13 percent of sworn officers are
Latino.
</P>
<P>
A group representing 15 civil rights groups also blamed the
incident on rising anti-immigrant sentiment across the nation.
"This is what gave these officers permission in their minds... to
do what they did with impunity," said Joe Hicks, executive
director of Multicultural Collaborative.
</P>
<P>
Public outrage prompted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to
open a civil rights investigation into the clubbing. When asked
President Clinton's reaction, White House press secretary Mike
McCurry said: "He's concerned."
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, a video-taped beating of black motorist Rodney
King by white police offices led to a riot in Los Angeles. During
the three-day riot, 58 people were killed and nearly 3,000 others
were injured.

<HEADLINE> UN Peace Mission to Move into Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The UN peace mission to
Afghanistan would move to the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad
next week, reports coming from Kabul said today.
</P>
<P>
UN special envoy to Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri, who was on a
one-day visit to Kabul, was quoted as saying that his mission
would move to Jalalabad from its present office in Islamabad next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that it would be the first time for the UN to
set up a base in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We will be moving to Jalalabad next week in order to be closer
to Kabul and the other major Afghan centers," Mestiri said.  "The
decision to move was taken by the UN secretary general following
my reports to him."
</P>
<P>
He said the move would give his mission easier access to Kabul
and the provincial strongholds including Kandahar, Herat,
Mazar-i-Sharif and Bamyan.
</P>
<P>
Jalalabad, which is 180 kilometers east of Kabul, lies on the
main road linking the besieged Afghan capital with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri said his mission had planned to move to Kabul, but UN
officials vetoed the plan for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been under regular rocket attacks allegedly launched
by the Taliban Militia since last October when Taliban advanced to
only five kilometers away from the city.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move was significant for the UN peace efforts
in Afghanistan. The UN has been repeatedly criticized for failing
to maintain a permanent presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The move could also affect other UN agencies which maintain
only sub-offices in Afghanistan, the analysts added.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: U.S. Commerce Secretary's Plane  Reportedly Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March (Xinhua)-- A plane carrying U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown crashed a few miles outside Dubrovnik,
Croatia, today, the Associated Press quoting diplomatic sources in
Europe reported.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic source in Dubrovnik, Croatia said Brown's plane
went down in stormy weather near that city.
</P>
<P>
In Sarajevo, Capt. Jorst Fohmann, a spokesman for the NATO-led
forces in Bosnia, said that there had been a plane crash in a
mountainous area near Dubrovnik but was not able to confirm
whether that had been the plane carrying Brown from Tuzla, the
main base for U.S. troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon source said wreckage of a crashed plane had been
spotted in the area where Brown's plane was reported missing. But
this source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the wreckage
had not been positively identified as the aircraft carrying Brown
and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
Because of the reported crash, U.S. President Clinton canceled
a noon appearance at the Justice Department where he was to
discuss anti-gang programs, Justice officials said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Secretary had planned to spend three days in
Bosnia and Croatia, meeting with American troops, government
figures and local business leaders.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Defends Raising of Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A minister today said the widely
criticized fuel price hike on Monday was a collective decision
made by the government and local oil companies following an 11
percent decline of the local currency against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Economists criticized the increase as a move that will have a
negative impact on the economy, increase commodity prices, fuel
inflation and erode disposable imcomes.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Energy Minister Simon Moyo said this scenario
had portrayed the government as "irresponsible," a perception was
far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
Defending the increase, Moyo said it was not the
responsibility of his ministry alone to raise or increase fuel
prices as portrayed by "some uninformed or misinformed
individuals or organizations".
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the increase was the result of the 11
percent decline of the Zimbabwe Dollar since July last year
thereby increasing costs which have to be paid in foreign
currency, did not make the government irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, petrol went up by three percent, diesel by nine
percent and aviation fuels by between 17 and 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Factory Orders in U.S. Down Sharply in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Factory orders in U.S. plunged
by 1.4 percent in February, the largest decrease in 10 months, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due mostly to a huge decline in the volatile
transportation sector. Orders excluding transportation were up
slightly by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 304.4 billion
dollars in February, down from 308.8 billion in January.
</P>
<P>
It was the second decline in three months and the steepest
since orders fell 2.2 percent last April.
</P>
<P>
Orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's manufacturing
strength and an increase could lead to greater production and more
jobs.
</P>
<P>
In February, the transportation orders plunged by 11.7 percent
after a 3 percent fall in January. Orders for durable goods fell
by 2.3 percent and orders for nondurable goods were down by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing economy has been weak for months. It rose by
6.7 percent last year comparing to a 10.3 percent gain in 1994.
The weakness is just part of the sluggishness that had affected
much of the overall economy which grew only 0.5 percent at an
annual rate in the final quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders inched up 0.1 percent, the sixth
straight increase. A growing backlog suggests more jobs and longer
production lines may be needed to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Inventories, another sign of future activity, edged up 0.2
percent after a 0.7 percent advance in January. That resulted in a
1.39 inventories-to-shipments ratio, down from 1.40 a month
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Daily: Serbs to Become Minority in Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A drastic drop in the birth rate
is threatening to reduce Serbs in Serbia to a minority group, the
Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti said today.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Professor Marko Mladenovic as saying that Serb
population would be sharply reduced soon unless the Serbs realized
that bearing children and unselfishly raising families was their
most important task.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1991 census, Serbia, which formed the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia with Montenegro in 1991, had a population
of 9,778,991, of whom 6,446,595 were Serbs, 139,299 Montenegrin,
323,625 Yugoslavs, 1,674,353 ethnic Albanians, 342,942 ethnic
Hungarians, 246,411 Muslims, 140,237 Gypsies, 105,406 ethnic
Croats, and 26,876 ethnic Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
According to demographic estimates, the population in central
Serbia will be reduced by a third in a few decades, while ethnic
Albanians populating Serbia's southern Kosovo province will
double, said Mladenovic.
</P>
<P>
The average annual birth rate is 2.02 percent in Kosovo and
Metohija, 0.8 percent in central Serbia and 0.18 percent in the
northern Vojvodina province.
</P>
<P>
In central Serbia, however, the number of births and deaths is
approximately the same, while in Vojvodina the mortality is even
higher than birth rate. But in Kosovo the birth rate exceeds the
death rate seven times.
</P>
<P>
Conducive to the drop of population in Serbia is the departure
of young Serbs from Yugoslavia, Mladenovic said, adding that half
a million youths had left the country in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Mladenovic warned that if this trend continues, the birth rate
in Serbia would drop to half of the death rate, thus plunging the
Serbs into minorities in Serbia in the future with only old people
remaining in the area.

<HEADLINE> Drug Campaign Intensified in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Narcotics Control
Commission today convened a plenary session, at which it urged
local governments to intensify the fight against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that by the end of 1995, 520,000 people
in China were registered as drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
Since the National People's Congress's Decision on Eradicating
Illegal Dealing in Narcotics was promulgated in 1990, all local
governments have adopted effective measures in the anti-drug
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, China's police dealt with 57,524
cases, arrested 73,734 offenders, and confiscated 2,376 kilograms
of heroin, 1,110 kilograms of opium, and 466 kilograms of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The same year, customs handled 30 cases, and confiscated 52
kilograms of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Last year China arrested 12,990 persons involved in drugs,
9,801 of whom were convicted, with 2,032 having been sentenced to
death or life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had opened 565 drug
rehabilitation centers, treating some 80,000 drug abusers every
year.
</P>
<P>
The commission acknowledged that the current situation is
stark, noting that the number of drug abusers in the country is on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, a national conference will be held
this year to work out plans on the anti-drug campaign for the next
five years.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Ponders Over Signing SADC Water Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia today declined to state
when it will sign the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) protocol on shared water resources, saying it needs more
time to study the document.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Water Development Minister Edith Nawakwi told
reporters here that Zambia is approaching the issues cautiously
due to the critical importance of the Zambezi River waters to
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
She explained that sharing of the Zambezi River water in such
ways as individual countries tapping from it would have more
consequences on Zambia than any other state in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Zambezi, the largest river in the region emptying its
water in the Indian Ocean, has part of its source in Zambia and
forms boders with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister denied that Zambia is frustrating
regional cooperation in the water sector by dragging its feet

<HEADLINE> City Regulator to Face MP's Question over Barings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA), the City regulator, is to be summoned to appear
within weeks before a committee of MPs to explain its decision to
discipline a former Barings executive.
</P>
<P>
The Independent reported today that the SFA will be questioned
by the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee over its move
to discipline Ian Hopkins, former head of group treasury and risk
at Barings.
</P>
<P>
Other former executives who may be called before the committee
include Andrew Tuckey, deputy chairman at the bank, and Peter
Norris, former head of securities.
</P>
<P>
Hopkins is thought to have approached the committee after a
move by the SFA to ban him from working within the industry for up
to three years and make him pay costs of 10,000 pounds (15,200
U.S. dollars) for his role in the bank's collapse.
</P>
<P>
Nine former Barings executives, including Hopkins, are said to
be facing disciplinary action by the SFA.
</P>
<P>
However, Hopkins is understood to see himself as a
whistleblower, who drew the activities of Nick Leeson, the
Singapore trader who caused Barings collapse, to the bank's
attention months earlier.
</P>
<P>
One MP said: "The SFA has a lot to answer for. I hope we will
be calling on them to appear before the Committee and tell us why
they have taken this prejudiced stand against a brave
whistleblower like Hopkins."

<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin
officially registered himself as a candidate for the June
presidential polls at the Central Electoral Commission today.
</P>
<P>
The initiative group which nominated Yeltsin submitted the
registration documents and 1.37 million signatures in support of
his re-election bid, which was declared on February 15.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's fate depends on how people vote," Yeltsin told the
commission, "They can vote to keep the reins of power and they can
also vote to lose them."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was afraid of failure, Yeltsin told reporters,
"I am nervous because the fight will not be easy and rivals are
strong. But I am not scared and I will fight hard."
</P>
<P>
After registration, Yeltsin will have the right to formally
launch his re-election campaign. He is expected to declare his
election platform on April 6.
</P>
<P>
The only other candidate registered is Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, who is regarded as Yeltsin's strongest rival in
the presidential polls scheduled for June 16.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Electricity Export Earnings Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange earnings
from export of electricity to its neighbors has been doubled in
the past four years, a Zambian minister revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Water Development Minister Edith Nawakwi told
reporters here that the electricity export earnings have been
increased by 5.5 million US Dollars per year since 1991, bringing
the total annual amount to about 42 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said before the present government came into power
more than four years ago, electricity exports stagnated at some
20 million Dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
This was a great improvement in power exports within the
period, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said the government intends to privatize state-owned
electricity companies in the long term, but the private sector is
now free to enter the power industry to generate electricity for
both home consumption and export.
</P>
<P>
She expressed hope that power exports would be boosted when
the private sector begins to participate in power generation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia exports electricity to Zimbabwe and
Tanzania.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev and his visiting Polish counterpart, Stanislaw Dobrzanski,
have agreed to resume military cooperation between their two
countries but were divided over the issue of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today after their talks, Grachev
said that the resumption of military cooperation is a big step
forward since 1993 when it was scaled down substantially following
Poland's application for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
He said that a joint team of experts would be set up to make
detailed plans for military cooperation, which will include joint
military exercises in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poland had also offered Russia the use of its naval facilities
in exchange for Russian military equipment, a proposal yet to be
further consulted between the two sides, Grachev said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of NATO's eastward expansion, the two sides were
as divided as ever.
</P>
<P>
Grachev acknowledged that Poland has the right to apply to join
NATO, but at the same time warned that Russia would reconsider its
military partnership with Poland once it joins the Western
alliance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Private Spending, Income Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in the U.S.
rebounded strongly in February while personal incomes were also
up, the U.S. Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the consumer spending shot up 1.1
percent after falling 0.4 percent in January. It was the steepest
gain since a 1.7 percent surge in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending--two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity--totaled 5.07 trillion dollars at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, up from 5.01 trillion in January.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods increased at an annual rate of 28.7
billion dollars while those on nondurable goods and services were
up 3.5 billion and 23.6 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
Still, many analysts expect spending to remain sluggish this
year because of weak income growth, large debt accumulations and
worries over the health of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In February, personal incomes in U.S. grew 0.8 percent to an
annual rate of 6.3 trillion dollars compared with a small 0.1
percent increase in January. The February growth was the largest
since January 1995, when it was 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase of personal income was mainly due to a sharp gain
of employment. The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier that
payrolls, which plunged by 188,000 in January, shot up by 705,000
in February.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income--income after taxes--jumped 0.7 percent, up
from an anemic 0.2 percent gain in January and matching December's
advance.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending means that Americans'
saving rate--savings as a percentage of disposable income-- was
4.8 percent, down from 5.2 percent a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> UK, Japan to Exchange Trade Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Japan have agreed to
exchange senior officials to help forge closer trade relations
between the two countries, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese recruit has already been chosen and will arrive in
London in June for a two-year stay, and an official of Britain's
department of trade and industry (DTI), yet to be selected, will
go to Tokyo later this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official will be appointed to what is being
described as a senior management position within the DTI's
automotive directorate, a manufacturing sector in which the UK
wants to improve its trading performance with Japan.
</P>
<P>
He will also participate in an analysis of the effectiveness of
UK automotive trade associations, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was part of the DTI's effort to step up exports
to Japan which is seen here as the most important country in
Britain's drive to develop its trade relations with Asia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, UK exports to Japan rose by 26 per cent to 3.8
billion pounds (5.2 billion US dollars), but Japanese exports to
the UK rose to 9.6 billion pounds (14.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang, Britain's trade and industry secretary, said
yesterday that Britain wanted to raise its exports to Japan to 5
billion pounds (7.5 billion US dollars) by 1997-98. The DTI has
already appointed nine export promoters to help UK companies.
</P>
<P>
Lang is to pay a four-day visit to Japan from April 9 to 12. He
will be accompanied by representatives of more than 100 UK
businesses, the biggest ever trade mission to Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Pick up Aircraft Sale Contract with Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Ron Brown today begins a two-day visit to Croatia and Bosnia, the
U.S. aircraft giant Boeing Corp. is confident that it will win a
lucrative contract for the sale of 18 airplanes to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Brown's visit, the Boeing Corp. has given
another boost in chances to pick up the contract worth of 1
billion U.S. dollars for selling Boeing 737 and 757 models to the
state-owned Croatia Airlines. The U.S. Export-Import Bank has
given the green light for medium-term loans to the Croatian
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Because of the war, these loans were not being extended to
Croatia. But the U.S. bank changed last week its policy as the
U.S. government is launching a campaign for aiding the economic
reconstruction in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Brown's trip to the Balkans are more than a dozen
American business leaders including Ronald Woodard, President of
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aircraft sales, the U.S. mission is also
expected to make a pitch for America's North West Airlines to be
named a partner with Croatia Airlines in offering flights to the
United States, Commerce Department officials said.

reassured that the 17,000-strong American peace implementation
troops will pull out of Bosnia at the end of this year on schedule
and they will not pursue suspected war criminals during their stay

at lunch with Washington Post editors and reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine circumstances changing in such a way that we

</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili made the comment when Bosnian authorities and
West European nations have been calling on the United States to
keep the American ground forces longer than planned in the
war-torn former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO forces' success so far in enforcing an end to
the fighting in Bosnia has fortified the Clinton administration's
resolve to withdraw the American troops by December.
</P>
<P>
But delays in assembling the civilian reconstruction effort,
and concerns about the need to resettle hundreds of thousands of
refugees and remove millions of land mines, have generated
warnings from local authorities and some European officials that
the fragile Bosnian peace could collapse without the presence
beyond December of at least a residual NATO force.
</P>
<P>
Shalikashvili made clear that the American troops would not
expand their mission from military tasks into searching for any of
the more than 50 Serbs, Muslims and Croats wanted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Recalling failed efforts by U.S. forces in Somalia to hunt down
a Mogadishu warlord, the General said, "I still have ringing in my
ears" the charges of "mission creep" leveled against American
authorities.

medley on Monday and the 200-meter freestyle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"She is so clever that she can catch what the coach says very
quickly," exclaimed Zhou who has trained the 1.78-meter girl for
one year, "Nowsdays, it's seldom to meet such talented swimmer."
</P>
<P>
In Zhou's view, Chen was a all-around swimmer and one of the
most promising budding stars in China.
</P>
<P>
"She will be a sensation after improving her breaststroke with
more international experiences," Zhou predicted.
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation, coach Han Binyan also hailed Chen for her
great success made at the Tianjin tourney.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with her performance," Han said, "The freestyles
will be her strongest disciplines, especially the middle and
long-distance ones."
</P>
<P>
Chen began to splash in the swimming pool at the age of six and
was enrolled into the national squad in 1993. She accumulated
three golds at the Urban Games in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, last
October.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to test her prowess, Chen was competing in as many
events as she can in the tourney, namely the 200-meter, 400-meter
individual medley, 200-meter, 400-meter and 800-meter freestyles.
</P>
<P>
"Although she is also very powerful in the 200-meter backstroke
she decided to give it up due to tight schedule," Han explained.
</P>
<P>
After the national tourney, Chen will tour to Bangkok for the
Asian Championships later.
</P>
<P>
"I want her to compete in more events in Tianjin so that she
can hold on and perform better in the Championships," Han said.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Reach Agreement on Mad Cow Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- After a two-day marathon meeting
in Luxembourg, agriculture ministers from 15 European Union(EU)
nations finally agreed early today on a plan to resolve the mad
cow crisis threatening the beef industry in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, cattle aged over 30 months in Britain will
be slaughtered and their carcasses will be incinerated.
</P>
<P>
The EU will meet 70 percent of the estimated cost -- 160
million ECUs (about 210 million U.S. dollars) -- of buying cattle
suspected of being infected with the deadly disease, and Britain
will bear the remaining 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain will bear the cost of slaughtering and incinerating the
cattle alone, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The British government has calculated that it may have to kill
some 15,000 cattle aged over 30 months a week for five or six
years to eradicate the disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE).
</P>
<P>
The agreement also requires Britain to present the European
Commission (EC) with a plan on the obligatory slaughter of animals
and/or herds identified as most likely to have been exposed to
BSE-infected meat and bone meal.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, European Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler warned that "any lingering doubt
regarding the United Kingdom program will seriously jeopardize the
early abolition of the UK beef export restriction and undermine
consumer confidence-building actions.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are now right for the restoration of consumer
confidence in beef throughout the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
The measures already in place and those to be adopted will
guarantee that consumers will be able to buy safe beef, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU has imposed a world-wide ban on British beef following
Britain's announcement last month of a possible link between the
mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture ministers' marathon bargaining session, which
began on Monday, was an attempt to reassure consumers that eating
beef would not give them the human version of the incurable
disease.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, British Farm Minister Douglas Hogg attacked
the failure to lift the ban on British beef, which he said was
unjustified.
</P>
<P>
Britain wanted the ban to be lifted by the end of April, but
the final text of the meeting signaled only a review of the ban
within six weeks of when it was originally imposed at the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
Of the EU's 15 members, Britain has the worst record on BSE,
registering 200 or so new cases of the brain infection in cattle
each week.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Party Chief on Anti-Graft Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Party chief Wei Jianxing
said today that it is imperative that the supervisory mechanism of
the anti-graft campaign be improved.
</P>
<P>
Wei said at the Fourth Session of the 10th Beijing Municipal
People's Conference that former Party Secretary Chen Xitong's
problem and the case concerning former Vice-Mayor Wang Baosen
mirror the new issues arising in the Party and in political power
in the course of shifting from a planned economy to a
market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
"We should increase democratic supervision, further improve the
supervisory mechanism, and gradually develop an effective system,
with laws and regulations on corruption to be enacted and improved
by learning from the past and gaining new experiences," he said.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening and reform on the supervisory mechanism must
be conducted on the basis of the Constitution and the Party
Constitution, meanwhile beefing up supervisory mechanism and
introducing and strengthening mechanism for inspiration and
encouragement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the emergence of the incident concerning Chen Xitong
and Wang Baosen is attributed to many factors, it involves the
question of supervision, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the leading cadres' political and ideological
building should be enhanced and importance attached to the
remoulding of their world outlook and outlook on life, and
democracy and legal development should be integrated, Wei said.

<P>
TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The 16-year-old Chen Yan
stole the limelight at the ongoing China's Champions' tourney as
she grabbed the third gold to her medal credit by winning the
women's 400 meters freestyle here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a 1.78-meter triple-gold winner at last year's Urban
Games in Nanjing, clocked 4:11.33 to finish well ahead of second-
and third-placers Zhang Chanying and Wang Luna at 4:15.48 and
4:16.82 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Luo Ping, national 800m freestyle record holder and the
pre-competition favorite, had to settle for the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Chen, from Liaoning province in the northeastern China, swam
home the 400 meters individual medley gold on Monday and the 200m
freestyle on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The teenager has entered a total of five events at the Tianjin
tourney, with 200m individual medley and 800m freestyle, both
slated for Friday.

heats but struggled to the second place in the final at 1:02.98,
0.27 seconds behind Chen's 1:02.71

He was 2.82 seconds slower than her own world best of 1:00.16,
set at the World Championships in Rome two years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, she refused to comment on her performance.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously her time is slow," said Zhou Ming, vice head coach
of the Chinese team. "The result is disappointing for her."

<P>
Zhou also expressed concerns about the prospect of the Chinese
medley relay at the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>

move proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on holding a
referendum on the final status negotiations with the Palestinians.

Characterizing the situation, Arafat told reporters prior to
the meeting that "there is a very serious situation" in the

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Over the past five years, a total
of 700 mayors and vice-mayors in China got advanced training in
urban planning and city management.
</P>
<P>
Another 800 will receive training over the next five years,
according to the country's plans.
</P>
<P>
The program was sponsored by the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Ministry of
Construction, and the China Association for Science and
Technology, as a means of improving the overall level of city
management in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 640 cities, nearly 200 more
than it had in 1990, and although 80 percent of the mayors and
vice-mayors of these cities graduated from universities or
colleges, few of them majored in city management.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Denies Child Labor in Producing Sports Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani manufacturers of
sports goods have strongly refuted allegations of child and bonded
labor in their industry, the official Associated Press of Pakistan
(APP) said today.
</P>
<P>
Football manufacturers in Sailkot, the manufacturing center of
sports goods in Pakistan, denounced the allegations as groundless
and said they were designed to defame the football industry of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen said the allegations were part of "malicious
propaganda" initiated by some unnamed countries.
</P>
<P>
They said Pakistan's law against child labor is very strict and
it is impossible for them to use child labor.
</P>
<P>
The concept of bonded labor in Pakistan is also a creation by
some countries, which is being used to misguide business circles
in the world, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to an APP survey, the stitching of international
standard footballs is a tough and highly technical job entailing
much more power, force and stamina than children can afford.
</P>
<P>
The survey found workers engaged in stitching footballs in
Sailkot were aged between 25 and 35.
</P>
<P>
Sailkot has enjoyed international repute for quality and
standard sports goods and surgical instruments for more than a
century, the APP reported.
</P>
<P>
As a 100-percent export-oriented city, Sailkot is exporting
sports goods and other products to more than 80 countries in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen said they were honored that Sailkot footballs
were used in the last Football World Cup.

SEOUL, April 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people have been
confirmed dead and 45 others injured when a South Korean
inter-city bus plunged into the Namhan River near Yangpyong city
about 40 kilometers west of Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The bus, carrying some 60 people, including students and
shoppers returning from the market, fell into the icy river around
5:30 p.m. local time, a police spokesman was quoted as saying by
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he feared the death toll may rise as some
passengers may have fallen out of the bus into the river as the
vehicle rolled down the embankment.
</P>
<P>
Local policemen and soldiers and an army helicopter were
engaged in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that the accident might have been caused by
speeding, but the exact cause is still under investigation.

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- South China has finished work on
early rice seedlings and has begun to transplant them, while on
the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the growing of
early rice seedlings is going well.
</P>
<P>
The northern and the northwestern parts of the country, which
have been arid during the past seasons, are striving to provide
more water for wheat growing, and the northeast's four provinces
have entered busy spring plowing season.
</P>
<P>
According to an agriculture official, conditions this year are
better than in previous years, with a series of policies
encouraging farming having taken effect.
</P>
<P>
The amount of acreage planted last autumn and winter in China
was nearly 30 million ha, 400,000 ha more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Wheat in the northern part of the country are turning green and
those in the southern part are forming joints, according to the
official, who predicted that the total grain acreage this year
will reach 110 million ha.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that there are some problems because
drought is still vexing the northern part of the country, while
rain and low temperature are affecting the southern part. Also,
some parts of the country still suffer from shortages of chemical
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that a good job must be done in spring
to have a good harvest in the summer and for the whole year.

ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Forein Ministry today
denied a report that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel had
invited Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to the Second U.N. Conference
on Human Settlements (Habitat 2) scheduled to be held in Istanbul
on June 3-14.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers have reported that Demirel sent an
invitation to Baghdad which would enable the Iraqi leader to
appear at the international platform for the first time since
the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told a press conference
that President Demirel had sent invitations as the co-host of
Habitat 2 to some heads of state or governments but that no
invitation was extended to Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Akbel, the Iraqi government had officially informed
Ankara that their diplomats based in Turkey would represent
Iraq at the Habitat meeting.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 to 25,000 officials and Non-Government
Organizations (NGO) representatives will attend the two-week event
on urbanization and housing supply processes.
</P>
<P>
Presidents, prime ministers, and other senior government
officials from some countries are expected to attend the
gathering for the last three days of the last large summit of the
century.
</P>
<P>
However, Akble declined to disclose by name the leaders that
have been invited.

-- Economy Showing Signs of Pickup in Latest Report
</P>
<P>
Battered recently by storms and undermined for months by weak
sales, the economy has been sluggish for most of the last year.
But figures released Tuesday gave some tentative signs that
business could improve this spring. The index of leading
indicators soared 1.3 percent in February, the biggest jump in 20
years, while business inventories appear to have been drawn down
enough to encourage companies to start increasing production soon.

<HEADLINE> England Soccer Team Confirms Far East Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The England soccer team
confirmed here on Wednesday its planned trip to the Far East for
matches against the Chinese national eleven and Hong Kong's Golden
Selection side.
</P>
<P>
England will bring a full line-up of about 25 players including
key striker Alan Shearer, newly crowned "Footballer of the Year"
Les Ferdinand and "Gaza" Paul Gascoigne to play the Hong Kong side
in the Century Challenge Cup here.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Golden Selection in association with
Strata Sports Marketing and promoted by ProEvents Management, the
"star-studded" event is expected to be the best international
friendly ever held in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"After playing against Bulgaria last week, Croatia will be our
next opponent on April 24 and then followed by Hungary on May 18,"
said Brian Scott, Travel Manager of the English Football
Association, at a press conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Far East trip, during which the England team will compete
against the Chinese side in Beijing on May 23 and then the Golden
Selection on May 26 in Hong Kong, is part of England's warming up
program for June's European Championships in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It will be the team's first visit to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 25 leading international players in the team will be
fighting for their places in the Euro '96 squad which will be
finalized the day after they return home from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the team are David Seaman, Tim Flowers, Ian Walker, Gary and
 Philip Neville, Rob Jones, Mark Wright, Steve Howey, Gareth
Southgate, Stuart Pearce, Steve Stone, Ugo Ehiogu, Robert Lee,
Dennis wise, Jamie Redknapp, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Ince, David
Platt, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler, Trevor Sinclair, Peter
Beardsley, Nick Barmby, Teddy Sheringham, Les Ferdinand and Alan
Shearer.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have asked why we'll be rounding off our match
preparation in the Far East. There are several factors,"
explained Scott.
</P>
<P>
"To have stayed home for the last three weeks before the
Championship would have been to risk boredom," he said.
</P>
<P>
To travel out of Europe would also help the team avoid some of
the pressures associated with the Euro '96 tournament as the host
nation, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the players who decided to take the Far East route
rather than the other two options -- South Africa and North
America, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Expand Air, Sea, Ground Links with Central Asian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Tehran was interested in
developing air, sea and ground links with the Central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasm
Zhomarat Tokayev, Rafsanjani said that his country had launched
a massive project to develop the routes to and from Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The scheme include establishing large ports in the Caspian
Sea, developing of roads and railroads, building two-way
pipeline between northern and southern Iran for the exportation
and transit of oil via Iran as well as building a
1000-kilometer, two-way railroad between Tehran and Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that cooperation between Iran,
Russia and other countries in the region played an important
role in establishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term and lasting cooperation between Iran, Russia and
other countries, plays a sensitive and important role in
establishing peace and security in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio quoted Tokayev as saying that "Iran
is one of the closest friends of Kazakhstan in the Middle
East because of its important economic and commercial potentials
and because of its rational stance in the international forum."
</P>
<P>
Tokayev conveyed greetings of Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev to Rafsanjani, adding that Nazarbayev was planning to
attend the inauguration ceremony for the opening of the
Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railroad line.
</P>
<P>
The railroad, scheduled to open in mid-May, is planned to
link Central Asia to the Persian Gulf through the Iranian port
city of Bandar Abbas.

<HEADLINE> IBF Announces Eligible Roaster for Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) annnouned on Wednesday the roasters of eligible
players who have qualified for the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
For singles events, 33 players are eligible with 19 pairs in
each of men's and women's doubles, and 17 pairs in mixed doubles,
the IBF said.
</P>
<P>
By the time wild cards and reserve are added to the list, 192
players are expected to participate in Atlanta, with 36 in singles
events and 20 pairs in doubles events.
</P>
<P>
For mixed doubles specialists, it is the first time the event
has been included in the Olympics at Atlanta, the federation said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Park Joo Bong, who won the first men's doubles
Olympic gold in Barcelona, has come out of retirement to try for
the first mixed doubles gold.
</P>
<P>
With a clear lead at the top of the World Rankings after only
six eligible events, Park and his partner Ra Kyung Min become the
top favorites.
</P>
<P>
In the singles events, Susi Susanti, the Queen of badminton, is
looking to repeat her gold medal performance, as will her fiance
Allan Budi Kusuma.
</P>
<P>
Barcolona was almost a fairytale for Susanti. She and Kusuma
both won the first Olympic golds in the two singles events, and
the first Olympic medals for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Susanti has plans to retire after Atlanta and the couple are
due to be married next year, the IBF said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Indonesia's Ardy Wiranata, the Barcelona men's
singles silver medalist, does not qualify even though he is ranked
seventh in the world as a maximum of three players from one
country are eligible in each event. Wiranata is the fourth-highest
Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
Two pairs in the men's doubles, Tony Gunawan/Rudy Wijaya and
Chandra Wijaya/Ade Sutrisna, also have the same problem. They are
ranked seventh and eighth in the world but are the fourth and
fifth Indonesian pairs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, requirement for a player or pair from each
continent has given the chance to Mauritius' Martine de Souza,
Eddy Clarisse and others to play with the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
The badminton competition at the Olympic Games takes place at
the Georgia State University from July 24 to August 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference urged Shanghai to contribute more to national economic
development by the turn of the century today, during a visit to
the country's largest metropolitan area and business center.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said
great efforts made by the people of Shanghai have helped to meet
Deng Xiaoping's call for Shanghai to have "a change in one year,
and a major change in three years" during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed out that Shanghai is bound to become an
international economic, financial, and trade center in the near
future, as long as it complies with Deng's theory and instructions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are both advantages and disadvantages for
the metropolis in carrying out the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and the Long-Term Goals to the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
As an economic giant, Shanghai should be bold enough to have
more experience to serve the national development, and should play
a more significant role, Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Mayor Xu Kuangdi
announced another 60 enterprises to be used as pilot companies to
experiment with the modern enterprise system, at a special meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
This brings to 200 the total number of pilot enterprises, 80
percent of the city's combined state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
The modern enterprise system is a major part of the country's
effort to sharpen the competitive edge of state-owned businesses
by requiring them to hold responsible for their own profits and
losses.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, the pilot enterprises are to be the
backbone of industry, commerce, agriculture, trade, urban
construction, and transportation in the municipality, China's
largest business center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 140 enterprises that were chosen earlier added
five billion yuan in state-owned assets, and had an annual growth
rate of 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), told the meeting that Shanghai will try to
get more than two-thirds of its state-owned enterprises operating
within the frame of modern enterprise system in the near future.

LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The chairman, director and a player
of Britain's top rubgy club Wigan, were all arrested on Wednesday
on allegation of conspiracy to defraud, police said in Wigan.
</P>
<P>
Detectives from Greater Manchester police arrested chairman

The third man arrested was believed to be Wigan's prop forward
Neil Cowie, who is Martin's son-in-law.

Police had been examining several hundred pages of documents,
including some information supplied by the Wigan Observer.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Subcommission Urged to Avoid Politicization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China and a number of other
countries have urged the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to avoid politicizing
its work.
</P>
<P>
"The Subcommission should keep its proceedings away from 'Cold
War' influence in order to uphold the principle of fairness and
objectivity and put an end to unfounded charges against countries
from Asia, Africa and Latin America," Chinese delegate Liu
Xinsheng told the 52nd session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that in international relations there are still
examples of the strong bullying the weak by unilaterally imposing
sanctions and other coercive measures against other countries.
Such acts run counter to the principles of international law
concerning the respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the
internal affairs of others.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, new forms of racism characterized by
xenophobia, discrimination against colored people and migrant
workers are rampant in certain countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"The various human rights bodies of the United Nations,
including the Subcommission, while keeping acutely aware of the
above-mentioned problems, should give them top priority in
accordance with their respective mandates", Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Indian delegate Hemant Krishan Singh accused the Subcommission
of failing to concentrate its efforts on providing studies and
recommendations on the basis of objective and thorough research.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Subcommission was enthusiastic about
portraying itself as a world human rights inspector rather than
helping every country improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Subcommission's fascination with
situations in particular countries was a distortion of its
mandate, as was its preoccupation with passing resolutions which
were fundamentally political acts.
</P>
<P>
"The Subcommission's practice of passing judgement on countries
in a highly selective manner contributed to politicization and
undermined efforts to promote human rights through cooperation,
consensus and dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Human Rights Commission to give guidance to
the Subcommission, the Commission's only subsidiary body, to
ensure the latter's work complements that of the commission
instead of duplicating it.
</P>
<P>
A Pakistani delegate also pointed out that the Subcommission's
reports and resolutions only targeted weak and small countries
while human rights violations in some major powers had been
ignored. Such a trend had impeded the body from coming up with
fair and valuable advice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Bangladesh, El Salvador, Russia and
Ukraine echoed the opinion that the Subcommission should be
reformed and its mandate redefined, in order to avoid unfairness
and politicization.

objective of operating daily flights to the two principal cities
in China as soon as possible.

objective data for government policy making.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun in a national

place in China's agriculture, and that the data the government now
holds may not be as trustworthy as necessary.

<P>
Jiang said he doubts the credibility of the official figure for
China's farmland area, which is put at 928.67 million hectares.
"People from all social sectors deem the figure as relatively
lower than the actual one," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all local governments to provide adequate funding for
the massive statistical operation, and called on them to take
effective measures to spread the knowledge about what an
agricultural survey is about.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the survey will cover more than 200 million
rural households, and over 20 million village and township-level
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> 3,360 MW Power Generating Capacity Added in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 3,360 megawatts has
been added to Pakistan's Water And Power Development Authority
(WAPDA) power generating capacity in the past three financial
years.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported today this included
1,496 mw hydro-electric and 1,864 mw thermal power generating
capacity.
</P>
<P>
With this addition, WAPDA's total system capacity reached
10,853 mw by the end of June 1995.
</P>
<P>
This represents nearly a 45 percent increase over the system
power generation capacity at the end of June 1992.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year from July 1992 to June 1993, a total
addition of 659 mw raised the system capacity to 8,152 mw, 8.8
percent higher than the previous year's total installed generating
capacity.
</P>
<P>
In 1993-94, WAPDA system witnessed a total addition of 1,529 mw
power generating capacity, raising the total system capacity to
9.681 mw, an 18 percent increase over the previous year's total
power generating capacity in WAPDA system.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-95, total addition to WAPDA system stood at 1,172 mw
with the total system generating capacity reached 10,853 mw, a 12
percent increase over the previous year's new power generating
capacity.
</P>
<P>
The total installed power generating capacity in Pakistan is
12,728 mw which consists of 10,853 mw in WAPDA's system, 1,738 mw
in Karachi Electric Supply Corporation and 137 mw from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
A total capacity of 1,634 mw is currently under construction in
two projects of WAPDA, the major power supplier of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the Pakistani government emphasizes
energy development to help the country's economic boost.
</P>
<P>
Its open policy regarding investment in power and energy sector
has attracted many foreign companies to invest in the energy
sector.
</P>
<P>
Privatization in the energy sector also helps the development
of power generating capacity.

TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Tehran was interested in
expanding air, sea and ground links with the Central Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with visiting Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasm
Zhomarat Tokayev, Rafsanjani said that his country had launched a
massive project to develop the routes to and from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The scheme include establishing large ports in the Caspian
Sea, developing roads and railroads, building two-way pipeline
between northern and southern Iran for the exportation and transit
of oil via Iran as well as building a 1000-kilometer, two-way
railroads between Tehran and Mashhad.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that cooperation between Iran,
Russia and other countries in the region played an important role
in establishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term and lasting cooperation between Iran, Russia and
other countries, plays a sensitive and important role in
establishing peace and security in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio quoted Tokayev as saying "Iran is
one of the closest friends of Kazakhstan in the Middle East
because of its important economic and commercial potentials and
because of its rational stance in the international forum."
</P>
<P>
Tokayev conveyed the warm greetings of Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev to Rafsanjani, adding that Nazarbayev was
planning to attend the inauguration ceremony for the opening
of the Mashhad-Sarakhs-Tajan railroad line.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Position on Terrorism and Peace Process Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's position on terrorism and
the Middle East peace process remains unchanged despite the
dialogue with the European Union high-ranking officials, said an
Italian diplomat here today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua that the
Iranians did not change their stance toward the issue of the
terrorism and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
But, he declined to specify differences between the two sides
on the crucial issues which affect the future ties between Iran
and the European countries.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat disclosed that the European ambassadors in Tehran
will have a meeting this afternoon and they would adopt a united
stand toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the embassy would publish an official statement on
the dialogue between the two sides Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another Western diplomat, who asked not to be identified,
disclosed that today's talks between EU and Iranian officials were
"frank and constructive, but made little progress."
</P>
<P>
The European Union Troika delegation left here for Rome after
dialogue with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Iran's state-run Tehran Radio claimed this afternoon that the
talks between Troika and Iran for expansion of relations were
"positive."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said earlier that
Europe should pursue an independent policy in its relations with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Iran and Europe are in the interests of
both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that dialogue should continue based on mutual respect
and interests.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Middle East peace process, Velayati said,
the peace process has failed because it has ignored the rights of
the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Iran gave little publicity to the arrival of the EU delegation
and barred journalists and photographers from approaching the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation took a special flight from Rome and arrived
here Tuesday afternoon. Their stay in Tehran is about 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
Mario Panaro, counselor of the Italian Embassy in Tehran, told
Xinhua that the Troika delegation is headed by Italian Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Ludovico Incisa di Camerana.
</P>
<P>
The Italian undersecretary is accompanied by Spanish Foreign
Ministry Director General of the Middle Eastern Affairs, Miguel
Angel Moratinos, and Irish Foreign Ministry Director General for
Middle Eastern Affairs, Kenneth Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The Troika visit to Iran is taking place following a decision
made by European foreign ministers in their March 9-10 meeting in
Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. pressure, major European countries such as
Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Britain still insist on
dialogue with Iran.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Le Praised by Her Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 3 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Zhou Ming, coach of world
champion Le Jingyi, said on Wednesday he was fully satisfied with
Le's performances at the on-going China's Swimming Champions'
Tourney.
</P>
<P>
Despite her failure to win any event so far at the tourney,
"she is launching a strong comeback after a long-period layoff,"
said Zhou, one of four top coaches of the Chinese national squad.
</P>
<P>
Le, women world record holder in both 50-meter and 100-meter
freestyles, was edged by Shan Ying to the second in the 100-meter
freestyle Monday night, and settled for the third place in the
200-meter freestyle Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In the Tianjin meet which serves as the Olympic trials, Le, a
big shot in the national squad, was competing in the 50-meter,
100-meter and 200-meter freestyles, three individual events as
well as two to three relay events.
</P>
<P>
Under a four-stage pre-Olympic training program starting from
June, 1995 to July of the year, Le has improved stage-by-stage and
"I'm satisfied with her steady progress," said Zhou who started
his stint of national coach in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Being a postgraduate from the Beijing Sports University, Zhou
had coached Olympic champion and world record holder Zhuang Yong
and Yang Wenyi, both retired after the Barcelona Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
To forecast the prospect for the Atlanta Olympics, Zhou said
China is tipped to win medals in the women's freestyles, with the
50-meter and 100-meter events in particular.
</P>
<P>
"At least we are in the same level against the Americans and
the Germans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou circled out American veteran Amy Van Dyken and Russian
Natalia Mescheryakova as the most dangerous rivals at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. Olympic trials last March in Indianapolis, Zhou
said those results "were not bad at all."
</P>
<P>
"Though the absolute advantage of the American swimmers is
disappearing, I felt they have a plenty of all-around potentials."
</P>
<P>
"American swimmers are serious gold contenders almost in every
event, and with the home-turf advantage, they may reap a great
success in Atlanta," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Quick, coach of the U.S. women's Olympic squad, said
after the U.S. trials that "U.S. women are decided underdogs to
the Chinese and the Australians, we aren't favoured in a single
event."
</P>
<P>
However, Zhou turned down the suggestion, saying that "they are
more clever nowsdays by leaving some leeway in their prediction."
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, the current results reflect nothing about the Olympic
competitions," Zhou said.

The privileges will also be extended to aliens working for

<HEADLINE> American's Fundraising Event in Beijing Illegal: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A fundraising event by an American
was asked to be halted by officials in Beijing after it was
declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Chinese people paid 600 Chinese yuan per head to
attend the fundraising event at the Lidu Hotel in China's capital
city.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang explained today why the
Social Groups Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal
Government intervened to call a halt to the illegal fundraising
activity organized by an American last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Shen was asked at a briefing why Chinese police stopped the
charitable fundraising activity at the Lidu Hotel on the evening
of March 30.
</P>
<P>
An American, Tim Baker, organizer of a fundraising dinner in
the name of so-called Philip Hayden Charitable Foundation, sold
admittance tickets at 600 Chinese RMB each to Chinese citizens
before they were allowed to enter the dining hall, Shen Guofang
said, adding more than 400 tickets were sold out.
</P>
<P>
Having been informed about the activity, officials from the
Social Groups Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal
Government went to investigate the actual conditions, inquiring
into the Foundation's status, and whether its activities within
China had been registered with the relevant Chinese authorities,
and whether it had applied for approval with relevant Chinese
authorities to hold the activity.
</P>
<P>
Unregistered activities, or where an application is not made
for registration, violate Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
Tim Baker admitted that the Foundation had not registered with
relevant Chinese authorities, and he had not applied for legal
approval to hold the event. The organizer also admitted that the
Foundation's activity that night had violated the Beijing
municipality's relevant regulations governing registration of
legal persons of social groups, gatherings and fundraising
activities.
</P>
<P>
The fundraising activity was asked to be stopped that night,
but the dinner was allowed to continue at the request of the
organizer, Shen Guofang said.

<HEADLINE> IGAD Meets to Revitalize its Function: Kenyan FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Presidents and Prime Ministers of
The Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development met
here last month to revitalize the organization's function,
Kenyan Foreign Minister Stephen Musyoka said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Musyoka said at the summit
which ended on March 22 in Nairobi, they restructured the
organization into the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) and reached agreement unanimously on basing its
headquarters in Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
"They need to build strong structure in the sub-region and
focus on development", said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He gave the news conference on the IGAD summit, saying he had
found no time last month to brief newsmen on it.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state from Kenya, Uganda, Eritrea and Sudan, Prime
Minister from Ethiopia and the Foreign Minister of Djibouti
attended the two-day summit which also wanted to mediate in the
Sudan's issue.
</P>
<P>
As the relations between Sudan and Ethiopia and betwen Sudan
and Uganda remain tense, it was a good thing for leaders of
all those countries to come together, and if they meet regularly,
they are in a position to settle the disputes between them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said as Sudan insisted that every resolution should be
adopted unanimously, no agreement on Sudan had been passed at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sudan insisted that she could not track down on the three
suspects who tried to assasinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
in Addis Ababa in June last year, he said, noting this was "not
only a crime against Egypt, but a crime against the whole of
Africa."
</P>
<P>
So the leaders at the meeting persisted in asking Sudan to
hand over these suspects, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question, he said he regretted that there are
now conflicts in Somalia, Liberia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya hopes that there should be stability in Sudan and
Somalia and that nobody is exporting arms to these countries,
Musyoka said.

<P>
TOKYO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that smooth development of
Sino-Japanese relations depends on Tokyo's attitude towards the
history and the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference here, Qian stated
that it can be said correct handling of the above two issues
constituted the primary political foundation for the normalization
of diplomatic relations between the two east Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Qian said, only a correct recognition of the history can
open up the future of bilateral relations. With regard to the
Taiwan issue, Japan should also maintain an unmistakable attitude
so that relations can be developed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and
that China's policy of peaceful reunification and "one nation, two
systems" has remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Taiwan Strait, he went on to say, will
become quite normal provided the authorities on Taiwan do not go
in for its independence and foreign forces refrain from supporting
and abetting their secessionist effort.
</P>
<P>
Qian said tha for historical reasons, Japan should understand
China's position on the Taiwan issue better, since it has more
knowledge of the island's history.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Qian also urged the Japanese
government to take earliest possible measures to destroy the
chemical weapons left behind in China by Japanese troops during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Sunday for a four-day visit, has met
with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Foreign Minister Yikihiko
Ikeda and several other Japanese government officials. He has also
called on Emperor Akihito.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Introduces more International Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Xiamen Special Economic Zone
has been actively introducing international standards to enhance
its economic strength.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen Quality Verification Center, founded in 1993, has
already granted verification certificates of the ISO9000 standard
to eight enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that training is of vital importance to practising
the international standards, the center has sponsored over 80
symposiums and training classes for over 5,000 people in over 300
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The special zone, which is also a major tourism city, was the
first in the country to introduce ISO9000 to hotels and department
stores, in a bid to comply with international practices.
</P>
<P>
The city is also actively engaged in the introduction of the
ISO14000 international environmental management standard.
</P>
<P>
The international standard has helped improve the performance
of enterprises remarkably.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Zhengxin Rubber Industry Co. Ltd, which is a
Taiwan-funded enterprise, raised its foreign exchange earnings to
80 million US dollars in 1995 from 54.83 million US dollars in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronics Enterprise raised the
rate of its qualified products by 1.5 percent in 1995 as compared
with 1994.

<HEADLINE> Archives Tell Social Progress in Tibet (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since 1952, the central government has never taken a penny out
of Tibet, but invested 35 billion yuan in various ventures and
causes. Many preferential economic policies for its development
have been also enacted.
</P>
<P>
The archives also contain a report on the way descendants of
blacksmiths were subject to rules which forbid them from certain
things. It says that a man working for the Dalai Lama was expelled
after he was found to be a descendant of a smith.
</P>
<P>
In the past, all blacksmiths, as well as gold and silver
craftsmen, butchers, and their offsprings were the "untouchable",
not allowed to work for the government, and they could not marry
into families of different classes.
</P>
<P>
But today, the descendants of these people are not prejudiced
against any more. Some of them have become government officials,
people's deputies, and members of people's political consultative
conferences.
</P>
<P>
Pugza, son of Tibetan knife maker in Xigaze, said: "In light of
my own family history, Tibetans have never had the human rights
and freedom as they have today, and anyone respecting history and
facts should agree with me."

<P>
Today, rural Tibetan people have an average of 20.36 square
meters of living space, and urban Tibetans 12.59 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The surrounding area of the Potala Palace, where the
"untouchable" were forbidden to dwell in the past, is now home to
a decent "Snow" neighborhood committee of ordinary Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
But the Dalai clique claims that Tibetan people are "living in
hell" today.
</P>
<P>
Files in the archives said that a nobleman in Xigaze, named
Gedwa, raised tax rates at will, and occupied lands of serfs in
1955, but the Dalai government did nothing to stop him. Many
became broken men because of too heavy taxes, and noblemen used
slaves to pay for their debts.
</P>
<P>
Another document shows that in 1944, every resident of Zheku
had to hand in the wool of 20 sheep for Dalai's clothes, and wool
of 12 sheep for his hat, but they got little payment.
</P>
<P>
Dunzhu, vice-chairman of the government of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, said that the Chinese government has given top priority to
solving the problem of food and clothes for all the Tibetan people
in the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
All the arable land, pasture, forest and most of the livestock,
owned only by high-ranking religious and governmental officials
and noblemen before 1959, were redistributed to serfs, who
accounted for 95 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the Central government has adopted a
rehabilitation policy towards Tibet, and decided to exempt its
agricultural taxes until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Those who have visited the Potala Palace will find that all the
halls and rooms, including Dalai's sleeping room and scripture
reciting halls, have been renovated as new.
</P>
<P>
In fact the central government did the work for the betterment
of its religious policies. It has allocated 216 million yuan (25.4
million US dollars) to repair the Potala Palace, the Jakong
Monastery, and many other religious buildings.

LHASA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- For the scripture-chanting ceremony
marking the Dalai Lama's birthday, "a set of intestines, two
heads, bowls of blood and a complete human skin are urgently
needed. Please send them here immediately."
</P>
<P>
This was written in a letter by a Tibetan official to a tribal
head in the 1950s, before the region was peacefully liberated.
</P>
<P>
The letter is now kept intact in the Archives of the Tibet
Autonomous Region here. The archives, built in the 1960s, preserve
over three million historical documents on Tibet dating from the
Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) to the 1950s, and it is one of the local
archives with the richest amount of historical data in the country.
</P>
<P>
An expert with the Archives explained that before 1959 it was
common for the Dalai Lamas to use parts of human bodies for their
religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The files also indicate that slave trading was rampant at that
time.
</P>
<P>
"After reading the decrees here, no one can believe that 'the
Tibetan people enjoyed freedom and happiness' under the Dalai
Lama, as he has been preaching outside China," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
According to the archives, of the one million people in Tibet
in 1950 over 900,000 had no homes of their own. And over 1,000
beggar families lived in the open air on the streets of Lhasa,
whose total population was only 20,000 at that time.
</P>
<P>
"Only after Tibet was liberated and the central government
built rows of houses in Lhasa's Lubo district did the homeless for
the first time have their own shelters," 60-year-old local
resident Chaka said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ends Dialogue with Iran on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An European Union Troika
delegation left here for Libya after dialogue with Iran on
crucial issues of terrorism and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati this morning on the two issues which would decide
the future ties between Iran and European countries.
</P>
<P>
But both sides refrained from making any comments on the
results of the negotiations at this moment.
</P>
<P>
Iran gave little publicity to the arrival of the EU delegation
and barred journalists and photographers from approaching the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition daily Salam today published a commentary
criticizing the dialogue between Tehran and the EU, terming it a
"one-way dialogue" by Europe "in order to put pressure on the
national and religious sanctities of the Islamic Iran."
</P>
<P>
"In the critical, one-way dialogue of Europe against Iran, it
is always their demands and impositions which are discussed," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation took a special flight from Rome and arrived
here Tuesday afternoon. Their stay in Tehran is about 20 hours.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is the first leg of the EU delegation, which will also
go to Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mario Panaro, Counsellor of the Italian Embassy in Tehran, told
Xinhua that the Troika delegation is headed by Italian Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Ludovico Incisa di Camerana.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the visit by the EU delegation is
crucial for the relations between Iran and the European
countries, which is seeking to persuade the Iranian authorities
to unequivocally condemn terrorism and disassociate themselves
from terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Undersecretary is accompanied by Spanish Foreign
Ministry Director General of the Middle Eastern Affairs Miguel
Angel Moratinos and Irish Foreign Ministry Director General for
Middle Eastern Affairs Kenneth Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The Troika visit to Iran is taking place following a decision
made by European foreign ministers in their March 9-10 meeting in
Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. pressure, major European countries such as
Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Britain still insist on
dialogue with the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in a press
conference held in middle of this month expressed his welcome
to the visit of the EU delegation, saying "we are ready to
hold talks with them."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "there is no need for the Europeans to
take the pains of traveling to the country. Theoretically
speaking, we do not agree with what is going on now under
the title of peace, because this peace is not just, as the
rights of the Palestinians are being trampled."
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that "we will create no stumble blocks."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of terrorism, he said, "in principle, we oppose
any terrorist act from anyone and any side."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "as a Palestinian movement struggling to
liberate its country, the Hamas should not be condemned."
</P>
<P>
"But if a terrorist activity is carried out, it should
not be accepted."

<HEADLINE> Central Government Helping Tibet to Eliminate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's central government is doing
its utmost to aid the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminate poverty,
according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
Yang Song, vice-chairman of the regional government, made the
remark in a meeting yesterday with Arthur Holcomb, representative
of the United Nations Development Program in China.
</P>
<P>
Holcomb and his assistants are here, discussing projects to aid
the poor and protect natural reserves with local government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Yang told the visitors that 75 percent of Tibetans have risen
above the poverty line over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibet regional government has drawn up a plan to help the
remaining 25 percent of residents eliminate poverty over the next
five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Tibet must accelerate growth of the farming sector
and the energy, transport and telecommunications industries, as
well as such sectors as education, culture, science and public
health, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years the central government will earmark at
least 10 billion yuan for Tibet, and urge other parts of the
country to provide two billion yuan in assistance.
</P>
<P>
"All international organizations, including the United Nations
and foreign governments, are welcome to provide aid to Tibet
without any conditions attached," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Holcomb praised the Chinese government for
having done a great deal of work to reduce the number of Tibetans
living under the poverty line and expand production in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Tibet regional government is
fully capable of eliminating poverty among Tibetans.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control on IC Card Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has taken measures to curb
the overlap in Intelligence Card (IC) production across the
country, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued by the Ministry of Electronics
Industry (MEI) here today, all new projects in relation with IC
production must seek the approval of the MEI and relevant
departments beforehand.
</P>
<P>
No IC card, floppy disc drive or software, whether imported
from abroad and made in China, will be allowed to be sold on the
market before undergoing quality checks by state designated
quality control departments.
</P>
<P>
ICs, popularly known as "electronic money", are necessary
accessories of China's "Golden Card Project".
</P>
<P>
A national estimate showed that the annual demand for ICs in
China will be 15 million before the year 2000. However, IC
production lines across the country have a combined production
capacity of more than 100 million a year, causing a huge waste in
material and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The MEI said in a circular titled "The Golden Card Project"
that this sector should be subject to a unified scheme in
planning, manufacture, distribution and management.

<HEADLINE> 232 Million Dollar Remittance Racket Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A massive racket involving
remittances of over 8,000 million rupees (232 million US dollars)
in the guise of payment for import has been unearthed in India.
</P>
<P>
The racket was being operated with the connivance of officials
of nationalized and foreign banks, highly-placed sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The deep-rooted network, involving employees of the State Bank
of Bikaner and Jaipur, United Commercial Bank (UCO Bank), South
Indian Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, had
siphoned off hundreds of crores (one crore equals 10 million) in
foreign exchange to Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai and other tax
havens since 1991.
</P>
<P>
In a Mumbai (Bombay) branch of UCO Bank, nearly 1,500 million
rupees (43.48 million US dollars) were deposited in cash in the
account of a "bogus firm" floated by a Mumbai-based company
secretary, without the bank manager questioning the source of the
money. Banks are not allowed to accept deposits in cash which are
more than 50,000 rupees (1,449.28 dollars), the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The entire amount of money was remitted abroad through Hong
Kong bank subsequently. Seven persons, including a manager of
State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur and the manager and chief cashier
of the UCO Bank branch, were arrested for their alleged
involvement in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
Connivance of employees of some banks in New Delhi, capital of
India, in such illegal foreign exchange transactions in huge
quantities has been established, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM: Jordan Can Provide Equilibrium for Final Israeli-Palestinian Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
has said that the establishment of "some sort of an affiliation"
between Jordan and the Palestinian territories would help provide
a "stable equilibrium" for the final Israeli-Palestinian
settlement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Jordan Times at his office Tuesday, Barak
said that it was "up to the Jordanians and the Palestinians
themselves to decide the kind of affiliation they want through a
dialogue that runs parallel to final status talks between Israel
and the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
The former Israeli army chief-of-staff also said that the
month-old Israeli blockade of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was
aimed at reducing the dependency of the Palestinian economy on
Israel in addition to the security considerations related to
stopping suicide bombings against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Israel would not negotiate with the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), because that would result in the
"emergence of more extremist groups."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Israel would not oppose the participation
of Hamas in the Palestinian political system, provided the
Palestinian National Authority crushed the "terrorist elements
within Hamas."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, he added, was not imposing
preconditions for resuming negotiations with either Lebanon or
Syria, but that his country "expects a clear Syrian condemnation
of the terrorist attacks."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Iraq, Barak said that the international embargo
imposed on Iraq "should continue until the present regime is
replaced by a more reasonable one."

<HEADLINE> More Qualified Teachers in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is scoring high marks for
improving the quality of local teachers in schools across the city.
</P>
<P>
It follows an initiative by the local municipal government to
improve learning at schools of different levels of learning.
</P>
<P>
Local government's departments said the number of university
and college qualified teachers in senior middle schools improved
from 43 percent in 1980 to 74 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The rate in junior middle schools went up from 31 percent to 82
percent, while in primary schools, the rate rose from 66 percent
to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
Marked increases have been recorded in the number of teachers
with senior professional titles in universities and colleges,
under direct administration of local municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the proportion of professors to the total
number of teachers increased from 1.4 percent to 6.4 percent
during the 1986-1994 period; the ratio of associate professors
went up from 12.2 percent to 30.6 percent. The number of teachers
with middle-ranking and senior professional titles amounted to 67
percent of total number of teacher in schools for adults.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen building of teaching groups, the municipal
government has established systems to recognize the qualifications
of teachers, and the ranking of their duties. More measures have
also been taken to award teachers who have made remarkable
academic progress and achievements.

<HEADLINE> Iran Raises Fuel Prices by 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today increased its domestic
oil prices between 30 to 50 percent amid fears that the price hike
might further increase the 100-percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Today's local dailies carried an announcement on the price
increase by the government-owned National Company for Refining
and Distribution of Oil Products.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the price increase will be effective
today "to protect the national assets and non-renewable energies."
</P>
<P>
It added that the law governing the Second Development Plan
approved by the Iranian Parliament mandated that every year the
subsidies for oil would be gradually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Under a spring downpour this morning, Tehran residents pulled
into a gas station in northern Tehran to fill up the tank. Most of
them were unaware of the price increase.
</P>
<P>
A gas station attendant told Xinhua that because the
announcement was not well publicized, most drivers did not know
about the price increase.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement was made Tuesday night. It could have been
made earlier to avoid the problems we have today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that instead of arguing with customers, he showed them
the large poster on the wall of the gas station. The poster
listed the new prices under the red emblem of the National
Company for Refining and Distribution of Oil Products.
</P>
<P>
An employee working for the Ministry of Culture and Islamic
Guidance who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the price
increase would have an adverse effect on ordinary people's
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
"The government increases its prices. The retailers follow by
increasing their prices. The real victims here are the ordinary
people, the clerks working for the government and private firms,
those on a fixed salary," he added.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government for not increasing the salaries
of the civil service employees to keep up with the inflation
rate.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices in oil-rich Iran are still the lowest in the
world. Even with the price increase, a gallon of regular gasoline
would cost about 600 rials (or about 20 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
But economic observers here have noted that the price hike
would boost the inflation rate. The official figures put the
inflation rate at 60 percent but observers say that the inflation
is about 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist's Sandstorm Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The memories of a severe sandstorm
that hit northwestern parts of China almost a year ago are still
vivid for many people.
</P>
<P>
The storms, in May 1995, caused direct economic losses of up to
560 million yuan. Scientists in China have been researching into
whether such great losses can be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Young scientist Yan Xiangkui and his colleagues have now come
up with ways of fighting back against the storms.
</P>
<P>
They concluded after careful research that stubble and unplowed
farm fields can effectively resist sand and dust storms.
</P>
<P>
They realized that sandstorms normally occurred during spring
when the farmland is naked, and the trees are still bare,
resulting in strong winds being able to blow away surface soil,
fertilizers or even seeds and seedlings.
</P>
<P>
With the loss of erosive surface soil, and organic substances,
the land gradually becomes desertified.
</P>
<P>
In other countries where wind erosion is severe, the land along
wind line is never plowed, and some crop stubble is kept to resist
wind erosion.
</P>
<P>
Yan's method is that stubble is to be kept in harvested fields,
unplowed intervals are allowed between plowed land, and the two
interchange periodically. The interval is planted with forage
grass, small fruit trees, or other crops that can be used
medically.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that the stubble and unplowed belt inside
farmland can not only resist wind and sand, it can also help to
keep water, and stabilize soil.

SHENYANG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Factory worker Qi Weizhi is in

coins.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old worker at an iron and steel plant in northeast
China's Liaoning Province started his coin collection over 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is very rare for an individual, a worker in
particular, to collect so many ancient coins by himself.
</P>
<P>
It all started for Qi Weizhi when he was kicking a shuttlecock
which was made of a chain of coins.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has gone all out to maintain his hobby, and all
his savings have been used in coin collecting. He has been
described as a super-fan of coin collecting.
</P>
<P>
To understand every word on the coins, he has read his
dictionary so much that it has virtually fallen to pieces. So far,
he has kept coins of nearly all the dynasties in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Qi was honored as the "Worker Collector" for his
knowledge on ancient coins, and rich coin collection.

<HEADLINE> Daily Currency Transaction Down 21 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The daily currency transaction on
the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange Trade System in March
was down 21 percent from February to 214 million US dollars, a
system spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the drop was due to the experimentation
of the foreign exchange surrender system among foreign-funded
enterprises in Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, and Shenzhen and Dalian
cities. Under the surrender system, foreign-funded enterprises can
buy foreign exchange directly from designated banks.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.5 billion US dollars-worth of foreign exchange
changed hands last month, according to the spokesman, who also
said that the total foreign exchange trading volume in the first
quarter broke down to 13.93 billion US dollars, 8.61 billion
Hong Kong dollars and 20.7 billion Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The US currency continued its upward trend against the
yuan last month, with its average trade-weighted value rising from
8.321 yuan at the end of February to 8.3339 on March 29, the last
trading day of the month. Its monthly high was 8.3365 yuan. The
greenback's rise in March was 128 points, up 55 points from
February.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar was largely stable last month, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen retreated against the local currency by 1,015
points last month, compared with a rise of 1,922 points in
February. It was quoted at 100 yen to 7.8276 yuan at the end
of March.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the US unit, the Hong Kong dollar and the yen are
the only three currencies traded on China's national foreign
exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Benefits from Using Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture will become the focus
of foreign investment in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
which is developing into one of China's key farm product bases.
</P>
<P>
With a vast territory and comparatively small population, the
region is China's largest cotton producer, turning out 925,000
tons of cotton last year.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that this multi-ethnic region has used
foreign investment totalling more than 150 million US dollars in
agriculture over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang began to carry out seven projects involved in the
development of land and water resources, protection of ecological
environment, rural education, and improvement of seed varieties
and soil in 1992 with 145 million US dollars loaned by the World
Bank and Japan, and foreign assistance of five million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the help of these funds, three million poor farmers have
made both ends meet, and thousands of farmers gained an
opportunity to study advanced farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw previously loss-making farms turn out a total
industrial and agricultural output value of about 600 million yuan
and profits amounting to 12 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, the region's three modern educational institutions,
built with foreign aid and loans, train about 1,000
agro-technicians and tens of thousands of farmers a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A secret group in Zambia, called
"black mamba" (poisonous snake), has threatened to eliminate
ministers and the speaker of the National Assembly if they
insisted on adopting the draft constitution through Parliament,
the "Zambia Daily Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10 ministers or deputy ministers and Speaker of the
National Assembly Robinson Nubulyato are among those who have
received the death threats through anonymous letters, according
to the daily.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu has offered
an award of about 25,000 US Dollars for any information leading
to the source of the threats and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Ndhlovu appealed to leaders not to open any suspicious looking
mail, but hand it over instead to the police for immediate
forensic scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Some of opposition parties and mass organizations have
differed from the government's stand on the way of adopting draft
constitution. They have insisted that a new constitution be
adopted by a constituent assembly and a national referendum.

<P>
HARARE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Tuesday called on parents to help their children foster a high
standard of morals against promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a fund raising function for the country's AIDS
victims, Mugabe attributed the rising incidence of HIV infection
to sexual immorality.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of Zimbabwe's 10.5 million people are
believed to be HIV positive, while official statistics show that
at least 300 people die each week from AIDS related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he realized that while most parents were strict
with their daughters, sons were allowed too much freedom that
often resulted in "disaster".
</P>
<P>
"Parents allow their children too much free time, we should be
strict with our children," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmer Gu Yingming could
hardly believe his eyes when an unexpected guest arrived at his
humble home in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
His excited mother quickly hurried to the kitchen to find some
food for their special guest.
</P>
<P>
They were playing host to Maomao, a fully grown giant panda,
who just strolled into their home in Jiuchi Village, in the
township of Maoping.
</P>
<P>
Local people call the rare animal "Maomao", and they have
become used to seeing the animal move freely around the village.
</P>
<P>
But it was the first time that Maomao directly entered a
farmer's house.
</P>
<P>
"I was both surprised and excited to find my special guest
pushing open my house's door in the evening," said Gu Yingming,
head of the village, "Seeing our respectable guest coming, my
mother hurried to find a dinner for him."
</P>
<P>
After eating some meat, Maomao found a pail of honey by
himself, and had another feast. Later he walked into the cattle
pen and fell asleep.
</P>
<P>
The next day Maomao paid visits to other households in the
village, by knocking their windows or doors, and he spent most of
the day eating bamboo shoots in the bamboo forest in front of Gu
Yingming's home.
</P>
<P>
When night was coming, he suddenly appeared at one villager's
kitchen room, eating rice from a pot.
</P>
<P>
On the third day, Maomao seemed to be in low spirit and
couldn't eat much. Medical staff from the provincial animal
protection department rushed to the village, and sent the precious
animal to the rare animal breeding center to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
On the day Maomao was leaving, all the villagers held torches
to see him off.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time for us to have such an intimate
relationship with a giant panda, we are all unwilling to part with
him," said Gu Yingming.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 giant pandas living in China, more than
160 of them are living in the Hanzhong Prefecture of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province. And on March 23 the giant panda visited
the Jiuchi Village of Maoping township in this region.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM to Visit Southeast Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected Coalition
Government of Australia launched its first wave of overseas
diplomatic campaign as Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander
Downer announced today that he would visit three Southeast Asian
countries later this month.
</P>
<P>
The first overseas visit by high-ranking officials of the new
Government followed a long-awaited visit to Australia by Malaysian
leader Mahathir Mohamad last week.
</P>
<P>
Downer will visit Indonesia from 15 to 18 April, Singapore from
18 to 20 April and Thailand from 20 to 22.
</P>
<P>
His Southeast Asian tour is part of the major gesture that the
Coalition Government made to assure its Asian neighbors of its
commitment to the region. At the completion of Downer's
three-nation visit, the Australian Government will have official
talks with four of the most influential members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) within six weeks after it took
office.
</P>
<P>
"The regional destinations I have chosen clearly reflect that
closer engagement with Asia will be this Government's highest
foreign policy priority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer is seen to pave the way for Australian Prime Minister
John Howard to pay his first visit overseas, possibly as early as
in June. Howard has promised in the election campaign that his
first overseas visit will be to a Southeast Asian nation.
Indonesia is predicted to be on top of Howard's list of
destinations, because Indonesian leader Suharto has formally
invited Howard to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is a natural first overseas destination and reflects
the priority the Government will be giving to the relationship
with Indonesia," Downer said in a news release today.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that improvement of bilateral relations with
the three nations were the top target of his visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia and Singapore enjoyed "excellent"
relations across the board. He also said that Australia would
further improve the "very well-developed" relationship with
Thailand, which Australia saw as a "very important regional
partner."
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Government has adopted a foreign policy that is
perceptibly different from that of the previous Labor Government.
While maintaining consistence in Australia's commitment to
multi-national forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) group, the Coalition Government attaches great
importance to the development of bilateral relations with
individual members of regional blocs.
</P>
<P>
It has adopted a more flexible attitude toward involvement in
multi-national organizations. For example, Howard told Mahathir
that Australia would continue to develop relationship with
Malaysia despite the fact that it could not join the 10-member
East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) that was initiated by Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
Downer will also visit New Zealand and Papua New Guinea after
his Southeast Asia tour.

<HEADLINE> Tree-Planting -- A Winning Formula for Gansu Chemical Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A chemical company came up with a
winning formula for a barren mountain area close to their factory
in China's Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Chemical Industry Company planted over five million
trees to transform the mountain.
</P>
<P>
As well as helping to create a green backdrop to the factory
the tree planting has reaped many other benefits for employees.
</P>
<P>
The chemical company planted over 40,000 apple, pear and peach
trees, built 26 chicken farms and a ranch with 150 cows, which
yield over 650,000 kg of eggs and 250,000 kg of milk annually, and
basically meet the health care demands of workers.
</P>
<P>
It is a similar story at other factories where tree planting is
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises in the northwest province are located on
barren deserts, and they have played a leading role in local
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Many of China's major heavy industrial plants are located in
the remote and barren areas. But as the plants were constructed,
green belts appeared around them.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the Changqing Petroleum Exploration Bureau plant
trees wherever they go, and so far more than eight million trees
have been planted. The Wanli Mechanical and Electric Plant has
planted over 100,000 trees.
</P>
<P>
Many large enterprises are among the most active in tree
planting, according to forestry departments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the improved environment has helped promote
efficiency, and a good attitude among workers, managers said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Security Officials Hold Secret Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Senior Israeli and Palestinian
security officials, led by General Security Service (GSS) chief
Ami Ayalon and Palestinian Preventive Security chief Mohammed
Dahalan, have held a series of meetings in Gaza recently to
enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According The Jerusalem Post, the latest meeting was at the end
of last week, at the office of Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat. Those attending were Arafat,
Ayalon, Dahalan and Palestinian police chief Razi Jabali, the
newspaper quoted both Israeli and Palestinian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources described the meetings as a direct offshoot of the
Sharm el-Sheikh anti-terror summit last month. CIA officers have
also been present at a number of the meetings, aimed at improving
cooperation between the security forces, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli security official said the meetings in
themselves reflect a degree of improvement in relations between
the Israeli and Palestinian security services. However, the
official said that "there is still much distrust between the
sides."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have an interest today in showing that they
are working to fight terror," said the official. "But we are still
waiting to see the results. When they've caught (Izzadin Kassam
commander Mohammed) Dief and turned him over to us, then we know
that they're for real."
</P>
<P>
Dahalan told the Jerusalem Post that both sides agreed to have
these meetings at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit. He described the
meetings as "productive" and said that the PNA has met most of
Israel's demands for cracking down on Hamas.
</P>
<P>
"We have detained 11 of the 13 persons on the wanted list
given to us by Israel," Dahalan said in a telephone interview
from his Gaza headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He added that his force's interrogation of Hamas detainees has
revealed that a Hamas splinter group has been carrying out terror
attacks independently of Izzadin Kassam, Hamas' military wing,
since September 1993 just after the Oslo Accords were signed.
</P>
<P>
The group is called El Jihaz Al-Sira, or "The Secret
Underground," and is controlled by Hamas officials outside of the
occupied territories, said Dahalan. 70 members of the underground
have been detained in recent weeks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dahalan strongly denied reports that he was holding secret
talks with Dief before the recent wave of suicide attacks, in
hopes of reaching an agreement between Izzadin Kassam and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Dief, according to Dahalan, has not fled the area and is
likely hiding out in Gaza or the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Izzadin Kassam declared in a leaflet a
resumption of suicide bomb attacks against Israel in response to
the heavy crackdown on the organization by Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as Israel is making last preparations for
Passover, one of the biggest Jewish holidays.

<HEADLINE> India's Exports of Livestock, Meats to Cross 144.9  Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- India's exports of livestock and
meats are likely to exceed 5,000 million rupees (144.9 million US
dollars) during the current financial year compared with 4,480
million rupees (129.9 million dollars) recorded during the
financial year 1994-95, according to a press release by meat
exporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The major increase in livestock product exports is expected to
be in buffalo meat, followed by sheep and goat meat.
</P>
<P>
India has the livestock population of 430 million, the second
largest in the world, but its export share in the world market is
very small due to poor livestock management and lack of mechanized
and automated abattoir facilities, the release said.
</P>
<P>
India exports livestock products mainly to Malaysia, UAE, the
Philippines, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Mauritius and Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> State-run Commerce Helps Curb Price Hikes in Anhui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The state-run commerce in Anhui
Province played an important role in bringing down price hikes by
10.6 percentage points in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sufficient supplies of meat, vegetables, sugar, edible oil
and salt in the state sector helped keep the consumer price index
at 12.7 percent last year, down from 23.3 percent in the previous
year, and two percent lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the rise of prices of vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs
and egg products was over 20 percentage points lower, thanks to
the assistance of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that state commerce still accounts for 65
percent and 95 percent of the sales of sugar and salt, and over 50
percent of household electronic goods and cultural products.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province opened five more large department stores
each exceeding 100 million yuan (12.04 million US dollars) in
retail sales, making the state commerce even stronger.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure supplies, the province has set up reserves
of pork and other major foodstuffs at both the provincial and city
levels. An extra 7,600 tons of pork was added last year, enabling
the state-run shops to sell the meat at 10-15 percent lower than
the market price during major festival periods.

<HEADLINE> Israel Maintains High Alert as Holiday Sets in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli security forces have
been put on increased alert for fear that the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) should launch renewed suicide attacks during the
week-long Passover Holiday beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of policemen, border policemen, security agents,
Civil Guard volunteers and the army men are mobilized on duty
throughout the Passover, one of the most significant Jewish
holidays, to ensure that the rest of the population can celebrate
the festival safely. The police have urged the public to report
suspicious objects, individuals, or vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The police will also take extra steps to enforce traffic
regulations so as to prevent holiday-makers from begetting any
mishaps. Traffic accident is one of the major killers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff, Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, told the
Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Tuesday
that Israel has information that Hamas and Islamic Jihad still
intend to carry out attacks. He said that the closure of the Gaza
Strip is strict, but unlike Gaza, the closure of the West Bank is
"shaky" and it is easier for a lone attacker to cross the Green
Line from there.
</P>
<P>
As if to prove Shahak's warning, Hamas warned Tuesday that
it might resume suicide attacks against Israelis to punish the
Palestinian Authority for its campaign against Islamic
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
A leaflet signed by its armed wing, Izzadin Kassam,
recommended what it called "lighting a fire again in the heart of
the Zionist state."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sets Targets for Developing Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Beijing municipal government has
worked out plans to launch a series of reforms to improve its
social security system in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
These reforms will focus on developing social insurance,
old-age pension insurance, medicare and unemployment insurance,
Xinhua learned from the ongoing Fourth Session of the 10th Beijing
Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, some 90 percent of urban and
township residents are expected to participate in social security
programs, and in rural areas the ratio is expected to exceed 50
percent by the year 2000. By the year 2010 all urban and rural
residents are expected to benefit from social security programs.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the local government plans to expand social
security programs from among workers in state enterprises and some
collective firms to all township workers and further expand them
among rural residents. Administrative organizations will be
established to monitor social security programs.
</P>
<P>
The local government will also devote efforts to effectively
raise and use social security funds to promote work in this
connection. Government, enterprises and individuals will share the
responsibility of raising and managing social security funds.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1995, 2.7 million people --
equal to 94 percent of the total number of workers in the
city-administered enterprises -- had participated in basic old-age
pension insurance. Eighty-seven percent, 2.21 million, of the
total number of enterprise workers had participated in insurance
on unemployment.

<P>
WELLINGTON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand ban on Alaskan
salmon has been misrepresented in a United States report on trade
barriers, said NZ Trade Negotiations Minister Philip Burdon.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand was named in the report, released yesterday, as one
of the 40 countries which the report charged had erected "harmful
trade barriers" against US companies.
</P>
<P>
However, Burdon was quoted by a local press report today as
saying that the US Trade Representative's office had got some
facts wrong.
</P>
<P>
He said that a claim that a New Zealand prohibition on Alaskan
salmon breached World Trade Organization rules was
"comprehensively incorrect."
</P>
<P>
"They claim that New Zealand is breaching WTO rules. We are not
and no country has been more meticulous in honoring its WTO
commitments," Burdon stated.
</P>
<P>
He said New Zealand was still waiting to receive information
for a risk analysis of Alaskan salmon imports.
</P>
<P>
He said the Government regretted at the misrepresentation on
the question of salmon imports from Alaska, but welcomed a
description in the report of New Zealand's trade and investment
policy as the "bellwether for regional and global trade and
investment liberalization."

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Striving for Good Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- More than eight million farmers in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are hoping for
another good grain harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have already had good grain harvests for 18 years running,
and are expecting the 19th good harvest year," said Liu Yanliang,
an agronomist with the regional bureau of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the regional government has allocated more
funds for agro-science, farm equipment and raw materials this year.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to grow crops on three million hectares this
year.
</P>
<P>
Included are 800,000 ha of cotton, up 66,700 ha over last year;
1.53 million ha of grain, the same as last year; and 100,000 ha of
beet, up 26,700 ha.
</P>
<P>
While sending officials and agro-scientists to rural areas to
help with farming, the regional government has supplied enough
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plastic sheeting and farm
machinery on time, and granted more loans to farmers.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the region turned out 925,000 tons of
cotton last year, ranking first in the country, and 7.3 million
tons of grain, making it self-sufficient in grain. The per capita
income of farmers last year topped 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
This year will see the region produce 1.02 million tons of
cotton and 7.4 million tons of grain, and the per capita income of
farmers will reach 1,250 yuan.

<P>
LANZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mount Qilian Nature Reserve in
northwest China has been admitted into the China biosphere
protection network, according to sources with the China State
Commission for Man and the Biosphere.
</P>
<P>
The largest forest and wild life protection area in inland
China, the reserve extends 1,200 km along the borders of Qinghai
and Gansu provinces. It was designated as a state nature reserve
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Since ancient times Mount Qilian has played a vital role in
protecting the biological balance, regulating water sources and
nurturing life varieties in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
A glacier over 5,000 m above sea level is the largest solid
reservoir in inland China, nourishing 56 tributaries flowing into
three water systems and irrigating large patches of farmland in
Qinghai and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Forests on the mountain cover more than 2.6 million ha, the
largest area of forest reservation in inland China, and they play
a significant role in retaining water and preventing soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The mountain also boasts abundant wild life, including snow
leopards, Asiatic wild asses and golden eagles.
</P>
<P>
The China biosphere protection network, established by the
China State Commission for Man and the Biosphere, is aimed at
contributing to the protection of and research into biological
varieties worldwide in accordance with an overall program of the

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Aims High in Developing Energy Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou province
is striving hard to develop energy resources and trying to become
a major energy producer in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has verified total coal deposits of 50.7
billion tons, the fifth-largest in the country. It still has a
potential power generating capacity of 16.84 million kw by taking
advantage of water resources, making it fourth in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the province developed a total power capacity of 4.34
million kw and turned out nearly 22.59 billion kwh of electricity,
with average annual increase hitting 12 percent and 16.8 percent,
respectively, over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province produced 55.1 million tons of
coal, showing an average annual increase of 8.3 percent. It also
provided 10 million tons of coal and 2.7 billion kwh of
electricity to other provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the power industry, some 70 cities and
counties, or 81.4 percent of the total in Guizhou, have been
connected to the south China power grid.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of energy resources the province
has set the targets of producing 70 million tons of coal and
develop an installed power capacity of eight million kw annually
by the year 2000.

NEW DELHI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment bankers want
a revision of India's tariff structure for basic telecom services
as a precondition for funding the newly licensed private projects,
an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
They also want a reduction in the number of seekers of debt and
equity finance through a special purpose vehicle in which
individual licensees may have proportionate stake.
</P>
<P>
In their presentations to the government, the foreign bankers
made out a strong case for setting right the lopsided nature of
tariff that makes the charges for local calls disproportionately
higher but keeps the long-distance charges lower.
</P>
<P>
The foreign bankers, who may have to provide 80 percent of the
funding of 15 billion US dollars necessary in the first five
years, have expressed their inability to tie up the funds without
removal of the skew in the tariff structure.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor in Indonesia Draws World Bank's Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An expert at the World Bank's
Jakarta office Tuesday urged the Indonesian government to
intervene in the exploitative child labor and poor working
conditions, especially for women, in the country.
</P>
<P>
The expert, Nisha Agrawal, made the call at a seminar here on
Indonesia's economic reforms and labor market restructuring.
</P>
<P>
According to a labor force survey of Indonesia, about two
million children aged between 10 and 14 are working voluntarily to
help their families make both ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Nisha said the number of child workers in the country was
declining thanks to a nine-year compulsory education program and
an economic growth in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, while the total number of child workers dropped by
about 26 percent from 1986 to 1994, the number of children working
in urban areas has doubled due to industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Nisha also urged the government to address the poor working
conditions for women, especially in the labor-intensive
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
She criticized the nationwide malpractice for not providing
women workers with family and medical allowances, adding that
women workers are still subject to discrimination in the country.

<P>
KATHMANDU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of an unknown
epidemic has claimed more than 200 lives at villages in western
Nepal in the last two months, the Kathmandu Post said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 218 people had died of the mysterious fever in the
hilly districts of Bajura, Jajarkot and Achham as local hospitals
failed to control the spread of the disease due to lack of
medicine and health workers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent a team of doctors and other medical
help to the three affected districts, Director General of the
Health Department Kalyan Pandey said in an interview with the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"The disease broke out two months ago but we did not know about
it until it was very late," said Pandey.
</P>
<P>
People who are hit by the disease often die suddenly after
suffering apparently common symptoms like light fever, headache,
pain in the joints and loss of appetite, said the report.
</P>

Health Minister Arjun Narsingh K. C. Tuesday inspected two
villages affected by the epidemic in Jajarkot and Achham

<HEADLINE> Cement Stock Gluts Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cement companies in Vietnam are
searching for ways to dispose of their rising stock in the face of
sluggish market demand, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
The stock in Ho Chi Minh City already reached 180,000 tons
while the reserve in Hanoi is still growing by an average of 500
to 1,000 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
Cement imports from China, South Korea and Thailand have
reached 280,000 tons, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The overstock came in the wake of last year's cement crisis
which was caused by a shortfall in supply and highly inflated
prices.
</P>
<P>
Though the Ministry of Construction estimated that the country
needs to stock 500,000 tons of cement this year, the estimate
backfired against cement companies as demand has been dropping
since late January and the pace of construction projects has
slowed down.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials, however, still predicted an annual demand
of 8.5 million tons for the year and expected a shortfall of 1.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The country has planned to build 19 large cement plants to cope
with an expected 20 percent annual increase in demand.

<HEADLINE> Leading Indicators Surge in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Conflicting U.S. economic figures
today showed a sharp recovery in a key index of short-term
economic indicators, but lower than estimated growth in the
economy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, an important gauge of
future economic activity, made its sharpest monthly gain in 20
years in February, climbing 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the index's publishers, the private business research group
Confeence Board, said the rise was largely due to businesses
recovering from January's blizzards. And analysts said the rebound
doesn't signal a coming boom.
</P>
<P>
The government announced that economic growth in the
fourth quarter of 1995 was lower than previously estimated, at 0.5
percent rather than the forecast 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) -- the total output of goods and
services in the United States -- grew just 2 percent last year,
the smallest annual advance since the economy shrank 1 percent
during a recession in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The monthly rise in the Index in February was the largest since
a 1.4 percent gain in January 1976. But economists view the index
as a true indication of the future only when it moves in the same
direction for three straight months or more.
</P>
<P>
So while the index rose 0.5 per cent to 101.5 in February, it
fell 0.5 percent in January to 100.2, against 100.7 in December.
The index is based on a 1987 benchmark of 100.
</P>
<P>
Of the index's 11 components, seven increased, including the
prices of materials, vendor deliveries, unfilled orders for
durable goods and building permits. Four indicators, including
consumer expectations and first-time claims for unemployment
declined.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said its downward revision of fourth
quarter growth, despite strong consumer spending, was due to
sluggish capital spending by companies. The change, from 0.9 to
0.5 percent, was greater than the 0.8 percent analysts had
pencilled in.
</P>
<P>
For the year, the government revised its GDP
estimate down from 2.1 percent to two percent.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Teenage pregnancy and abortion
rates in the United States were high in the early 1990s,
according to a report in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The report said, statistics from 40 states show that the
pregnancy rate among the under-15 group was 6.3 per thousand in
1980, rising to 6.9 by 1985 and to 7.1 by 1990.
</P>
<P>
Among girls ages 15 to 19, it was 88.8 per thousand in
1980, dipping to 87.7 in 1985 and rising again to 95.9 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The federal government's goal was no births in the under-15 age
group by 1990. But in that year, 22,928 girls younger than 15
became pregnant, 11,657 gave birth and 11,271 had abortions, the
report said.

</P>
<P>
The statement said that others in the 14-member cabinet had
also offered to resign, a usual move to give the president a
free hand in forming a new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Cordova, also education minister, was named prime minister last
July when Fujimori began his second five-year presidential term.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Pepsi, the cola giant now running
almost neck and neck with Coca-Cola in the United States, kicked
off a 500 million-U.S.-dollar promotional campaign today to catch
up with its rival in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Pepsi is launching a new can in European and other world
markets, shedding its red, white and blue logo for a vivid blue
can, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is part of Pepsi's plan to close the gap with
Coca-Cola, the dominant cola outside the Unites States.
</P>
<P>
Although Pepsi did not release plans for the can in its home
market and Canada, it said the new packaging would eventually be
used worldwide.
</P>
<P>
With little growth in the North American cola market, Pepsi is
looking for a way to stand out on shelves full of bright-red Coke
cans.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus Agree to Establish New Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus today signed a
treaty of establishing the Community of Sovereign Republics in a
bid to speed up economic and political integration among the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony in the Kremlin, Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said the signing was a "historic moment," and called
the treaty a "document that opens a radically new stage in the
history of two sovereign peoples, two sovereign states."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is seeking a second term as president in June
elections, hopes the treaty will attract voters nostalgic for the
Soviet Union while Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, who
arrived early today, wants Russia to help solve his country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was also the culmination of Lukashenko's
two-year drive to bring his country of 10 million back into a
union of some kind with their 150 million Russian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"The dream of the peoples of the former Soviet Union to join
together, especially the Slavs, is starting to come true," said
Lukashenko at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, The Russian parliament hailed the signing of
the treaty, saying it will serve the integration of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the signing is
a first step in the process of closer integration, and hoped that
other CIS member states will join in the integration process.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Belarus treaty said both had "decided on a voluntary
basis to form a deeply integrated political and economic Community
of Sovereign Republics".
</P>
<P>
Other economic clauses of the treaty envisage synchronized
moves by the end of 1997 to create a common market with free
movement of goods, services, capital and labor.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, a council, with Lukashenko as its chairman,
will govern the community.
</P>
<P>
The council is made up of the two countries' presidents, prime
ministers and parliament leaders.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the new union came just two weeks after the
Russian State Duma passed a resolution declaring the breakup of
the Soviet Union in 1991 illegal and demanding its restoration.
</P>
<P>
Call and Support for deepening ties between former Soviet Union
republics have been growing, especially in Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan, whose economic reforms have been in trouble without
subsidies and cheap energy from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Belarus signed a
an agreement pledging to expand links among themselves.

I. Guarantee of Children's Rights and Interests
</P>
<P>
Children are the future and hope of mankind. Today's children
will be masters of the 21st century. Children's survival,
protection and development, which are the basis for improving the
quality of the population and the prerequisite conditions for the
advance of mankind, directly concern a country and a nation's
future and destiny. The Chinese nation has long cultivated the
traditional virtues of "bringing along the young" and "loving
the young." An old saying, "Love our own and others' children,"
is still very popular. The Chinese Government, with an earnest and
responsible attitude, always shows great concern for children's
survival, protection and development. It regards "the education
of children to improve the quality of the whole people" as a
fundamental policy for its socialist modernization program. The
government educates society at large to "protect and educate
children, and set an example and do practical things for
children." It spares no effort to create favorable social
conditions for the progress of children's programs. Since the
initiation of reform and opening to the outside world, children's
programs in China have moved into social, scientific and legal
tracks; and children's programs have become an important component
part of the nation's construction and the duties of the whole
society.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Situation of Children in China Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A white paper on the situation of
children in China released today by the Information Office of the
State Council fully introduces to the world, with a host of facts
and accurate statistics, the unremitting efforts China has made
made and the achievements it has scored in children's survival,
protection and development, refuting the slandering and
accusations about the situation of children in China by some
foreign media and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
The paper on "The Situation of Children in China" consists of
five parts: "Guarantee of Children's Rights and Interests",
"Children's Health and Care", "Education for Children",
"Protection of Disabled Children", and "China's Welfare Homes for
Children", totalling 15,000 Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The paper says, China has a population of over 1.2 billion, of
whom over 300 million are children under the age of 16, making up
about one fifth of the total number of children in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, with an earnest and responsible
attitude, always shows great concern for children's survival,
protection and development. Since the initiation of reform and
opening to the outside world, children's programs in China have
moved into social, scientific and legal tracks, and children's
programs have become an important component part of the nation's
construction and the duties of the whole society, the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
The paper continues, the Chinese government has done a great
deal of painstaking work in protecting children's lives and
health. As a result, remarkable success has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the 1990s, the annual rate of decrease
of infant mortality in China is 6.5 percent and that of children
under five years old is 5.85 percent. The paper points out that so
far, no other country in the world enjoying an annual per capita
income approximate to China has reached such a high level.
</P>
<P>
It says, the Chinese government always gives pride of place to
children's education in the promotion of education in general. In
1995, the enrollment ratio of school-age children in primary
schools was 98.5 percent, the enrollment ratio of school-age girls
was 98.2 percent, and 90.8 percent of primary school graduates
entered a higher school.
</P>
<P>
The paper stresses, China has all along attached importance to
protecting disabled children, making great efforts to create
favorable conditions for their survival and development.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had rectified 360,000 children of
polio sequelae, a success rate of 98 percent; helped more than
60,000 deaf children recover their hearing and speech abilities,
provided 30,000 poor-sighted children with sight aids and helped
100,000 mentally retarded children enhence their cognitive ability
and ability of taking care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
The paper gives detailed introduction of China's welfare homes
for children. It says, by the end of 1995, there were a total of
73 welfare homes for children set up by local governments, taking
care of 8,900 orphans and abandoned ill or disabled children. More
than 1,200 social welfare institutions and some homes for the aged
in rural areas have also offered guardianship and rearing to
orphans and abandoned ill or disabled children.
</P>
<P>
The paper says, currently, there are about 20,000 such children
under the guardianship and rearing of welfare institutions,
accounting for five per one hundred thousand of the total number
of juveniles in China.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Chinese government appropriated 740
million yuan specially for the improvement of welfare homes for
children. These funds have guaranteed the basic needs of the
children's lives in the welfare homes.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out, China has made great efforts to support
the survival, protection and development of children. the UNICEF,
UNESCO, WHO and other international organizations and public
figures all made positive comments on China's achievements in this
connection.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the paper says, the Chinese government is sober
about the fact that since China is a developing country with a
large population and since its economic foundation is still
comparatively weak, its per capita income is in a rather rear
position in the world per capita income listings and its
development level is unbalanced between city and countryside and
between different areas, there is much difficulty in the work for
children and therefore much room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes, therefore, as China develops economically and
socially, an important task facing the Chinese government is to
constantly improve children's conditions and promote activities
and programs to help children.
</P>
<P>
The paper also refutes strongly in the appendix the slandering
and accusations about China's children's welfare institutions by
Britain's commercial television station Channel Four and Human
Rights Watch/Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes Human Rights Watch/Asia's Accusations on China's Children's Welfare Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A white paper on the situation of
children in China released today by the Information Office of the
State Council refuted in the appendix the slandering and
accusations on China's children's welfare institutions by Human
Rights Watch/Asia.
</P>
<P>
The paper says the Human Rights Watch/Asia made a gratuitous
accusation in its report, published on January 7, 1996, on the
situation of children's welfare homes in China. Many parts of the
report are cooked up based on distorted and exaggerated matters.
</P>
<P>
The censure of the report on the "maltreatment" of disabled
children by the Shanghai Municipal Welfare Home for Children is
not based on facts, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It says the Shanghai children's welfare home is a social
welfare charity institution directed by the Shanghai Municipal
Government. The institution now offers guardianship and rearing to
more than 500 children, most of whom are disabled, including over
100 disabled children entrusted to its care by the society. It has
a staff of 320 members, including 42 medical personnel, 23
teachers and 220 nurses.
</P>
<P>
The orphans in the welfare home receive food, medical treatment
and education. Regarding the food supply for the orphans, the
emphasis is placed on nutrition and nursing; the food menu,
designed to meet the needs of growing children, is worked out by a
nutritionist according to the physical conditions and ages of the
orphans. As a result, the paper says, the nutritional status of
the children is good overall.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that with regard to medical care and
rehabilitation, the welfare home has set up an in-patient
department and a children's rehabilitation center. Sick children
are taken care of in the welfare home or sent to larger hospitals
in the city for treatment, and physical check-ups are conducted
for those recovered from illness twice a year. Those who are
suitable for rectification are sent to the city's major hospitals
to receive the operation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the last two years 87 disabled children
have received surgical operations. Rehabilitative training has
been practiced on children suffering from impaired or abnormal
motion, with the recovery rate reaching 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The paper goes on to say that in education, school-age children
with physical deformities but normal mental conditions are sent,
at the welfare home's expense, to study in ordinary primary or
middle schools, while the blind and deaf-mutes are sent to
special schools. There are 32 children who study outside the
welfare home.
</P>
<P>
In order to strengthen their education, two teachers are
designated to instruct and take care of them after class. In
addition, funded by the public, the welfare home has set
up a school with 2,500 square meters of floor space and a sports
ground of 1,200 square meters to provide the orphans and disabled
children who can not go out to study in ordinary schools with an
excellent education environment.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the above, the legal rights of the disabled in the
Shanghai children's welfare home are well protected, the paper
stresses.
</P>
<P>
It says China's children's welfare homes accept visitors and
welcome the exchange of experiences as well as cooperation with
other countries. Nearly every day people go to visit these
institutions; some work as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The paper concludes by saying that it is neither reasonable nor
responsible that governments and political figures in some
countries should denounce the Chinese Government merely on the
basis of the report cooked up and dished out by the Human Rights
Watch/Asia.

<HEADLINE> China Releases White Paper on Situation of Its Children (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
a white paper on the situation of children in China, which was
released here today by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The Situation of Children in China
</P>
<P>
Foreword
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country with a population of over 1.2
billion, of whom over 300 million are children under the age of 16,
making up about one fifth of the total number of children in the
world.
</P>
<P>
What is the situation of Chinese children today? The 1996 State
of the World's Children Report of the United Nations issued a
group of figures, which reflect concrete conditions in the
following aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- The basic indexes on children. In 1994, the mortality rate
of children under five in developing countries was 101 per thousand;
that in East Asia and the Pacific region, 56 per thousand; and in
China, 43 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
-- Children's nutrition. Between 1980 and 1994, children with
low weight in developing countries made up 35 percent on average,
23 percent in East Asia and the Pacific region, and 17 percent in
China.
</P>
<P>
-- Health care for children. In 1994, in developing countries,
one-year-old children who were immune to the BCG vaccine totaled
87 percent; those immune to pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, 80
percent; to infantile paralysis, 80 percent; and to measles, 78
percent. The immunity percentages for East Asia and the Pacific
region were respectively 94 percent, 91 percent, 92 percent and 89
percent; and those for China, 94 percent, 93 percent, 94 percent
and 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- Children's education. Between 1986 and 1993, the net
attendance rate of schoolage boys of primary schools in developing
countries averaged 87 percent, and that of girls, 80 percent. This
compares to, respectively, 99 percent and 94 percent in East Asia
and the Pacific region, and 99 percent and 94 percent in China.
</P>
<P>
To help the world toward a more comprehensive understanding of
the situation of Chinese children, of how the Chinese Government
and the whole society protect children's survival and development,
and of the difficulties and problems on the development of
children that remain to be resolved in a developing country like
China, we now reveal to the public a range of relevant information
about the condition of children in China.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes British TV's Accusations on China's Children's Welfare Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua)-- A white paper on the situation of
children in China released here today by the Information Office of
the State Council refuted in the appendix the slandering and
accusations on China's children's welfare institutions by the
British commercial television station Channel Four.
</P>
<P>
The British commercial television station Channel Four
broadcast "Secret Asia, the Dying Rooms" on June 14, 1995, and
"Return to the Dying Rooms" (a refurbished version of the former)
on January 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out that using clumsy tricks, the programs
stated that in China's children's welfare homes there were "dying
rooms" where children were abused to death.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that an investigation proved that the so-called
"dying rooms" in the program "Secret Asia, the Dying Rooms" refer
actually to a warehouse in the Huangshi City Social Welfare Home
in Hubei Province and that the major part of the program is
fabricated.
</P>
<P>
The "Dying Rooms" claimed that in 1994 more than 80 children
died in that house. This is sheer fabrication, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the welfare home's statistics record and
the list of children taken in or identified and adopted shows that
there were 161 children in the institution in 1994 and 128 were
adopted later in the year. How come more than 80 children
died? Claiming that the empty beds formerly used by children who
were later adopted or identified and so left the welfare home were
the beds of dead children and further referring to the warehouse
as the "dying rooms" is deliberate distortion of facts.
</P>
<P>
Using wanton fabrication to cheat and mislead viewers cannot
but arouse indignation among the people, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that China, which has opened its door to the
outside world, now receives millions of foreign visitors every
year. They have opportunities to see the true situation, one which
is completely contrary to what's described in the "Dying Rooms."

<HEADLINE> China Makes Achievements in Reducing Infant Mortality Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of decrease of
infant mortality in China since 1990 is 6.5 percent and that of
children under five years old is 5.85 percent. So far, no other
country in the world enjoying an annual per capita income
approximate to China's has reached such a high level, according to
the white paper on the situation of Chinese children issued by the
Information Office of the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of China's immunization program at the
end of the 1970s, great achievements have been made and the
incidence of infectious diseases has sharply declined, the white
paper says. A national report on the country's epidemic situation
reveals that the number of cases of measles, diphtheria, pertussis
and poliomyelitis in 1994 dropped by 96.4, 99.4, 99.3 and 97.5
percent respectively compared with 1978; the death rate decreased
by 97.4, 99.3, 96.5 and 97.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The white paper notes that China considers reducing children's
mortality caused by pneumonia and diarrhoea as an important and
urgent task of its medical and health work for children. For this
purpose a series of measures, such as popularizing proper
techniques, personnel training, health education and monitoring
systems have been adopted to reduce infant mortality, especially
rural infant mortality. In order to eliminate infant mortality
caused by tetanus, China, while continuing to popularize the new
methods of child delivery and encourage hospital childbirths, has
striven to rapidly develop immunization work among women of
childbearing age.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, China has paid great attention to
improving children's nutritional status and adopted various
medical and health measures.
</P>
<P>
In the early period after the founding of the People's Republic
of China the government handed out infant food in some areas. In
the 1960s and 1970s a scientific diet for children was popularized
in China. the supplementary food was developed in the 1980s and
breast feeding was advocated and dietary scheme was optimized in
the 1990s, having greatly improved the nutritional status of
Chinese children. Now it is rare to find cases of serious
malnutrition caused by shortage of food or cases of serious
vitamin-A deficiency. By the end of 1995, 2,957 baby friendly
hospitals had been constructed, ranking first in number in the
world.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, in order to improve the level of medical
treatment and health care and the nutritional status of children
in rural areas, measures for promoting the building of township
clinics, county health and antiepidemic stations, and county
health centers for women and children have been adopted by the
state, the white paper says. Compared with 1990, the rate of
malnutrition in children under five years old had dropped by 23.82
percent in 1995.

speech and performing cataract operations). By the end of 1995,
China had rectified 360,000 children of polio sequelae (a success
rate of 98 percent), helped more than 60,000 deaf children recover
their hearing and speech abilities (10 percent of which had
entered regular kindergartens and elementary schools to receive
regular education), had provided 30,000 poor-sighted children with
sight aids and helped 100,000 mentally retarded children enhance
their cognitive capacity and self-sufficiency. At present, China
has established the National Rehabilitation Research Center for
Deaf Children, in addition to 26 provincial-level rehabilitation
centers for deaf children and over 1,000 rehabilitation stations,
kindergartens and training classes for disabled children.
</P>
<P>
Community rehabilitation service systems for disabled children
also have been set up. China has fully used the urban-rural
three-level network of health services to develop community
rehabilitation, helping most disabled children in grassroots areas
enjoy basic rehabilitation services. Moreover, under the
leadership of local governments at different levels, community
rehabilitation leading groups have been founded, consisting of
public health departments, civil administration departments,
disabled persons' federations and other relevant departments,
which coordinate and cooperate with each other to mutually
formulate community rehabilitation plans and manage their
implementation.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs started to
cooperate with the UNICEF in the Community Rehabilitation for
Disabled Children project. By the end of 1994, the rehabilitation
network for disabled children covered 32 cities and counties in 23
provinces of the country and systematically trained disabled
children's parents and rehabilitation instructors. These efforts
were successful in effectively improving the management of the
rehabilitation work for disabled children.

IV. Protection of Disabled Children
</P>
<P>
China has all along attached great importance to protecting
disabled children, making great efforts to create favorable
conditions for their survival and development.

Protection of Disabled Children's Rights and Interests
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has devoted much attention to
guaranteeing the rights and interests of disabled children. Among
children aged 14 and under, there are over 9 million disabled,
accounting for 2.66 percent of the total number of children in
China. The Chinese Constitution and relevant laws contain clear
statements regarding the rights and interests of the disabled,
including disabled children. The Law on the Protection of Disabled
Persons contains all-inclusive, systematic provisions guaranteeing
the legitimate rights and interests of the disabled. It states
clearly that the disabled enjoy equal rights with other citizens
in all spheres: political, economic, cultural, social and family
life; that discrimination, insult and harassment against the
disabled are prohibited; that the state should develop disability
prevention programs; and that the rights of the disabled to
rehabilitation, education, labor, entertainment and welfare should
be protected. While all these provisions also apply to disabled
children, the law includes specific statements on special
protection of disabled children.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect rights and interests of the disabled and
promote their cause, the China Disabled Persons' Federation
(CDPF), an organization that represents the disabled, serves their
interests and administrates the work concerning the disabled, has
been established with the approval of the Chinese Government. One
of its principal tasks is to protect the lawful rights and
interests of disabled children. Also, local disabled persons'
federations at the provincial (autonomous regional and municipal),
prefectural and county levels have been established to serve the
disabled, including disabled children in the region, and
administrate their affairs.

III. Education for Children
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government always gives pride of place to
children's education in the promotion of education in
general. Thanks to the mutual efforts made by the government and
society, children's education in China has seen great progress in
the past few years, with many indexes higher than those of other
developing countries and some indexes close to those of developed
countries.

Vigorously Increase Input in Education
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has established an educational
fund-raising system, whereby financial allocations are the
predominant source, with funds collected through other channels as
a supplement. It is stipulated that the increase of allocations
for education by the central and local governments should be
higher than the increase of regular revenue, thus ensuring a
year-by-year increase of average educational appropriations for
every student.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1994 China spent 59.4 billion yuan
on primary education, with operating expenses for public use
averaging 89.47 yuan per student; 43.5 billion yuan was spent on
ordinary middle schools, with operating expenses for public use
averaging 239.89 yuan per student.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government pays great attention to educational
development in remote and poor areas, as well as areas inhabited
by national minorities. Since the 1980s, the state has
appropriated school aid for the popularization of primary
education, and subsidies for developing vocational education,
normal education and education for national minorities. The State
Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance have decided that
in 1995-2000, the special funds allocated by the central
government for the popularization of compulsory education, plus
the supporting money provided by the local governments, should be
used to implement the National Compulsory Education Project in
Poor Areas. It is estimated that over 10 billion yuan will be put
into the project. The money will be used mainly to improve
conditions in primary schools and junior middle schools in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
China has been making great efforts in raising educational
funds through various channels. According to incomplete
statistics, during 1991-94, it collected a total of 33.8 billion
yuan for primary and middle schools to buy more and better quality
teaching aids, books and reference materials, sports requisites
and campus facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has made great efforts to support the survival,
protection and development of children. The UNICEF, UNESCO, WHO
and other international organizations and public figures all made
positive comments on China's achievements in this connection. Of
course, the Chinese Government is sober about the fact that since
China is a developing country with a large population and since
its economic foundation is still comparatively weak, its per
capita income is in a rather rear position in the world per capita
income listings and its development level is unbalanced between
city and countryside and between different areas, there is much
difficulty in the work for children and therefore much room for
improvement. Take medical care for children, for example. The
incidence of disease among children in the countryside is high and
in some poor areas children's nutrition is below the normal
level. As for children's education, the teaching conditions in
some outlying and poor areas are not up to par and the phenomenon
of primary and middle school children discontinuing their studies
still exists. As for the protection of disabled children, the
state is not able to amass in a short period enough money to fully
satisfy the actual needs in the protection of these
children. Since the level of economic development varies from area
to area, some welfare homes are better run than others with
economic difficulties. Therefore, as China develops economically
and socially, an important task facing the Chinese Government is
to constantly improve children's conditions and promote activities
and programs to help children. The Chinese Government will
continue to work persistently toward this end, as it has done in
the past, and the cause of children will surely develop further as
a result.

V. China's Welfare Homes for Children
</P>
<P>
China's welfare homes for children play a special role in the
country's efforts to care for children. The welfare homes and some
social welfare institutions that also accept orphans offer
guardianship and rearing to mainly children who have lost their
parents during natural disasters or accidents, and also to those
abandoned by their parents because they are seriously disabled
mentally or physically, or because they have contracted a serious
illness. Currently, there are about 20,000 such children under the
guardianship and rearing of welfare institutions, accounting for
five per one hundred thousand of the total number of juveniles in
China.

Rearing Under Guardianship
</P>
<P>
In China, such rearing and emplacement of orphans or children
abandoned for physical disability are under the charge of civil
administration departments.
</P>
<P>
These are the ways that orphans are reared under guardianship
in China: social welfare institutions set up by the government or
collectives offer guardianship and rearing to some of the orphans
till their adult age and give life support to idiotic and
seriously disabled orphans under their care; some orphans are
brought up in citizens' homes under the guardianship of welfare
institutions; some orphans are adopted by domestic citizens and a
small number by foreign citizens according to relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, there were a total of 73 welfare homes for
children set up by local governments, offering guardianship and
rearing to 8,900 orphans and abandoned ill or disabled
children. More than 1,200 social welfare institutions and some
homes for the aged in rural areas have also offered guardianship
and rearing to orphans and abandoned ill or disabled
children. Some orphans and abandoned ill or disabled children are
under the care of or adopted by common people. Moreover, there
are a total of nearly ten thousand organizations serving orphans
and disabled persons in communities throughout China, such as
schools for orphans, rehabilitation centers, training classes for
mentally retarded children, rehabilitation stations for disabled
children and community rehabilitation stations, as well as about a
hundred social welfare institutions established by individuals or
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Apart from welfare institutions set up by the government and
the society to take care of orphans and abandoned children, China
encourages citizens to adopt these children so that they can enjoy
a normal family life and grow up sound of body and mind. In order
to protect legal adoption and the legal rights of the persons
concerned, and to benefit the care and growth of adopted
juveniles, the NPC Standing Committee of China stipulated the
Adoption Law. According to this law, the Ministry of Justice and
the Ministry of Civil Affairs, with the approval of the State
Council, published for implementation the Procedures for the
Adoption of Children by Foreigners in the People's Republic of
China. The adoption of orphans in China has laws to go by and is
in full accord with the principles put forward by the United
Nations in the Convention on the Rights of Children.
</P>
<P>
All adoption procedures are done strictly according to law.
Both Chinese citizens and foreigners shall meet the conditions
required by law and go through all necessary procedures. While
handling the adoption procedures for the person concerned, the
related departments of the Chinese Government charge the fees
strictly according to law. As required by law, the adoptor shall
pay to the welfare home the cost for upbringing of the adoptee,
which will then be used to improve living conditions for other
children in the institution. This cost is determined mainly
through negotiations between the two parties.

China considers reducing children's mortality caused by
pneumonia and diarrhoea as an important and urgent task of its
medical and health work for children. For this purpose the Chinese
Ministry of Public Health has formulated the National Plan on
Controlling Infection of Children's Respiratory Tract (1992-95)
and the Plan on Controlling Diarrhoea (1990-94) and implemented a
series of measures, such as popularizing proper techniques,
personnel training, health education and monitoring systems. These
have all served to reduce infant mortality, especially rural
infant mortality. Management projects on standard AIR cases had
been expanded to 53 counties in 24 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities and diarrhoea control projects had covered 17
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities by 1994. And at
the same time, 360,000 township and village doctors from 300 poor
counties have been trained on managing standard AIR cases and
controlling diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
Before 1949, tetanus was one of the main causes of death in
China's newborn babies. Health centers for women and children were
set up throughout China from the 1950s to the 1960s and new
methods for child delivery as a major measure for controlling
puerperal fever and tetanus neonatorum have been crowned with
remarkable success. In 1993, the Ministry of Public Health of
China put forward a new task to further reduce infant mortality
caused by tetanus, so as to meet the 2000 international standard
for eliminating tetanus. In 1995, the Ministry of Public Health
promulgated the National Action Plan on Eliminating Tetanus
Neonatorum. Basing on data gathered from investigation and
monitoring, it designated areas highly susceptible to tetanus
neonatorum attacks and, while continuing to popularize the new
methods of child delivery and encourage hospital childbirths,
strove to rapidly develop immunization work among women of
childbearing age.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Good Care of Disabled Children: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has all along attached
importance to protecting disabled children, making great efforts
to create favorable conditions for their survival and
development, according to the White Paper on "The Situation of
Children in China", which was issued by the Information office of
the State Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper says that the Chinese government has expended
great efforts to prevent congenital disability by adopting a
series of measures, such as a comprehensive immunization program
and supplying iodized salt. Meanwhile, the country has actively
developed the "Three Recoveries" program (rectifying polio
sequelae, training deaf or dumb children to hear or speak and
performing cataract operations). By the end of 1995 China had
rectified polio sequelae in 360,000 children (a success rate of 98
percent), helped more than 60,000 deaf or dumb children recover
their hearing or speech abilities (10 percent of them have since
entered regular kindergartens and elementary schools), provided
30,000 poor-sighted children with sight aids, and helped 100,000
mentaly retarded children enhance their cognitive capacity and
self-sufficiency. In addition, it has established the National
Rehabilitation Research Center for Deaf Children, in addition to
26 provincial-level rehabilitation centers for deaf children and
over 1,000 rehabilitation stations, kindergartens and training
classes for disabled children.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that after years of efforts China has formed a
compulsory education set-up for disabled children, with
special-education schools as well as special-education classes
attached to ordinary schools. By the end of 1995 China had set up
1,379 special-education schools for blind, deaf and mentally
retarded children, an increase of 400 percent over 1980. There
were also 6,510 special-education classes attached to
ordinary schools, with 296,000 disabled students (including those
attending regular schools), an increase of 800 percent over
1980. In addition, in 1995 the national average school enrollment
rate of blind, deaf and mentally retarded children reached 60
percent; in the economically developed areas enrollment reached
80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government has done a great deal of
work to mobilize various circles in society to care for, in
various ways, disabled children, to encourage the spirit of
self-improvement among disabled children and to advocate the
social virtues of unity, friendship and mutual aid. The Chinese
media actively reports on the lives of disabled children and the
work concerning the disabled. As a result, the broad masses of
people all over the country also widely participate in various
activities to help the disabled.

In order to eliminate poliomyelitis, while strengthening
regular work on immunity and the monitoring of poliomyelitis,
China performed nationwide six rounds of reinforced inoculations
on children under four years old, on December 5 and January 5
separately in each of the three years 1993-96, each round
involving about 80 million children. In this way the timetable
for eliminating poliomyelitis has been shortened.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of China's immunization program, great
achievements have been made and the incidence of infectious
diseases has sharply declined. A national report on the country's
epidemic situation reveals that the number of cases of measles,
diphtheria, pertussis and poliomyelitis in 1994 dropped by 96.4,
99.4, 99.3 and 97.5 percent respectively compared with 1978; the
death rate decreased by 97.4, 99.3, 96.5 and 97.7 percent
respectively. In 1994, the number of incidences of the
above-mentioned four epidemic diseases fell by about 3.517 million
and the number of deaths by about 13,000 as compared with 1978. In
1995, only one strain of a wild virus was found in the stool of a
child suffering from poliomyelitis who came from abroad to Yunnan
for medical treatment. No other poliomyelitis wild viruses were
found in Acute Flaccid Paralise cases.
</P>
<P>
China's immunization achievements have been highly praised by
the international community. On October 16, 1989, a silver medal
was awarded to the Chinese Health and Antiepidemic Department of
the Ministry of Public Health by the then UNICEF executive
director, James P. Grant to commend China's achievements made in
children's immunity work. On November 24, 1994 and August 8, 1995,
Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, Director General of the WHO and Dr S. T. Han,
Director of Western Pacific Regional Office of the WHO,
successively wrote letters to Li Peng, Premier of the State
Council of the People's Republic of China, and Qiao Shi, Chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in
which they spoke highly of these achievements and, on behalf of
the WHO, expressed their great satisfaction with China's work in
eliminating poliomyelitis. They held that China had played an
important role in the world public health field.

<HEADLINE> China Shows Concern for Children's Rights: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A white paper issued by China says
that the Chinese government, with an earnest and responsible
attitude, has always shown great concern and attached great
importance to children's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, titled "The situation of Children in China",
was released here today by the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
The paper says there are over 300 million children under the
age of 16 among China's population of over 1.2 billion, making up
about one fifth of the total number of children in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, with an earnest and responsible
attitude, always shows great concern for children's survival,
protection and development, it stresses.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Chinese government formally promulgated the
Outline of the Program for Chinese Children's Development in the
1990s, which puts forward ten main objectives and measures for
realizing these objectives.
</P>
<P>
The paper goes on to say that the constitution of China
clearly specifies that "... children are protected by the state"
and "maltreatment of ...children is prohibited".
</P>
<P>
Formulated according to the constitution, China's relevant
laws include comprehensive and systematic provisions on children's
right to life, survival and development, as well as basic health
and health care. The provisions also address children's family
environment and institutional care, education, free time and
cultural activities, and the special protection of disabled
children.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's constitution, laws and relevant
administrative legislation also include comparatively complete
provisions on the government's functions, society's participation,
work principles and corresponding legal responsibilities in the
protection of children's rights and interests. The judicial
procedure attaches great importance to the protection of
juveniles' legal rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The paper concludes that China's legal framework for the
protection of children's interests and its social guarantee
mechanisms are effective in practice.
</P>
<P>
To truly protect children's rights and interests, China's
legislation, and judicial and government departments concerned as
well as mass organizations have set up corresponding mechanisms
to supervise, effect and propel the healthy development of work
impacting children's protection, it adds.
</P>
<P>
China has taken an active part in global and regional
co-operation and exchanges regarding children's survival,
protection and development, actively participated in working out
the UN Convention on the Rights of Children, and was one of the
co-sponsor countries that raised the draft resolution for the
approval of the convention, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Priority Given to Children's Education: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Children's education always claims
precedence in China's educational development, and 98.5 percent of
all school-age children across the country were at school in 1995,
the Information Office of the State Council stated in a white
paper issued here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Situation of Children in China", as the white paper is
named, said that the Chinese government always gives pride of
place to children's education in the promotion of education in
general. In 1994 China spent 59.4 billion yuan on primary
education, with operating expenses for public use averaging 89.47
yuan per student; 43.5 billion yuan was spent on ordinary middle
schools, with operating expenses for public use averaging 239.89
yuan per student.
</P>
<P>
China has been making great efforts to raise educational funds
through various channels. During 1991-1994 it collected a total of
33.8 billion yuan for primary and middle schools to buy more and
better quality teaching aids, books and reference materials,
sports requisites and campus facilities.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that popularization of compulsory
nine-year schooling is the key goal of China's elementary
education program. In 1995 the number of children attending
primary schools reached 131.95 million, with an enrollment rate of
98.5 percent of children of school age. In 1995 the enrollment
ratio of school-age girls in primary schools was 98.2 percent. And
90.8 percent of the primary school graduates entered higher
schools. According to China's present standard on popularization
of compulsory primary schooling, elementary education has been
basically popularized in an area covering 91 percent of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that UNESCO statistics show that the
enrollment ratio of school-age children in China is much higher
than in other countries of the same economic development level.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the concern of and vigorous promotion by the
government, people from all walks of life have been helping
drop-out children from poverty-stricken areas to return to school.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the Hope Project, which provides
grants-in-aid as long-term financial assistance to children in
poor areas who have dropped out of school because of straitened
family circumstances, had raised 690 million yuan, given financial
assistance to 1.25 million children for continuing primary
education and subsidized construction of over 2,000 Hope Project
primary schools. The Spring Buds Program, providing a special fund
to help girls in poor areas to receive charge-free compulsory
primary education, helped 100,000 girls return to school in 1994
and 1995.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Welfare Homes Look After 20,000 Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- There are around 20,000 children,
or five for every 100,000 of the total number of juveniles in
China, who are being taken care of in various kinds of welfare
homes, according to the white paper on "The Situation of Children
in China", issued here today by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The white paper notes that welfare homes for children in China
play a special role in the country's efforts to care for children.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 there were a total of 73 welfare homes for
children set up by local governments, taking care of 8,900 orphans
and abandoned disabled children. More than 1,200 social welfare
institutions and homes for the aged in rural areas have also
taken in orphans and abandoned disabled children. Currently, there
are around 20,000 children in the care of welfare institutions,
accounting for five per one hundred thousand of the total number
of juveniles in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, most of the funds for China's welfare
homes for children come from appropriations by state and local
financial departments, collective fund raising, welfare lotteries
and donations.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1994 local financial departments had appropriated
a total of 515 million yuan directly for urban welfare homes for
children. Of this total, 40 percent was used for the basic needs
of the children, increasing by 25.5 percent annually. During this
period the state appropriated 740 million yuan specially for the
improvement of the welfare homes for children. All these funds
have ensured the basic needs for children's lives in the welfare
homes.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the welfare homes for children in China
practise the principle of combining upbringing, treatment and
education.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the number of sick or disabled children in these homes
nursed back to health reached 200, and a total of 40 percent of
children in the welfare homes taking part in rehabilitation
training programs, and many of them have recovered or basically
recovered from disability. Welfare homes for children boast
doctors, rehabilitators, nutritionists, as well as clinics,
rehabilitation rooms, emergency treatment rooms, laboratories and
pharmacies, giving timely treatment to ailing children.
</P>
<P>
In welfare homes normal children receive compulsory education,
while the blind, deaf and mentally retarded children are educated
in special schools at the welfare homes' expense. Many children
have been brought up at the welfare homes. At present, China has
a contingent of professional staff who are devoted to the
well-being of orphans and disabled children; medical personnel
account for 32 percent of the total welfare home staff.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, mass movements to help orphans have
blossomed. many urban families take children from children's
welfare institutions and let them stay in their homes during
holidays or at ordinary times so that these children can enjoy the
warmth and affection of a family.

<HEADLINE> China Releases White Paper on Situation of Its Children (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
II. Children's Health and Care
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government and various circles in Chinese society
have paid great attention to the health and care of its children.
Much painstaking work has been done in protecting children's lives
and health. As a result of these efforts, remarkable success has
been achieved.

Birth and Death
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China's birthrate was 17.12 per thousand and 20.63
million children were born, the natural growth rate being 10.55
per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The mortality of children under five years old is an important
indication of the situation of children in a country. According to
a national maternity and child-care monitoring report in 1994, the
infant mortality of China decreased to 37.79 per thousand from 200
per thousand in the early 1950s and the mortality rate for
children under five years old to 46.75 per thousand. From 1950 to
1980, the annual decrease rate of China's infant mortality was
above five percent, higher than the annual decrease rate (2.5
percent) of the average infant mortality of developing countries
in the same period and also higher than that (4.6 percent) of
developed countries. In the 1990s, the annual rate of decrease of
infant mortality in China is 6.50 percent and that of children
under five years old is 5.85 percent. So far, no other country in
the world enjoying an annual per capita income approximate to
China has reached such a high level.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Power Market Important, Says French Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear power development
plays "a very important role" in the international market, said a
visiting French official.
</P>
<P>
While the nuclear power market of Western countries has
stabilized, China's still has prospects, Thierry Dujardin,
executive deputy director of the Division for International
Affairs of the Commission of Atomic Energy of France, recently
told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, nuclear power output accounts for 35 percent of the
total power output, while in France, it is 75 percent, Dujardin
said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop nuclear power as part of its effort to
ease energy shortages. By 2020, the installed capacity of nuclear
power plants is expected to account for more than six percent of
the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Dujardin said the Daya Bay and Ling'ao nuclear power plants and
the second-phase of the Qinshan plant have offered business
opportunities to French suppliers, and job opportunities to both
France and China.
</P>
<P>
The official said that he hopes France will continue to help
China develop nuclear power by providing equipment, and by
transferring technology.
</P>
<P>
Dujardin said his talks with his Chinese counterpart Li
Donghui, deputy director of the International Cooperation Bureau
under the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), had been
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Li said the two countries will continue cooperation in basic
research, nuclear power security, development and reactor
research.

<HEADLINE> Inland Province To Expand Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province
targets its annual tourism revenue at 100 million US dollars and
three billion yuan by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province's tourism income will then account for six percent
of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
It plans to receive a total of 100 million domestic and
overseas tourists over the next five years, with revenues reaching
320 million US dollars and 8.82 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has developed two major travel routes, with the western
one featuring its karst scenery and the eastern one its folk
customs.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years it will focus on developing four
trans-provincial routes from this provincial capital to Kunming,
Zhangjiajie, Chongqing and Liuzhou, all major tourist spots in
neighboring Yunnan, Hunan, Sichuan provinces and the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Guiyang-Kunming route is regarded as highly competitive
among China's newly developed travel routes.
</P>
<P>
Winding through western Guizhou to Kunming, a popular
destination for travelers from Southeast Asia, it takes in most of
Guizhou's karst scenery, including China's biggest waterfall,
Asia's biggest cave and a canyon.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 a total of 136,000 overseas and 17.5 million domestic
tourists arrived in the province, increases of 13 percent and 3.14
percent, respectively, over the previous year, and tourism
revenues reached 960 million yuan, according to the provincial
tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has built 38 hotels catering to overseas
travelers. These hotels are able to receive 150,000 visitors a
year, a number which will be doubled by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new airport is being constructed here, which is
scheduled to be put into operation in the summer of 1997.

BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa has assigned two deputy prime ministers to solve
problems raised by Northeastern farmers, who have protested at
Government House for almost a week.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Ministers Chavalit Yongchaiyudh will take charge
of the labor-related problems while Montri Pongpanich will look
into forest and land rights issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the Forum of the Poor, an umbrella organization
representing various protest groups with different demands, set
Thursday as a deadline for Banharn to intervene personally.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Northeastern farmers, slum-dwellers, dam-affected
villagers and laid-off workers have joined forces in the protest.
</P>
<P>
As the protest continues, Metropolitan Police Bureau officers
said the demonstrators were unlikely to go home soon because their
demands could not be tackled in a short time.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the protesters' threat to break into Government
House, Metropolitan police sources said that police are prepared
to cope with possible unrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) met here today to prepare
for the upcoming CIS summit in May.
</P>
<P>
The ministers focused on discussing the 1996-1997 draft plan on
the CIS intergration, the implementation of the CIS Collective
Security Treaty and the Abkhazian question.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on maintaining European security,
enhancing international cooperation and other issues.
</P>
<P>
On the Abkhazian question, the ministers failed to reach
consensus on the proposal put forward by Georgia on changing the
functions of the CIS peacekeeping forces stationed on its
territory.
</P>
<P>
A CIS military coordinator said Georgia demanded that the
peacekeeping forces be given a police role, and the question be
settled only through consultations between Georgia and Russia,
although the U.N. requests through tripartite negotiations by
Georgia, Russia and Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Georgia and Abkhazia signed in Moscow in May 1994 an agreement
on ceasefire and the deployment of the CIS peacekeeping forces in
Abkhazia. The tenure of the CIS peacekeepers was renewed for
another year in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The CIS official said if no agreement is reached until June
when the tenure of the peacekeeping forces expires, there will be
a danger of the renewal of conflicts in Abkhazia.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympic Games
organisers expressed confident that they will easily surpass their
390 million U.S. dollars sponsorship target after receiving
the support of a large international corporation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prediction came after the Sydney Organising Committee for
the Olympic Games (Socog) announced they had signed a record deal
with Coca-Cola giving the company exclusive soft drinks rights for
the 2000 Olympics and associated promotions in the four years
leading to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said it is estimated to be worth more
than 37.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The soft drinks company is the third major corporation to sign
a sponsorship agreement with the Socog. The others are Australian
communications company Telstra and IBM.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola vice-president Stuart Cross Wednesday said: "Sydney
2000 will be the biggest, most supported program in the history of
the company behind the Olympic movement."
</P>
<P>
Socog chief executive Mal Hemmerling said Socog was ahead of
schedule of its target to raise more than 390 million U.S. dollars
in national corporate partnerships and licensing agreements
towards the 1.56 billion U.S. dollars Olympic budget.
</P>
<P>
He said that bigger than expected returns from the marketing
wing of the Socog, along with large profits from TV rights, have
heightened expectations of a bumper profit for the Sydney 2000
Olympics.

villages, according to the Local Development Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rural self reliance program, introduced in the government's

<HEADLINE> G7 Says Reforms Needed to Cut Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth, reforming labor
markets and curbing public deficits are crucial to cut worsening
unemployment, The Group of Seven leading industrial nations said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A final statement, released by the two-day G7 conference of
labor and economics ministers in Lille, France, said the pressing
task was to make structural reforms in the labor market to make
it less rigid and more flexible to keep up with global trade
liberalization and the fast development of new technology.
</P>
<P>
Globalization and the development of information technology
breathe life into the world economy, but at the same time pose a
threat to labor markets, said the final statement.
</P>
<P>
The G7 nations -- the U.S., Canada, Britain, Italy, Germany,
Japan and France -- noted that small businesses could play a
bigger role in job creation so that they deserved more funds and
technological support from governments.
</P>
<P>
But vigorous growth could only be achieved with healthy public
finances, so G7 countries should try to control public spending
more effectively, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The G7 meeting was called by French President Jacques Chirac
to find ways to help beat unemployment which stands at some 22
million in the seven countries. Although unemployment in the
U.S. is around 5.5 percent, the average jobless rate in Europe is
11 percent.

<HEADLINE> European Monetary Institute Calls For Rectifying EU Finances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Monetary Institute today
called for the European Union (EU) nations to rectify their domestic
finances for a smooth entry into the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based institute, destined to be the central bank
of the entire future Europe, said given EU's current economic
situation, there is an urgent need for financial rectification.
</P>
<P>
Immediate actions are key to the success of the efforts in this
regard, the institute asserted in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the institute, said EMU's
timetable starting from early 1999 could be followed only with
appropriate economic policies, unified common standards, and
satisfactory economic developments.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, his institute hoped that EU member nations
could start early the financial rectification.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the 1995 performance, Lamfalussy said EU made great
progress in curbing inflation.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report, EU nations' inflation averaged
3 percent in 1995, the same as the previous year. However,
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria and Finland successfully managed to keep the
rate under annual 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lamfalussy noted, most EU nations still had budgetary
deficits substantially higher than 3 percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP) -- a limit set forth by the Maastricht
Treaty for further integrating Europe.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the total volume of state debt in many EU
nations were over 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The finance of public sectors is the weak point for keeping up
with the unified common monetary standards.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 12.4 million
security-holding Romanians have registered with nearly 4,000
state-owned enterprises, ending the government's second phase of
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
They account for 74.8 percent of the nation's security-holders,
Vice Prime Minister Mircea Cosea, who is in charge of the
implementation of the privatization program, said in a radio
broadcast today.
</P>
<P>
He said that those who don't want to register with state-owned
companies can go with four private capital funds by the end
of April.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the three-phased privatization program,
approved by the parliament in June 1995, demanded that
security-holders register with state or private companies.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase, the government issued privatization
securities to citizens free of charge.
</P>
<P>
And in the third phase, the state companies will turn the
securities into stocks which will then be returned to the same
security-holders.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the second phase, the government will
issue stock-holding certificates to its citizens and to form a
capital market in the country, Cosea added.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say the capital market will not be formed
until the completion of the privatization program, although
Romania set up a stock exchange last fall.

<HEADLINE> Dudayev: Russian Troops Must Withdraw Before Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev today said he was ready to negotiate with Moscow but only
after Russian troops had pulled out from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Real negotiations can only take place once military operations
have been halted and after Russian troops have withdrawn from the
Chechen republic," Dudayev told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan,
in his first public response to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
peace plan for the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
But the rebel leader doubted the sincerity of the offer and
said Yeltsin's conciliatory attitude was only a tactic for his
presidential reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin announced his long-awaited peace plan for war-torn
Chechnya on Sunday. He ordered a halt to combat operations,
promised a step by step troop withdrawal and free elections ahead
of negotiations on Chechnya's future status within the Russian
federation.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he is ready to hold peace talks with
Dudayev through intermediaries, something he had previously ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin is under pressure to solve the 15-month crisis in
Chechnya, which has become a major obstacle in his path to
reelection in June. He faces a tough challenge from Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who is ahead in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev said, "The authorities in Moscow are not ready for any
normal talks," and they "have no desire at all to end the
conflict."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he listed several possible intermediaries for the
peace talks, such as former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev,
president of Russia's republic of Tartarstan Mintimer Shaimiyev,
and leader of the Yabloko movement Grigory Yavlinsky, all of whom
he said have made efforts to mediate in the war.
</P>
<P>
Despite Yeltsin's pledge to halt military operations from
midnight Sunday night, he said, "there has been no ceasefire so
far," adding that the war would last until a new Russian president
is in power.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting raged between Russian forces and Dudayev's
guerrillas in southern Chechnya on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But in Grozny, the capital of the Caucasian republic, life
seems to be returning to a semblance of normality, with more
people and more vehicles appearing on the streets.

Charette said today that Europe should be bolstered by a strong
and united EU, a reformed and well-balanced NATO, and an enlarged
security alliance including Russia.
</P>
<P>
These three bodies should form the three pillars of European
defense, de Charette told a defense institute in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He also said the European Union should adopt common foreign and
defense policies and merge with the Western European Union (WEU),
Europe's only military alliance, made up of 10 of the EU's 15
members.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a reformed NATO will enable European
countries to take military action when necessary. And within a
well-balanced NATO, Europe and the U.S. can conduct true political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
France isn't a member of NATO but has been active in advocating
NATO reforms, supporting the maintenance of U.S. forces in Europe
while strengthening Europe's own forces, unified or independent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said Russia must be included in any
expanded defense organization. Without it, such an organization
would not be a real one.

<HEADLINE> Million American Children Abused or Neglected: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- State agencies say 1 million
children are abused or neglected, with parents responsible for 80
percent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say the real toll may be three times as high,
because in many cases mistreatment is never substantiated and
reported by the states.
</P>
<P>
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect of the U.S.
Health and Human Service Department released a report Monday,
based on 1994 statistics collected from 47 states and the District
of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three percent of the children suffered neglect.
Twenty-six percent were physically abused, 14 percent were
sexually abused, 5 percent were abused emotionally, and 22 percent
suffered other types of mistreatment, the Center said.
</P>
<P>
Substantiated cases of abuse or neglect increased 27 percent
during the five-year period beginning in 1990, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an increase in child abuse and neglect since
1990 which is attributed in part to drug use and an increase in
drugs that are highly addictive and cause severe behavioral
chances, such as crack cocaine," said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman
for the Health and Human Services Department (HHS).
</P>
<P>
Other studies indicate the actual number of abused and
neglected children may be much higher than the number the states
were able to substantiate, said Mary Jo Bane, HHS assistant
secretary for children and families.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a study ordered by Congress found 2.9
million children abused or mistreated in 1993. The National
Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect receives information
from private professionals who have contacts with abused children,
in addition to state officials.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three states reported deaths from neglect or abuse,
totaling 1,111 child fatalities in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Croatia Seek Stronger Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Croatia have agreed
to seek ways to forge closer economic and diplomatic ties, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are studying the possibility of concluding a
package of agreements to expand bilateral economic cooperation,
said visiting Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic.
</P>
<P>
It is an appropriate time for cooperation on economic issues
between Thailand and Croatia, said Granic, who is also Croatia's
foreign minister, during a meeting with his Thai counterpart
Kasem. S. Kasemsri on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cranic arrived in Thailand on a five-day official visit after
his tours to Malaysia and Indonesia. He is scheduled to leave
Thailand later today.
</P>
<P>
Cranic also expressed hopes that there would be exchanges of
visits by businessmen and government officials between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kasem said that he would encourage Thai businessmen to visit
Croatia, stressing that Thailand could use Croatian ports to
transport goods to Central European countries.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral diplomatic ties, Kasem said that the two
countries are to appoint honorary consuls in each other's capital.
He also expressed confidence that Thailand and Croatia would open
embassies in each other's capital when their relations are further
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was the first member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to recognize Croatia's independence in 1992.
Bilateral trade has been limited due to the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Thai embassy in Hungary oversees Croatia and the
Croatian embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, oversees Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Europe Begins Designing Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite skepticism about the actual
realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January
1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already
begun.
</P>
<P>
The European Monetary Institute, responsible for the
preparations, has set up a consultative group of artists, art
historians and psychologists to come up with designs.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released
today that it has decided on two themes for the new
currency: history of European civilization and abstract or
concrete paintings.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is expected to have seven notes with face values
ranging from five to 500.
</P>
<P>
The institute, which functions as a preparatory European
Central Bank, began to invite tenders for making the new currency
in February.
</P>
<P>
The institute requires the design of the Euro to include five
languages of the European Union together with the symbol of the EU
-- 12 stars in a ring. It hasn't been decided whether the Euro
should include country emblems.
</P>
<P>
The Euro must also be counterfeit-proof and must include
special designs to accommodate blind or poor-sighted
people.

PARIS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Boris Becker might miss Germany's
Davis Cup Quarter-final against France after he returned to Munich
for a medical examination on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France are scheduled to play on an indoor clay
court starting Friday. The draw is set for Thursday.

<P>
Becker was forced to withdraw from two tournaments in the
United States due to bronchitis after winning the Australian Open
last January.
</P>
<P>
Becker, a three-time Wimbledon winner, arrived in Limoges,
France, Sunday night and had a light workout on Monday. But
Tuesday, after a harder training, he went to Munich to have a
further examination by his personal physician Dr. Hans-Wilhelm
Mueller-Wohlfarth.
</P>
<P>
"After about an hour and a quarter, he was totally
exhausted," German Davis Cup captain Niki Pilic said. "It's 99
percent sure that he won't play any singles. A five-set match for
him would be too much."

<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city is to build a
group of museums centering on different specific topics in the
next five years, according to a local government decision.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ratio of the number of museums to the total
local population is expected to reach 1:100,000. The number of
visitors to the museums is expected to exceed 50 million annually.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 120 museums, and some 90 of them have
been opened to the public. Each year these museums hold more than
400 exhibitions, attracting over 40 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has established special education
sections for young people in some 40 museums since 1992. More than
three million youngsters visit them annually.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the municipal government has launched a campaign to
strengthen the centralized management of museums established by
different departments in different areas, with certifications

<HEADLINE> Kuchma Urges to Keep on Reforms in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma today pledged to forge ahead with market reforms and fight
budget deficit and inflation to bail his country out of its
economic dilemma.
</P>
<P>
In his annual state-of-the-nation address to the parliament,
Kuchma said that 1995 will be remembered as Ukraine's most
successful year despite various social problems.
</P>
<P>
A lot was achieved politically and economically in the past
year, the president told the deputies, including the signing of
the constitutional accord which has paved the way for the
establishment of a constitutional government. Inflation rate
dropped from 72 percent in November 1994 to 4.6 percent in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that Ukraine won recognition and affirmation from
the international community by joining the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
But the progress had to be made at the expense of the
Ukrainians whose living standard suffered from a downward economic
spiral.
</P>
<P>
He, however, rated 1996 as an important year in which the
country is to march out of its economic mire by stabilizing
macroeconomy and promoting privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state will carry out reforms in the taxation
system so as to avoid the fate of becoming a "shadow economy"
under rampant tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
It is Ukraine's strategic choice to complete the integration
with Europe, Kuchma said, and Ukraine is also for an integration
with countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States on an
equal and mutually beneficial basis.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine will pursue close contact with Russia despite
the fact that Boris Yeltsin has postponed his trip to Kiev time
and again.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also stressed cooperation in the sectors of
trade, science and technology and culture with countries in
northern Africa, western Europe, Latin America, the Middle East,
Asia and the Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Fights Land Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
will carry out a green plan to reverse the trend of serious land
erosion, the provincial governor Cheng Andong was quoted by
today's "China Daily" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The world's worst case of erosion can be seen along the upper
and middle reaches of the Yellow River in the province. In fact,
67 percent of the province's total land mass faces soil erosion,
and the serious problems that accompany it.
</P>
<P>
The continued serious soil erosion has worsened the ecological
environment. Every year, two million hectares of farmland in the
province suffer from drought, waterlogging and sandy wind, which
seriously hinder agricultural development and economic growth, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
The province is aiming for total vegetation cover by the year
2000. Between 1995 and 1998, during the first stage of the green
plan, the province will plant trees on barren mountains with
suitable conditions.
</P>
<P>
If the drive to make green the loess plateau and the
Qinling-Daba mountains is also successful, the entire province
will see grass and trees cover by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said he hopes by the year 2000, the province will have
controlled 467,000 ha of desert.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Recruit 1,500 More Beat Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital is expected to
recruit 1,000 to 1,500 more policemen to patrol street beats this
year, bringing the total to 4,500 or 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Liangji, director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau,
told an ongoing session of the municipal legislature Tuesday that
this move is aimed at dealing with the increasing number of cases
of disorder on the streets in a "direct and timely way".
</P>
<P>
Beijing officially started the patrol system last May in its
eight urban districts. At present, there are 3,500 patrol police
working in three shifts per day on the streets.
</P>
<P>
"Although the patrol police have been on the streets for less
than a year, they have won high esteem among local residents and
outsiders alike. Thus we decided to recruit more patrol police to
meet the needs of social security in the capital," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that so far the patrol police have arrested 3,390
criminal suspects, looked into 465 cases and helped 430,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The patrol police are trained to perform such duties as
maintaining social order and the smooth flow of traffic, aiding
accident victims or persons who need help, and stopping disputes.
</P>
<P>
China's first patrol police squad was organized in the
country's largest metropolis of Shanghai in 1992, and squads were
allocated to some booming coastal cities soon after.

By the end of 1995 the province had about 14.4 ha of lakes and
reservoirs where rainbow trout thrived and the per ha output of
the fish reached 80,000 kg to 150,000 kg.

obstructed section of the river in north China's Inner Mongolia

The icy water has passed through Togtoh County in the region,
the headquarters said, and the work to remove the ice has finished.
</P>
<P>
Ice has been melting in the upper reaches of the river, but is
still blocking the lower reaches, pushing the water level up in
the upper reaches, breaking embankments in several places and
causing flooding in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Ice frequently blocks the 860-kilometer-long section of the
river in the region, experts from the headquarters noted.
</P>
<P>
They said that, compared with previous years, temperatures in
the early days of melting period were quite low and then rose
suddenly, accelerating the ice melting.

<HEADLINE> Retired US Generals Call for Ban on Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of retired high-ranking
American military officers today called on the U.S. government and
the Pentagon to impose a total and earlier ban on land mines.
</P>
<P>
In a "Open Letter to President Clinton," retired U.S. General
Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in the Gulf War in 1991,
and 13 other retired generals asked Clinton to "take the lead in
efforts to achieve a total and permanent international ban on the
production, stockpiling, sale and use of anti-personnel land
mines."
</P>
<P>
Land mines are similar to long-banned poison gas in that "they
are hard to control and often have unwanted harmful
consequences... even for those who deploy them," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Their indiscriminate effects persist long after hostilities
have ceased, continuing to cause casualties among innocent
people, especially farmers and children," they said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has signed a law imposing a
one-year U.S. moratorium on use of land mines and has supported
an eventual worldwide ban.
</P>
<P>
But some U.S. military officers still argue that land mines
are needed to protect troops and some borders.
</P>
<P>
The letter estimated that 26,000 annual deaths or maimings from
mines around the world.

The festival, which is to mark Turkish national sovereignty

would render Nigerian folks songs and dances in some turkish
cities during their stay.

festival in 1979 under the initiative of the Turkish radio and
television.

During their stay in Turkey, each child would be hosted by a
Turkish family.

<HEADLINE> Exhumation of Serb Bodies in Mrkonjic Grad Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-eight Serb bodies have
been exhumed from a mass grave discovered at the orthodox cemetery
in te Serb town of Mrkonjic Grad in western Bosnia, the Serb
military prosecution in Banja Luka said today.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were Serbs killed in an offensive launched by joint
Bosnian Croat and Croatian regular army troops in central and
western Bosnia last autumn. Under the Dayton peace accord, these
occupied areas were returned to Serbs on February 4.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation began from an unmarked grave on March 30. The
bodies, mainly those of civilians, had been simply thrown into the
grave, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
One of the bodies was identified as a 74-year-old man who was
beaten to death as there were no injuries caused by firearms on
his body.
</P>
<P>
A full analysis will be conducted on the basis of findings by a
team of experts, led by Zoran Stankovic, pathologist from
Belgrade's military academy hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to Stankovic, injuries on the bodies indicate that
many victims were tortured to death in a brutal manner.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation is expected to end later this week, depending on
weather conditions, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities in Mrkonjic Grad say that there are several
more mass graves in the area.
</P>
<P>
The exhumation at the orthodox cemetery, where about 200 Serb
civilians and soldiers are believed to have been buried, is being
conducted in the presence of international officials, domestic and
foreign reporters as well as a large number of citizens and the
victims' relatives.

<HEADLINE> Plane With US Commerce Secretary Crashes Over Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The plane carrying U.S. Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown crashed today during a flight from Tuzla in
northeastern Bosnia to the Croatian Adriatic town of Dubrovnik,

<HEADLINE> Reports Conflict About Crash Site of Plane With  Brown Aboard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The plane carrying U.S. Secretary
of Commerce Ron Brown and a dozen of U.S. business leaders today
hit the top of a hill on the southeastern coast of Croatia,
presumably killing all those on board.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on CNN, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said that
the plane, a U.S. military-version of Boeing 737, crashed into the
hill some 16 kilometers from the scenic city of Dubrovnik after
three landing attempts failed.
</P>
<P>
The plane carried 27 people including 12 executives from
various American companies on route from Tuzla to Dubrovnik, where
Brown was expected to start a two-day visit to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Transportation Ministry said in a statement that
the tail of the plane and four bodies have been recovered by a
Croatian search and rescue team near the village of Velji Do,
about 40 kilometers southeast of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department was quoted by CNN as saying that
wreckage of the plane was found in the waters off Dubrovnik, to
further confuse the site of the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was still unknown, but bad whether in the
region seemed to be the main factor.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Brown's visit was to find opportunities for U.S.
companies in the post-war reconstruction of the former Yugoslav
countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Import 350,000 Tons of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish cabinet decree approving
the imports of 350,000 tons of beet and cane sugar came into
effect today after a previous import decree expired Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new decree, which will be valid until September 3, was
published today in the Official Gazette.
</P>
<P>
The decree canceled a 200-U.S. dollar per ton customs levy on
imported sugar. However, the customs duty on sugar imports will
rise to 47 percent from a previous three percent, the Gazette said.
</P>
<P>
The duty on sugar imports will rise to 100 percent starting on
September 3 in line with Turkey's import regime which ties it to
the Customs pact with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
An official from Turkey's Foreign Trade Undersecretariat said
that the newly imposed 47 percent customs duty, almost an
equivalent to the 200-dollar customs levy, means the abolishment
of the double taxation in the customs in line with the new import
regime.
</P>
<P>
The previous decree, which was put into effect on December 30,
1995, allowed import of 300,000 tons of sugar by April 1 and cut
the customs levy on imported sugar to 200-dollar per ton from
400-dollar per ton.
