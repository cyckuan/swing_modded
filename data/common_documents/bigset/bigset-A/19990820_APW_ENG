<HEADLINE> Man Wins $250K on ABC Quiz Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Doug Van Gundy prides himself on his  
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	But the self-proclaimed ``information junkie'' insists he hasn't  
spent his whole life preparing for a game show -- it just looks that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Virginia fiddler, who makes $11,000 a year, claimed one  
of the largest cash prizes in American television game show 
history, walking away with $250,000 from ABC's new ``Who Wants to 
be a Millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy, 33, correctly answered Nome as the Alaskan city where  
the Iditarod sled-dog race ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just spend a lot of time reading and watching movies or  
TV,'' said Van Gundy, who also works as a substitute teacher. ``I 
can credit it all to growing up to the son of a college professor 
and a nurse. We always had lots of books in our house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy watched Friday's show from his home in Marlinton, one  
night after he was in New York for the show's taping. 
</P>
<P>
	``Millionaire,'' modeled after a popular British quiz show,  
features host Regis Philbin and 10 contestants who compete for 
escalating prizes that eventually can total $1 million. The last of 
the original 13 installments will be broadcast Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Reminiscent of quiz shows that captivated the nation in the  
'50s, ``Millionaire'' is off to a promising start. 
</P>
<P>
	It captured the 8:30 p.m. time slot among adults 18-49 and among  
total viewers Thursday, outperforming CBS's ``Martial Law,'' NBC's 
``Jesse'' and Fox's ``World's Wildest Police Chases,'' ABC said, 
citing Nielsen Media Research figures. 
</P>
<P>
	While other game shows often force would-be contestants to  
travel to New York or California to compete, ``Millionaire'' picks 
players over the phone. For $1.50 on a 900 line, people can play an 
initial round that is rated on accuracy and speed of response. The 
top players proceed to a second round, also played on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten finalists and two alternates are then flown to New York.  
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy didn't qualify on the first call.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went to bed that night and it kind of ate on me. I went down  
and called again ... and I qualified the second time,'' he said. 
``It's the best dollar and a half I ever spent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from paying off his student loan and mortgage, ``I want to  
do something sweet for my wife,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Thomas-Van Gundy, is the family breadwinner. She works  
for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy isn't sure how much of his prize will be lost to  
taxes. Right now, he's just getting used to the idea of winning all 
that money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to sit on it for a while, let it collect some  
interest, think about it and figure out what to do,'' he said. 
``I've never had much disposable income, so I'm wary of being 
seduced by spending it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show drew attention this week after contestant David Honea  
lost a bid for $1 million when his correct answer was rejected. 
Show executives have admitted they erred and will have Honea back 
to play again.

<P>
	It's no longer the Barry Sanders Show in Detroit. That doesn't  
mean the Lions won't be entertaining this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see us play a real loose game,'' coach Bobby  
Ross said. ``The game we played the other night is going to be 
pretty indicative of how we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 35-31 loss at Atlanta, second-year quarterback Charlie  
Batch completed 11 of 16 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown, 
while backup Gus Frerotte was 15-of-21 for 171 yards and a 
touchdown. The Lions rushed for 113 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Lions fans can expect this season with Sanders  
retired, Ross said. The team will think pass first and try to 
complement it with the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to ignore the running game. That's going to be  
big part of it. But we've got some skilled people we have to take 
advantage of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, the Lions play their first game at the Silverdome since  
Sanders' retirement when they play host to the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Ross said he left training camp with a sense of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've had a very good camp,'' Ross said after  
Thursday's practice. ``We've made a lot of progress as a team. What 
I'm reminding them out there is that we have to carry this over to 
the Pontiac portion of our camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other preseason games tonight, its Philadelphia at the New  
York Jets, Pittsburgh at Carolina, Buffalo at Washington and 
Tennessee at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	In other training camp news:  
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	Jaguars wide receiver Keenan McCardell suffered a contusion of  
the lower right leg in practice Thursday, leaving his status for 
the team's opener Sept. 12 in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	McCardell, enjoying one of his best preseason camps of his  
eight-year NFL career, hurt his leg on a running play near the end 
of practice and will be out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative, but Jaguars officials wouldn't speculate  
on how long he might be sidelined. They said he would miss 
Saturday's preseason game with the Giants in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Chargers    	
</P>
<P>
	Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf had to be forced away from a  
verbal confrontation with a heckling fan on Thursday, the latest 
episode in his short but troubled NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the tense situation, Leaf said he gets the  
feeling that no one in the organization wants him around after his 
contract becomes voidable following the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's in the team's best interests to let me go, but I  
don't want that to be the case,'' said Leaf, the second pick 
overall in the 1998 draft who was benched midway through his rocky 
rookie season. ``It doesn't seem like there's anything positive 
around here at all right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson says he's in no hurry for Dimitrius  
Underwood to join the Dolphins. The rookie defensive end, waived by 
Minnesota after saying he preferred a religious calling to 
football, is willing to meet with Johnson, but also is not rushing 
to get back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, the 29th overall pick in April's draft, was claimed  
Monday off waivers by the Dolphins. Johnson talked with him for the 
first time Tuesday and predicted the rookie will eventually join 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Steve McNair will not start tonight when the Titans  
play an exhibition game at Arizona, according to coach Jeff Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has not practiced since Sunday's exhibition loss to  
Kansas City because of back spasms. He is expected back in the 
lineup Aug. 27 when Tennessee plays Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil O'Donnell, a 10-year veteran, will start in McNair's  
place. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Colts    	
</P>
<P>
	The Colts closed their training camp with veteran Jay  
Leeuwenberg unhappy over a demotion to a backup role on the 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not taking it very well at all,'' Leeuwenberg said. ``I'm  
going to do everything in my power to change the decision between 
now and the start of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenberg has started 37 consecutive games for the Colts, the  
team's second-longest streak. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	With backup quarterback Kerry Collins nursing a sprained foot,  
Giants third-stringer Mike Cherry might get a chance to play longer 
than expected Saturday night when the Giants host Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	The game plan has Kent Graham starting and playing the first  
half. Cherry is scheduled to play in the second, if Collins can't 
go. Cherry has been the Giants' No. 3 quarterback for the past two 
seasons.

<HEADLINE> NU's Herbie Husker Now Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Herbie Husker is about to become official.  
</P>
<P>
	The University of Nebraska makes millions of dollars a year from  
royalties paid by sporting apparel companies and other manufactures 
to use registered trademarks such as the Herbie Husker cartoon 
character and terms like ``Husker Power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, a recent legal decision noted the school's Board of  
Regents has never formerly adopted the trademarks and trade names 
that are earning the school big bucks, and should do so to avoid 
possible legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the nature of dotting an `I' a crossing a `T' to make  
sure that there has been the requisite approval ... from the 
highest authority within the university,'' the university's 
attorney Richard Wood said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is big money at stake.  
</P>
<P>
	Following the football team's 1995 national championship, for  
example, the university received $3.3 million in royalties from 
such sales, according to athletic department records. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling had its genesis in 1996, when the university  
decided to open a store called ``Huskers Authentic'' next to 
Memorial Stadium. The university tried to register the name with 
the Secretary of State's office but was rejected because it had 
failed to post the required public notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent White, owner of a downtown Lincoln T-shirt shop that sold  
Husker apparel, then tried to register a very similar name, 
``Husker Authentics.'' He sued after the university said his 
actions were violating the licensing agreement that allowed him to 
sell Husker items. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster County District Judge Steven Burns ruled in December  
that neither side had a case, noting the Board of Regents had never 
formally approved registering school trademarks.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Atheist Case Gets 8 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- A suspect in the disappearance of atheist Madalyn  
Murray O'Hair has been sentenced to eight years in prison on a 
federal weapons charge, days after he got 60 years for stealing 
from her organization. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks cited David Waters' long criminal  
history, which includes a murder conviction in 1965. Waters is a 
three-time felon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my opinion you should be kept out of society for as long  
as possible,'' Sparks said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters was convicted on Aug. 11 on state charges of stealing  
more than $50,000 from Ms. O'Hair's atheist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters, a former office manager for Ms. O'Hair, had been on  
probation since 1995. He landed back in court after federal 
authorities found 119 rounds of ammunition in his Austin apartment 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities suspect Waters, 52, orchestrated the 1995  
disappearance of Ms. O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and adopted 
daughter Robin Murray O'Hair. No charges have been filed in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Waters' attorney, Patrick Ganne, accused federal authorities of  
trying to punish Waters for Ms. O'Hair's slaying without having to 
bring him to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair is best known for a case that led to a 1963 U.S.  
Supreme Court decision that, along with a decision the previous 
year, struck down organized prayer in public schools as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. O'Hair and her two adult children vanished from San  
Antonio along with $500,000 in gold coins, authorities questioned 
whether they were victims of foul play or had merely run off with 
their organization's money. 
</P>
<P>
	Others suggested that Ms. O'Hair, who was 77 and ailing, had  
gone off to die quietly so Christians wouldn't pray over her.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Arraigned in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The leader of a Catholic  
protest group and eight followers were arraigned Friday on charges 
connected to their thwarted efforts to prevent Protestants from 
marching past a Catholic neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Divisive Protestant parades, met by organized Catholic  
opposition, have triggered street violence in Northern Ireland for 
the past four summers. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent Parades Commission empowered to weigh both sides'  
rights approved last Saturday's march by about 40 Protestants, 
making any Catholic attempt to block the parade illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belfast Magistrates Court, Judge Harry McKibbin granted bail  
to the nine defendants -- all men ranging in age from 27 to 40 -- 
until their next scheduled court appearance Oct. 15 to face charges 
of obstruction and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three were identified as residents of Lower Ormeau, the  
south Belfast neighborhood at the center of the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Rice, a former Irish Republican Army prisoner, leads the  
militant group that is trying to prevent any of Northern Ireland's 
marching Protestant brotherhoods from passing Lower Ormeau. 
</P>
<P>
	Lines of riot police kept Rice from joining about 200 supporters  
who blocked the road at dawn last Saturday. Many protesters fought 
back with their feet and fists as police dragged them from the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of the defendants denies categorically that they  
committed any offense,'' said one of the defendant's attorney, Joe 
McVeigh. ``Further, each formally complains at the brutal manner of 
the police and the way the police forced this parade through the 
Ormeau Road in contravention of their most basic human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, 20 supporters of the IRA-linked Sinn  
Fein party held placards demanding the abolition of the 
predominantly Protestant police force. The IRA killed about 300 
members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary before calling a 1997 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, police arrested a 69-year-old woman and her son  
after overnight rioting in Larne, a Protestant town north of 
Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said someone fired several shotgun blasts at officers as  
they investigated reports that a vigilante mob had beaten up a man 
and set fire to his car. 
</P>
<P>
	Three officers and a firefighter suffered minor wounds in the  
confused melee that followed, police said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Playing Golf, Raising Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday promoted  
peace in Northern Ireland and his wife's political prospects in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The president opened with an afternoon of golf on this New  
England holiday island after a hop from his vacation headquarters 
at Martha's Vineyard. His foursome included Sen. John Kerry, 
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	On tap was a Clinton speech at a fund-raising dinner for the  
American Ireland Fund, an organization whose charitable, 
not-for-profit work includes promoting reconciliation in Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also was to headline a private fund-raising reception  
intended to help pay for Hillary Rodham Clinton's political effort. 
It was the first time he has formally pitched in on her behalf. She 
is considering a run in 2000 for the Senate seat held by retiring 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the fund-raiser, the first lady had her own Nantucket  
agenda, beginning with a visit to an old whaling church. The visit 
was part of her yearlong effort to promote awareness of American 
historical treasures in need of preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, along with daughter Chelsea and their chocolate  
Labrador Buddy, arrived Thursday night -- the president's 53rd 
birthday -- for their fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family are dividing their vacation this year  
between the island and New York state, a nod to Mrs. Clinton's 
senatorial aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will spend their first nine days away from the  
White House at the 20-acre Oyster Pond spread of Massachusetts 
developer Richard Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement level on Martha's Vineyard is far lower than it  
was during the Clintons' first two vacations, with only a 
sprinkling of shop signs and newspaper advertisements taking 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign hailed the Clintons as ``our true heroes.'' Another  
store retrieved from storage larger-than-life cardboard cutouts of 
the Clintons. Tourists posing with them were asked to put a dollar 
in a fishbowl ``for charity.'' A newspaper ad ignored the first 
couple but welcomed ``Buddy Clinton'' back to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nantucket, Mrs. Clinton was visiting a church as part of a  
White House program celebrating the millennium effort to encourage 
preservation of the nation's culture and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28, the Clintons plan to leave Martha's Vineyard for  
posh East Hampton, N.Y., and a weekend of raising money for the 
Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's possible campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Clinton's will settle in for five days in  
Skaneateles, a town in the Finger lakes region southwest of 
Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Study: Absence Makes Males Pine Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- So who pines away the longest, men or women?  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say the more time spent apart after sex, the more  
eager men were to copulate with their lovers again. It turns out 
women don't feel the same way -- and it doesn't matter how much time 
has gone by since the couple last had sex. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of people on and around college campuses, women were  
generally unaffected by separation, according to the study led by 
Todd Shackelford, an assistant professor of psychology at Florida 
Atlantic University. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers propose in a paper presented Friday at the  
annual meeting of the American Psychological Association that men 
are unwittingly responding to an urge from way back in human 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, the researchers suggest, the urge that drives a man  
to want sex after separation is the thought that another man might 
have gotten there first and beat out his sperm in the race to 
fertilize his partner's egg. After all, in the view of evolutionary 
biology, passing on genes to the next generation is what sex is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of ``sperm competition'' has been well-studied in  
non-humans, but whether it significantly shapes sexual behavior in 
people is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackelford acknowledged the measured effect of time apart on  
men's attitudes about sex is small. Many other factors could effect 
how interested a man is in sex on a given day. The results of the 
study are preliminary and can suggest only that time apart affected 
men's attitudes, because they come from a one-time survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers gave anonymous one-time questionnaires to 388  
women and 304 men who said they were in committed sexual 
relationships. The participants, in their mid-20s on average, were 
recruited at universities and nearby public areas in Texas, Florida 
and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants rated their current interest in their partner on a  
10-point scale. Results suggest that for every 100 hours of time 
apart since the last time they had sex with their partner, men's 
interest in doing it again rose an average of about one point, and 
their rating of their partner's attractiveness rose about a 
half-point. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the less time men had spent with their partners since  
last intercourse, the higher they rated the partner's sexual 
interest in themselves and her attractiveness to other men. It 
didn't matter how much total time had elapsed since the last 
copulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Women, in contrast, appeared unaffected by the amount of time  
spent apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work proposes a psychological underpinning for earlier  
controversial research. The prior work found evidence that the more 
time a man spent apart from his sexual partner since they last had 
sex, the more sperm he ejaculates at the next copulation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Timothy Perper, an independent sex researcher in  
Philadelphia and author of ``Sex Signals: The Biology of Love,'' 
said he doubted that Shackelford had really detected a 
psychological signal of sperm competition. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Perper said, the researchers didn't directly test  
whether the male-female differences were big enough to be 
considered real, rather than just a fluke. If there's no real 
difference, there's no evidence for sperm competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the results didn't support two other tested  
predictions from sperm competition theory. Time apart was not 
related to how much a man figured his partner was sexually 
interested in other men, nor how distressed he was if his partner 
refused to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackelford said the questionnaire may have just done a poor job  
of asking about those things.

<HEADLINE> Faldo Annoyed Over Ryder Cup Status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- British golfer Nick Faldo complained  
Friday about not being informed about his chances to earn a wild 
card spot on the European Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo is playing at the BMW Open, where a wild scramble to  
qualify for golf's premiere team event is underway before the 
European team is named Sunday when the tournament ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks of the three-time Masters champion, anxious to play  
a record 12th Ryder Cup, were aimed at European captain Mark James. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have been nice to get a message `nay or  
yeah','' Faldo said. ``You either want me or you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James had triggered speculation that Faldo, no matter how he  
does at the BMW, would not be chosen by saying he wouldn't select a 
wild-card outside the top 20 on the Ryder Cup points list. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, who has slumped the past two years, would only reach No.  
22 even by capturing the BMW Open. After Friday's second round, he 
is seven strokes off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	James said Friday he makes a point of not talking to golfers  
about their wild-card chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably a dozen people in the situation where they  
would like to know,'' James said. ``I could say something and then 
in a day or so, the situation could change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only eight players have wrapped up places on the team that will  
defend its trophy against the United States Sept. 24-26 in 
Brookline, Mass.

<HEADLINE> Pats' Sign Law to 7-Yr., $50M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMITHFIELD, R.I. (AP) -- Ty Law says he didn't need to be the  
highest-paid cornerback in the NFL. He just wants to play like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first name that you hear when people say cornerback is  
Deion Sanders. ... I would even say Deion Sanders,'' Law said 
Friday after agreeing to a contract extension that could pay him 
$50 million over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be at that same level. When I retire, five years  
later I want to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law, who had one year remaining on the contract he signed as a  
rookie in 1995, agreed to a six-year entension that makes him the 
second-highest paid cornerback in football behind Sanders. Both the 
total package and the $14.2 million signing bonus are the biggest 
in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a special contract,'' said Patriots vice president Andy  
Wasynczuk, ``but we think we have a real special player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is structured so that it frees up about $450,000 in  
salary cap space this season, Wasynczuk said. He also said he did 
not expect any complaints from quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who had 
been the highest-paid player on the team since he signed his 
seven-year, $42 million deal in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ty is obviously a key part of this club. Drew is a key part,''  
Wasynczuk said. ``Drew's deal was done four years ago. When we get 
to his deal, the market will still be changing. The most important 
thing is putting together the deal that makes sense at the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law, the Patriots' first-round draft choice in 1995, led the  
team with nine interceptions last season and was named co-MVP in 
the Pro Bowl. He has 18 interceptions in four seasons, good for 
10th on the team's all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has separated himself (from the pack) as a tremendous  
play-maker,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``It's rare that we have the 
opportunity to draft a guy No. 1, see him come through to this 
level and really be able to reward him for his accomplishments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Law's first chance to prove his worth it comes Saturday night in  
an exhibition game against Sanders' Dallas Cowboys. But Sanders, 
who makes about $10 million per year, will not play in the game 
because he is recovering from an injury to his left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said this week he didn't know when he would be back.  
``My goal is just whatever the Lord will have me to do, brother,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys are playing for the third time this preseason, and  
coach Chan Gailey said he'll use his first teams a little more than 
he has in the previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
	But he will also take advantage of the opportunity to look at  
the players on the fringes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say this is big week for them,'' Gailey said. ``... But  
there's time left for people to make moves, up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey is winless in seven preseason games over two summers. The  
skid is the longest by a Cowboys coach, topping a pair of six-game 
losing streaks Tom Landry endured. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he knows it's only the preseason.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win,'' Gailey said. ``I wanted that last week and  
the week before and the five last year. But am I going to play the 
starters all game so I can get a win? No. I'm not.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals QB Plummer Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Quarterback Jake Plummer sprained his right  
thumb on Arizona's first possession of Friday night's exhibition 
game against the Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer went to the locker room for X-rays, which were negative,  
and returned to watch from the sideline with his hand in ice. Team 
officials said he would not play the rest of the game, but the 
injury was not believed to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by backup Dave Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, considered one of the NFL's rising stars, was injured  
when he was sacked on a second-down pass attempt. He stayed in for 
a third-down incompletion, then went to the locker room. When he 
returned his hand was in an ice pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have been beset by injuries throughout the  
preseason. Three players were injured in the first quarter Friday. 
Besides Plummer, defensive tackle Mike Moten sprained his right 
knee and defensive end Thomas Burke pulled his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, three linemen were injured in an auto accident on the  
way to a morning team meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Again / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bonds resumed their rally Friday, rising for the  
fifth time in six sessions and pushing long-term interest rates 
below 6 percent for the first time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 5/8 point, or $6.25  
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, an influence on the interest 
charged on many loans, fell to 5.98 percent from 6.03 percent on 
Thursday and the lowest finish since July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up 1/16 point higher, while intermediate maturities gained 1/8 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market has rallied over the past week amid hopes that a  
likely interest rate boost by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday will 
be the last move by the central bank to contain inflation for the 
near-term. Rising inflation and interest rates make the fixed 
payoff on bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Thursday, yields on three-month Treasury bills  
rose to 4.81 percent as the discount rose to 4.69 percent, up 0.08 
percentage point from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields were 5.08 percent while the discount rose to  
4.88 percent. One-year yields rose to 5.14 percent while the 
discount rose to 4.88 percent, up percentage point from a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, held steady at 4.93 3/4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell was unchanged at 113 1/32. The average 
yield to maturity was 5.85 percent, down from late Thursday's 5.86 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Getty 2nd Family Wants Inheritance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A second family kept secret for more than a  
decade by billionaire Gordon P. Getty is negotiating for 
inheritance rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Getty, a philanthropist, composer and heir to his father's oil  
fortune, has confirmed that he fathered three daughters in Los 
Angeles, the San Jose Mercury News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nicolette, Kendalle and Alexandra are my children. Their  
mother, Cynthia Beck, and I love them very much. The most import 
concern is that the children's needs be addressed. ... This will be 
our first priority,'' Getty said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Getty family has been fully supportive throughout this  
situation, and for that I am very grateful,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper didn't specify the amount sought. Getty was  
sailing in Europe and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercury News reported that a source close to the family said  
Getty's wife of more than three decades, Ann, is not considering 
divorce. His wife and their four children learned only recently 
about the other family.

<HEADLINE> Conde Nast May Buy Disney Magazines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue, Glamour and  
Mademoiselle, will reportedly add Women's Wear Daily and W to its 
list of major fashion magazines with the purchase of Fairchild 
Publications from Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, citing unidentified executives, reported  
Friday that Conde Nast has agreed to pay $650 million for 
Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment on the report  
Friday, and Conde Nast executives did not immediately return 
repeated telephone calls from The Associated Press. The agreement 
was to be announced by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's profits and its stock price have been weak and it has  
been under pressure to sell some of its assets to concentrate on 
its core businesses -- its movie studio and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported last week that Conde Nast and Hearst  
Magazines, publishers of Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country, were 
involved in a bidding war on Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	The jewel of the acquisition is W, a glossy fashion monthly that  
has become a general-interest magazine. W has taken apparel 
advertising from magazines at both Hearst Magazines and Conde Nast. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast, a division of Advance Publications, also publishes  
Allure, GQ, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, among other magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairchild group also publishes several trade magazines  
including Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News and 
Children's Business. 
</P>
<P>
	With addition of Fairchild, Conde Nast would have a powerful new  
offering for advertisers, who could be given cut rates for buying 
ads as a package in several of its fashion publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney acquired Fairchild in 1995 with its purchase of Capital  
Cities ABC, but publishing has never among its top businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago it sold other publishing businesses that were  
acquired with Capital Cities ABC including four newspapers, among 
them Kansas City Star and Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The newspaper 
publisher Knight Ridder bought the papers for $1.65 billion.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team Probes Russia's 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A team of International Monetary Fund experts on  
Friday began studying the Russian government's 2000 budget draft, 
which analysts call impressively austere -- so austere that the 
country is unlikely to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
	The government finalized the budget Thursday and will present it  
to the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, next week. 
President Boris Yeltsin's government will likely face pressure from 
the Communist-led parliament to increase spending. 
</P>
<P>
	With parliamentary elections in December and presidential  
elections next summer, politicians might also be tempted to boost 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russia is under heavy pressure from the IMF, its biggest  
lender, to keep spending down and boost revenues, particularly its 
perennially poor tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reasonable budget, but the question is whether they  
will be able to adopt it, given that we're heading to a period with 
two elections,'' said John Orford, an economist at investment bank 
Robert Flemings in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Orford and other analysts have said the 2000 budget envisages  
tight management of the government's resources and praised its low 
deficit target. The draft foresees a deficit of 1.1 percent of 
gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in this year's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma must pass it in four readings, a process that  
traditionally takes months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia's economy continues to be plagued by the fact  
that many companies opt to barter with suppliers and customers 
instead of paying bills, making it difficult to tax business 
transactions. That's translating into huge losses for tax coffers, 
said Sergei Prudnik, analyst at Moscow brokerage Troika Dialog. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, investors, domestic and foreign, continue to withdraw  
money from Russia as long as Yeltsin changes prime ministers every 
few months and the army is enmeshed in a military conflict with 
Islamic guerrillas on its southern border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is when is Russia going to be able to restore  
confidence in the economy,'' Orford said. ``You need massive 
investment, and to get that you need to put in place a stable 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is pinning its hopes on higher oil prices,  
analysts said. With oil and gas companies generating the bulk of 
Russia's budget revenues, higher oil prices have helped raise tax 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF experts are in Moscow through Sept. 1 to study the  
budget and whether Russia has met requirements for another 
installment of a $4.5 billion loan package. Russian officials have 
said they expect a $640 million installment in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia needs the money to keep servicing its massive foreign  
debts.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Loses Another CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp. CEO Jodie Glore has resigned,  
forcing the troubled computer equipment market to search for 
someone to lead the company for the second time in the past 10 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega said Thursday that Glore, who also served as president,  
is leaving for personal reasons. ``I expect to take my first 
vacation in three years and spend time with my family,'' Glore said 
in a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Glore will remain with Iomega until Aug. 31. David Dunn,  
chairman of the company's board of directors, will act as CEO until 
a replacement is found. Glore also said would be available to the 
board for whatever advice and counsel they would seek from him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Iomega made considerable progress during his tenure and  
he believes the progress will continue after he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	But analyst Howard Rosecrans of the New York research firm H.D.  
Brous had a much harsher prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically he inherited a difficult situation,'' Rosecrans said  
Friday. ``This company is headed toward bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glore joined Iomega in October after serving as president and  
chief operating officer of Rockwell International's automation 
business, where he was credited with doubling the division's sales 
in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaced interim president and CEO James E. Sierk, who  
remained on Iomega's board of directors. Sierk was named to the 
post in March 1998, when president and CEO Kim Edwards abruptly 
resigned after the company announced it had lost $25 million in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Iomega, the maker of the Jaz and Zip removable  
data-storage systems for personal computers, has continued to 
struggle in the marketplace and has lost several key employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted a net loss of $47.1 million for the second  
quarter, due in part to a restructuring charge of $41.9 million 
stemming from closing facilities and eliminating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega announced in June that it would cut 450 regular and  
temporary employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Iomega fell 18 3/4 cents to $3.87 1/2 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Washington Plans AIDS Virus Tracking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's capital plans to develop an  
identifcation system for tracking the spread of the AIDS virus 
without compromising patient confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear to me that we have an epidemic,'' Mayor Anthony A.  
Williams, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS is the leading cause of death among district residents  
between ages 25 and 44. According to the city's Department of 
Health, the rate of new human immunodeficiency virus infections per 
100,000 population was 186 in the district -- more than nine times 
the national average. 
</P>
<P>
	``HIV infection is spreading to more and more of our young  
people as well as spreading very, very fiercely in our Latino 
community,'' Williams told AIDS activists at a nonprofit health 
clinic that serves primarily Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``unique identifier'' system allows a public health agency  
to develop a database that includes, racial, ethnic, gender and 
geographical information on each patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, hospitals and clinics would use coded information to  
designate each patient but their name would remain in the 
confidential records of individual health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1994, Maryland and Texas have used a 12-digit number that  
includes portions of a person's Social Security number, date of 
birth and other digits to represent gender and race. 
</P>
<P>
	Although new HIV infections in the district are declining among  
gay men, the rate of new infections continues to grow among young 
people, African-American women and heterosexuals. Officials hope to 
have a reporting system operating within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the national Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention has asked all states to conduct HIV tracking as an 
extension of their AIDS surveillance programs. Names tracking has 
provided more reliable data than coded methods because of 
incomplete coding information, according to the CDC.

<HEADLINE> Ernie Irvan Crashes During Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- NASCAR Winston Cup driver Ernie Irvan  
crashed this morning during practice for the Pepsi 400 at Michigan 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	He was airlifted to a hospital, but Jay Frye, the general  
manager of Irvan's Winston Cup team, said that trip was more a 
precaution than a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe he's going to be just fine,'' Frye said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers had to cut off the top of his car to get Irvan out  
after the vehicle slammed into the wall near turn 4. As he was 
removed from the car, Ervan picked his arm up in what looked like a 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reportedly conscious and talking.  
</P>
<P>
	Ervan was nearly killed in a crash at the same speedway exactly  
five years ago to the day. He was unconscious for two days at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Frye said Irvan would not race this weekend. He said that  
because of the seriousness of his earlier acident, the team does 
not want to take chances this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary. Any time anything like this happens, it makes  
you stop and think,'' Frye said.

<HEADLINE> Jets Obtain Mirer From Packers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New York Jets, still seeking a  
backup quarterback, obtained Rick Mirer from the Green Bay Packers 
on Friday for a conditional draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, the second overall pick in the 1993 draft, has never  
lived up to expectations, bouncing from Seattle to Chicago and then 
to Green Bay. He is expected to compete with Scott Zolak, signed as 
a free agent from New England, and Ray Lucas for the job as Vinny 
Testaverde's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to create some options at the second quarterback  
spot,'' Jets coach Bill Parcells said. ``I talked to Rick today and 
I didn't make him any promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer joined the Packers last Sept. 2 and was the Packers' third  
quarterback for 12 games, moving up to No. 2 when Doug Pederson was 
injured. This season, Pederson left for Philadelphia as a free 
agent, but the Packers deemed Mirer expendable because of the 
progress made by second-year man Matt Hasselbeck and rookie Aaron 
Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucas played much of the Jets' game last week with the Packers  
and Zolak finished 10-of-22 for 90 yards in a 10-9 win over the 
Eagles on Friday night. The Jets' punter, Tom Tupa, has experience 
as a backup quarterback in Cleveland and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells was in New England when Mirer was drafted and scouted  
him extensively, but he took Drew Bledsoe No. 1, letting Mirer fall 
to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked what I saw then in Rick, but it wasn't close when we  
took Bledsoe,'' Parcells said. ``That was seven years ago, anyway. 
A lot of things have changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mirer's six-year career, he has 867 completions in 1,626  
attempts for 9,541 yards, with 41 touchdowns and 62 interceptions.

<HEADLINE> Headers May Cause Mental Harm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Adult soccer players appear to suffer a loss of  
some mental abilities over time, possibly from whacking the ball 
with their head, two researchers suggested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study, outlined at the annual meeting of the American  
Psychological Association, bolsters a growing body of research 
pointing to possible mental harm from headers. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers caution that no study has conclusively  
demonstrated that headers -- as opposed to concussions from 
colliding with other players -- are to blame. It is also unknown if 
the impairment, as measured by psychological tests in such studies, 
translates into any real handicaps in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the findings, I think it may be worth pursuing this  
further by asking: Does a lifetime of soccer playing lead to 
problems with social or occupational functioning?'' said David 
Abwender, a neuropsychologist at New York State 
University-Brockport. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Soccer Federation had no immediate reaction to he  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Abwender and Danielle Symons, a doctoral student in sports  
science at the University of Florida, studied a total of 26 men and 
women who played soccer at the Brockport campus and six current or 
former professionals, aged 30 to 55. A group of swimmers was used 
for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	On tests of reaction time and ability to deduce unstated rules  
of a card game, soccer players did 12 and 16 percent worse on 
average than swimmers. Soccer players who have competed at 
relatively higher levels -- and presumably did more frequent heading 
-- performed significantly worse on five of 11 tests, even when age 
differences were accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Webbe, a Florida Institute of Technology psychologist who  
has also studied mental impairment in soccer players, said the 
Brockport study appears to buttress similar findings elsewhere. He 
said simple common sense suggests headers might do harm in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to go up to someone and say, `Would you bang your  
head against that wall 20 or 30 times a day?' you'd probably say, 
`No,''' said Webbe. 
</P>
<P>
	George S. Baroff, a psychologist who studies brain impairment at  
the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said such cognitive 
loss may stem from a mixture of repeated concussions from 
collisions and banging from headers. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews, researchers differed in their recommendations for  
parents and soccer leagues because so many questions remain. 
Several encouraged teaching proper heading technique to children 
and using a small ball; some went as far as broaching the idea of 
soft helmets or even banning headers among children younger than 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Haley, the men's soccer coach at Springfield College, said  
he is interested and awaits further research. 
</P>
<P>
	``My greatest concern as a coach is two guys going full steam  
and cracking heads,'' he said. ``It could be pretty traumatic.''

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Associate Prefers Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GALESBURG, Mich. (AP) -- With Jack Kevorkian behind bars,  
authorities believe that his crusade to legalize doctor-assisted 
suicide will be carried on by his associate, Georges Reding. 
</P>
<P>
	Their styles differ -- Kevorkian's flamboyance is in sharp  
contrast to Reding's low-key nature -- but prosecutors say both men 
have equally strong convictions about what they see as the right of 
suffering people to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was jailed in April, sentenced to 10 to 25 years after  
being convicted of murdering a Lou Gehrig's disease patient. By 
then, Reding had taken up what his attorneys called a 
``fellowship'' with Kevorkian, assisting in several deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities now believe Reding may have taken another step in  
picking up where Kevorkian left off. On Thursday, he was charged in 
New Mexico with first-degree murder in the death of a 54-year-old 
woman who had multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had thought Donna Brennan died of natural causes in  
August 1998. However, an autopsy showed she died of a sedative 
overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding's association with Kevorkian became public in July 1996,  
when Kevorkian attorney Geoffrey Fieger introduced him at a meeting 
of the National Press Club, describing the connection as a 
fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding, a 74-year-old retired psychiatrist, told the crowd he  
had witnessed five assisted suicides and would continue to help 
Kevorkian judge the mental status of people who seek his help in 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The five people I saw die, their serenity was so beautiful,''  
Reding said. ``It's very beautiful and it's full of sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reding said he had joined Kevorkian because he was ``embarrassed  
by the cowardice of my profession'' in not supporting patients who 
seek suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	While the beliefs of Kevorkian and Reding may be similar, their  
public personas are very different. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian often taunted, even dared, prosecutors to put him on  
trial. He once dressed up as Thomas Jefferson for a trial. He held 
a news conference to burn an order barring him from assisting in 
suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schwartz, an attorney who has represented both Kevorkian  
and Reding, said he can't picture a similar performance from 
Reding. He has ``No Trespassing'' signs posted on his farm a short 
drive from Kalamazoo in western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Reding had I think once or twice talked to the press --  
it's not really something he's interested in,'' Schwartz said. 
``He's not interested in furthering some cause ... just helping 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy farmer Frank Drobney has lived a few houses down the road  
from Reding for about nine years. But he knew nothing about 
Reding's beliefs or activities until this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so isolated, I don't think anyone knows him around  
here,'' Drobney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lin Foote, an assisted-suicide advocate in Kalamazoo County,  
said he's known of Reding for years, finally meeting him this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a lunch of quiche, wine and cheesecake at Reding's home,  
Foote said, a small group talked generally about the future of 
assisted suicide, given Michigan's defeat last year of a 
proposition that would have legalized it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly is ... rather gregarious, very pleasant. His wife  
was very charming,'' Foote said. ``But Dr. Reding is not a showman. 
He's not looking for publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, while Reding has not displayed the same penchant for the  
dramatic as Kevorkian, ``nothing would surprise or shock me,'' 
Oakland County Prosecutor David Gorcyca said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding was born in Belgium, his wife, Kathleen Reding, said  
earlier this summer. As a child, he accompanied his father, an 
oncologist, on visits to cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, The Oakland Press of Pontiac quoted Reding as saying he  
used to hasten the deaths of patients while working with his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father was a very distinguished physician in Europe who  
told me `If you do not do this, you have no heart, and if you do it 
and get caught, you are a dumbbell,''' Reding told a free-lance 
writer for the story. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding emigrated to New York in the 1960s and, in 1990, he and  
his wife moved to Galesburg, where he worked as a psychiatrist. 
Mrs. Reding is a Western Michigan University professor who writes 
about death and dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said he believes Reding and Kevorkian became friends  
about 1996 through ``Physicians for Mercy,'' a support group of 
doctors backing Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding and Kevorkian were later arrested for allegedly  
participating in three assisted suicides in Oakland County. Charges 
were dropped after the prosecutor decided there was insufficient 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, both were arrested after a body was dropped off at a  
suburban Detroit hospital. Reding was acquitted of charges he 
interfered with police and resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz has predicted that any case in New Mexico wouldn't go  
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public down there is more conservative than the one  
here,'' he said. ``The people in New Mexico have a much greater 
unhappiness with government interfering in their personal lives.''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Dye To Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals offensive lineman  
Ernest Dye will undergo surgery Sunday to repair nerves damaged in 
a car accident that nearly severed his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors feel confident that Dye's arm will remain viable, the  
team said in a statement. The doctors felt it is time to repair the 
nerve damage he sustained in Monday's accident south of Flagstaff, 
where the team holds its training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye has already undergone one operation at Flagstaff Medical  
Center to repair the bone and restore blood flow to his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other players in the car at the time, Lester Holmes and Carl  
Simpson, received only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Holmes was driving Dye's car when it veered off  
rain-slicked Interstate 17 and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was traveling about the posted 75 mph speed limit in a  
heavy rain at the time of the crash, according to DPS reports.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Hold Talks in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund announced  
Friday it was dispatching a team to Ecuador for weekend talks aimed 
at assembling an economic support program for the troubled South 
American nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to continue to work closely with the Ecuadorian  
authorities to finalize a comprehensive program that addresses 
Ecuador's current economic difficulties,'' the IMF said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador has been struggling with what its president, Jamil  
Mahuad, has called the country's ``worst economic crisis in 70 
years.'' El Nino floods have ravaged the country and last year's 
steep decline in the global price of oil, Ecuador's main export, 
has hurt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have been involved in discussions with Ecuador on  
a proposed $400 million loan to help the country restructure its 
banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuadorian officials said earlier this week the government would  
be able to meet a $94 million interest payment due at the end of 
this month on $6.3 billion in Brady bond debt. But financial 
markets remained jittery, fearing that Ecuador could become the 
first nation to default on Brady bonds since they were introduced 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  
Brady who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, were 
created to resolve the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. The 
bonds are backed by zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In its statement Friday, the IMF said that the program it hoped  
to work out with Ecuador ``would complement the authorities' 
efforts to work in a transparent and cooperative manner with 
private creditors on financing arrangements that honor to the 
fullest extent possible Ecuador's commitment to pay its 
creditors.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Suspends Mack for 1st 4 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kick returner-defensive back Tremain Mack, in  
trouble with the NFL for a series of alcohol-abuse arrests, was 
suspended today for the first four games of the regular season 
without pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL said the penalty will complete an eight-game suspension  
for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled that the initial part of the  
suspension was served last season when Mack missed the last four 
games while in jail for drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack will begin the latest suspension on opening day, Sept. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the suspension without pay, the commissioner said  
Mack is responsible for paying a four-week fine based on his 1998 
salary for a previous violation of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A message seeking comment from the Bengals was left at their  
Cincinnati offices today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a fourth-round pick in 1997 from Miami, set Bengals season  
records last year for kickoff return yardage and average per 
return. He is the team's No. 1 returner and a backup defensive 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	He was jailed last fall after his second drunken driving arrest  
in the Cincinnati area, and the loss of pay amounted to about 
$62,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first two years with the Bengals, Mack has had the two  
DUI arrests in Ohio along with other alcohol-related arrests in 
Texas and Florida.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Irish to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton is suggesting that  
Northern Ireland leaders learn to ``let go'' of violence for peace 
to have the chance it deserves in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing an American Ireland Fund dinner Friday night on  
nearby Nantucket Island, Clinton said resistance by the pro-British 
Unionists to Sinn Fein's presence in Northern Ireland's government 
is actually steeped in mistrust over agreements for the Irish 
Republican Army to lay down arms -- and in reluctance to change 
age-old patterns of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost looks like two kids daring each other to go first,''  
the president said. ``Some of these folks have been doing this for 
so long that their whole identity is caught up in the continuation 
of the conflict. So what we have to do is find ways to help them 
let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cast a Sept. 6 meeting between the parties and his  
special envoy, former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, as 
``maybe our last chance'' at peace. He said the ``critical decision 
makers'' in Northern Ireland must respect the people's desire for 
peace and reject the old divisions that foment violence between 
majority Protestants and Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have leaders who can let go,'' the president said.  
``There was reconciliation in South Africa because Nelson Mandela 
could let go. And he had a whole lot more to let go of than most of 
the Irish do. ... It'll have a lot of texture and meaning and 
standing in the community if they let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event, attended by about 300 people, raised $92,000 for the  
fund, an organization whose charitable work helps promote 
reconciliation in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be contributed in first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton's name to the ``Vital Voices'' project that brings 
Protestant and Catholic women together, said Sheila O'Malley, 
director of the fund's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was honored. ``Thanks to the fund, we've  
really been able to make progress by bringing people, particularly 
women, together,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he wished all of the parties in Northern  
Ireland would move as resolutely toward peace as have the women 
with whom Mrs. Clinton works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think her world will have more to do with whether  
peace will really take hold than the one I've moved in,'' he said. 
``The women are doing better than the men now in promoting peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton headlined a $100,000 fund-raising reception  
intended to help pay for his wife's own political efforts, the 
first time he has formally pitched in on her behalf. She is 
considering a run in 2000 for the Senate seat from New York being 
vacated by fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	If she wins a Senate seat, the president said, New Yorkers will  
be represented by ``the most gifted person'' he has ever met. 
</P>
<P>
	He recounted for the more than 100 contributors at a Nantucket  
estate how he met and fell in love with Hillary Rodham while 
students at Yale Law School even though he didn't want to do it. He 
said the first time he met her he found her compelling and 
attractive but said to himself, ``This is nothing but trouble'' and 
walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton explained to reporters as Air Force One carried him back  
to vacation headquarters on the island of Martha's Vineyard that he 
had just broken up with another young woman. ``I said that to 
myself because I thought I would fall in love with her and I didn't 
want to fall in love, that's what I thought,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the fund-raiser, the first lady had her own Nantucket  
agenda, beginning with a visit to an old whaling church. The visit 
was part of her yearlong effort to promote awareness of American 
historical treasures in need of preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also kept busy, spending the afternoon golfing on  
Nantucket after a hop from Martha's Vineyard. His foursome included 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, along with daughter Chelsea and their chocolate  
Labrador, Buddy, arrived Thursday night for their fifth Martha's 
Vineyard vacation. Clinton and his family are dividing their 
vacation this year between the island and New York state, a nod to 
Mrs. Clinton's senatorial aspirations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Irish to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- Saying some Northern Ireland leaders put  
``their whole identity'' into continuing violence, President 
Clinton urged all sides in the conflict Friday to trust each other 
enough to lay aside their arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got to help them let go,'' he told a fund-raiser for  
the American Ireland Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said peace will not flourish in Northern Ireland if its  
leaders do not put total faith in the agreements that can create 
it. That can start, he said, by laying down arms without insisting 
that some other faction go first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these folks have been doing this for so long that  
their whole identity is caught up in the continuation of the 
conflict,'' Clinton said. ``We have got to target those critical 
decision makers and give them an image of a life they can have that 
is meaningful and rich. ...We have got to help them let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event, attended by about 300 people, raised $92,000 for the  
fund, an organization whose charitable, not-for-profit work helps 
promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland.

<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said she was honored. ``Thanks to the fund, we've  
really been able to make progress by bringing people, particularly 
women, together,'' she said. ``Thank you for believing so strongly 
that peace will last, that it will take firm root.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he wished all of the parties in Northern  
Ireland would move as resolutely toward peace as have the women 
with whom Mrs. Clinton works. ``Sometimes, I think her world will 
have more to do with whether peace will really take hold than the 
one I've moved in,'' he said.

	Other than the fund-raiser, the first lady had her own Nantucket  
agenda, beginning with a visit to an old whaling church. The visit 
was part of her yearlong effort to promote awareness of American 
historical treasures in need of preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The president opened his 16-day vacation with an afternoon of  
golf on this New England holiday island after a hop from Martha's 
Vineyard, where the Clintons are staying. His foursome included 
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, along with daughter Chelsea and their chocolate  
Labrador Buddy, arrived Thursday night -- the president's 53rd 
birthday -- for their fifth Martha's Vineyard vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his family are dividing their vacation this year  
between the island and New York state, a nod to Mrs. Clinton's 
senatorial aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons will spend their first nine days away from the  
White House at the 20-acre Oyster Pond spread of Massachusetts 
developer Richard Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	The excitement level on Martha's Vineyard is far lower than it  
was during the Clintons' first two vacations, with only a 
sprinkling of shop signs and newspaper advertisements taking 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign hailed the Clintons as ``our true heroes.'' Another  
store retrieved from storage larger-than-life cardboard cutouts of 
the Clintons. Tourists posing with them were asked to put a dollar 
in a fishbowl ``for charity.'' A newspaper ad ignored the first 
couple but welcomed ``Buddy Clinton'' back to the island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nantucket, Mrs. Clinton was visiting a church as part of a  
White House program celebrating the millennium effort to encourage 
preservation of the nation's culture and heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 28, the Clintons plan to leave Martha's Vineyard for  
posh East Hampton, N.Y., and a weekend of raising money for the 
Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's possible campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Clinton's will settle in for five days in  
Skaneateles, a town in the Finger lakes region southwest of 
Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Squash Players Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A bus taking Egyptian squash players to a  
tourist resort overturned Friday while speeding, killing the driver 
and injuring four players and an official, security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players -- the women's team and two men players -- were  
traveling to the city of Madaba on their day off between matches at 
the Arab Games in Amman, said the officials, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was Nasreen Nasha't, who underwent  
surgery in a hospital near Madaba for a broken thigh bone, said 
Egyptian diplomats who also spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	She was later taken to the King Hussein Medical Hospital in  
Amman where she underwent a second surgery on a broken jaw. Nasha't 
also suffered concussion, Health Minister Ishaq Maraqa told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her condition is 70 percent stable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Nasha't finished eighth in the individual championship, which  
ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other women -- Iman Amir and Umniya Abdul Qawi -- suffered  
bruises and were taken to the King Hussein Medical Hospital in 
Amman. Amir won the silver medal and Qawi the bronze in the women's 
squash championship on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold was won by Egypt's Enjy Kherillah, who not on the bus.  
</P>
<P>
	The bus was carrying about 15 people, all of them Egyptians.  
Only the unidentified driver, who died, was Jordanian, the security 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said one member of the men's team, Mohammed Mithat,  
and a sports administrator, Mohammed Ismail Sharmi, also suffered 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the accident occurred on the outskirts of Madaba when  
the speeding bus climbed the sidewalk and overturned. No other 
details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if the Egyptians intend to go on with the team  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Madaba, about 18 miles southwest of Amman, is known for its  
Byzantine ruins featuring mosaic floors and picnic spots near a 
couple of waterfalls. It also is the site of Mount Nebo where Moses 
is said to have sighted the promised land.

<HEADLINE> Talk Showing Slaying Trial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Defense attorneys are attempting to shift  
the blame in the retrial of a man accused of killing a gay 
acquaintance after they taped an episode of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' on secret crushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure pursued Jonathan Schmitz to a point that Schmitz  
``lost it,'' defense attorney Jerome Sabbota said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz is accused of second-degree murder in the shotgun  
slaying of Amedure three days after the taping in 1995, in what 
prosecutor Donna Pendergast called ``the epitome of senseless 
violence and destruction, the cold-blooded and unwarranted 
obliteration of human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sabbota told jurors that Schmitz should be convicted of  
nothing more than manslaughter. ``I won't ask you to set him free. 
I want you to convict him of what he did,'' he said in opening 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, then 24, and Amedure, 32, flew to Chicago for the  
taping on March 6, 1995. Amedure, who was gay, revealed his crush 
on Schmitz to the studio audience during the taped segment, which 
never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Schmitz calmly went about his business three  
days after the taping, buying ammunition and a shotgun, then 
shooting a defenseless Amedure twice in his mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland County sheriff's Deputy Craig Stout, who took Schmitz's  
confession the day of the shooting, testified that Schmitz was 
angry about being humiliated on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't showing any open emotion,'' Stout said. ``He had  
kind of a worried look on his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors also heard the 911 call placed by Gary Brady, Amedure's  
roommate, who testified that Schmitz came to the mobile home that 
morning, came in once, then returned to his car to retrieve a 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was another knock on the door,'' Brady said. ``He  
(Amedure) said, `Gary, help! He's got a gun, he's going to 
shoot.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of second-degree murder in 1996 and  
sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. An appeals court later 
overturned the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the new trial has ruled that the defense won't be  
allowed to present evidence of Schmitz's history of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Michigan law, diminished mental capacity cannot be used as  
a defense against a charge of second-degree murder. Such a defense 
was allowed in the first trial because the original charge then was 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate civil case, a jury in May found the show and its  
corporate owner, Warner Bros., negligent and ordered them to pay 
$25 million in damages to Amedure's relatives.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Leave Schourek on Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates didn't make a roster  
move Friday involving left-hander Pete Schourek, who will miss at 
least one start with inflammation in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation the Pirates might put Schourek on the  
disabled list, a move they still might make Saturday to clear a 
roster spot for left-handed reliever Jason Christiansen. 
</P>
<P>
	The one problem with that is it might make it more difficult to  
trade Schourek, since he would be on the disabled list Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Players are eligible for the postseason if they are on a team's  
roster Aug. 31. Players on the disabled list are eligible for the 
postseason, but another player on the active roster must be removed 
to make room for the injured player. 
</P>
<P>
	Schourek (3-7, 5.68 ERA) must clear waivers before he can be  
traded and his $2 million guaranteed salary for next season is an 
impedance to any sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Jimmy Anderson (1-0, 3.72 ERA in five games) will  
take Schourek's spot in the rotation Saturday and will oppose 
Diamondbacks left-hander Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	That isn't likely to bother Anderson, who opposed Mark McGwire  
in his first career start on August 6, a 5-1 victory in which 
Anderson allowed St. Louis one run and six hits over six innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was 3-0 with a 1.54 ERA in three starts against  
Pittsburgh last season after the Houston Astros barely beat the 
trading deadline by acquiring him from Seattle on July 31.

<HEADLINE> Two Moroccans Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been  
stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building 
steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and  
Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 
400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda 
Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze  
medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building  
steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests 
-- including several at the Pan American Games and even others 
announced this week in advance of the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive  
among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited 
laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field  
events. No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said most gold medal winners were tested. Suspicions about  
Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically 
in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The track and field events were held Aug. 11-14 while the games  
formally opened on Aug. 15 for other events. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey  
withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for 
Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford  
Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers 
tarnished by positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal. The Arab  
Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban 
athletes. Bans imposed by international organizations range between 
two months and life. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan,  
rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the  
country of working with steroids. We have 100 percent confidence in 
the tests and everything has been conducted according to the 
international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time  
in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon. Twelve 
athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.

<HEADLINE> French Climber Scales Sears Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A French daredevil known as ``Spiderman'' for his  
climbing exploits scaled the 1,450-foot Sears Tower this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Robert of Valance, France, was met on the roof of the  
110-story building by officers with handcuffs. Chicago police said 
Robert was charged with two misdemeanor counts, criminal trespass 
and failure to use a safety device while operating an aerial show. 
</P>
<P>
	The climb created a spectacle on Wacker Drive, a busy downtown  
thoroughfare. Traffic backed up and TV station helicopters hovered 
to show the stunt live on morning news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert, who scales tall buildings for publicity, has climbed  
more than 30 skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sears Tower held the ``world's tallest'' title from 1973  
until 1996, when the 1,483-foot Petronas Twin Towers skyscraper in 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was ruled taller. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert's effort marks the second time the building has been  
conquered by daredevils. On Memorial Day 1981, Dan Goodwin, a Las 
Vegas stuntman who went by the name ``Spider Dan,'' climbed the 
building after spending $4,000 on equipment, which included three 
huge glass carrier suction cups. He was charged and convicted of 
disorderly conduct and fined $35. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin's successful attempt to climb the 100-story John Hancock  
Center later that year was nearly thwarted by the Chicago Fire 
Department, which used water hoses to try to wash him off the side 
of the building.

	Time Running Out for Rescue in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Three people were pulled alive from  
beneath crumbled buildings today, three days after the quake that 
killed more than 10,000 people and may have trapped tens of 
thousands more, but time was running out and little hope remained 
that others would be rescued. The disaster threatened to rival 
Turkey's most destructive quake -- a 7.9 temblor in 1939 that killed 
33,000 people. As the scope of the destruction become clear, 
authorities took their first steps against contractors who built 
shoddy buildings blamed for many deaths.

	CIA Cuts Ex-Spy Director's Clearance

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Central Intelligence Agency said today it  
has cut off former CIA Director John Deutch's access to classified 
information in response to his having violated agency rules by 
keeping secret files on an unsecured computer at his home. 
Suspending the security clearances of a former CIA director is 
highly unusual. Agency spokesman William Harlow said he knew of no 
precedent. The decision was made by CIA Director George Tenet, 
Deutch's immediate successor, who acted after reviewing a CIA 
inspector general's July 13 report on the former director's 
improper handling of classified materials.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian war planes, which have been  
bombing separatist rebels in the southern republic of Dagestan for 
almost two weeks, hit rebels inside neighboring Chechnya today, the 
Defense Ministry said. The airstrikes on two villages inside 
Chechnya raised the prospect of widening the conflict, which has so 
far been concentrated in several villages in Dagestan. This is 
Russia's most serious internal conflict since the 1994-1996 war in 
Chechnya. The estimated 1,200 fundamentalist rebel forces in 
Dagestan are seeking an independent Islamic state in southern 
Russia. The militants include fighters from Chechnya and Dagestan.

the Serb people have shown they will settle for nothing less than 
the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic. ``There are two sides 
in Serbia today -- the regime and the people,'' said Zoran Djindjic, 
a key opponent of Milosevic. ``Everybody will soon have to take one 
of the sides.'' Djindjic, a key leader of the umbrella opposition 
group, The Alliance for Change, spoke at a press conference a day 
after an estimated 150,000 people gathered at an opposition rally

set 6-4 and won the second set 6-3. But he retired after consulting 
his trainer before the start of the third set.

<HEADLINE> Tour Brings Money for Armstrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de  
France has begun to pay off -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has signed a contract extension with his team, U.S.  
Postal Service, that will pay him $2 million in 2000, four times 
his 1999 base salary. He also has signed a string of new 
endorsement deals worth as much as $6 million through the year 
2004, the Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance is somewhat astounded by what's happening now,'' said  
Armstrong's agent, Bill Stapleton. ``The numbers are pretty 
staggering and he's really flattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Armstrong has pledged to donate at least  
$250,000 from his 2000 salary to his Lance Armstrong Foundation for 
cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the endorsement deals call for Armstrong to appear in  
television commercials for financial news provider Bridge 
Information Systems, American General Financial Services and the 
Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong already has been the subject of a commercial for Nike  
Inc., one of his apparel and equipment sponsors. He has made 
appearances as a motivational speaker since he was diagnosed with 
advanced testicular cancer in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the Tour de France, Armstrong made $30,000 per speech.  
Stapleton said companies now are offering up to $100,000 per 
speech.

<HEADLINE> Colts LB Royal To Be Subpoenaed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The attorney for a French Quarter dancer will  
attempt to have Indianapolis linebacker Andre Royal served with a 
subpoena at Saturday's game between the Colts and New Orleans 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal, traded by the Saints to the Colts last year is being sued  
by Rebekah Cehajic, a former dancer at Rick's Caberet. She claims 
Royal hit her, groped her and left without paying for private 
dances on March 18, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal was scheduled to be deposed by Cehajic's lawyer, Stephen  
Rue, on Friday. But Royal's lawyer canceled the deposition because 
he couldn't reach the player to confirm he would show up, Rue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rue said he rescheduled Royal's deposition for Sept. 13, but  
asked for a civil sheriff's deputy serve the player with a subpoena 
to make sure he appears for questioning. Rue said he wants the 
subpoena served at the night game because that's the only place he 
knows Royal will be in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to play games with Mr. Royal,'' Rue said. ``It's  
unfortunate that I have to go to these measures to have Mr. Royal 
attend a deposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal's lawyer did not return a telephone message seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Police booked Royal with misdemeanor charges of simple battery  
and public drunkenness. He has denied striking the woman but did 
apologize for his behavior. Royal subsequently was cleared of any 
wrongdoing in the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after he was released from jail, Royal signed a $3.8  
million offer sheet with the Saints when the Carolina Panthers 
refused to match it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cehajic, who has moved to California, is suing Royal for  
personal injuries. She also wants him to pay her for lost wages and 
for $200 she says he owes for private dances she performed for him.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Activate Montgomery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies activated  
right-hander Steve Montgomery from the 15-day disabled list Friday 
and designated left-hander Jim Poole for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, on the DL since Aug. 4 with a strained groin, is 1-4  
with a 3.15 ERA in 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole, who struggled in his specialty role against left-handed  
hitters, apologized to manager Terry Francona for not pitching 
better before leaving the clubhouse. The Phillies have 10 days to 
trade him, release him or send him outright to the minors. Poole 
was 1-1 with a 4.33 ERA and allowed 48 hits in 35 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said something to the effect of, `Sorry I didn't pitch  
better,' '' Francona said. ``He was pretty professional about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies also assigned right-hander Ken Ryan outright to the  
minors. Ryan, who has been trying to come back from major elbow 
surgery since 1997, accepted an assignment to Triple-A Scranton in 
May. Phillies general manager Ed Wade said he wanted to give Ryan 
the option to sign with another team before the end of the season.

<HEADLINE> Medical Privacy Deadline Missed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the information age, when even the most  
sensitive information zips across continents with lightning speed, 
there's widespread agreement on a need for federal legislation to 
protect the privacy of medical records. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, after years of effort, Congress has failed to pass a law,  
despite giving itself a deadline -- Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was close until getting hung up over a pair of  
issues: the right to sue over improper use of records and privacy 
of teen-agers who have abortions. Congress will try again after it 
returns to Washington this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've had three years, and lots of bills have been  
introduced, and hearings have been held, but there's been no 
serious movement,'' said Janlori Goldman, a privacy advocate who 
directs the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University. ``I 
think it's very distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, for the moment, more privacy safeguards are in place for  
Americans' video rentals than for their medical records. There are 
no guarantees that private information won't be sold to 
pharmaceutical companies, passed to employers or whispered about in 
insurance company offices. A hospital clerk could sell your records 
to a malpractice attorney or leak them to a newspaper, and it's not 
against the law -- at least, not federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	A patchwork of state laws protects medical privacy, but the  
protections vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all-party agreement that federal legislation is needed,  
sharp disagreement persists over details. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, privacy advocates and consumer groups want a tough  
law that makes it difficult for health insurance companies, 
researchers and law enforcers to use records for anything other 
than care and billing. Health care companies and businesses want to 
be sure their operations are not constrained by overly strict 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Among specific questions:  
</P>
<P>
	Should the federal law replace stricter state laws already on  
the books? 
</P>
<P>
	Should police be forced to get a court order or a warrant before  
seizing medical records? 
</P>
<P>
	How much flexibility should go to health insurance companies for  
the use of medical records in their operations? 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate Health,  
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, wrote a bill with 
compromises on each of these. But he couldn't find agreement on the 
right to sue and teen abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits are a perennial issue on Capitol Hill and dominated  
this summer's debate over new rights for patients in managed-care 
health plans. So while the issue is peripheral to privacy, it 
brings out many of the same arguments pitting consumer groups who 
want to ensure victims are compensated against businesses worried 
about costly judgments. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the issue is whether to limit damages if someone  
improperly releases records and whether to make plaintiffs prove 
that their records were released on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion is even further removed from the essence of the privacy  
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether the new privacy rights being created  
include teen-agers who get medical care on their own if there is no 
state law specifically requiring parental involvement. Democrats 
led by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., want to be sure that teens are 
allowed to keep their records private, even from their parents. 
That naturally includes controversial medical visits -- including 
those for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffords was unable to reach compromise on either of these  
issues before Congress left for its August break. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the House began work on its own legislation.  
But it is just beginning and is even further from consensus than 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress had hoped that a looming deadline would force  
interested parties to compromise, but so far it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 law requires the Department of Health and Human Services  
to write regulations on medical privacy if Congress fails to act by 
Saturday. The department is busy writing the rules, although the 
department, and the interest groups involved, would prefer that 
Congress write a law instead. 
</P>
<P>
	A law would carry more weight than regulations would, and HHS  
rules would cover only electronic records, not paper files. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, HHS plans to issue proposed regulations this fall, in  
time to take effect by February. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress fails to act in the fall, it could extend the  
deadline. Meanwhile, the threat of HHS rules may encourage 
compromise, said Joe Karpinski, spokesman for the Senate health 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``That environment,'' he said, ``is the best thing that can help  
us.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Strike Votes Slowly Tallied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The word in Detroit was that the United Auto  
Workers wanted to send a message to Ford Motor Co. by having all 
its Ford members cast a strike-authorization vote on the same day 
rather than over several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Only problem is, it didn't work.  
</P>
<P>
	Strike authorization votes are routine every three years before  
national contract negotiations intensify in September. They 
typically are conducted over several days or weeks; members usually 
vote overwhelmingly to grant their representatives the power to 
call a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford vote was scheduled for Tuesday, but some of the 43 Ford  
locals across the country set their own voting schedule. The union 
originally had said it would release the results Wednesday, but by 
late Friday the total still was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW spokesman Paul Krell said the vote would be released Monday  
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to have all Ford voting on Tuesday led to speculation  
that the UAW was trying to signal its displeasure with the No. 2 
automaker over its possible spinoff of the Visteon Automotive 
Systems Corp. parts unit. The union opposes a spinoff of Visteon, 
which has about 28,500 UAW members. 
</P>
<P>
	The current contracts with Ford, General Motors Corp. and the  
Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG expire Sept. 14. 
Strike-authorization voting also was still being conducted in the 
normal fashion this week at GM and Chrysler locals.

<HEADLINE> Browns Set for Raucous Home Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Orlando Brown will never forget the ugly scene  
in the old Cleveland Stadium on Dec. 17, 1995, the last time the 
Browns played a home game. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing bleachers and seats ripped up and tossed on the  
field, and batteries and fireworks thrown at the Cincinnati 
Bengals, Brown wanted to visit with some of Cleveland's fans who 
were about to lose their treasured football team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the Dawg Pound at the end of the game,''  
Cleveland's mammoth offensive tackle said. ``I had always heard 
them calling my name, but I never had looked in their eyes. They 
were crying, man. That's when I realized how much people love their 
football here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they take the field Saturday night in the new 72,000-seat  
Cleveland Browns Stadium, the expansion Browns will be welcomed 
like conquering heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	There's sure to be more tears in the stands, but these won't be  
tinged with sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns will be home again.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has been waiting nearly three years for Saturday  
night's home opener against the Minnesota Vikings. A giant clock in 
the downtown's Tower City Mall has been counting down the days 
until kickoff since the NFL announced in 1996 it would bring the 
Browns back for the 1999 season as an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns' home opener will culminate a weeklong celebration,  
which included a stadium dedication, a parade through the city 
streets on Friday and a pep rally in Public Square which drew an 
estimated 40,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Kickoff was still 36 hours away, but Cleveland was carrying on  
like it was New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans chanted, ``Here We Go Brownies, Here We Go, Woof, Woof!''  
as Mayor Michael R. White, instrumental in bringing pro football 
back, thanked Browns fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	White recalled that when the city was trying to convince the  
league to return the Browns, he was often asked: ``What does 
Cleveland want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'We want our team, our name and our colors,'' he said.  
``And guess what Cleveland. We have our team. We have our name. We 
have our colors. We have our legacy, and a brand new stadium to 
boot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even a planned rally by the Ku Klux Klan, which has stolen  
recent headlines and increased racial tension in the city, has been 
able to dampen Cleveland's enthusiasm about the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Browns take the field in their traditional orange  
helmets Saturday night, fans may be too excited to care much about 
what is happening on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town is fired up,'' said cornerback Antonio Langham, who  
like Brown played for the Browns in '95. ``They've waited three 
years for this. Football is back, a new stadium, the whole nine. 
You might see more hitting in the Dawg Pound than you do on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland coach Chris Palmer is hoping for a much better effort  
from his team than he got a week ago in Tampa Bay when the Browns 
(1-1) were awful in a 30-3 loss to the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will start rookie quarterback Tim Couch, the team's No. 1  
overall pick in the NFL draft against the Vikings (0-1). Couch, so 
impressive in his pro debut against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall 
of Fame Game, was under siege most of the time last week.

<HEADLINE> Marilyn Sheppard Body To Be Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Prosecutors will exhume the body of Marilyn  
Sheppard, whose husband was convicted, then acquitted in the 
sensational 1950s killing that inspired ``The Fugitive'' television 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason wants to exhume the  
body to do his own DNA analysis for the upcoming trial in a 
wrongful imprisonment lawsuit filed by Dr. Sam Sheppard's son, Sam 
Reese Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, who contends a window washer killed his mother in  
1954, is trying to clear his late father's name once and for all. 
The elder Sheppard spent 10 years in prison for the slaying before 
courts set him free. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, 51, accused the prosecutor of using the exhumation as  
an excuse to delay the trial, scheduled to begin Oct. 18. Damages 
could reach as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNA being used is contaminated,'' Cuyahoga County  
Prosecutor William D. Mason told reporters today. ``We need to get 
a positive DNA sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said the allegations focus on how Mrs. Sheppard died, but  
he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sheppard believes the evidence gathered will back up his  
theory, he was personally offended by the prospect of his mother's 
exhumation. He accused prosecutors of grandstanding to get in the 
newspapers and on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was a very modest woman,'' he said in a telephone  
interview from his Oakland, Calif., home early today. ``This is an 
insult on her in terms of her dignity. This is outrageous. They've 
had 45 years to investigate this fully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wouldn't contest it in court but did plan to contest  
any trial delays. The exhumation could delay the trial by months. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unsettling. To be getting ready for a trial and have this  
kind of wrench thrown into the works, it seems unconscionable,'' he 
said. ``It looks like a delay tactic on their part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said Ohio law gives him or the county coroner the  
authority to exhume a body without a court order. The remains will 
be exhumed within the next several weeks but the date will not be 
announced out of respect for Mrs. Sheppard's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make every effort to maintain the quiet and dignity of  
the cemetery where she and so many other families' loved ones rest 
in peace,'' Mason said. Sheppard said he planned to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sheppard to win at trial, a jury will have to decide more  
evidence points to his father being innocent than guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard, 31 and four months pregnant, was beaten on July  
4, 1954, in her bedroom at the couple's home on the shore of Lake 
Erie. Her husband was convicted of murder later that year in a 
highly publicized trial, but insisted that a bushy-haired intruder 
killed his wife, then knocked him unconscious when he came to her 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court later overturned the verdict in a  
landmark decision that cited the unfair effect of pretrial 
publicity. Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966. He died in 
1970 of liver failure. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sheppard's remains are in a crypt at Knollwood Cemetery in  
suburban Mayfield Heights. The cremated remains of her husband also 
are in the crypt. He was exhumed in 1997, at the request of Sam 
Reese Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA evidence from that exhumation indicated former window washer  
Richard Eberling could be the killer. Eberling died in prison last 
year while serving time for an unrelated murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor mentioned only a DNA test. He wouldn't comment  
today on the claim by Terry Gilbert, Sam Reese Sheppard's attorney, 
that prosecutors want to clarify the nature of the wounds Mrs. 
Sheppard received, including injuries to her teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Mrs. Sheppard's teeth were broken when she was beaten to  
death. Criminologist Paul Kirk, whose testimony helped clear the 
doctor at his second trial in 1966, concluded that Mrs. Sheppard 
bit her attacker -- who then pulled the teeth out when he jerked his 
hand away. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert said the evidence will support the fact that Sheppard is  
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact it will just confirm what the world seems to know at  
this point that an innocent man had been convicted of a crime he 
didn't commit and that the state had no interest in 45 years in 
correcting the terrible injustice,'' Gilbert said.

<HEADLINE> ABC Reporter To Give Back IPO Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- ABC's medical correspondent is returning  
more than $50,000 to drkoop.com after violating insider-trading 
rules by selling shares in the healthcare Web site too soon after 
it went public, the company acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nancy Snyderman, who regularly appears on ABC's ``Good  
Morning America,'' serves as a director of the Internet site named 
after its founder, former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Snyderman's husband bought 1,650 shares of Austin-based  
drkoop.com during a June 8 initial public offering for $9 and sold 
it one month later when prices soared to $41.27 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a violation of Securities and Exchange Commission rules  
barring corporate officers and directors from profiting from a 
stock sale within six months of purchasing shares, said Sue 
Georgen-Saad, chief financial officer of drkoop.com. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dr. Snyderman's husband doesn't work for the company, he  
is held to the same rules, Ms. Georgen-Saad said. SEC rules 
consider husbands and wives to be one person for filing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Snyderman didn't immediately return calls to The Associated  
Press for comment, but told The Wall Street Journal that she and 
her husband tried to stop the stock sale after realizing it would 
violate federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Snyderman said she ``notified the authorities and disclosed  
it immediately in compliance with SEC regulations. Compliance with 
the SEC is of paramount importance to me and will continue to be 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an error on the part of the broker and an unauthorized  
sale,'' said Ms. Georgen-Saad, who added that the transactions also 
violated underwriter rules meant to keep company insiders from 
quickly selling their IPO shares. Top officials at the company 
signed agreements with underwriter Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. not to sell 
stock until 180 days after the public offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC correspondent planned to repay the $53,000 her husband  
earned on the sales Friday or early next week, Ms. Georgen-Saad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She'll be writing a check for the proceeds of the stock,'' she  
said. ``She's very anxious to put this behind her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her position on the company's board of directors,  
Dr. Snyderman also contributes content to the consumer healthcare 
site, including a column in which she answers general medical 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Snyderman has worked for ABC for 12 years.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our understanding at the moment is that this is an issue of  
personal finance not having really anything to do with us,'' said 
Eileen Murphy, ABC News spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy said ABC News does have policies related to the  
outside interests of correspondents to head off potential conflicts 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't discuss the specifics of those policies,'' Ms. Murphy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Murphy said she couldn't discuss whether Dr. Snyderman  
violated the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never discuss the application of the policy in any  
individual situation,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks, Dollar Rise in Tokyo / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices closed higher Friday following  
news of a planned alliance of three major Japanese banks. The 
dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 218.37 points, or 1.22  
percent, to close at 18,098.11. On Thursday, the average dropped 
12.52 points, or 0.07 percent, to finish at 17,879.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was traded at 111.74 at mid-afternoon, up 0.11 yen  
from its level late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late level 
of 111.40 overnight in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders reacted positively after financial  
giants Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and 
Fuji Bank Ltd. said they plan an alliance that would create the 
world's largest banking group with assets of well over dlrs 1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in Tokyo came after a fall on Wall Street overnight,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 27.54 points, or 
0.25 percent, to 10,963.84. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 23.59 points, or 1.60 percent, to 1,498.94. The 
TOPIX dropped 3.08 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,475.35 the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange, investors were cautious about selling  
dollars amid fears the Bank of Japan might step in to prop up the 
greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese finance officials have long maintained that a sudden  
surge in the yen could hurt Japan's giant exporters and have 
intervened in markets to keep the yen low and those companies 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen can hurt exporters by forcing them to raise prices  
abroad or accept less in terms of yen from their overseas 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell sharply against both the yen and the euro  
overnight after a surprise jump in the U.S. trade deficit sparked 
selling of dollars. Against the Japanese currency, the greenback 
dropped as low as 110.68 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 119.08 yen in  
mid-afternoon trading, up from its level of 116.98 yen late 
Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.8500 percent from Thursday's close of 1.9200 
percent, driving its price up to 99.57 yen from 98.98 yen.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Release Pitcher Ricky Bones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ricky Bones, who failed to win a game with  
Baltimore and appeared to be losing the zip on his fastball, was 
released by the Orioles on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was made after the Orioles' game against the Chicago  
White Sox was postponed by rain. He was replaced on the 25-man 
roster by Doug Linton, who will start the opener of Saturday's 
day-night doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Linton (0-1) will face John Snyder (9-8) in the 1:05 p.m. EDT  
opener. Sidney Ponson (11-8), who was slated to pitch Friday, will 
oppose Mike Sirotka (8-10) in the second game, scheduled for 7:05 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones, 30, played the past two seasons with Kansas City before  
signing with Baltimore as a free agent in December. He had a 1.62 
ERA through April, but he was placed on the disabled list on July 2 
with right arm fatigue and never again showed the form he displayed 
early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a quality kid, a great worker,'' Orioles manager Ray  
Miller said. ``But statistically, he wasn't getting it done. The 
first month he looked outstanding, then his velocity went down and 
so did his effectiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bones was given two starts this month after Baltimore traded  
Juan Guzman to Cincinnati, but Bones lost at Oakland on Aug. 3 and 
was ineffective against Detroit on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-3 with 5.98 ERA and opponents were hitting .322 against  
him. Miller said his fastball was clocked at under 90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised. No one likes to be in this position, but  
somebody has to go,'' Bones said. ``They were supposed to make a 
move, and they were looking around, and it was me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said the Orioles placed on waivers but he wasn't claimed.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question I can go somewhere else and pitch. I know  
I'm healthy; even last night I pitched and got two of three guys 
out,'' Bones said. ``I'll stick around here a couple days, and see 
Baltimore from a different sight. Then in a couple days I'll go 
home and see my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night's game was called off after a delay of nearly two  
hours. Because Ponson warmed up to pitch, Miller decided to use him 
the second game of the day-night doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder was slated to pitch Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``Playing two like this doesn't matter to me,'' White Sox  
manager Jerry Manuel said. ``In minor league ball I've been through 
a few of them (day-nighters). But never here (majors) that I can 
remember. This will be the first one of them for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shouldn't matter to us. It doesn't make any difference,''  
Manuel said. ``We've got a bunch of young kids, so we should be 
OK.''

<HEADLINE> Drugs Cast Pall Over Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones and Maurice Greene are ready  
to run at the World Championships, where drug cases and positive 
tests continue to tarnish the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships begin Saturday at 60,000-seat Olympic Stadium,  
with Jones and Greene, the world's No. 1 sprinters, competing in 
the first two rounds of the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Interfering with the excitement of their appearances is the  
grave concern over the sudden rash of doping cases, some involving 
the sport's biggest stars -- Merlene Ottey, Javier Sotomayor, 
Linford Christie and Dennis Mitchell. The latest case, of 200-meter 
runner Troy Douglas of the Netherlands, was disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last couple of weeks, our beautiful and lovely sport  
has been marred by all of this,'' said Jones, who will be seeking 
an unprecedented four gold medals at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, aiming for three golds, also has been dismayed by the  
crushing drug revelations and thinks blood testing might by the 
solution to slow the onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't wait until that time comes,'' he said. ``The number of  
positive tests have been very bad for our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's spectators, meanwhile, will be anxiously awaiting the  
time when the two mercurial sprinters appear on the track, taking 
the focus from the off-track activities and centering it on the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that our wonderful performances will overshadow what  
has happened,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Greene already have turned in sensational performances  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the defending champion in the 100, has the season's two  
fastest times, running 10.80 seconds twice. She owns the five 
fastest times and eight of the best nine in the 200, topped by 
21.81. Jones also has run the 400 once, in a respectable 50.79, and 
has long-jumped 23 feet, fourth-best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the four events in which she will compete -- the 100, 200,  
long jump and a relay -- the long jump concerns her most. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier this season I was having a little difficulty with my  
rhythm on the runway,'' she said. ``Since my last long jump 
competition ... we (Jones and coach Trevor Graham) ... have made 
our necessary corrections and I feel quite confident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' long jump hopes were boosted Friday when 1983 and 1993  
champion Heike Drechsler of Germany withdrew with a calf injury. 
Drechsler was the only athlete to beat Jones in any event last 
year, and also outjumped her last month in Linz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jones is a prohibitive favorite in both sprints, Greene,  
also running both dashes and a relay, is favored only to defend his 
title in the 100. He shattered the world record in June with a 
stunning time of 9.79, and he has run 9.85, the second-best time in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 200, his best time of 19.92 is tied for fourth fastest.  
However, of the three runners ahead of him -- Ato Boldon of Trinidad 
and Tobago, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia and John Capel of the 
United States -- only Fredericks is competing at the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 is a challenge for Maurice,'' coach John Smith said.  
``He needs to step up in this area to become that sprinter he's 
always wanted to be ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's 100 semifinals and final will be Sunday.  
Jones also will have long jump qualifying Saturday, with the final 
on Monday. The relays are on the final day of the championships, 
Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	American John Godina, another athlete attempting to win multiple  
medals, begins competition Saturday in the shot put final. On 
Sunday, he will have discus qualifying, with the final Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina is the two-time defending champion in the shot put and  
leads the world in that event this year with a career-best 72 feet, 
3 inches. He has yet to medal in the discus, but ranks second in 
the world this year at 226-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, who has thrown the discus since fifth grade and the shot  
put since 10th grade, has no difficulty adjusting to the two 
implements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adjusting is nothing,'' he said. ``All of a sudden you take a  
couple of throws with one and you're back into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun to be able to do both -- to impress people. That's why  
I stick with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's program also includes finals in the women's pole  
vault and men's 20-kilometer race walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole vault never has been contested at the outdoor  
championships, but has been held twice at the indoor meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorites include 1997 indoor champion Stacy Dragila of the  
United States, world record-holder Emma George of Australia, 1999 
indoor winner Nastia Ryshich of Germany, and Anzhela Balakhonova of 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The top contenders in the walk are world record-holder Julio  
Martinez of Guatemala and No. 2 all-time Alejandro Lopez of Mexico.

<HEADLINE> KLA Says Disarmament Deadline Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Liberation Army leaders say  
they have met a NATO deadline to turn over 60 percent of their 
weapons by today and are not responsible for the continued violence 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, German-led peacekeepers arrested three men around the  
town of Orahovac on suspicion of involvement in ``serious crimes,'' 
NATO said. In Bonn, the German defense ministry said the men were 
suspected of involvement in murdering ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, 
looting and arson last spring. The troops acted on information from 
the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, 
the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch troops have been stationed in Orahovac for weeks but are  
due to hand the town over to Russian peacekeepers this weekend. 
Ethnic Albanians accuse the Russians of favoritism to their fellow 
Slav Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an accord the KLA signed in June, the group must turn in  
its heavy weaponry, most of its arms and uniforms in stages to NATO 
peacekeepers. Disarmament must be completed by Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've fulfilled all our obligations,'' KLA military commander  
Gen. Agim Ceku said Thursday. NATO did not confirm the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceku and KLA political leader Hashim Thaci condemned violence  
against the province's Serb minority. The state-run Tanjug agency 
said that since NATO arrived more than 200 Serbs and other 
non-Albanians have been killed and most of Kosovo's 200,000 Serbs 
have been forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceku said the KLA could have stopped the continuing violence if  
not for foreign interference. The international community, he said, 
is to blame because they prevented the KLA from filling a power 
vacuum that developed after the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Thaci also said crime is harming the KLA's goal of becoming the  
leading force in a multiethnic, democratic Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders' comments came one day after unknown assailants  
hurled grenades and firebombs at a Serbian Orthodox church in 
Kosovo, wounding two Italian peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic violence has persisted in Kosovo, despite the presence of  
more than 40,000 NATO soldiers who arrived after the end of the 
78-day NATO bombing campaign. NATO began the campaign after 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign a peace deal 
and end his crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800,000 ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo in April, May and  
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials warned today that Moscow may withdraw its  
peacekeepers from Kosovo or change their role there if conditions 
become ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Mayorsky, the Foreign Ministry's envoy to the former  
Yugoslavia, and Leonid Ivashov, the Defense Ministry's chief of 
international cooperation department, said Moscow will take such a 
step if the actions of the peacekeeping force ``take such a 
character that it would become unacceptable for Russia to be 
associated with such activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They did not elaborate but stressed that there were no such  
conditions present now, Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia had sharply protested NATO's bombing campaign and had  
wanted a separate zone of responsibility in Kosovo. The Russians 
have complained that the peacekeeping effort is failing to stop 
violence against Serbs, and Mayorsky and Ivashov blamed NATO 
policies for the ongoing violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan today, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata  
said more than 90 percent of the ethnic Albanians who fled have 
returned, and her agency is scrambling to make sure they have 
shelter when winter comes. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR would like to distribute 70,000 shelter kits before  
October. That would enable returning refugees to at least winterize 
one room in their ruined homes, Ogata said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a little bit afraid that we may not make it,'' she  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is refurbishing partly destroyed public buildings as  
collective shelters and arranging for host families to take in 
returning residents. Longer-term infrastructure needs, such as the 
restoration of electrical and water service, are likely to remain 
unfilled until spring.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Currency Plunges Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian real skidded to a  
five-month low on Friday, pushed by uncertainty about 
deficit-cutting reforms and flagging investor confidence in South 
American markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency was trading at 1.995 to the dollar at midday --  
down 6 percent from a week ago -- before strengthening late in the 
day to 1.913. 
</P>
<P>
	For Brazilians, the scramble to buy dollars was uncomfortably  
reminiscent of the panic that followed the 1997 crisis in southeast 
Asia and last year's turmoil in Russia. The shock waves quickly 
reached Brazil, which was forced to devalue its currency in January 
and plunged into a recession from which it just now is emerging. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were quick to argue the situation now is very  
different. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank President Arminio Fraga said markets had the wrong  
impression that the government was weakening in its resolve to 
enact deficit-cutting reforms, a condition of the International 
Monetary Fund for a $41.5 billion loan approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil also is a victim of its neighbors' problems -- elections  
in Argentina, a debt crisis in Ecuador, political unrest in 
Venezuela and Colombia. In New York, Moody's Investors Service 
indicated it may downgrade its ratings for the long-term debt of 
twelve Argentine banks, hurting the value of Brazilian debt bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an unfavorable wind from abroad,'' said Fraga. ``It's  
not a storm, but it's not a generous climate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger is that pessimistic expectations often become  
self-fulfilling. Banks and companies buy dollars as a hedge against 
an uncertain future, which weakens the real and raises the demand 
for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Central Bank tried to increase the inflow  
of dollars by eliminating a 0.5 percent tax on some foreign 
investments. In a bid to restore confidence, the government also 
announced it would pass up a $4.35 billion parcel of the IMF loan, 
on grounds it wasn't needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any moment now, (the market) will realize the economy is  
growing more than expected, inflation is low, and we are meeting 
all our fiscal targets,'' said Daniel Gleizer, the Central Bank's 
director of international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gleizer has a point. The economy has grown for the past two  
quarters and inflation will be close to 8 percent this year, far 
better than expected. Foreign direct investment is strong and 
should easily cover a $23 billion deficit in the balance of 
payments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Projections for next year are not so rosy, however. Brazil has  
promised a sharp cut in its budget deficit, but Congress is 
dragging its feet on reform bills to reduce government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is nervous just now,'' Amalia Estensorro, Latin  
American economist at BBV Latinvest in London, said this week. 
``International currencies are a bit wobbly in general, but 
particular to Brazil is the indefinition of the fiscal situation.''

<HEADLINE> Illinois Excluded in Organ Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Patients in grave need of new livers have been  
put at risk by a new Midwestern organ-sharing network that excludes 
Illinois, some organ transplant officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is I think somebody's going to die,'' said Dr.  
Michael Abecassis, director of liver transplants at Northwestern 
Memorial Hospital in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a four-state agreement launched this week, donor  
livers are offered to patients with the most urgent need regardless 
of where they reside in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and 
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Under regions established by the United Network of Organ  
Sharing, the agency that runs the nation's transplant system, 
Illinois also should be included in the region's organ-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
	The four states have not yet submitted their proposal to UNOS,  
but are moving forward anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin officials argued that Illinois was unfairly benefiting  
from their state's strong organ-donor program because under the 
UNOS formula, donor livers are too often shipped to six 
Chicago-area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wisconsin officials also said the new network was based on  
recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, part of the 
National Academy of Sciences, that suggest smaller organ-sharing 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is meant to take care of these patients in this  
population base that was recommended by the IOM,'' said Dr. Anthony 
D'Alessandro, the director of multi-organ transplantation at the 
University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois could have been included in the new network but  
wouldn't agree to a ``payback'' provision requiring it to provide 
livers to other states in exchange for ones it received, Wisconsin 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really boggles my mind how they can do this,'' Abecassis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Brems, the director of transplants at Loyola University  
Medical Center, said that if Illinois is receiving more livers for 
seriously ill patients it's because the state contains more than 
half of the region's population. Illinois also has six of the 10 
transplant centers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Aug. 1, 1,227 patients were awaiting liver transplants in  
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``There shouldn't be a patient in Chicago dying of liver failure  
when someone who is relatively well in Milwaukee is receiving a 
liver,'' Brems said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bosch, a spokesman for the Regional Organ Bank of  
Illinois, believes Wisconsin has the best interests of patients in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all comes back to the fact that we're in the same  
predicament,'' he said. ``If we had enough organs to go around we 
wouldn't have to allocate.''

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene Aim for Seven Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Maurice Greene is the world's fastest man.  
Marion Jones is the world's fastest woman. Together, they could run 
away with seven gold medals in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The American sprinters will share the spotlight when the sport's  
showcase event opens Saturday, with both determined to establish 
their place in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is bidding to become the first athlete, man or woman, to  
win four gold medals in the championships. She's competing in the 
100 meters, 200, long jump and one of the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be disappointed if I come back with anything less than  
four,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is chasing gold in three events: the 100, 200 and 400  
relay. He could become the first man to complete a 100-200 double 
in the worlds, and the first in any major championship since Carl 
Lewis in the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just eager to get on the track and run,'' Greene said.  
``They say the track is very fast. I just want to see how fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones is a big favorite in the 100 and 200, where she is  
unbeaten since 1997 and owns the world-best times this season 
(10.80 seconds and 21.81). 
</P>
<P>
	Her biggest challenge will be in the long jump, where she lost  
last month in Linz, Austria, to Germany's Heike Drechsler, the 
former Olympic and world champion. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing to Drechsler -- 22 feet, 5 inches to 22-3 -- Jones  
returned home to coordinate her blistering speed down the runway 
with her shaky technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows earlier in the season I was having a little  
bit of trouble with my rhythm on the long jump,'' she said. ``Since 
my last long jump in Linz, we've gone back to the drawing board and 
made our necessary corrections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some answers will roll in almost instantly. Jones begins her  
long-jump qualifying at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, with the 100 prelims 
starting 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out there and hopefully on my first jump,  
qualify, and be able to concentrate on the 100 after that,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said she hasn't decided yet whether she will run in the  
400 or 1,600 relay. The decision will rest with her coach, Trevor 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trevor has told me that after my three individual events are  
done, hopefully I'm happy with three wins there, he's going to look 
into my eyes and tell if I'm ready to run a 400 meters or not,'' 
she said. ``If he doesn't ... then I'm going to run the 4 by 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seville is a dress rehearsal for next year's Sydney Olympics,  
where Jones plans to run in both relays in a bid for a record five 
gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, meanwhile, is looking to bolster his reputation as one  
of the most prolific sprinters in history. 
</P>
<P>
	He has broken the 10-second barrier -- the standard for  
excellence in the 100 -- 22 times, including six times this year 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene entered sprinting lore on June 6 in Athens, Greece, when  
he set the 100 world record of 9.79 seconds, shattering Donovan 
Bailey's mark (9.84 seconds in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics) by an 
astounding five-hundredths of a seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greene looks untouchable in the 100, a gold medal in the  
200 is no certainty. Greene is still learning the longer sprint, 
and his best time this year (19.92) is behind the 19.86 run by 
Namibia's Frankie Fredericks and Trinidad's Ato Boldon and the 
19.87 by John Capel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 is a challenge for Maurice,'' said Greene's coach,  
John Smith. ``It's an event he's not run a great deal of, but he's 
real good at it. So he needs to step up in this area to become that 
sprinter he's always wanted to be -- not only stop at the short 
races, but be able to go up to the furlong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With training partner Boldon out of the championships with an  
injury, Fredericks shapes up as Greene's biggest rival in the 200. 
In the 100, Canada's Bruny Surin, Barbados's Obadele Thompson and 
Fredericks are the main challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been speculation that, without Boldon and Bailey to push  
him in Seville, Greene will be less motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about that,'' Smith said. ``That's why I'm  
there. We'll find a reason to run fast. The mere fact that Ato is 
not there means that Maurice will be running with Ato in his spirit 
and his heart.''

<HEADLINE> Exabyte Eliminating 200 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Computer equipment maker Exabyte Corp. is  
cutting 200 jobs as part of a reorganization aimed at slashing 
costs by as much as $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 of the layoffs occurred Thursday. Another 40  
positions, including 20 vacancies, will be phased out by the end of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining jobs will be eliminated before the end of the  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Exabyte officials announced earlier this month that they would  
make significant cuts to streamline operations. Before the 
reductions, the company employed 1,275 people, including 900 in 
Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions will affect most of Exabyte's operations,  
including sales, marketing, manufacturing, administration, quality 
control and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Exabyte was founded in the mid-1980s by former Storage  
Technology Corp. executives. It makes tape drives and tape 
libraries for computer data storage. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has struggled the past year, its quarterly revenues  
falling from $63.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year to 
$48.5 million last quarter. Its losses the past three quarters 
totaled $25.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Blues' Campbell Cited for DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jim Campbell, a forward with the St. Louis  
Blues, was arrested Thursday night for driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped Campbell in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton after  
he drove through a red light. A breathalizer test indicated that he 
had a .15 blood alcohol level. The legal limit is .10. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was cited for running the light, and for driving under  
the influence of alcohol. He's expected to appear in court Sept. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell suffered a groin injury earlier this year that kept him  
out for a portion of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named to the National Hockey League's All-Rookie team in  
1996-97, and was a runnerup for the Calder Trophy, given to the 
NHL's top rookie. He led the Blues in seven goals and 10 points in 
the 1998 Stanley Cup playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Feds Allege Fraud by Navy Contractor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government agents posing as ship repair  
subcontractors have uncovered major fraud by several employees of a 
management company charged with overseeing repairs of Navy ships, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bribes and kickbacks allegedly accepted by some employees of  
Bayship Management Inc. of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., included 
dinners, golf outings, country club memberships and trips from 
subcontractors that were later billed to the government as part of 
the contract price, officials said Thursday. Bayship had been 
awarded a $200 million government contract to maintain the ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Four former Bayship employees were charged in criminal bills of  
information last week in Texas. Charges include fraud and 
kickbacks. Two other Bayship employees were charged earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, the four-year investigation has netted charges against  
21 people, from Jacksonville, Fla., to Boston and San Francisco, 
and two companies working as subcontractors. Federal authorities 
say the investigation continues and more charges are likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is an egregious example of corruption within a  
Department of Defense program that has undermined the procurement 
process, cost the American taxpayers a significant amount of money 
and eroded the trust and confidence of the public in the operation 
of the government,'' said John F. Keenan, director of the Defense 
Criminal Investigative Service, the investigative arm of the 
Defense Department's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus of the investigation was alleged fraud in a $200  
million contract Bayship had with the Military Sealift Command for 
maintenance and repairs of eight Navy ships. Bayship was 
responsible for soliciting subcontractors to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving reports of the allegations in 1994, federal  
agents set up an undercover subcontracting business known as 
Coastal Marine Engineering Group that eventually operated in 
Houston, Jacksonville, New Orleans, Norfolk, Va., and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	During the probe, more than 27 agents had undercover roles and  
made more than 3,000 telephone and body recordings, officials said. 
Dozens of meetings between the undercover agents and subjects were 
videotaped, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the investigation revealed that Bayship employees  
directed the undercover agents to fraudulently inflate the dollar 
amounts of contracts to cover gratuities provided to them by 
Coastal Marine Engineering Group. On some occasions, fraudulent 
contracts were allegedly issued to reimburse the undercover 
business for cash given to Bayship employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation also uncovered the use of ``complementary''  
bids in the awarding of repair contracts. In this practice, certain 
subcontractors were allegedly instructed to submit bids higher than 
a favored vendor so it would appear that the competitive bid 
process was followed. Authorities said that on many occasions the 
Bayship employees recorded the undercover company as a bidder on a 
job when, in fact, no bid was ever submitted.

	``If you ask me if we're going to be confident, I'm going to say  
yes,'' he said. ``But there's not going to be much difference 
between the top team and the bottom team in our conference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats return 16 starters from last year's team; 17 if  
Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins, who shared the quarterback 
position, are both included. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guys we've got, I wouldn't trade them for anyone in  
the world,'' Tomey said. ``I said that when we were struggling a 
couple years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Struggling, indeed. At one point in 1997, Arizona had a 3-5  
record, and there were rumblings that Tomey's job was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats are 16-1 since, with the only loss a 52-28 setback  
to defending Pac-10 champion UCLA last fall. That was the only 
blemish in a 12-1 season, and Arizona was ranked fourth in the 
final AP media poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith and Jenkins combined to pass for 2,743 yards and 18  
touchdowns with 11 interceptions last season. Smith set a Pac-10 
passing efficiency record with a 174.17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both did a tremendous job of handling the situation,''  
Tomey said. ``We may do what we did last year, we may not. We're 
probably going to start the season that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other returnees are Trung Canidate, who rushed for 1,220  
yards and 10 touchdowns, and Dennis Northcutt, who caught 63 passes 
for 922 yards and six TDs. Nine defensive starters are back. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomey had a ready answer when asked whether the Wildcats were  
pointing toward their first-ever Rose Bowl game or, perhaps, the 
Sugar Bowl, site of the Bowl Championship Series' national title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have our sights set on the first day of training camp,  
firmly,'' he said. ``That's where we get started. I think if your 
focus gets too far ahead, that's when you start screwing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona opens its season Aug. 28 at Penn State in the Pigskin  
Classic in a matchup where the Wildcats or Nittany Lions could find 
their national title hopes dashed over four months before it's 
eventually decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no exhibition games,'' Tomey said.  
</P>
<P>
	UCLA, 10-2 and ranked eighth at the end of last season, has to  
find a successor to Cade McNown and shore up a defense that allowed 
a staggering 340 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some kids who can throw the football, we'll be fine  
there,'' coach Bob Toledo said of UCLA's quarterback situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew Bennett, who has thrown five passes in college, enters fall  
camp as UCLA's No. 1 quarterback, with redshirt freshman Cory Paus 
listed No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to go one-dimensional,'' Toledo said. ``We  
have recruited at that position for the system. They just haven't 
done it yet. The quarterbacks are all capable, I'm not worried 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Danny Farmer, who caught 58 passes for 1,274 yards and  
nine touchdowns, the Bruins have one of the country's finest corps 
of wide receivers, and their top three rushers return, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona and UCLA meet on Oct. 30 at the Rose Bowl in what could  
be the Pac-10 game of the year, although Southern California, 
Arizona State and Oregon could be heard from before the race is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	USC, 8-5 under first-year coach Paul Hackett last season after a  
disappointing 28-19 loss to TCU in the Sun Bowl, hopes to be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're headed in the right direction,'' Hackett said.  
``The offense is going to have to carry us, especially early in the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans return their entire offensive line along with  
quarterback Carson Palmer, wide receiver R. Jay Soward and running 
back Chad Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, however, will be much less experienced.  
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State entered last season with national championship  
hopes, but went a disappointing 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like I've been asked about what happened last year in  
every interview since December,'' ASU coach Bruce Snyder said. ``It 
was obviously a year where we had a lot of high expectations. We 
have a lot of hungry guys. I think everything is positive at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Ryan Kealy and tailback J.R. Redmond are among seven  
returning starters from an offense that averaged 30.3 points and 
411.8 yards per game. The defense, which allowed two fewer points 
than UCLA in one less game, will have to improve if the Sun Devils 
are going to contend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe the leadership on the current squad will be able  
to handle a problem much better than last year's team,'' Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like UCLA, Oregon will be inexperienced at quarterback, having  
lost Akili Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue,'' Oregon coach Mike Bellotti said when asked  
who will play the position. ``If we played a game today, (A.J.) 
Feeley would start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feeley has thrown 10 passes in college; none last year, when the  
Ducks went 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year's team was initially led by the offense, this year's  
team will initially by led by the defense,'' Bellotti said. ``We 
have eight starters, and the linebacking unit may be one of the 
best in the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pac-10 has eight returning coaches and two well-known  
newcomers -- Rick Neuheisel at Washington, and Dennis Erickson at 
Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how things work out,'' said Neuheisel, a former  
offensive coordinator at UCLA who coached Colorado the past four 
years. ``This was just one of those opportunities that felt right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where we'll end up. We're not going to concede  
anything. I also know where there's transition, there are bumps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erickson, who won national championships at Miami in 1989 and  
1991, was fired as coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks following 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to get back into college football after four years in  
the NFL, which I thoroughly enjoyed,'' he said. ``There's a 
commitment from our president, there's a commitment to get things 
done.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Confirms Sheik Assault Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI is investigating allegations that a  
prison guard cursed and assaulted Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the 
imprisoned Egyptian cleric whose followers blew up the World Trade 
Center, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blind sheik was allegedly knocked off the toilet by a prison  
lieutenant who entered his cell early on Aug. 8 at the Federal 
Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., bumping his head and bruising 
his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI was investigating the assault, said spokesman Paul  
McCabe in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old cleric is in declining health with diabetes and  
heart disease, said his attorney, Ramsey Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdel-Rahman was sentenced to life in prison after he was  
convicted in 1995 for conspiracy for allegedly plotting to 
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and approving bombings 
of the United Nations, FBI headquarters in Manhattan and two 
tunnels and a bridge connecting New Jersey to Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake Strikes Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUTTE, Mont. (AP) -- A moderate earthquake struck a sparsely  
populated area of Montana and Idaho today, but there were no 
immediate reports of injuries or significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake with a magnitude of 5.3 happened shortly before 8 a.m.  
near Lima in the extreme southwest corner of Montana, near the 
Idaho line, according to the earthquake studies office at the 
Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology in Butte. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shook the floor of the building,'' said Kathy Cherry, who  
works at Yesterday's Cafe in Dell. ``It kind of startled us.'' 
However, she said there was no damage. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was no report of damage at Yellowstone National Park.  
The epicenter is roughly 70 miles west of the park's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Lay of the state Disaster and Emergency Services office  
said the quake was felt as far away as Billings, roughly 200 miles 
to the east. 
</P>
<P>
	A quake of magnitude 5.0 can cause considerable damage in  
populated areas, though modern building codes can substantially 
reduce the potential for damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty years ago this week, a magnitude 7.5 quake shook the  
Hebgen Lake area east of today's temblor, causing a landslide that 
buried a campground. Twenty-eight people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Bulger Added To FBI's Fugitive List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The FBI has granted reputed mobster James J.  
``Whitey'' Bulger membership in a very exclusive club -- the 
agency's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a public relations ploy designed to get people around the  
country looking for the Boston man who has been on the run since 
1995. Even comic strip gumshoe Dick Tracy will be on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this will do is guarantee that he's on the top list of  
every law enforcement official,'' U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger is accused of extortion and racketeering. The FBI said he  
siphoned money from illegal gambling, loan sharking and drug 
operations in the Boston area. The agency has posted a $250,000 
reward for information leading to his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has said Bulger ran his criminal organization for 30  
years from a Boston neighborhood, but the agency has also conceded 
that it had an improperly cozy relationship with him in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI agent is alleged to have given Bulger and Stephen ``the  
Rifleman'' Flemmi permission to commit crimes in exchange for 
information about other criminals. Lawyers for Flemmi and others 
awaiting trial have asked a federal judge to dismiss the charges 
because they believe the FBI overstepped its legal authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the agency now places Bulger in the same league as  
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the 
bombing of U.S. embassies last year in Africa, and bombing suspect 
Eric Robert Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	``James J. Bulger should be considered armed and extremely  
dangerous,'' said Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of the FBI's 
Boston office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger, 69, is believed to be traveling with his girlfriend,  
Catherine Greig, 48, who is accused of harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger disappeared just before his indictment on racketeering  
charges in January 1995. Flemmi has testified that Bulger fled 
after being told by an FBI agent that they were about to be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also announced this week that fugitives on the 10 Most  
Wanted list would be profiled in Sunday editions of the ``Dick 
Tracy'' comic strip. The strip will have an artist's rendering of 
each fugitive and a short outline of why he is wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said Bulger is the 458th person to be placed on the  
list, which was established in 1950. Of those, 429 have been 
captured or located. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulger fills a spot vacated by Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who  
turned himself in last month and now faces charges he killed seven 
people as he traveled the nation's railways.

<HEADLINE> Saints Extend GM's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The New Orleans Saints believe they are on  
the eve of greatness, and on Friday, owner Tom Benson took steps to 
reward Bill Kuharich, the man he holds responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints signed Kuharich, who has the titles of president,  
general manager and chief operating officer, to a new five-year 
contract that will run through Jan. 31, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to sign Bill to this new contract because it gives  
this team stability across the board at the very top of the 
organization,'' said owner Tom Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich, 46, was hired by Jim Finks in 1986 and was promoted to  
his present role in 1997. At that time, the team was coming off a 
3-13 season in which coach Jim Mora had quit halfway through the 
season. Kuharich's first major move was hiring coach Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Kuharich, the Saints have also locked up Pro Bowl tackle  
William Roaf, defensive end Joe Johnson, linebacker Mark Fields, 
defensive tackle La'Roi Glover and safety Sammy Knight with 
long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Bill has done during his tenure is to try and provide  
stability to the organization by signing head coach Mike Ditka to a 
long-term contract, and by signing our top core players to 
long-term contracts,'' Benson said. ``I feel that is vital in 
today's NFL, as does Bill. By placing him under contract until 
2004, we're ensuring the stability of this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, who extended Ditka's contract last year, locking him in  
through the 2002 season, negotiated the new deal with Kuharich 
before the Saints left training camp in La Crosse, Wis., on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new terms, Kuharich's old contract, which was to  
expire in 2002, was replaced by the new deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to continuing with the positive work we've done  
both on and off the field,'' Kuharich said. ``This will be a great 
opportunity for the Saints organization to see our goal of becoming 
the best franchise in the National Football League come to 
fruition. We aren't satisfied with anything less than the Super 
Bowl and we are continuing to work in that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kuharich served as the team's director of player personnel from  
1986-93 under Finks. In 1994, when Finks died of lung cancer, 
Kuharich was promoted to vice president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the Saints, Kuharich served as assistant general  
manager and director of player personnel for the Philadelphia Stars 
of the USFL.

<HEADLINE> Gerald Ford Honored in Hometown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Former President Ford was honored in  
his hometown with a revival-flavored tribute marking the 25th 
anniversary of the beginning of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the backdrop of a gospel choir, the Rev. Billy Graham  
told a cheering crowd of more than 2,000 on Thursday that Ford's 
courage helped a nation recover from the devastation and 
humiliation after President Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham visited Ford in the White House and offered his support  
when the president issued his pardon of Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Ford came along and healed us under God I believe,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, 85, thanked the crowd and hugged Graham. His eyes, he  
said, are turned on the future, which he believes hold great 
promise -- if America stays spiritually strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cling, I say, to your faith,'' Ford said. ``We are all God's  
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tribute was part of a series of lectures in Ford's hometown  
in his honor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scraps Plane Aid for Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon today scrapped plans to send four  
Air Force transport planes to Turkey to help fight fires triggered 
by the earthquake. But a small U.S. Navy medical team from Naples, 
Italy, arrived on the scene with 27,000 pounds of medical gear and 
surgical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday the Pentagon announced it was sending three Air  
National Guard C-130 planes equipped to fight fires, plus a C-17 
with fire-suppression materials and personnel. Spokesman Kenneth 
Bacon said Turkish officials had told Defense Secretary William 
Cohen on Wednesday that their most immediate need was firefighting 
aid, but today spokesman Bryan Whitman said the planes were no 
longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy medical team is composed of 22 people, including  
doctors and nurses from Naples. They brought tents, water and 
prepackaged meals plus surgical supplies, anesthesia machines and 
intravenous fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, three Navy ships led by the USS Kearsarge continued  
en route to Turkey to stand by in case additional medical 
assistance is requested by the Turkish government. The ships, with 
2,100 Marines and 1,000 sailors aboard, are due off the coast of 
Istanbul on Saturday, Whitman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The ships can provide six operating rooms and five X-ray rooms,  
eight doctors, three dental officers and 88 medical corpsmen. Their 
22 helicopters can provide medical evacuations from the damaged 
areas if Turkey requests it. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the U.S. European Command announced it will send a  
humanitarian assistance survey team of about 20 people Saturday 
from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to assess ways the U.S. military 
might provide more help. The team will include troops trained in 
logistics, construction and radio communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also plans to bring in a water-purification  
unit that can handle emergency water needs for about 10,000 people, 
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 search-and-rescue experts from Fairfax, Va., and  
Miami are stationed in the hard-hit city of Izmit, Leavy said. The 
search teams began round-the-clock shifts early Thursday, Leavy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said U.S.  
searchers rescued two children and an adult Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavy said there is no estimate yet of the cost of U.S. relief  
efforts in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Sign 1998 Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers signed center Simon  
Gagne, their 1998 first-round draft pick, to a three-year contract 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract had not yet been filed with the players' union  
Friday afternoon, but is believed to be worth about $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
	With Quebec of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League last  
season, Gagne tied for the team-high with 50 goals and led the 
squad with 70 assists in 61 games. With the silver-medal winning 
Canadian National Team in the 1999 World Junior Championships, 
Gagne scored a tournament-high seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers general manager Bob Clarke said the 19-year-old Gagne  
would get ``every opportunity to display his skills during training 
camp,'' but would most likely start the 1999 season back at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the potential to play in the NHL in the very near  
future,'' Clarke said. ``He has a chance of making our club this 
season, but we need to be certain that he would get enough ice time 
to further his development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gagne has scored 89 goals and 131 assists over three seasons in  
the Quebec league. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke also said the team hopes to re-sign two free agents, left  
wing Valeri Zelepukin and center Daymond Langkow, next week, but 
has not spoken to the agent for another unsigned player, left wing 
Craig Berube.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Hits Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- An earthquake with a preliminary  
magnitude of 6.7 shook Costa Rica early today, and was felt in 
neighboring Panama and Nicaragua. There were no immediate reports 
of casualties or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake occurred at 4:02 a.m. local time, said Don  
Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information 
Center in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenter was 55 miles south of San Jose, the capital.  
</P>
<P>
	Temblors of magnitude 6 can cause serious damage. Blakeman said  
he had no early reports of damage but ``wouldn't be at all 
surprised considering the magnitude'' if there was some damage. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Costa Rican Red Cross, Mario Vequez, said  
the organization also had no reports of damages or injuries. 
Because of Costa Rica's vulnerability to frequent earthquakes, most 
buildings in the country are no more than three stories high, 
making them less prone to damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at a hotel in Puerto Quepos, on the Pacific coast near  
the quake's epicenter, told the center they felt the temblor but 
suffered no damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake rattled almost the entire country and was felt  
strongly in villages along the Pacific coastline and the major 
cities in the central valley, where most of the 3.5 million people 
of the Central American country live. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was felt throughout western Panama, where people rushed  
out into the streets and authorities reported broken windows, 
cracked walls and other minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Two residential buildings made of concrete were seriously  
damaged in La Mesa de San Cristobal in Panama's western Veraguas 
Province, said Jorge Correa, director of the Panamanian National 
Civil Protection System. 
</P>
<P>
	Only slight tremors from the quake were felt in the southern  
half of Nicaragua, and no damage or casualties were reported.

Francisco Giants on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom took a called third strike in the bottom of the eighth  
inning and briefly argued with home plate umpire Bob Davidson. When 
he reached the dugout, Grissom apparently threw ice from a cooler 
onto the field, and Davidson ejected him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre and Grissom ran out to argue with Davidson, and  
Lefebvre was quickly ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Lefebvre pointed and argued vehemently with Davidson, while  
third-base coach Doug Mansolino, shortstop Jose Valentin and 
catcher Bobby Hughes had to restrain Grissom from approaching 
Davidson. After five minutes, Lefebvre and Grissom left the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee trailed San Francisco 8-3 at the time of the  
ejections.

	The Murray Hill, N.J.-based company does not expect its  
third-quarter and year-end earnings to meet Wall Street analysts'

<HEADLINE> Actress Margot Kidder Gives Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Margot Kidder called on her  
``fellow nuts'' to take control of their treatment for mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress said Thursday at a mental health conference that she  
uses herbs and alternative treatments to control her manic 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to do it -- and I was really out of it, as most of  
you saw on the news,'' she said to laughs. 
</P>
<P>
	She lambasted the use of drug treatments as a ``pharmacological  
lobotomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, Kidder made headlines when she was discovered  
in a delusional state in a Los Angeles neighborhood. Pictures of a 
disheveled and confused Kidder were broadcast around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those National Enquirer reporters, I didn't ask them to  
come. I didn't want them along for the ride,'' said Kidder, who 
played Lois Lane in the ``Superman'' movies.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 136.77 at 11,100.61 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks ended the week with a solid  
rally, although the prospect of an increase in interest rates next 
Tuesday kept many investors out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136.77 Friday to close at  
11,100.61. For the week, the Dow gained 126.96, or 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 rose 13.02 to 1,336.61, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
26.90 to 2,648.33. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors gravitated toward a handful of blue-chip stocks  
Friday, seeking safe bets before Tuesday's meeting of the Federal 
Reserve's policy-making committee. Most economists expect a 
quarter-percentage point increase in short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase on Tuesday would be the Fed's second this year as  
the central bank works to prevent a resurgence of inflation. There 
are fears the Fed also might see a need for a third rate increase 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stocks may be up today, but investors don't see a lot of  
reason to step in front of stocks and build positions ahead of the 
Fed meeting next week,'' said Brian G. Belski, chief investment 
strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co., in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors who did seek out stocks chose big, established  
companies. American Express led the Dow higher, gaining 4 3/8 to 142 7/8. 
Procter &AMP; Gamble gained 3 to 97 1/4, and Alcoa rose 2 1/2 to 67 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a segmented rally in a handful of Dow industrials,''  
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King 
Nussbaum. ``I don't see participation elsewhere in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks benefited as the dollar steadied against foreign  
currencies, helping to calm fears that investors are pulling money 
out of U.S. assets in search of higher returns in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the U.S. currency touched a seven-month low against  
the surging Japanese yen. A weak dollar boosts the costs of 
imported goods, adding to inflationary pressures, and also makes 
U.S. securities less attractive to overseas investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The steady dollar also helped lift bond prices, pushing down  
yields of 30-year Treasurys to 5.98 percent from 6.03 percent late 
Thursday. The yield ended at its lowest point since July 22. 
</P>
<P>
	While analysts said optimism about third-quarter earnings has  
begun lifting the market, investors punished a handful of companies 
that delivered bad news about their profit outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint sank 4 1/16 to 45 after several Wall Street analysts cut  
their earnings estimates for the phone company, saying they do not 
expect Sprint to meet earnings projections for fiscal years 1999 or 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, the business-information services provider,  
fell 5 3/16 to 25 1/2 after saying it will miss profit forecasts in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Volume of all NYSE-listed shares totaled 
791.62 million shares, compared with 815.36 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the low volume, some traders bought heavily as Friday  
was a ``double witching'' day, with stock and index options 
expiring. Hyman said at least some of the market's gains came from 
traders working to balance their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.73 to 626.09, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.72 to 787.79. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.61 to 434.38. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.2 percent. Three  
Japanese banks -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the Industrial Bank of 
Japan Ltd., and Fuji Bank Ltd. -- announced an alliance that would 
create the world's largest banking group, with assets of well over 
$1 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	European indexes also posted solid gains. Germany's DAX index  
rose 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.0 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 closed 1.4 percent higher.

<HEADLINE>  Rockies GM Bob Gebhard Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard  
resigned Friday as the team struggled through the final weeks of 
its second straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies owner Jerry McMorris announced Gebhard's resignation at  
Coors Field while the Rockies played the Cubs in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Geb's decision,'' McMorris said.  
</P>
<P>
	He fended off questions about recent reports that he planned to  
fire Gebhard at the end of the season, saying, ``That would be pure 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Gebhard didn't tell him whether speculation about  
his job contributed to his decision to resign, but added it could 
have been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors have been more intensive as time has gone by and it's  
clearly taken its toll on Geb,'' McMorris said. ``It was difficult 
for everybody here. There are a lot of red eyes in the organization 
today. He's our friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard did not attend the news conference and wasn't available  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's responsibilities are being taken over by Pat  
Daugherty, vice president for scouting; Gary Hughes, vice president 
for player personnel; and Tony Siegal, director for baseball 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Hughes is a candidate to become GM.  
</P>
<P>
	``But we're going to do a thorough search,'' the owner said.  
``There are no external names on the list yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's job has been in jeopardy for a year. Colorado, which  
made the playoffs in 1995 in its third season, finished 77-85 last 
year. The Rockies kept Gebhard but fired manager Don Baylor and 
replaced him with Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel responsible and I say WE. We feel like we're part  
of the reason this happened,'' Leyland said. ``He's a friend. He 
brought me here with high hopes. I talked to him before the game 
and he's going to be OK. He bled Rocky purple-and-black like 
nobody. We let him down. I can only speak for myself but if myself, 
my staff and the players had lived up to Geb's expectations, this 
wouldn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker learned of Gebhard's resignation during the fifth  
inning of an 11-3 win at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the guys in here pretty much loved him. He  
made some people unhappy but he had a job to do,'' Walker said. 
``GMs aren't supposed to make people happy. They've got a job to do 
and they've got to do what's best for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite unfortunately, the last couple years we've made Don  
Baylor look bad and we've made Bob Gebhard look really bad. That's 
not their fault. That's our fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado is last in the NL West at 55-69.  
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, 56, was hired in the fall of 1991, about 18 months  
before the Rockies started play. In the November 1992 expansion 
draft, he selected Vinny Castilla, Curtis Leskanic and Kevin Ritz. 
He also traded for Dante Bichette and signed Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard has made other shrewd deals, notably signing free agent  
Larry Walker before the 1995 season. But he has been criticized for 
other moves, such as the acquisitions of Greg Harris, Darryl Kyle, 
Bill Swift and Bret Saberhagen and the departures of Galarraga, 
Walt Weiss, Andy Ashby, Brad Ausmus, Joe Girardi and Armando 
Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making the playoffs, the Rockies have disappointed fans.  
They finished 83-79 in each of the 1996 and 1997 season before 
dropping below .500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Colorado has the top batting average in the National  
League at .286, it has the worst ERA in the majors at 5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard began his professional baseball career as a pitcher,  
playing 11 years that including stints with the Minnesota Twins and 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player/coach for Montreal from 1974-75, was promoted to  
minor league field director in 1976 and later to pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Minnesota Twins in 1987 as director of player  
personnel, and became a team vice president the following year.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Wins Lawsuit Over Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MARIA, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Jackson won a lawsuit  
claiming he violated a settlement over molestation accusations of a 
13-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	An arbitrator entered a judgment in favor of Jackson on July 26.  
News of the judgment was published in Wednesday's Santa Barbara 
News-Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Molestation allegations against Jackson were investigated by  
authorities in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties, but Jackson 
was not charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Jackson reached an out-of-court settlement in a  
molestation lawsuit stemming from his friendship with the boy. The 
boy's father filed a follow-up lawsuit in 1996, claiming Jackson, 
by calling the allegation ``lies, lies, lies, lies'' in an 
interview, harmed the reputations of the father and son. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement agreement called for binding arbitration of any  
disputes, said an attorney for Jackson, Steve Cochran.

<HEADLINE> Border City Goes All-Spanish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL CENIZO, Texas (AP) -- Flora Barton says her community holds  
its official meetings in Spanish, but it's just as American as 
anyplace else in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only because you speak Spanish doesn't make you less  
American,'' she said. ``That's the way I see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walk into an El Cenizo city meeting and you might wonder what  
side of the Rio Grande you're on. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Ms. Barton and her fellow commissioners in this  
small community along the Mexican border passed an ordinance 
declaring that all city meetings and functions would be held in 
Spanish. They also passed a measure forbidding city employees to 
turn in illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	El Cenizo is believed to be the only U.S. city with an  
all-Spanish policy. English translations of meetings are available 
but must be requested 48 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know of no other city that is presently conducting their  
business in Spanish,'' said Mari Lopez, director of civic education 
for the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed 
Officials. ``They are the trailblazers, if you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	El Cenizo is a largely blue-collar town of 7,800 about 10 miles  
outside Laredo. Its main streets are paved, but dirt roads also run 
through the city. Well-kept, modest houses exist side by side with 
ramshackle homes and buildings. For years, the city had no garbage 
or ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barton estimates that more than 90 percent of El Cenizo's  
residents speak Spanish, though many also speak English. A few 
people, particularly younger ones, speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, meetings have been bilingual, since residents  
routinely asked commissioners to explain things in Spanish, she 
said. But some Spanish-speakers wouldn't attend city meetings 
because of the language barrier and were surprised by 
commissioners' decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent city council meeting, on Aug. 12, was conducted  
in Spanish after passage of the measure. Ordinances and resolutions 
still will be written in English, but the city will translate them 
upon request. 
</P>
<P>
	English First, a Virginia-based organization working to make  
English the official language of the country and to undo bilingual 
education, was troubled by the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Cenizo is the canary in the mine,'' executive director Jim  
Boulet Jr. said Thursday. ``I think this is a wake-up call to this 
country, where in a land where 328 different languages are spoken, 
that we either are going to speak in one language in this nation of 
immigrants or we are going to be speaking in many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the language measure, El Cenizo passed a Safe  
Haven Ordinance, forbidding city employees and officials to ask 
residents whether they are legal immigrants or citizens or to help 
an agency like the Border Patrol and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. City employees who violate the ordinance 
can be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barton said the city will still cooperate with the Border  
Patrol on other matters, such as stopping drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the ordinance is not aimed at making El Cenizo a haven  
for illegal immigrants. She said residents simply resent constantly 
having to prove their status to the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know these people,'' she said. ``They've been here for  
years like us and we don't know (if they're illegal immigrants). 
You could be talking to me in English. That doesn't mean I know 
that you're legal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	INS spokesman Tomas Zuniga warned: ``If there comes a time when  
we come into conflict with the city ordinances, we would pursue the 
matter at that time. I don't foresee it going that far, but the 
extreme level would be where we take action through legal means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jessika Silva, director of the El Cenizo Community Center, which  
offers a basic English class taught by a volunteer, said the 
Spanish-language ordinance reflects a harsh reality for many people 
in El Cenizo: ``They have to work hard all day so they don't have 
time to learn English.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Virginia Salazar, an El Cenizo resident who teaches  
nutrition at a community clinic, believes the ordinance is 
wrong-headed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want our children to get educated,'' she said. ``We want  
them to have better jobs, to progress. It looks like we're going 
backward instead of progressing.''

<HEADLINE> N.M. Teens Protest Hacky Sack Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE (AP) -- Four people who were playing Hacky Sack in this  
city's historic Plaza were arrested for violating a city ordinance 
that forbids the tossing or kicking of objects. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teens and two adults were arrested Thursday for kicking  
around a Hacky Sack, a golf ball-size bean bag that is kicked a few 
feet in the air by players in a circle. The charges stem from the 
same ordinance that forbids bike riding and skateboards. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a complete abuse of power under a tyrannical  
government,'' said Simon Constable, 16, one of those charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they arrested the four after they kept playing  
despite repeated warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were given the opportunity to stop,'' Capt. David Segura  
said. ``They felt it wasn't just and continued as a form of 
protest.''

<HEADLINE>  Rockies GM Bob Gebhard Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard  
resigned Friday as the team struggled through the final weeks of 
its second straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies owner Jerry McMorris announced Gebhard's resignation at  
Coors Field while the Rockies played the Cubs in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Geb's decision,'' McMorris said.  
</P>
<P>
	He fended off questions about recent reports that he planned to  
fire Gebhard at the end of the season, saying, ``That would be pure 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Gebhard didn't tell him whether speculation about  
his job contributed to his decision to resign, but added it could 
have been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors have been more intensive as time has gone by and it's  
clearly taken its toll on Geb,'' McMorris said. ``It was difficult 
for everybody here. There are a lot of red eyes in the organization 
today. He's our friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard did not attend the news conference and wasn't available  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's responsibilities are being taken over by Pat  
Daugherty, vice president for scouting; Gary Hughes, vice president 
for player personnel; and Tony Siegal, director for baseball 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Hughes is a candidate to become GM.  
</P>
<P>
	``But we're going to do a thorough search,'' the owner said.  
``There are no external names on the list yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's job has been in jeopardy for a year. Colorado, which  
made the playoffs in 1995 in its third season, finished 77-85 last 
year. The Rockies kept Gebhard but fired manager Don Baylor and 
replaced him with Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel responsible and I say WE. We feel like we're part  
of the reason this happened,'' Leyland said. ``He's a friend. He 
brought me here with high hopes. I talked to him before the game 
and he's going to be OK. He bled Rocky purple-and-black like 
nobody. We let him down. I can only speak for myself but if myself, 
my staff and the players had lived up to Geb's expectations, this 
wouldn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Walker learned of Gebhard's resignation during the fifth  
inning of an 11-3 win at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most of the guys in here pretty much loved him. He  
made some people unhappy but he had a job to do,'' Walker said. 
``GMs aren't supposed to make people happy. They've got a job to do 
and they've got to do what's best for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite unfortunately, the last couple years we've made Don  
Baylor look bad and we've made Bob Gebhard look really bad. That's 
not their fault. That's our fault. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado is last in the NL West at 55-69.  
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, 56, was hired in the fall of 1991, about 18 months  
before the Rockies started play. In the November 1992 expansion 
draft, he selected Vinny Castilla, Curtis Leskanic and Kevin Ritz. 
He also traded for Dante Bichette and signed Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard has made other shrewd deals, notably signing free agent  
Larry Walker before the 1995 season. But he has been criticized for 
other moves, such as the acquisitions of Greg Harris, Darryl Kyle, 
Bill Swift and Bret Saberhagen and the departures of Galarraga, 
Walt Weiss, Andy Ashby, Brad Ausmus, Joe Girardi and Armando 
Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making the playoffs, the Rockies have disappointed fans.  
They finished 83-79 in each of the 1996 and 1997 season before 
dropping below .500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Colorado has the top batting average in the National  
League at .286, it has the worst ERA in the majors at 5.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard began his professional baseball career as a pitcher,  
playing 11 years that including stints with the Minnesota Twins and 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player/coach for Montreal from 1974-75, was promoted to  
minor league field director in 1976 and later to pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Minnesota Twins in 1987 as director of player  
personnel, and became a team vice president the following year.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Sign Anti-Gay Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republican presidential candidates  
have pledged to oppose allowing gay or lesbian couples to adopt and 
to promote the rights of organizations such as the Boy Scouts to 
exclude homosexuals, a gay rights group said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Campaign said former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
radio host Alan Keyes, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative 
activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and commentator Pat 
Buchanan signed the pledge before last week's Iowa straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Forbes and Hatch campaigns confirmed their  
candidates had signed; Bauer's campaign could not be reached; and 
officials at the Buchanan, Keyes and Quayle organizations said they 
hadn't heard about it, indicating those candidates hadn't signed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former American Red Cross head  
Elizabeth Dole and the GOP front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of 
Texas, did not sign, Human Rights Campaign said in a statement. 
Neither did Democratic candidates Al Gore, the vice president, or 
Bill Bradley, the former U.S. senator from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The pledge was sponsored by more than a dozen groups that  
publicly abhor homosexuality. It has provisions opposing including 
same-sex relationships under the term ``marriage,'' opposing 
discussion of homosexuality in schools, and federal laws to 
specifically protect homosexuals from discrimination.

<HEADLINE> School Reviews Star of David Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) -- A school system will review a decision  
prohibiting a Jewish student from wearing a Star of David necklace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrison County School Board had earlier told high school  
junior Ryan Green that he could not display the Star of David 
because a school policy banned wearing anything visible that could 
be viewed as a gang symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials say some gang symbols incorporate  
six-pointed stars but normally have other elements, such as a 
letter or a pitchfork. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision led to a threatened lawsuit by the American Civil  
Liberties Union and complaints from religious groups and others. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ingebretsen, with the ACLU in Mississippi, said today the  
board's promise to review the decision would not end his plans for 
a lawsuit. He said he intended to ask U.S. District Court to 
instruct the school board to immediately suspend the policy pending 
a decision on a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The school does not ban Christian crosses on jewelry, saying no  
gangs around there use anything similar to it as a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	School board members met privately Thursday with representatives  
from the Jewish community, law enforcement and tourism bureaus. The 
groups later issued a joint statement saying they agreed the 
decision was motivated by safety concerns and not religious 
prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very calm meeting, a very professional meeting,''  
said Luis R. Dorfman, president of the Southeast Region B'nai 
B'rith and past president of Congregation Beth Israel. He said 
everyone at the meeting agreed that the board is sincerely 
interested in safety and ``is not motivated by anti-Semitism or 
religious discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Henry Arledge said the board will likely  
discuss the necklace policy again on Aug. 30 and make a decision on 
Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think the board will just review it on the grounds of  
it being a religious symbol and try to come to some kind of 
resolution to make it acceptable,'' Arledge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingebretsen said the lawsuit would go beyond the Green family.  
</P>
<P>
	``Their son has said he wanted to do this, not only for himself  
but others who might be affected by the policy in the future,'' 
Ingebretsen had said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The deal struck by three Japanese lenders to form  
the world's biggest bank generated optimism Friday that similar 
alliances would follow, thinning the ranks of an overcrowded 
industry that has long lost its knack for turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts approached the alliance cautiously, saying the  
marriage of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan 
Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. could founder if they fail to unload excess 
baggage and depend on sheer size alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one of the main players in the pact, the chairman of  
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, expressed similar fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``If big banks just get together, it's possible they'll become  
too massive, like an elephant, and might topple when the right leg 
gets in the way of the left leg,'' Katsuyuki Sugita said at a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will create a mammoth financial institution with  
complementary strengths -- investment banking for IBJ and retail 
banking for DKB and Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets at the three banks exceed $1.2 trillion, which would make  
the new entity the largest banking group in the world, surpassing 
the $735.3 billion in assets of Germany's Deutsche Bank and the 
$652 billion of Japan's largest bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, 
as well as the largest U.S. bank -- Citigroup, at $668.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the alliance's sheen of boldness, some analysts saw it  
as a defensive move, designed more to survive the new 
government-engineered era of competition in Japan's financial 
markets than to stake a claim in the global arena. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, the number of major Japanese banks has  
dwindled to 17 from 20 with the collapse of a city bank and two 
long-term credit banks. Some experts predict that number soon to 
fall to five or six. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been troubled by huge loans gone sour after  
the speculative lending rush of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and 
the three lenders in Friday's alliance have been hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
	IBJ rose to prominence as a financier for Japan's dramatic  
postwar ascension to global renown, but it has struggled to remain 
relevant as the age of the Japanese industrial bank wanes. The 
bank's main rivals -- Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon 
Credit Bank -- have both collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the banks denied they were getting together merely to  
stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be front-runners in bringing about a revival of  
Japan's financial sector,'' said IBJ head Masao Nishimura. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials went out of their way to welcome the pact,  
even though it still faces questions from Japanese antitrust 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a simple merger, but rather a new, resolute move  
built on lessons learned from the past, and as such I evaluate it 
highly,'' said Hakuo Yanagisawa, head of Japan's Financial 
Reconstruction Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa's comments suggest the government will encourage  
further alliances. And the three-way deal will certainly put 
pressure on other Japanese banks to forge their own mega-mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say several of Japan's major banks -- including Sanwa  
Bank, Sumitomo Trust Bank and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking -- are 
likely to be involved in major banking alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The IBJ-DKB-Fuji alliance) would appear to constitute the  
first shot in a series of like moves,'' said James Fiorillo, a 
banking analyst at ING Barings. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank, which already have an alliance, said  
Friday they are actively pursuing a merger, and the Yomiuri 
newspaper reported that they will set up a holding company in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to cut costs, the bank chiefs promised to reduce  
the combined number of branches by 150 within five years after 
forming a joint holding company by October next year. By the spring 
of 2002, the group will be reorganized according to its financial 
operations, such as consumer banking, corporate banking and 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
	They also plan to cut up to 6,000 jobs, or 17 percent, from  
their combined payroll. The new group is aiming for annual profit 
of nearly $9 billion and to reduce costs by $896 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial experts warned the banks to keep their word.  
</P>
<P>
	``Rapid restructuring is essential to the success of the  
proposed alliance,'' said credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's.

<HEADLINE> CDC Reports on Drug-Resistant Staph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Federal health officials say the deaths of  
four previously healthy children from a drug-resistant bacteria is 
not cause for panic, but they stress that doctors need to be aware 
the bacteria has spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to be able to take this into account when they're  
making decisions about how to test for infections and how to treat 
them,'' said Dr. Timothy Naimi, an epidemiologist with the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	One-quarter of all humans carry staph bacteria, but  
drug-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections were largely 
thought to be confined to hospitals and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths of the children, from diverse ethnic backgrounds and  
environments, indicated healthy people could be susceptible to the 
drug-resistant strain. 
</P>
<P>
	The children, two from Minnesota and two from North Dakota,  
ranged in age from 1 to 13. Two were white, one was black and one 
was American Indian. Their deaths, between 1997 and 1999, were 
documented in a report released by the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hundred people have become ill in the past two years after  
contracting staph infections resistant to penicillin and 
cephalosporin, drugs from the most common class of antibiotics, the 
CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kirk Smith of the Minnesota Department of Health said cases  
had been reported in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not in any way a widespread epidemic,'' Naimi said  
Friday. ``The risk to any individual of getting an infection from 
staph aureus is very low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staph germs are passed through skin-to-skin contact but  
generally don't become a problem unless they enter the body through 
a cut or abrasion. Good hygiene such as frequent hand-washing can 
minimize the chance of infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The four children who died were given the right antibiotics to  
treat their symptoms, but the doctors who treated them were not 
aware the drug-resistant strain had spread into the general 
population, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a former Minnesota state 
epidemiologist involved in the CDC study. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason the bacteria may have become resistant to some drugs  
is the overuse of antibiotics, said North Dakota state 
epidemiologist Larry Shireley. 
</P>
<P>
	``As physicians in the medical community, we need to look at how  
we are prescribing drugs, to make sure that we are prescribing 
drugs appropriately and look at the drug resistance pattern when we 
treat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Citadel's Faulkner Finishes College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) --Shannon Faulkner, who fought a legal battle  
to open the all-male military academy The Citadel to women, has 
graduated from a college 200 miles across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Faulkner earned a bachelor's degree in secondary education  
of English this month at Anderson College, one of two schools she 
attended after dropping out of The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Faulkner made national headlines when she sued The Citadel  
in 1993 seeking admission. She became the first woman day student 
at the state-run military school in Charleston in January 1994, 
attending classes under a federal court order. 
</P>
<P>
	She started classes and training in August 1995, but left after  
six days, citing the pressure of her long struggle and the 
isolation of being the only female cadet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Faulkner attended Furman University in Greenville in 1996  
and 1997 before going to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Citadel dropped its all-male admissions policy in 1996,  
following a U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the all-male 
policy at the Virginia Military Institute.

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Takes Lead With 49th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa took over the major league home run  
lead from Mark McGwire on Friday, hitting his 48th and 49th homers 
off Colorado's Pedro Astacio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit a solo shot in the third to tie McGwire and then passed  
him with another solo drive in the sixth. He has three homers this 
season off Astacio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has hit 151 homers since the start of the 1997 season. He  
is the fifth player in major league history to reach 150 homers 
during a three-year span, joining McGwire, Babe Ruth, Ken Griffey 
Jr., and Jimmie Foxx. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is ahead of his 66-homer pace of a year ago when he fell  
four short of McGwire. He didn't hit his 49th homer last season 
until the 128th game. Friday's game was the Cubs' 120th this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's first homer followed one by Mark Grace, the fifth time  
this season the Cubs have homered back-to-back.

	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Some form of blood testing will be  
introduced at next year's Sydney Olympics in a bid to improve 
detection of performance-enhancing drugs, the IOC announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move to step up the fight against drugs, the  
International Olympic Committee affirmed that a world anti-doping 
agency will definitely be set up by the end of this year and will 
be operational for the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls for blood testing at the Olympics have mounted in the wake  
of a spate of high-profile drug scandals in track and field and 
other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Several performance-enhancing drugs of choice, such as human  
growth hormone and EPO (erythropoietin), cannot be detected in 
standard urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug issue was a centerpiece of an IOC executive board  
meeting on the eve of the World Athletics Championships opening 
Saturday in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be blood testing in Sydney, if not for doping  
control, at least for scientific research,'' IOC spokesman Franklin 
Servan-Schreiber said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test works and we have a procedure,'' he said, noting that  
blood tests were carried out at the world short-course swimming 
championships in Hong Kong earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to have a foolproof test that could be used as part  
of the official doping control procedures during the Sydney Games. 
Normally, all medalists, as well as other athletes chosen at 
random, are tested during the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Servan-Schreiber said blood tests could also be implemented in  
out-of-competition controls on the eve of the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can find a test that is 100 percent reliable and will  
not jeopardize the reputation of athletes or cause legal problems 
for the federations, we would have no problem'' using it for 
official controls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the test is not perfected yet, athletes will be asked to  
undergo ``voluntary'' blood testing for research purposes. The test 
results would be unofficial, and positive tests would not be 
sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also declared its commitment to the establishment of an  
international anti-doping agency. The project was approved in 
February at a world drug summit in Lausanne, Switzerland, but the 
location of the agency and other details still have not been 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said the agency, which would coordinate drug testing  
around the world, would be in place by the end of the year and be 
up and running by the Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has been at odds with European governments over the  
status and location of the agency. Critics say the agency should be 
completely independent of the IOC and should not be based in 
Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	A special IOC panel is scheduled to meet Sept. 10 to finalize  
arrangements for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is putting up $25 million to set up the agency, but  
expects governments and other organizations to contribute as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the IOC approved the allocation of $2 million for  
further anti-doping research, particularly for developing reliable 
tests for EPO and human growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also backed the anti-doping efforts of the International  
Amateur Athletic federation, the world governing body of track and 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport has been rocked by recent positive drug cases  
involving such high-profile athletes as Javier Sotomayor, Linford 
Christie and Merlene Ottey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why these cases have led to criticism of  
the sport,'' IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said. 
``Personally, I believe athletics deserves to be congratulated 
because it is fighting doping with facts, not just words. The IAAF 
should be an example to other federations.''

<HEADLINE> NBC May Buy Stake in Paxson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is reportedly negotiating a deal to buy part  
of Paxson Communications Corp., which owns or operates 73 
television stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks focus on NBC buying 32 percent of Paxson, the Wall  
Street Journal reported Friday, citing unidentified sources 
familiar with the negotiations. The move would be worth more than 
$300 million at current stock values. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for NBC declined to comment Friday when contacted  
by The Associated Press. Paxson officials did not immediately 
return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Paxson said it had hired Salomon Smith Barney to  
explore its options following a landmark Federal Communications 
Commission decision that allows a single company to own more than 
one TV station in a local market. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision was expected to ignite a flurry of dealmaking as  
powerful TV networks make acquisitions, seeking greater dominance 
over major cities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched last year, Paxson's PAX TV has a presence in the  
nation's top 20 markets but has been struggling to find an audience 
for its rerun-heavy programming, often attracting less than 1 
million of the 100 million households it reaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson had lobbied to relax the ownership rules saying that they  
were needed for broadcasters who face new competition from cable 
stations, satellite TV operators and the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Geena Davis Seeks Olympic Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Geena Davis already has an Oscar. Now  
she's shooting for a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old actress, who took up archery two years ago after  
watching the Olympics on television, is ranked 22nd in the nation 
and is competing this weekend to qualify for the next Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned as an adult that I'm fairly athletic,'' Davis  
said Friday, the day before the semifinals of the U.S. Olympic 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of ``Thelma and Louise'' and ``The Accidental Tourist''  
-- for which she won an Oscar in 1988 -- has surprised archers with 
her quick rise in a sport that doesn't normally capture the kind of 
attention it got Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Camera crews surrounded Davis, wearing a floppy blue hat and  
sunglasses, as she calmly fired off 60 arrows in Brookdale Park to 
a target 70 meters away. Her coach, Don Rabska, said she had to 
work to distinguish the clicking sound her bow made from the 
clicking cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she would make the team, it would be unbelievable for our  
sport,'' said Denise Parker, the top-ranked woman in the nation. 
``The question is, does she want to be in the spotlight in this 
environment?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis had kept her hobby a secret from Hollywood and the public  
for two years, despite winning a tournament or two, until she 
finished 29th out of 300 women in Ohio to qualify for the Olympic 
semifinals. Four of the 32 semifinalists dropped out, making Davis 
one of 28 competing Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That number will drop by Monday to eight, who will compete next  
month in California for three team spots and one alternate spot at 
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many called Davis' chances slim at best to become an Olympian,  
saying she is competing against higher-ranked archers who have 
trained more than twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justin Huish, a 1996 Olympic gold medalist, said Friday, ``I  
wouldn't be surprised one bit if Geena Davis made the Olympic 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huish, 24, said he shot with Davis last week in a private yard  
in the San Fernando Valley and ``a couple of times, she shot better 
than me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis first learned she had shooting ability while going through  
FBI training to shoot handguns for the 1996 film ``The Long Kiss 
Goodnight,'' said Rabska. But she had no interest in firing 
handguns in her backyard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	She wanted to try shooting with a bow and arrow after watching  
Huish win two gold medals at the Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made it look so elegant and interesting,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She met with Huish, who thought initially that Davis ``wanted to  
shoot archery just as a stress reliever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told him she wanted to go to the Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
	Rabska, an archer for more than 30 years, said Davis has  
mastered a concentration during her acting career that helps her as 
an archer. Archery, he said, is all about finesse and mental 
toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has been practicing five hours a day, shooting about 300  
arrows. She had a target range set up on the set of her latest 
film, ``Stuart Little.'' She also goes to the gym five days a week 
to work out on the treadmill and lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's shooting well right now, better than I've ever seen  
her,'' said Rabska. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Davis: ``I don't feel that I've yet discovered how good I  
can get.''

<HEADLINE> Quantum Corp. To Cut 800 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILPITAS, Calif. (AP) -- Computer disk drive and storage drive  
maker Quantum Corp. is eliminating 800 jobs -- about 13 percent of 
its work force -- to better compete in the rapidly growing low-cost 
computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	Quantum will record a special charge of $50 million for its  
second quarter ending Sept. 26 as part of a restructuring of its

<HEADLINE> Report: Agent Orange in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Secret U.S. tests of Agent Orange in Panama during  
the Vietnam War may have exposed many residents and military 
personnel to potentially lethal chemicals, The Dallas Morning News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of barrels of the toxic herbicide were shipped to  
Panama during the 1960s and 1970s, then sprayed on jungles in an 
effort to simulate the battlefield conditions of Southeast Asia, 
the newspaper reported, citing documents and witness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Panamanians and Americans may have been exposed.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Southern Command, the operational authority in Panama,  
said it was unaware of any tests involving Agent Orange there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line on our side is that we have no knowledge that  
it happened,'' said Raul Duany, a Southern Command spokesman. ``We 
have no evidence that Agent Orange was actually sprayed in 
Panama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it was, he said, ``it wouldn't pose a threat today because it  
should have dissipated by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defoliant contains the highly toxic chemical dioxin.  
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent  
Orange, which was sprayed by U.S. planes during a 10-year period to 
strip away cover from North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops and 
their convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	One American veteran who served in Panama from 1968 to 1971 told  
the Morning News he witnessed the spraying at a test site close to 
the Panama Canal and near a popular beach, a recreation center, a 
sporting club and a lake that supplied Panama City's drinking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders in Panama have long suspected that lethal  
chemical weapons and herbicides were used there. The country is 
already seeking as much as $500 million from the U.S. military in 
damages and cleanup costs following years of ammunition and weapons 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of toxic herbicides has been identified by the Department of  
Veterans Affairs as a factor in the deaths of at least three U.S. 
servicemen stationed in Panama in the 1960s and 1970s, said Bill 
Russo, an attorney for the Washington-based Vietnam Veterans of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the servicemen are receiving service-related  
benefits as a result of their husbands' exposure, the newspaper 
said.

<HEADLINE> Youth Triumphs in U.S. Amateur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Tied after 18, they were about to  
tee off on the first of five sudden-death holes when Bryce Molder 
turned to James Oh as an evening chill descended on the U.S. 
Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	With a quarterfinal spot on the line, Molder asked his opponent:  
``Are you having fun yet?'' Oh responded with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Youth defeated experience in Thursday's two rounds of match  
play, with two 17-year-olds and six college students reaching the 
quarterfinals. No player older than 22 survived the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last and most dramatic match of the day, Oh made a  
10-foot birdie putt on the fifth extra hole to defeat Molder -- who 
also had gone into overtime while winning his second-round match 
earlier Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, 17, trailed Molder by two holes on the 15th. But he won that  
hole and evened the match on the 18th, sending the golfers back to 
the start of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long day for me,'' Oh said. ``I wasn't too nervous. I  
don't really feel much pressure here because I'm here to learn. I'm 
still young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molder, 20, a Georgia Tech junior who shot a career-best round  
of 60 recently with President Clinton in Arkansas, rallied from a 
three-hole deficit in Thursday's second round to defeat Gary 
Mankulish Jr. on the third extra hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Down the stretch, I got to the point I was almost not nervous  
out there,'' Molder said. ``I was having fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh's next opponent was to be another 17-year-old golfer. Sung  
Yoon Kim, a high school junior from Seoul, South Korea, reached the 
quarterfinals by rallying from a 3-stroke deficit to defeat 
Canada's David Hearn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, at 17 years and 3 months, is 42 days younger than Oh. The  
youngest player to win the Amateur was Tiger Woods, who captured 
the first of three consecutive titles in 1994 at 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal was to get into the final eight,'' Kim said through an  
interpreter. ``If I do anything beyond this, I'll be really 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Oh and Kim in the quarterfinals today were James  
Driscoll, 21, a senior at Virginia; David Gossett, 20, a sophomore 
at Texas; Ben Curtis, 22, a senior at Kent State; Andrew Sanders, 
20, a junior at Houston; Hunter Haas, 22, a senior at Oklahoma; and 
Charlie Woerner, 22, a senior at Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans of the field in the third round were Bob Kearney,  
43, of Houston and Richard Smith, 41, of Dresden, Tenn. Kearney won 
his second-round match against John Pate, older brother of PGA 
player Steve Pate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Haas defeated Kearney 2 and 1 in the third round, while  
Smith lost 5 and 4 to Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Vanier, 48, who was trying to become the oldest Amateur  
champion, three-putted the 18th hole to lose his second-round match 
to Robert Oppenheim, 19, a sophomore at Rollins College. Oppenheim 
lost to Woerner in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Team McCumber'' also failed to reach the third round.  
</P>
<P>
	Josh McCumber, the nephew of PGA player Mark McCumber, lost six  
of the first seven holes and was ousted 4 and 2 by SMU sophomore 
Nicholas Loar, who chipped in on the 16th to end that second-round 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	McCumber's caddy throughout the championship was his wife,  
Tracey. McCumber proposed on a golf course last November, and they 
were married 3 1/2 months ago.

<HEADLINE> N. Illinois' Lux Gets Extra Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DE KALB, Ill. (AP) -- Northern Illinois forward T.J. Lux, the  
leading active career rebounder in Division I, was granted another 
year of eligibility by NCAA, the school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lux was granted a fifth year to play basketball at the  
Mid-American Conference school for ``reasons of medical hardship.'' 
The 6-foot-9, 245-pound Lux was sidelined with severe shin splints 
after five games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ecstatic, specifically for T.J., our program and our  
fans,'' coach Brian Hammel said in a statement. ``With a strong 
summer of rehab and rest, T.J. is anxious to have a sensational 
senior year and lead us into the postseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lux has 860 rebounds in his career, a 9.77 average. In 88 games,  
he has 47 double-doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Lux graduated last May and began postgraduate work this summer  
in Mathematics Education.

<HEADLINE> Schools Seek Funds for Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- An Anaheim school board has approved a  
resolution to bill foreign countries for the cost of educating 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members of the Anaheim Union High School District voted  
4-1 to approve the measure during a raucous three-hour meeting 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere along the line, somebody has to stand up to the  
federal and state government,'' Board Trustee Robert Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution asks the Immigration and Naturalization Service  
to count the number of illegal immigrants who attend district 
schools and determine their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
	It also demands the federal government reimburse the district  
for the cost of educating the immigrants and negotiate with their 
native countries to recover the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has said it is unlikely the resolution will be enforced.  
</P>
<P>
	The sole dissenter, E.L. ``Slim'' Terrell, said he opposed the  
measure ``100 percent'' and chided his colleagues for writing and 
supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come up with something that was this divisive was a little  
thoughtless of us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS estimates 2 million of the nation's 3.9 million illegal  
immigrants live in California. Although there are no statistics on 
the number of those attending public schools, officials estimate 
that up to one in six California students are illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Educators say the Anaheim resolution, if successful, could  
inspire other districts to try to recover costs of educating 
illegal immigrants and expand programs that would benefit all 
students at a time when schools are overcrowded and financially 
burdened. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts in Florida, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and  
Washington state are considering comparable measures. Similar 
resolutions have failed in some Texas districts.

<HEADLINE> 3 Hurt in Hot Air Balloon Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A downdraft slammed a hot air balloon into the  
ground, scattering sightseeing passengers as it bounced into a 
highway median and then into the desert. Three people were injured, 
one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was blood and screaming,'' passenger Janet Barton said.  
``It was quite frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Long, president of Hot Air Expeditions, which owns the  
balloon, said the pilot and 12 passengers -- including tourists from 
England -- were on an hour-long flight north of Phoenix on Thursday. 
The balloon was suddenly forced down by windy ``microburst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Department Capt. Doug Mummert said the balloon hit a  
highway median and then bounded over one of the lanes and across 
100 feet of desert. 
</P>
<P>
	``People either bounced out or were thrown out of the gondola,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long said it was the first flight injury in the company's  
11-year history. He said pilot William Swanson made a good landing, 
given the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rain, wind, lightning and dark clouds in the area, Long  
said Swanson and two of the company's other pilots took balloons up 
after checking with weather officials. Two balloons landed when 
winds got stronger, but Swanson couldn't find an open area to land. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously injured was Helen Bermener, 51, who was in  
serious condition at a hospital with head, ankle and wrist trauma.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jr. No Rookie to Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. hopes all the notes  
he's been taking on driving at Michigan Speedway pay off in 
Sunday's Pepsi 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr., son of the seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup  
champion, will start from the 17th position after turning in a 
qualifying lap Friday of 186.042 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	And he beat his dad in the process. Dale Sr. could do no better  
than 35th in qualifying with a lap of 183.763 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	While it will be his first Winston Cup start on the 2-mile  
superspeedway, Earnhardt Jr. competed in a NASCAR Busch Series race 
in August 1998 and an International Race of Champions event this 
June. In the latter race, he finished second to his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tested the Winston Cup car last week at Michigan,''  
Earnhardt Jr. said. ``I think some of what we learned will help us 
with the Busch car and I, of course, got a few lessons from my dad 
when we ran the IROC race here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the younger Earnhardt's third Winston Cup start this  
season. He also ran at the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., and 
the Jiffy Lube 300 at Loudon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the first round (qualifying), and I was worried at the  
start of the year about just making the races,'' Earnhardt said. 
``We made the first rounds of my first three races and that gives 
us something to work on next year. ``This is all about taking notes 
and getting experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GO AHEAD, PLEASE*: Bill Elliott thinks the only time that being  
first is worth it is at the end of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's feelings were reinforced after luck of the draw put  
him first on the track for qualifying. He turned in a lap of 
186.384 mph. However, the track conditions improved throughout the 
session and so did other drivers' speeds. As a result, Elliott 
ended up with the 14th-best speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to be the first guy out,'' Elliott said. ``You don't  
really know where you stand because it seems like so much has 
changed when we practiced last. The Busch cars went out there and 
then we ran again and you don't really know where you're at when

	Elliott has won seven times at Michigan, the last time in 1989.  
In the Kmart 400 in June, he qualified fifth but finished 41st on 
race day after an oil fitting broke on his McDonald's Ford early in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good run here in the spring,'' Elliott said. ``We've  
got to just keep digging. The biggest thing is we're trying to turn 
this deal around. If we keep nibbling at it week in and week out, 
we'll be all right.''

	 *PARTING OF WAYS*: Team SABCO and Joe Nemechek will be parting  
ways at the end of the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an extremely difficult decision for the both of us,  
but we have been discussing it for a while,'' team owner Felix 
Sabates said. ``I've developed a very close relationship with Joe, 
(his wife) Andrea and his mom and dad throughout our three years 
together. But Joe and I both felt that a fresh start would be best 
for us all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek started with Team SABCO in 1997. Since then, he's had  
three pole positions and finished in the top 10 eight times. His 
best and only top-10 finish this season was sixth at the Pontiac 
Excitement 400 in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the equipment and we've got the communication,''  
Nemechek said. ``We've just been unable to make it work in our 
situation.''

	Marlin, who finished 33rd, hit Little, who was 14th, while the  
cars were entering pit lane. Marlin bumped Little's rear bumper 
several times with his Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR said Marlin was cited for ``actions detrimental to auto  
racing.''

<HEADLINE> Rain Makes Grains, Soybeans Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after some private forecasters 
predicted a greater possibility of rain in some dry growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
        Some meteorologists were calling for increased rainfall in  
the next few days across the Midwest, while a tropical storm in the 
Gulf of Mexico opened the possibility for rain in the U.S. Delta. 
</P>
<P>
        Investors ignored reports out of a crop tour of Midwestern  
farms, which indicated yields are likely to be far lower than current 
U.S. Agriculture Department estimates. Market participants said those 
reports already had been factored into prices. 
</P>
<P>
        Analysts said the latest forecasts gave the market a chance  
to take a rest from strong gains made earlier this week. Still, the 
National Weather Service's 10-day forecast, released after trading 
had ended, called for only normal to below-normal precipitation in 
major growing states. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.86 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; December 
oats rose 1/4 cent to $1.14 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5 
cents to $4.72 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .20 cent to 65.45 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle was unchanged at 78.17 cents a pound; October lean hogs 
rose 1.45 cents to 44.65 cents a pound; February pork bellies rose 
1.17 cents to 55.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Receiver Wiggins Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska senior receiver Shevin Wiggins was  
arrested and charged Friday with sexual assault of a child for 
allegedly fondling two 14-year-old girls, Lancaster County Attorney 
Gary Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, 24, and another man, Floyd Brown, 22, are accused of  
touching the girls between July 25 and July 26, at a Lincoln home. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins and Brown both were arraigned in Lancaster County Court,  
where their bonds were set at $10,000. Wiggins appeared voluntarily 
with his attorney, while Brown was arrested at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, who was granted a sixth year of eligibility by the NCAA  
in April, remained in jail late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska coach Frank Solich said Wiggins will be suspended from  
the team until the facts of the case are clear. Solich said Wiggins 
will not be allowed to practice or play in any games until the 
suspension is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate certainly for Shevin and all of us,'' Solich  
said Friday. His arrest ``shocked us all, but we'll just have to 
move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexual assault of a child is a felony punishable up to 5 years  
in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, who is also a kick returner, was recruited in 1994 but  
sat out while gaining academic eligibility. He redshirted in 1995 
and played the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He is best known for when his kicked ball at the goal line fell  
into the arms of teammate Matt Davison as the Cornhuskers rallied 
to beat Missouri in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Murderer Caught in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENDENHALL, Pa. (AP) -- Norman Johnston, who killed four  
teen-agers to cover up a family burglary ring, was captured Friday 
wet, scratched and exhausted in the same county where he and his 
brothers committed their infamous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston stepped out of the woods around dawn and ran right into  
state troopers who were investigating a 911 call from a secluded 
home in Medenhall, about 130 miles from the State Correctional 
Institution at Huntingdon where Johnston escaped Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers and tracking dogs had been searching for Johnston for  
19 days, chasing him through Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up returning to Chester County, the area where he and  
two brothers stole hundreds of trucks, cars and farm equipment in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was kind of surprised to see us,'' said Trooper  
Brian Barber. ``He was tired. He knew it was daylight. He knew he 
didn't have any place left to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, was sentenced to life in 1980 along with older  
brothers Bruce and David for killing four boys involved in their 
burglary ring. The men feared the teen-agers would tell police 
about their activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Johnston also was convicted of killing his son's  
girlfriend and trying to kill his son, who testified against his 
father and uncles' ring that ran for 20 years and involved 40 or 
more people. The 1978 slayings were portrayed in the film ``At 
Close Range'' starring Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	Many people in the area were on edge when Johnston escaped,  
worried he may return to a county that was glad to be rid of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they said Norman Johnston was out and about, I just went  
home and locked my doors,'' said Ed Scheffler of Kennett Square, a 
town just outside Philadelphia and 200 miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Townspeople in Mendenhall were relieved.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's caught. He needed catching,'' said Roland  
Norman, behind the counter at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston had cut his way through a cell window and two fences to  
escape. An elaborate dummy left in his bunk gave him as much as a 
10-hour head start. 
</P>
<P>
	While on the run, he was seen several times in stolen cars in  
Pennsylvania and nearby border towns in Maryland and Delaware. Two 
park rangers wrestled with him at Nottingham County Park four days 
after his escape, but he slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later spotted by an unarmed University of Delaware  
security officer, who couldn't hold him. 
</P>
<P>
	Police began closing in on Johnston Thursday night after he  
crashed a stolen car during a chase and fled into the woods. More 
than 100 officers and tracking dogs were scouring southeastern 
Chester County early Friday when the 911 call came in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Mercurio and his fiancee, Ellen Baldo, had seen officers  
searching the woods around their home as they ate breakfast that 
morning. When they heard a noise on their deck, like someone had 
knocked something over, they called police. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were searching behind the house when the couple  
spotted Johnston walking from the woods and down their gravel 
driveway. They yelled to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston attempted to bolt through the bushes but slammed into a  
wooden fence. He began yelling ``I'm not armed! I'm not armed!'' as 
troopers grabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't believe it was him,'' said Trooper Glenn Blue, one  
of three officers who found Johnston. ``He pretty much gave up. He 
didn't put up a fight and we're very happy about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was scruffy, wet and unarmed when he was taken into  
custody about 5:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was led out of the Avondale state police barracks Friday  
morning to be taken back to prison, Johnston shook his head and 
refused to answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	State police Capt. Henry Oleyniczak said troopers had questioned  
him about why he stayed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it was hard for him to get out of the area,''  
Oleyniczak said. ``He felt like the heat was on and he couldn't get 
out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked him, 'Was it worth it?' and he said, 'Not for 20  
days.'''

<HEADLINE> Multiple Killer Caught in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENDENHALL, Pa. (AP) -- Luck ran out this morning for escaped  
murderer Norman Johnston, who was captured not far from his 
hometown after a manhunt that lasted nearly three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see the smile on my face, that says it all,'' state police  
Capt. Henry Oleyniczak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police focused on the area Thursday night after spotting a car  
stolen in Newark, Del., where Johnston had been sighted and nearly 
captured. The driver fled after crashing the car, but he was 
tracked down by authorities using helicopters and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, was captured in a shed without a struggle,  
Oleyniczak said. He was not armed. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston escaped Aug. 2 after cutting his way through a cell  
window at a maximum-security prison in Huntingdon, nearly 200 miles 
from here in western Pennsylvania. After his escape, authorities 
here alerted dozens of residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Mendenhall is only a few miles from Johnston's hometown of  
Kennett Square, just outside Philadelphia. Some of his relatives 
still live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sightings were made by police, who even struggled with  
Johnston a couple of times. He fought them off and ran away. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston was convicted in 1980 of killing four teen-agers to  
cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston and his two older brothers, Bruce Sr. and David, were  
sentenced to life terms for the slayings in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Johnston Sr. also was convicted of killing his son's  
girlfriend and trying to kill his son, Bruce Jr., who later gave 
incriminating testimony against his father and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
	The burglary ring included more than 40 people and operated for  
nearly 20 years. The gang was responsible for stealing hundreds of 
trucks, cars and farm equipment in Delaware, Maryland and 
Pennsylvania. At least 25 other people were convicted of burglary 
and fencing charges until the gang's 1987 demise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Johnston brothers have continued to appeal their murder  
convictions, and Norman Johnston was to have a hearing later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, authorities also captured a murderer and an  
arsonist who escaped from another state prison this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McCloskey and Anthony Yang broke out of the  
medium-security state prison Monday in Dallas, 100 miles northwest 
of Philadelphia. They were arrested together Thursday night near 
Wyoming, less than 10 miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
	McCloskey was convicted of shooting a 70-year-old man to death  
during a lunchtime robbery of a Philadelphia bar in 1985. Yang 
admitted setting 10 fires in 1987 that caused $3 million in damage.

<HEADLINE> Body Not Found, Man Still Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- A convicted child molester has been found  
guilty of killing an 11-year-old girl who lived across the street 
and whose body was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Bell, 31, was convicted of murder Friday after a four-day  
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell and 11-year-old Jeanna North lived across the same Fargo  
street when the girl disappeared. The trial was moved to Mandan, 
about 200 miles away, because of pretrial publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanna North disappeared near her home in Fargo on June 28,  
1993. She was last seen inline skating. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors relied on the testimony of police detectives who  
said Bell told them he struck the girl and dumped her body into the 
Sheyenne River near Fargo. The prosecutors had no physical evidence 
that Bell had killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	A sentencing date was not immediately set. Defense attorney  
Steve Mottinger promised an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Birch Burdick, the Cass County state's attorney, said he was  
inclined to ask the judge to impose the maximum sentence of life in 
prison without a chance at parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's father, John North, said he hoped Bell would get  
that sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he does come out again, he'll do it again,'' he said.  
``He's a sex offender, he's a child molester, and he doesn't 
deserve to be out in society. He should spend the rest of his life 
in prison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is already serving a 40-year prison sentence, with 10 years  
suspended, for molesting two young girls.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Aide Accused of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- An associate of Jack Kevorkian has been  
charged with first-degree murder, accused of giving a drug overdose 
to a multiple sclerosis patient whose death once was blamed on 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Georges Reding was charged Thursday with the death of Donna  
Brennan, 54, of Rio Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding, a 74-year-old retired psychiatrist, also was indicted on  
charges of practicing medicine without a license, trafficking in a 
controlled substance and evidence tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy showed Ms. Brennan died in 1998 from a lethal dose of  
a sedative. Authorities said telephone and credit card records, 
along with a witness, place Reding at Brennan's house around the 
time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole case began because the family asked the Rio Rancho  
Department of Public Safety to look into the circumstances 
surrounding Donna Brennan's death,'' District Attorney Mike Runnels 
said. ``It was their unease that initiated the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reding did not return a message left Thursday at his home in  
Galesburg, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Schwartz, Reding's attorney, has said Ms. Brennan  
contacted the psychiatrist for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indictment is absolutely ridiculous. There's no way  
they're ever going to show that Dr. Reding murdered anybody,'' 
Schwartz said. ``We're dealing with a woman who was very severely 
ill, who had expressed an interest in ending her suffering in the 
only way it could be ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way they can show she didn't end her own life.''  
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide is a felony in New Mexico, punishable by up to  
18 months in prison. But the grand jury chose to indict Reding on a 
charge of first-degree murder, which carries a potential life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	If the case goes to trial, the indictment says jurors ``may be  
instructed to consider murder in the second degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree  
murder and drug delivery in the lethal injection of a patient with 
Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian, 71, says he has attended more than 
130 suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Reding and Kevorkian were charged in connection with  
three assisted suicides in Oakland County, Mich. A prosecutor later 
dropped all the charges, saying there was insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years later, Reding and Kevorkian were arrested on  
charges they resisted arrested and interfered with police while 
dropping a body off at a Royal Oak, Mich., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Reding was acquitted; Kevorkian was convicted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Scandal Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A top-level parliamentary committee  
demanded Friday that Indonesia's finance minister and bank 
restructuring agency chief be dismissed over a widening bank 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be fired,'' said Ekki Syachruddin, a deputy of  
the ruling Golkar Party, referring to Finance Minister Bambang 
Subianto and Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency Chairman Glenn 
Yusuf. 
</P>
<P>
	Syachruddin said the committee looking into the ballooning Bank  
Bali scandal had not yet decided whether Indonesia's central bank 
governor, Sjahril Sabirin, should also resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, police said they had named a key figure in Golkar  
as a suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The affair broke after an audit into Bank Bali found its  
directors had funneled $80 million in government bailout money to 
PT Era Giat Prima, a little-known finance and debt-collection 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	PT Era is controlled by a senior Golkar official. Opponents of  
Golkar allege the money was to bankroll a bid by President B.J. 
Habibie to retain the presidency when an electoral college selects 
a head of state in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition politicians have implicated several members of  
Indonesia's ruling elite in the scandal, including some Cabinet 
ministers and one of Habibie's brothers. Golkar leaders have denied 
any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Syachruddin's committee threatened to take the unprecedented  
step of summoning Habibie to testify on the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar said investigators  
have requested presidential approval to interrogate Setya Novanto, 
Golkar's deputy treasurer. Novanto and Bank Bali's president 
director, Rudy Ramly, were among five people named Friday as 
suspects in the case, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chief Gen. Roesmanhadi told the Suara Pembaruan daily  
that police might begin questioning Cabinet ministers as well as 
the chairman of the presidential advisory council about their 
alleged involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a massive  
economic plan for the world's fourth-most populous nation, has 
demanded that wrongdoers in the case be brought to justice. The IMF 
fears the scandal could damage attempts to reform Indonesia's 
crippled economy, long riddled by corruption.

<HEADLINE> Study: Women Unfazed by Separation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Absence really could make a man's heart grow  
fonder, but it doesn't appear to make his sweetheart any more 
interested in sex with him, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey of people on and around college campuses,  
researchers found that the more time spent apart after sex, the 
more eager men were to copulate with their lovers again. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were generally unaffected by separation, according to the  
study led by Todd K. Shackelford, an assistant professor of 
psychology at Florida Atlantic University. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't matter how much time had lapsed since the couple last  
had sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't take it personally, guys. The researchers propose in a  
paper presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American 
Psychological Association that you're unwittingly responding to an 
urge from way back in human evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Basically, the researchers suggest, the urge that drives a man  
to want sex after separation is the thought that another man might 
have gotten there first and beat out his sperm in the race to 
fertilize his partner's egg. After all, in the view of evolutionary 
biology, passing on genes to the next generation is what sex is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	The notion of ``sperm competition'' within a female has been  
well-studied in non-humans, but whether it significantly shapes 
sexual behavior in people is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackelford acknowledged the measured effect of time apart on  
men's attitudes about sex is small. Many other factors could effect 
how interested a man is in sex on a given day. The results of the 
study are preliminary and can suggest only that time apart affected 
men's attitudes, because they come from a one-time survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers gave anonymous one-time questionnaires to 388  
women and 304 men who said they were in committed sexual 
relationships. The participants, in their mid-20s on average, were 
recruited at universities and nearby public areas in Texas, Florida 
and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants rated their current interest in their partner on a  
10-point scale. Results suggest that for every 100 hours of time 
apart since the last time they had sex with their partner, men's 
interest in doing it again rose an average of about one point, and 
their rating of their partner's attractiveness rose about a 
half-point. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the less time men had spent with their partners since  
last intercourse, the higher they rated the partner's sexual 
interest in themselves and her attractiveness to other men. It 
didn't matter how much total time had elapsed since the last 
copulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Women, in contrast, appeared unaffected by the amount of time  
spent apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work proposes a psychological underpinning for earlier  
controversial research. The prior work found evidence that the more 
time a man spent apart from his sexual partner since they last had 
sex, the more sperm he ejaculates at the next copulation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Timothy Perper, an independent sex researcher in  
Philadelphia and author of ``Sex Signals: The Biology of Love,'' 
said he doubted that Shackelford had really detected a 
psychological signal of sperm competition. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, Perper said, the researchers didn't directly test  
whether the male-female differences were big enough to be 
considered real, rather than just a fluke. If there's no real 
difference, there's no evidence for sperm competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the results didn't support two other tested  
predictions from sperm competition theory. Time apart was not 
related to how much a man figured his partner was sexually 
interested in other men, nor how distressed he was if his partner 
refused to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Shackelford said the questionnaire may have just done a poor job  
of asking about those things.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed, Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed Friday, losing ground to  
the euro but recovering a bit from a seven-month low against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0668, up  
from $1.0630 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 111.52 
Japanese yen, up from 111.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign exchange analysts said Friday's currency markets had  
little direction and were essentially drifting on momentum from 
earlier in the week. Traders were skittish about taking a strong 
position in advance of Tuesday's meeting of Federal Reserve 
policy-makers.	   The session was basically a ``continuation of optimism'' for a 
rebound in the fledgling single European economy, said David Solin, 
a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's economy, which no long ago appeared on ``the edge of  
total disaster,'' now appears to be stabilizing, Solin said. 
</P>
<P>
	And traders remain enthusiastic on the potential of the yen,  
despite Friday's mild reversal against the dollar. ``Most people 
are bullish on the yen,'' said Thomas Arnold, chief currency trader 
at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold cited several reasons for traders' optimism; the rebound  
in Japan's Nikkei Index, Tokyo's benchmark stock market indicator 
that has risen nearly 30 percent since Jan. 1; fund managers' 
increased interest in Japanese stocks; and the merger announced 
Friday of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji and Industrial Bank of Japan 
into the world's largest bank, which is being viewed as a positive 
for Japan's resurgent economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4957 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5037 Thursday, and 1.4964 Canadian dollars, upfrom 1.4930. The 
British pound fell to $1.6142 from $1.6186. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8334 German 
marks, down from 1.8403; 6.1491 French francs, down from 6.1708; 
and 1,815 Italian lire, down from 1,821.

<HEADLINE> FAA Wants To Fine Sears, Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing  
fines against the nation's two largest retailers for allegedly 
violating hazardous materials regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Wal-Mart Stores are accused of  
shipping hazardous materials without using the proper packaging and 
inadequately labeling them. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA increased its number of hazardous material inspectors  
after 110 people were killed in the May 1996 crash in the 
Everglades of a ValuJet airliner, spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory 
said. The crash was attributed to mislabeled oxygen canisters, 
which caused a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA alleges Bensonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart on May 11,  
1998, improperly offered a shipment containing dry chemical fire 
extinguishers for transport by Airborne Express from a facility in 
Hermiston, Ore. to Seymour, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The extinguishers were not packaged properly, nor labeled or  
described as required by the Department of Transportation, Cory 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight ounces of the nonflammable material in one extinguisher  
leaked and was noticed by Airborne ground crew, Cory said. The FAA 
is seeking a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart spokesman John Bisio said that the company is  
investigating their shipping procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We safely ship thousands of cases of merchandise every day. We  
take this matter very seriously and are cooperating with the FAA 
fully on this,'' Bisio said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is accusing Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears of giving  
a garden tractor battery that contained corrosive materials and 
explosive gases to Airborne Express on Oct. 1. The package was 
shipped to Airborne's sorting facility in Wilmington, Ohio, where 
the ground crew noticed acid stains on the container's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA is proposing a $55,000 fine against Sears.  
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we learned about this last year, we took prompt  
action to make sure we can avoid this kind of shipment in the 
future,'' Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies have 30 days to respond to the FAA's allegations.

<HEADLINE> Former AD Sues Tennessee State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vivian Fuller, fired as Tennessee State  
athletic director last January, is suing the school, claiming she 
was let go because she tried to improve women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, who was the only black woman athletic director at a  
Division I school with a football program, also said she was 
treated less favorably than her male colleagues, fired without 
notice and defamed by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, also names  
the Tennessee Board of Regents, which oversees TSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller is seeking an unspecified financial award, damages for  
lost income and reinstatement as athletic director or a comparable 
job at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials contacted by The Tennessean said they had not  
seen the lawsuit and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller, 42, was hired in October 1997 after serving as athletic  
director at Northeastern Illinois for five years. She was fired 14 
months later when school officials said they wanted to take the 
athletic program in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuller said shortly before her firing she questioned the  
disparity in funding between the men's and women's athletic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the athletic department is ``dominated by male  
employees and by a male chauvinist atmosphere'' and that school 
officials treated her with less respect than her male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	After she was fired, Fuller said the locks to the athletic  
director's office door were changed and security guards accompanied 
her while she collected her belongings, causing ``humiliation, 
embarrassment and stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee State hired a new athletic director on Monday. James  
Smith, an assistant athletic director at Memphis, takes over on 
Sept. 1.

<HEADLINE> Navy Predicts Widespread Y2K Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. military report predicts widespread  
``probable'' or ``likely'' failures in important power and water 
systems for many of the nation's cities because of the Year 2000 
technology problem, a far more dire assessment than anything the 
White House has made. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton's top Y2K adviser, John Koskinen, called  
the conclusions overly pessimistic in the study by Navy and Marine 
Corps base commanders worldwide. He said the military was assuming 
that major utilities would fail unless proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent version of the study, updated less than two  
weeks ago, predicted ``probable'' or ``likely'' partial failures in 
electric utilities that serve nearly 60 of roughly 400 Navy and 
Marine Corps facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study predicted ``likely'' partial electrical failures, for  
example, at the new year at bases and offices in Orlando, Fla.; 
Gulfport, Miss.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and nine other small- to 
mid-size cities. 
</P>
<P>
	It also predicted ``probable'' partial water system failures in  
Dallas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Baton Rouge, La.; Montgomery, 
Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; and 59 other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The study forecast likely partial natural gas failures -- in the  
middle of winter -- in Nashville; Albany, Ga.; Columbus, Ohio; Fort 
Worth, Texas; Pensacola, Fla.; and Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The military report contrasts sharply with predictions from the  
White House, which said in its own report just weeks ago that 
national electrical failures are ``highly unlikely.'' The White 
House report also said disruptions in water service from the date 
rollover were ``increasingly unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen, who vouched for the authenticity of the Navy report,  
noted nevertheless that all its worst-case predictions for failures 
were marked as ``interim'' or ``partial'' assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not nearly as interesting as the world coming to an  
end,'' said Koskinen. ``The way they worked was, until you have 
information for contingency planning purposes, you ought to assume 
there was a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem may occur because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
Because the programs were written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900, potentially causing problems with financial transactions, 
airline schedules and electrical grids. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy report was first summarized this week on an Internet  
site run by Jim Lord, a Y2K author, who said he obtained it ``from 
a confidential source of the highest reliability and integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The military has to work from the worst case, but so do we,''  
Lord told The Associated Press on Thursday. ``It's reprehensible 
for them to know this and keep it from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen said the Navy wasn't withholding information from  
anyone, noting that the continually updated report was available 
until recently on a Web site maintained by the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last people in the world the department is going to keep  
information from is their own people,'' Koskinen said. ``In fact, 
the whole purpose of the exercise is to make sure they can provide 
appropriate information to servicemen on their bases and their 
families.''

<HEADLINE> Sheppard Angry Mother To Be Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The son of Dr. Sam Sheppard, who was convicted  
and then acquitted of killing his wife 45 years ago, is outraged 
that prosecutors will exhume his mother's remains and said the plan 
is only a means to delay a trial to clear his father's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand why they're doing this. It's outrageous,''  
Sam Reese Sheppard, 52, said Friday after learning Cuyahoga County 
Prosecutor William Mason ordered the exhumation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's father spent 10 years in prison after being convicted  
of killing his wife, Marilyn, in a sensational 1950s case that 
inspired ``The Fugitive'' television series. The U.S. Supreme Court 
overturned the verdict in a landmark decision that cited the unfair 
effect of pretrial publicity. Then the elder Sheppard was acquitted 
in a retrial in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, who contends a window washer killed his mother, has  
filed a wrongful imprisonment lawsuit to try to clear his father's 
name. The trial is to begin Oct. 18. Damages could reach as much as 
$2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday Mason said his experts, which include an  
anthropologist, forensic dentist and DNA expert, needed to exhume 
Mrs. Sheppard's body to get new samples of her DNA. The remains 
will be exhumed within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DNA being used, in our opinion, has been contaminated so  
we need to get a positive profile so we can evaluate that with some 
of the evidence that was taken at the scene,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's lawyer, Terry Gilbert, said he was looking into  
whether Mason can exhume the body without a court order. Mason said 
Ohio law gives him or the county coroner that authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to obstruct any reasonable effort to get at  
the truth if it's viable, but to just go and exhume a body in the 
hopes of maybe finding something is not appropriate,'' Gilbert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mason said the exhumation became necessary after he reviewed  
legal documents that his office received 10 days ago from 
Sheppard's attorneys. He would say only that their reports focus on 
how Mrs. Sheppard died. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard scoffed at prosecutors, pointing out that everything  
his attorneys filed had been published previously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's only fair that they elaborate why they're doing  
this,'' he said. ``We don't understand what they expect to find. To 
do this is sacrilegious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of Dr. Sheppard, who died in 1970, were exhumed for  
DNA samples in 1997, at the son's request. The younger Sheppard 
said he asked for the exhumation only because of criticism of blood 
evidence that his investigative team had found. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard said he does not believe anything new will be  
discovered from an examination of his mother's remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Because prosecutors will need time to analyze the scientific  
data from Mrs. Sheppard's exhumation, the trial could be delayed 
two to three months, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had all this stuff for years,'' Gilbert said. ``They  
don't want to reopen the case because they say it's too old, the 
DNA doesn't work, etc. Now two months before trial, they have a 
revelation about what role scientific evidence will have in the 
trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Sheppard to win his lawsuit, a jury will have to decide more  
evidence points to his father being innocent than guilty.

<HEADLINE> Drechsler Exits World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Heike Drechsler, the German long jumper  
who competed in all six previous World Championships, pulled out of 
this weekend's meet because of a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the latest in a late rush of withdrawals to hit the  
championships, which open Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	British 110-meter hurdler Tony Jarrett, the Commonwealth Games  
champion, pulled out because of a back injury sustained last month. 
</P>
<P>
	James Beckford, the Jamaican long jumper who is No. 4 in the  
world this year, was dropped from the team because he refused to 
take part in his national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Drechsler, 34, arrived in Seville Thursday but announced her  
withdrawal 24 hours before the opening of what would have been her 
seventh World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did some sprints and I started having problems again,'' she  
said. ``I'm sad because I was in good form, but I'm relieved the 
decision has been made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drechsler had shaped up as the main rival to American star  
Marion Jones in the long jump. Jones, who is seeking an 
unprecedented four gold medals in Seville, lost to Drechsler last 
month in Linz, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Drechsler was the youngest champion at the inaugural worlds in  
1983, when she was 18. She won the gold again in 1993, and has six 
medals from six championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Drechsler is one of the biggest names who will miss the  
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Ato Bolton, the 200-meter record holder, is out with a hamstring  
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Also out with injuries are Sergei Bubka, who has won the pole  
vault title at all six previous championships, and Olympic 200 and 
400 champion Marie-Jose Perec of France. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban high jump world record-holder Javier Sotomayor was  
suspended after testing positive for cocaine and Jamaican spinter 
Merlene Ottey pulled out after learning she flunked a test for 
steroids

<HEADLINE> Drought May Mean Smaller Apples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bite-size apples are on the way, thanks to the  
Northeast drought. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of rain throughout the region will likely produce a  
crop of smaller-than-usual apples. Apple growers say the little 
fruits will be sweet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smaller they are, they tend to concentrate the sugars,''  
said Cindy Cook-Charpentier, who works at Cook's Valley Farm in 
Wrentham, Mass. Larger apples have more water. 
</P>
<P>
	The apple crop will be plentiful and will bloom about a week  
earlier than usual, said Russell Powell, executive director of the 
New England McIntosh Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller size will mean more apples to a bushel -- about 120  
instead of 96. A normal-sized apple is about an inch bigger than 
this year's apples are expected to be, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought in much of the East and parts of the Midwest has  
parched many crops, and forced suburbs from Washington to New York 
to restrict water use. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates drought-related  
losses to farmers is ``$1 billion and counting,'' USDA Chief 
Economist Keith Collins said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other farmers, New England apple growers are concerned. Jay  
Marshall, owner of Marshall Farm Inc. in Fitchburg, Mass., said 
that while the volume of his crop is about average, the apples are 
smaller than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no money in small apples,'' Marshall said. ``They'll  
pay more money for that larger apple and they can sell it for more 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, apple growers were faced with the opposite problem:  
too much rain dampened bees' efforts to pollinate the trees. As a 
result, the trees produced fewer apples, but they tended to be 
larger, with a higher water content.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Giants in Rush To Realign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The announcement Friday of three Japanese banks'  
plan to create the world's largest banking group is the latest in a 
slew of recent alliances and mergers involving Japanese 
corporations. Here are some of the more significant: 
</P>
<P>
	--AUTO MERGER: Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA sealed the world's  
fourth-largest auto partnership in March when the French automaker 
agreed to pump $5.8 billion into Nissan's debt-laden operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal made Renault the largest shareholder in Nissan and  
marked increasing involvement by foreign companies in Japan's once 
virtually closed auto sector, which had been struggling with 
slumping sales caused by the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	--OIL MERGER: Nippon Oil Co. and Mitsubishi Oil Co., two of  
Japan's largest petroleum distributors and refiners, announced last 
October a union that would create the nation's biggest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, named Nisseki Mitsubishi Co., aims to save $630  
million within five years by combining its two parent corporations' 
administrative, distribution and refining operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was a reaction to lower demand due to a recessionary  
economy and a plunge in retail gasoline prices following the 
lifting of a ban on imported fuel in early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	--BANK MERGER: In a marriage of Japanese financial giants,  
Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of Tokyo agreed in 1995 to merge to 
form what was then the world's largest bank, with more than $690 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marked an aggressive attempt to compete internationally  
with more profitable rivals in the United States and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Receiver Wiggins Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska receiver Shevin Wiggins was  
arrested Friday and charged with sexually assaulting two 
14-year-old girls outside a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, 24, and another man, Floyd Brown, 22, were accused of  
fondling the girls late July 25 or early July 26 in a camper in the 
driveway of the home near Lincoln, Sheriff Terry Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests followed a three-week investigation. Wagner said a  
third unidentified man involved in the incident has not been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men posted bonds of $10,000 and were released from jail.  
</P>
<P>
	Sexual assault of a child is a felony punishable by up to five  
years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, a senior who was granted a sixth year of eligibility by  
the NCAA in April, was indefinitely suspended from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate certainly for Shevin and all of us,''  
Nebraska coach Frank Solich said. The arrest ``shocked us all, but 
we'll just have to move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins, also a kick returner, was recruited in 1994 but sat out  
while gaining academic eligibility. He redshirted in 1995 and 
played the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He's best known for when his kicked ball at the goal line was  
caught by teammate Matt Davison as the Cornhuskers rallied to beat 
Missouri in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Navigation Tool in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARINA DEL REY, Calif. (AP) -- For those who rely on the  
high-tech Global Positioning System to find their way around, this 
weekend has plenty of potential drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite-based navigation devices in use all over the world  
could malfunction when the system resets its clocks at 5 p.m. PDT 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That could be a problem for someone such as Stuart Prince, a  
boater who relies on his GPS. Prince doesn't carry maps or charts 
when he sails off the Southern California coast. He has no radar on 
his 30-foot sailboat and doesn't know how to navigate by the stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I'd just go east until I hit land,'' Prince, 39, said  
as he and a buddy fiddled with his GPS receiver. ``It's such a 
fantastic tool. Everyone is so dependent on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this possible Y2K-like glitch, the receivers may take  
longer to pinpoint a location, be off in their calculations or be 
unable to find a location, which is usually displayed on a map or 
in latitude and longitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the problem is that GPS receivers determine a  
location by using signals from three to 24 satellites. To account 
for variations in the Earth's orbit and rotation, they need the 
exact time, determined by counting the weeks since Jan. 5, 1980 -- 
up to 1,024. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS is reaching its maximum number of weeks and time clocks on  
the locators are resetting to zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Most receivers built since 1993 were designed to handle the  
rollover. Manufacturers have offered upgrades of older ones. 
</P>
<P>
	A nationwide boat rescue company, Vessel Assist Association of  
America, doesn't expect an increase in calls a day for help. But 
finding a stranded boat's exact coordinates might take a little 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there would be a problem, then we're going to have  
difficulty in finding people because we rely on them to tell us 
where they are -- and they use GPS to do that,'' said Vessel Assist 
spokesman Brian Haney. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, the company can locate a boat using VHF radio  
frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
	GPS, originally designed for the military, has been used for at  
least a decade by aviators and boaters. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the devices are booming in the commercial market, often  
offered in luxury cars as a mapping device. Hikers use GPS to 
recall a favorite campsite or apply it like a high-tech trail of 
bread crumbs to get back to their starting point in featureless 
terrain or bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand-held GPS units are hot-selling gadgets at sporting goods  
stores, priced between $100 and $750. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretchen Crumbaugh, 28, of Boulder, Colo., has used GPS while  
hiking in the Rockies but places her faith in her compass and 
topography map. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of it as a toy,'' she said. ``We've taken it hiking a  
few times to say, `Hey, we got up to 10,000 feet.'''

<HEADLINE> Tszyu, Gonzalez To Fight for Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Kostya Tszyu and Miguel Angel Gonzalez have waited  
10 months to fight each other, and their chance finally comes 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-round bout for the WBC super-lightweight crown has been  
canceled three times because of injuries and a legal dispute. Tszyu 
and Gonzalez are competing for a title that has been vacant since 
April 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten tired of watching him in videos as I prepared for  
the fight,'' said Gonzalez, of Mexico. ``I'm not going to believe 
when the referee tells us to touch gloves and come out fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bout was scheduled for last October, only to be postponed  
when Tszyu suffered a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescheduled for November, the fight was again canceled because  
of a rib injury to Gonzalez. Then, when it seemed the bout was 
ready for the spring, legal problems between the fight's promoters, 
Don King and America Presents, left Tszyu and Gonzalez waiting 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The 140-pound title has been vacant since Oscar De La Hoya  
relinquished it to move up to the welterweight division. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya's only defense in the division was a tough 12-round  
decision over Gonzalez in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delays haven't bothered me,'' said Tszyu, a Russian living  
in Australia and a former IBF junior-welterweight champion. ``It 
gave me time to prepare for different plans for Miguel, and one of 
them will work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tszyu (22-1-1, 18 KOs) usually starts a fight with a vengeance,  
looking for the quick finish. But he could change his strategy 
against Gonzalez, who had a 10-fight run as WBC lightweight 
titleholder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what's going to happen with me?'' Tszyu said. ``I  
know I rush a little too much because I don't fight often. It's not 
good for me when I knock down opponents early, because I become 
anxious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez (43-1-1, 33 KOs) will be ready for any quick assault  
from Tszyu, 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's constantly throwing punches,'' Gonzalez said. ``You have  
to control him from a distance and not give him much of an 
opportunity to become active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 27, said if he defeats Tszyu, he will fight countryman  
Julio Cesar Chavez in a rematch of their disputed draw last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tszyu has his sights set on unifying the 140-pound belt against  
the other recognized world champions, Sharmba Mitchell (WBA) and 
Terronn Millet (IBF).

<HEADLINE> McGwire's Pace Same, Target Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark McGwire is launching baseballs out of  
stadiums at the same record pace he set last year. The target has 
changed, and with it, the interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we were talking about chasing history, chasing 61,''  
McGwire said Friday before his St. Louis Cardinals were rained out 
against the New York Mets. ``Now people want to talk about Home Run 
Derby Two. This is much lighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire has 48 home runs, one more than last season after the  
122 games and one fewer than Sammy Sosa, whose 66 home runs last 
season fell four short of McGwire's record. Sosa hit two homers 
Friday against Colorado to move back into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	With Roger Maris' and Babe Ruth's names out of the conversation,  
McGwire and Sosa are only chasing each other. And even though they 
haven't slowed down a bit from 1998, McGwire doesn't expect either 
to make history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy is like ridiculous. It really is,'' McGwire said. ``I  
think 60 will be gotten again. Seventy is an extra 10. It is 
unfathomable when you think that I had to hit five in the last 
three days to get there. I don't know how you can ever dream about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's more than a dream. It could be reality. If McGwire hits as  
many homers in the final 40 games of this season as he did last 
year, he'd not only reach 70, he'd top it by one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only do what I am capable of doing,'' he said. ``People  
say to me every day, `Are you going to hit a home run today.' It's 
like they're asking, `Will I walk down street today?' I wish it was 
easy, but it's not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's just that he's made it look that way the last few years.  
McGwire has 227 homers since the beginning of 1996 and with 13 more 
this season he will be averaging 60 a season over four years. 
That's a plateau that had been reached twice before last season -- 
by Ruth and Maris. 
</P>
<P>
	Four more years at that pace, and McGwire will be threatening  
Hank Aaron's career mark of 755. He is currently 251 homers short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anything is possible,'' he said. ``But the man with  
the best shot is Ken Griffey. He has the age, that great stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire took advantage of his 40-minute forum with reporters to  
talk about teaching -- young players on how to play the game, the 
public about sexual abuse and children about role models. 
</P>
<P>
	He even revealed that he would tell his own son not to take  
androstenedione, the over-the-counter dietary supplement that 
caused controversy during his chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tell him not to,'' McGwire said. ``That's the way I  
feel. I wouldn't want him to be associated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, McGwire acknowledged to The Associated Press that  
he had used andro for more than a year. McGwire's admission helped 
spark a tenfold increase in sales of the supplement last fall and 
led many steroid experts to warn of serious health consequences for 
teen-agers who took it to emulate McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, McGwire said he had stopped taking andro  
before the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got tired of seeing my name associated with it,'' he said.  
``I didn't want to be seen as an endorser of a product which I 
wasn't endorsing. I got tired of hearing about underage kids taking 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Castro Offered LBJ Help in '64 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before the 1964 presidential campaign,  
President Lyndon B. Johnson got an offer of help from an improbable 
source -- Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro sent a verbal message to Johnson that he was eager for  
Johnson to prevail in the election -- and even invited him to take 
``hostile action'' against Cuba if it would be to his political 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	He also urged Johnson to continue a U.S.-Cuban dialogue that  
Kennedy had initiated in the months before his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's comments are contained in a series of once-secret 1960s  
documents on U.S.-Cuban relations obtained by Peter Kornbluh, a 
senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a research group 
at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornbluh wrote an article based on the documents in the current  
edition of Cigar Aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Castro message was dated Feb. 12, 1964, less than three  
months after Kennedy was assassinated. It was given verbally by 
Castro to Lisa Howard of ABC News in Havana for delivery to 
Johnson. Kornbluh said the message reached Johnson through U.N. 
Ambassador Adlai Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, who then held the title of prime minister, asked Howard  
to ``Please tell President Johnson that I earnestly desire his 
election to the presidency in November ... though that appears 
assured. .... Seriously, I have observed how Republicans use Cuba 
as a weapon against the Democrats. So tell President Johnson to let 
me know what I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that his offer remain secret lest it become useful  
to the Republicans. It was a time when the conservative wing of the 
party was poised to seize power after long years of dominance by 
moderates. That summer, the GOP nominated conservative Sen. Barry 
Goldwater of Arizona to run against Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro continued: ``If the president feels it necessary during  
the campaign to make bellicose statements about Cuba or even to 
take hostile action, if he will inform me unofficially that a 
specific action is required because of domestic political 
considerations, I shall understand and not take any serious 
retaliatory action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How Johnson responded to Castro's letter is not known. Four  
months after his message to Johnson, Castro proposed in an 
interview ``extensive discussions of the issues dividing'' Cuba and 
the United States. There were subsequent contacts but the 
initiative begun by Kennedy fizzled out by the end of 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	As the documents show, Kennedy placed high priority on a normal  
relationship with Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting a State Department recommendation that Cuba loosen its  
ties with the Soviet Union and China as the price for normal ties, 
a White House memo dated March 4, 1963, said, ``We don't want to 
present Castro with a condition that he obviously cannot fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should start thinking along more flexible lines. The  
president, himself, is very interested in this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The documents highlight Kennedy's previously reported interest  
in abandoning his policy of unremitting hostility toward Cuba in 
exchange for a more moderate course. For his part Castro seemed 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-November 1963, Castro was preparing to send instructions  
to his U.N. ambassador on a proposed agenda for official talks 
between Castro and a U.S. emissary. Kennedy sent word to top aides 
that he was prepared to decide on next steps once the agenda was 
received. The date was Nov. 19, 1963, three days before Kennedy's 
assassination.

<HEADLINE> Conde Nast May Buy Disney Magazines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue, Glamour and  
Mademoiselle, will reportedly add Women's Wear Daily and W to its 
list of major fashion magazines with the purchase of Fairchild 
Publications from Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, citing unidentified executives, reported  
Friday that Conde Nast has agreed to pay $650 million for 
Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment on the report  
Friday, and Conde Nast executives did not immediately return 
repeated telephone calls from The Associated Press. The agreement 
was to be announced by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's profits and its stock price have been weak and it has  
been under pressure to sell some of its assets to concentrate on 
its core businesses -- its movie studio and theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported last week that Conde Nast and Hearst  
Magazines, publishers of Harper's Bazaar and Town &AMP; Country, were 
involved in a bidding war on Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
	The jewel of the acquisition is W, a glossy fashion monthly that  
has become a general-interest magazine. W has taken apparel 
advertising from magazines at both Hearst Magazines and Conde Nast. 
</P>
<P>
	Conde Nast, a division of Advance Publications, also publishes  
Allure, GQ, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, among other magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairchild group also publishes several trade magazines  
including Supermarket News, Brand Marketing, Footwear News and 
Children's Business. 
</P>
<P>
	With addition of Fairchild, Conde Nast would have a powerful new  
offering for advertisers, who could be given cut rates for buying 
ads as a package in several of its fashion publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney acquired Fairchild in 1995 with its purchase of Capital  
Cities ABC, but publishing has never among its top businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago it sold other publishing businesses that were  
acquired with Capital Cities ABC including four newspapers, among 
them Kansas City Star and Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The newspaper 
publisher Knight Ridder bought the papers for $1.65 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Major League Catcher George Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	METAIRIE, La. (AP) -- Charles ``Greek'' George, who set an  
American League record for putouts in a game when he caught Bob 
Feller, died at his home in Metairie on Sunday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	George was called up to the majors by the Cleveland Indians in  
1936 and caught Feller when the pitcher struck out 17 in his major 
league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about catching the future Hall of Famer, George said  
``How would you feel if you knew you were making history? Feller 
never knew how to throw easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current AL record for putouts is 20, last done by Dan Wilson  
of Seattle in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During five years in the majors, George also played with the  
Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Athletics. He 
finished with a .177 batting average in 118 games. 
</P>
<P>
	His major league career ended in scandal, however, when he was  
banished by the sport after exchanging punches with an umpire. 
George maintained the umpire provoked him with an insult. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include two sons, four daughters, one sister, 19  
grandchildren and 10 great-grand children.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Farm Van Violations Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A statewide sweep of surprise  
inspections of farm-labor vehicles turned up more than 200 safety 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's early-morning sweep came 10 days after a van crashed  
into a tractor-trailer near Fresno, killing 13 farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Highway Patrol checked 118 farm-labor vehicles  
and found a total of 221 safety violations, including defective 
lights, tires, wheels and brakes. Officers took 36 vehicles out of 
service because of serious safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to keep the pressure on to make sure all vehicles  
carrying farm workers are safe,'' said CHP Commissioner D.O. 
Helmick. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle check took place the same day that a state Senate  
committee approved legislation requiring seat belts and inspections 
for all vehicles used to transport farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal approved 9-1 by the Senate Transportation Committee  
was prompted by the Aug. 9 van crash. The van had an unlicensed 
driver and no seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This month's accident is not new but now Californians are  
focused on these tragedies like never before,'' said Assemblyman 
Dean Florez, one of the bill's sponsors. ``Somehow, these deaths 
used to be seen as part of the harvest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In last week's accident, a van carrying 15 workers from an  
overnight shift at Terra Linda farms crashed into a tractor-trailer 
that was turning around on the two-lane road. Only two passengers 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1983 Dodge Ram was last certified in 1997 and did not have  
seat belts. None are required under a code that lets farm-worker 
vehicles carrying more than 10 passengers be classified as buses, 
which are exempt from seat belt laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require seat belts in all vehicles used to  
transport farm laborers, and would require the vehicles to be 
inspected at least once a year. An 800 number would be set up for 
people to report violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulation is so long overdue and it's been avoided because it  
costs money,'' said Rosalinda Guillen from the United Farm Workers 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic accidents have killed at least 63 farm workers in  
California's Central Valley in the last decade, a bill backer said.

<HEADLINE> Man 'Sorry' in Yosemite Slay Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The man suspected of killing four women  
near Yosemite National Park says he is ``truly sorry'' for the pain 
he's caused and says selling his story could compensate families of 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, is charged with last month's slaying of  
naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong, 26, and is suspected in the 
killings of Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter Juli and 
16-year-old Argentine exchange student Silvina Pelosso in February. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent to The Fresno Bee from the Fresno County jail,  
Stayner wrote: ``I would like to say how deeply sorry I am for all 
the pain and sorrow I've brought upon so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner has pleaded innocent to a first-degree murder charge,  
which carries a potential death sentence. No one has been charged 
in the sightseers' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner's late brother, Steven, was the subject of a book and  
television movie after being kidnapped as a child and sexually 
abused for seven years before escaping. After his July 24 arrest, 
Cary Stayner reportedly said he'd like to see his life story turned 
into a TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realize that the money would be little consolation for the  
loss of their loved ones but until the jury, judge and executioner 
fulfill their role in this matter, it's all I have to offer,'' 
Stayner wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said it wants to see the letter. ``It could be a very  
important piece of evidence,'' said FBI agent Nick Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner likely won't face trial for months. A judge on Thursday  
said a trial date probably will be scheduled on Dec. 2.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Quake Hits Central America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A powerful earthquake rattled three  
Central American nations Friday, damaging buildings in Panama but 
leaving other parts of the region unscathed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6.7-magnitude quake, with its epicenter 55 miles south of  
Costa Rica's capital, San Jose, struck at 4 a.m. and was felt 
throughout that country as well as parts of Panama and Nicaragua, 
said Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake 
Information Center in Golden, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake was felt most strongly in villages along Costa Rica's  
Pacific coastline and the major cities in the central valley, where 
most of the 3.5 million people of the country live. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Panama, where people rushed out into the streets and  
authorities reported broken windows, cracked walls and other minor 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Two residential buildings made of concrete were seriously  
damaged in Panama's La Mesa de San Cristobal, said civil defense 
spokesman Jorge Correa. 
</P>
<P>
	Only slight tremors were felt in the southern half of Nicaragua,  
and no damage or casualties were reported there. 
</P>
<P>
	The last major quake to hit Costa Rica occurred on April 1991.  
It registered 7.4 in magnitude and caused the death of 95 people. 
About 800 were injured and severe damages were reported.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Opposes Star of David Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union asked  
a court Friday to strike down a school policy against gang symbols 
that has been applied to a Jewish student's Star of David. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harrison County School Board agreed to reconsider its policy  
at its next meeting, but the ACLU lawsuit filed in federal court in 
Biloxi asks that student Ryan Green be helped immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not convinced they will make the right decision and,  
since nothing would apparently happen until Sept. 7, that would 
mean Ryan is prohibited from wearing the Star of David during that 
time,'' said David Ingebretsen, executive director of the ACLU in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	The board has a policy against allowing students to wear gang  
symbols, and had refused to make an exception for Ryan, a high 
school junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement officials say some gang symbols incorporate  
six-pointed stars but normally have other elements such as a letter 
or a pitchfork. Crosses can be worn, the school system says, 
because currently there are no gangs that use a similar symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	School board members and representatives of the Jewish community  
met privately Thursday. In a joint statement, they agreed the 
school board's decision was motivated by safety concerns and not 
religious prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Henry Arledge expressed hope that the  
matter would be resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think the board will just review it on the grounds of  
it being a religious symbol and try to come to some kind of 
resolution to make it acceptable,'' Arledge said.

<HEADLINE> Man Indicted on Bribery Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A retired lawyer has been indicted on  
bribery charges, with prosecutors claiming he tried to buy a copy 
of the JonBenet Ramsey ransom note for $30,000 on behalf of a 
national tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Miller allegedly offered the money to a former Denver police  
officer who possessed a copy of the ransom note, according to 
indictment papers filed Friday. The tabloid was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller did not have anything to do with the note, and only  
introduced two people, said his attorney, Charles Leidner. 
</P>
<P>
	Patsy Ramsey reported finding the 2 1/2-page ransom note on the  
back stairs of the family's Boulder house the morning of Dec. 26, 
1996, about seven hours before her 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, 
was found in the basement, beaten, bound and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made in her death.  
</P>
<P>
	Senior Deputy District Attorney Dennis Hall said Miller's  
indictment stemmed from an investigation of information brokers 
also facing charges in the case. If convicted, Miller faces up to 
three years in prison and fines up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A private detective and his wife are accused of supplying  
confidential information about the Ramsey murder investigation to 
tabloid newspapers. James Rapp, 39, and his wife, Regana Rapp, 29, 
were indicted on racketeering charges in June.

<HEADLINE> Reactor Buried at Hanford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- With a brief ceremony, authorities began  
burying a 1,000-ton reactor taken from the largest nuclear power 
plant ever shut down in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take several months to cover the empty, radioactive  
reactor with desert soil and river rock in a trench 850 feet long, 
150 feet wide and 45 feet deep. The process began Thursday at US 
Ecology's 100-acre disposal site on the Hanford nuclear 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing went off without a hitch,'' said Joe Nagel,  
president and chief operating officer for Boise, Idaho-based 
American Ecology, US Ecology's parent. 
</P>
<P>
	The reactor, wrapped up in bright blue, attracted national  
attention two weeks ago as it chugged 270 miles up the Columbia 
River aboard a barge. It came from the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant, 
which for 16 years produced enough electricity to power Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland General Electric chose to decommission the plant in  
1993, two decades earlier than planned, after a series of problems, 
including a faulty safety system that drew federal fines, the 
accidental release of radioactive gases and cracked steam tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	The burial of the hulking, cylindrical reactor is permanent.  
</P>
<P>
	The reactor vessel is encased in carbon steel, 5 inches to 10  
inches thick, and the reactor itself is stainless steel and filled 
with cement, all of which should keep it from leaching anything 
into the ground.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Hoping to find their way out of the industry's  
worst crisis since World War II, three Japanese banks announced 
today an alliance that would create the world's largest banking 
group -- a giant with more than $1 trillion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance, to be implemented over the next two years, was  
announced by the presidents of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the 
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., and Fuji Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The move sent share prices soaring on the Tokyo Stock Exchange  
and was generally welcomed by analysts as a long-overdue effort to 
deal with the realities of an overcrowded market, massive bad loans 
and woefully low profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts were skeptical about whether size alone would  
help make the banks more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be front-runners in bringing about a revival of  
Japan's financial sector,'' Industrial Bank of Japan head Masao 
Nishimura told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets at the three banks exceed $1.2 trillion, which would make  
the new entity the largest banking group in the world. Their assets 
would surpass the $735.3 billion of Germany's Deutsche Bank and the 
$652 billion of Japan's largest bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks may be following suit. Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank are  
also considering a plan to set up a joint holding company, a Tokai 
spokeswoman said. The Yomiuri newspaper reported today that the 
holding company will be set up in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan announced today, Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank  
and the Industrial Bank of Japan said they will reduce the combined 
number of branches by 150 within five years after forming a joint 
holding company by October next year. 
</P>
<P>
	By the spring of 2002, the group will be reorganized according  
to its financial operations, such as consumer banking, corporate 
banking and securities. 
</P>
<P>
	They also plan to reduce by 6,000, or 17 percent, their combined  
payroll. The new group is aiming for annual profit of more than 
$8.9 billion and to reduce costs by $896 million, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the need to create a bank in Japan that is competitive  
on an international level,'' said Fuji Bank president Yoshiro 
Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been troubled by huge loans gone sour after  
the speculative lending rush of the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
Turning around the banking woes has been viewed as integral to help 
bring along economic recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts agree the main problem of Japan's banking sector  
is that it was overly protected up to now by the government and has 
never been under much pressure to be competitive. It has a dismal 
record as far as turning profits and has been slow in cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	James Fiorillo, analyst at ING Baring Securities Japan, said the  
alliance was part of an inevitable overall trend in the financial 
sector, but remained cautious about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would, therefore, view the alliance as much a defensive  
move as an offensive move,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the banks have had their troubles, although they  
denied they were getting together merely to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank has reported problem loans at its  
parent company amounting to $20 billion. It posted a consolidated 
net loss of $4 billion for the fiscal year ending in March. Fuji 
Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan also reported large group 
losses for fiscal 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, news of the plan sent the banks' stock prices higher  
today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Industrial Bank of Japan shares 
were up by 10 percent to $9.70 from the previous close; Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank by 11 percent to $9; Fuji Bank by 9 percent to $9.30. 
</P>
<P>
	And U.S. ratings agency Moody's Investors Services today placed  
on review for possible upgrade the ratings for long-term credit and 
financial strength of the three banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks, however, acknowledged more than just size was needed  
to solve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``If big banks just get together, it's possible they'll become  
too massive, like an elephant, and might topple when the right leg 
gets in the way of the left leg,'' said Katsuyuki Sugita, head of 
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.

<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Four months after the Columbine High  
School rampage, the last victim to leave the hospital strapped on a 
pair of biking gloves and wheeled himself out the hospital doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Castaldo, 17, left in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the

<HEADLINE> Foster Fined for Duke List Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Gov. Mike Foster won't pay a $20,000  
fine for violating campaign finance law by not reporting his 
purchase of a voter list from white supremacist David Duke. The 
governor's supporters will. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster, a Republican who is seeking re-election, said he would  
use campaign funds to pay the fine -- something his attorneys said 
he can legally do. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Board of Ethics fined Foster on Thursday for failing  
to report more than $150,000 in payments to ex-Ku Klux Klan leader 
Duke for a computerized voter list. The governor said the violation 
was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never intentionally broken the law in my life,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a consent opinion negotiated between Foster's lawyers and the  
board, the governor was found to have twice violated the state's 
campaign finance disclosure law. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time was during the 1995 governor's race when he  
failed to report a $103,000 payment for a computerized ``list of 
conservative voters,'' the board said. The second was in 1997 when 
he paid $52,000 for the right to continue to use the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The list of 60,000 to 80,000 names was bought by Foster through  
Impact Mail Ltd., a Metairie firm that brokered the transaction and 
made a $15,000 commission on the deal, Duke said after a grand jury 
appearance in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans federal grand jury has sought information on  
whether Duke paid taxes on income he received from Foster and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the purchase has become an issue in Foster's  
re-election campaign with his leading opponents -- Rep. William 
Jefferson and Baton Rouge businessman Phil Preis, both Democrats -- 
lambasting him over the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster has said he tried to keep the purchase secret because  
``it ain't real cool to put out there that you're buying something 
from David Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has also said he didn't think he needed to report the  
purchase because he used his own money and didn't use the list in 
his campaign. But the Ethics Board said the purchase should have 
been reported regardless of whether the list was used because it 
was bought for the potential purpose of influencing the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke ran unsuccessfully for Congress this year, using the  
campaign to tout his latest book contending that blacks are 
genetically inferior to whites and that an Aryan revolution is 
needed.

<HEADLINE> Auburn, Former Coach Settle Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- The Terry Bowden era at Auburn was  
officially closed Friday when the university agreed to pay $210,000 
to former defensive coordinator Bill ``Brother'' Oliver, who 
claimed he was promised Bowden's job. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver, who acted as interim coach last year when Bowden quit  
with five games left to play, had sued Auburn, athletic director 
David Housel and influential trustee Bobby Lowder contending they 
misled him. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 hours of mediation between the parties, the settlement  
was reached late Thursday night and announced Friday by Auburn 
President William Muse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payment in no way correlates to any of the specific  
allegations made in the lawsuit,'' Muse said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver claimed he was promised the permanent head coach  
position, which actually went to Tommy Tuberville. Oliver, a highly 
regarded defensive coordinator who came to Auburn from Alabama in 
1996, retired when it became clear he would not get it. 
</P>
<P>
	He then sued the school, claiming he was shortchanged on some  
$112,000. The two sides were ordered into Thursday's mediation, 
which was presided over by former Alabama Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Sonny Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not want to have to bring a lawsuit and it should never  
have come this far,'' Oliver said Friday. ``I never had any desire 
to harm the Auburn football team, and it is for that reason that I 
feel it best for everyone that we put this matter behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muse said the $210,000 will come from the Greater Auburn Fund,  
which is made up of private contributions from alumni and Auburn 
supporters to help finance athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Muse said the university did not agree with Oliver's claims but  
agreed to settle the suit because it was going to be 
``time-consuming, disruptive and expensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Heartsill, a spokesman for the university, said the school  
had figured ``Tuberville would be starting his third season at 
Auburn before the lawsuit would make its way through the courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville, formerly head coach at Mississippi, makes his debut  
as head coach on Sept. 4 at home against Appalachian State. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university made a practical business decision,'' said  
Housel. ``... We're going to take the high road and move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement closes the Bowden era, which saw the school at  
some of its highest and lowest times. Bowden won his first 20 games 
at Auburn, then abruptly resigned last October as the team 
struggled to a 1-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers finished the season 3-8, their worst record since  
1952. The school then found itself embroiled in off-the-field 
controversy, player arrests and Oliver's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Terry Bowden era is part of our history, but we are moving  
forward now,'' Housel said. ``We don't go anywhere by looking 
back.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The deal struck by three Japanese lenders to form  
the world's biggest bank generated optimism Friday that similar 
alliances would follow, thinning the ranks of an overcrowded 
industry that has long lost its knack for turning a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts approached the alliance cautiously, saying the  
marriage of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan 
Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. could founder if they fail to unload excess 
baggage and depend on sheer size alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Even one of the main players in the pact, the chairman of  
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, expressed similar fears. 
</P>
<P>
	``If big banks just get together, it's possible they'll become  
too massive, like an elephant, and might topple when the right leg 
gets in the way of the left leg,'' Katsuyuki Sugita said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger will create a mammoth financial institution with  
complementary strengths -- investment banking for IBJ and retail 
banking for DKB and Fuji. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets at the three banks exceed $1.2 trillion, which would make  
the new entity the largest banking group in the world, surpassing 
the $735.2 billion in assets of Germany's Deutsche Bank and the 
$580 billion of Japan's largest bank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, 
as well as the largest U.S. bank -- Citigroup, which has $668.6 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the alliance's sheen of boldness, some analysts saw it  
as a defensive move, designed more to survive the new 
government-engineered era of competition in Japan's financial 
markets than to stake a claim in the global arena. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, the number of major Japanese banks has  
dropped from 20 to 17 with the collapse of a city bank and two 
long-term credit banks. Some experts predict that number will soon 
fall to five or six. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks have been troubled by huge loans gone sour after  
the speculative lending rush of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and 
the three lenders in Friday's alliance have been hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
	IBJ rose to prominence as a financier for Japan's dramatic  
postwar ascension to global renown, but it has struggled to remain 
relevant as the age of the Japanese industrial bank wanes. Its main 
rivals -- Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank -- 
have both collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks denied they were getting together merely to stay  
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be front-runners in bringing about a revival of  
Japan's financial sector,'' said IBJ head Masao Nishimura. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials went out of their way to welcome the pact,  
even though it still faces questions from Japanese antitrust 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a simple merger, but rather a new, resolute move  
built on lessons learned from the past, and as such I evaluate it 
highly,'' said Hakuo Yanagisawa, head of Japan's Financial 
Reconstruction Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Yanagisawa's comments suggest the government will encourage  
further alliances. And the three-way deal will certainly put 
pressure on other Japanese banks to forge their own mega-mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank, which already have an alliance, said  
Friday they are actively pursuing a merger, and the Yomiuri 
newspaper reported that they will set up a holding company in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Charged With Hiring Hit Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a courthouse where his work has brought him so  
many times, criminal defense lawyer Frederick Ford has a new role: 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is charged with hiring a hit man -- really an undercover  
agent -- to kill two former clients who allegedly could have 
testified about his involvement in the kidnapping of a marijuana 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents detail the alleged deal, including Ford's  
request that the killer empty an entire clip into each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want them dead. I don't want them to suffer,'' he  
allegedly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The burly 6-foot-6 attorney was in federal court Friday as his  
lawyer asked that he undergo a competency evaluation. Magistrate 
Judge Joyce London Alexander granted the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The courtroom was packed to capacity with colleagues and friends  
of Ford, a married father of two who has practiced law in Boston 
since 1991. Before that, he was a federal probation officer for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ford, 48, wanted the two unidentified former  
clients dead after he learned they might testify against him in a 
federal investigation into the kidnapping last year of a 
``large-scale marijuana dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford allegedly proposed the kidnapping and expected to receive a  
share of proceeds from the ransom money. The U.S. attorney's office 
wouldn't release any further information about the kidnapping, 
including its outcome, because it is the subject of an ongoing 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit by a Drug Enforcement Administration  
agent, Ford confided to a government informant early last month 
that he had learned of the kidnapping investigation and wanted the 
two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant later secretly recorded Ford saying he was  
prepared to kill the men himself and had thought about hiding in a 
van and shooting one with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 26, a special agent from the Department of Labor's  
racketeering division, posing as a prospective hit man, contacted 
Ford. Speaking in an elaborate coded language, the two hatched a 
plan to kill the former clients, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Ford allegedly gave the ``hit man'' $11,000 in a  
meeting at a doughnut shop that prosecutors say was caught on 
videotape, audiotape and in photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Ford allegedly requested that entire clips be  
emptied into each victim, and offered to bring the men to a 
restaurant so the hit man could ``eyeball'' them before the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The undercover agent told Ford he was involved with stolen  
diamonds, and Ford suggested a second kidnapping -- of a wealthy 
jeweler's son, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the undercover agent met Ford at a hotel and told  
him the killings had been committed. The agent asked if Ford was a 
religious man, and if he had any problems with his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Ford allegedly replied, and was arrested soon after.

<HEADLINE> Snake-In-Pants Spoils Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Pet store clerk Regina Creamer can  
handle a snake in the grass, but when the reptiles start slithering 
from a customer's clothing -- that's when it's time to call the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to her 911 call, police arrested James Collison after  
a boa constrictor peeped from under his shirt and a milk snake 
climbed out of a pants pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Collison, 46, pleaded no contest Thursday to grand theft of the  
snakes from Bird World Pet Shop in June. Judge Dedee Costello 
sentenced him to two years of house arrest and probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The snakes, each about 3 1/2 feet long, are valued about $340.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was hilarious,'' Ms. Creamer said. ``He kept saying he  
wasn't taking anything, but those snakes were just moving around 
and one was under his shirt, and he was doing all kinds of strange 
things and trying to keep it in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collison's story, according to police, was that ``he saw the  
snakes loose in the store and caught them and placed them into his 
pocket for safekeeping until he could find an employee.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Must Tear Down Treehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACHESNEY PARK, Ill. (AP) -- To 9-year-old Gregory Webb, it's a  
treehouse -- even if it is made from lawn chairs, leftover carpet 
and a pet carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	To town officials, it's debris that must be removed.  
</P>
<P>
	Chad Atkinson, the director of planning and zoning in Machesney  
Park, said the treehouse must be gone by the end of next week, 
citing the village's public nuisance ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty sad when the government doesn't have anything  
better to do than tear down a little boy's treehouse,'' said Leslie 
Webb, the boy's mother who has lived in the neighborhood for 18 
years. ``It may not be the prettiest treehouse, but it's his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio host Bruce Butler of WROK in nearby Rockford mentioned the  
issue on his show and there have been enough donations and 
volunteers to build Gregory a new treehouse -- before the deadline. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Drought May Mean Smaller Apples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but this  
fall you might need to snack on two. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of rain throughout the region will likely produce a  
crop of smaller than usual apples. However, the smaller the fruit, 
the sweeter the taste, say apple growers. 
</P>
<P>
	The apple crop will still be plentiful and will bloom about a  
week earlier than usual, said Russell Powell, executive director of 
the New England McIntosh Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	For consumers, the smaller size will mean more apples to a  
bushel -- about 120 instead of 96. A normal-sized apple is about an 
inch bigger than this year's apples are expected to be, Powell 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller apples are just one of many results from the drought,  
which has affected about 15 percent to 20 percent of the country. 
This year's drought has parched crops from Virginia into parts of 
the Midwest and forced suburbs from Washington to New York to 
restrict water use. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Agriculture, using its Aug. 12 crop  
production report, estimates drought-related losses to farmers is 
``$1 billion and counting,'' USDA Chief Economist Keith Collins 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Needless to say, New England apple growers are concerned. Jay  
Marshall, owner of Marshall Farm, Inc. in Fitchburg, Mass., said 
that while the volume of his crop is about average, the apples are 
smaller than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no money in small apples,'' Marshall said. ``They'll  
pay more money for that larger apple and they can sell it for more 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prolonged exposure to the sun does have the added bonus of  
making the apples sweeter than their larger counterparts, which 
contain more water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smaller they are, they tend to concentrate the sugars,''  
said Cindy Cook-Charpentier, who works at Cook's Valley Farm in 
Wrentham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, apple growers were faced with the opposite problem:  
too much rain dampened bees' efforts to pollinate the trees. As a 
result, the trees produced fewer apples, but they tended to be 
larger, with a higher water content. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, in areas where rainfall has been plentiful, apples  
should be the normal size. Apple growers say they're waiting to see 
if Mother Nature gives them a final burst of water sometime over 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we receive no moisture in the next month, that could have a  
negative effect. If you have plenty of apples and they're smaller, 
that could bring your volume down,'' Powell said.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Salons Offering Free Condoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hair stylist Jean Arnold has been listening to  
clients talk about their love lives for the past 25 years. Now, 
she's doing more than just listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold is one of 25 beauty salon owners in the nation's capital  
giving her customers free condoms with each cut, color or setting. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of a month-old pilot program sponsored by the District  
of Columbia's Department of Health aimed at preventing the spread 
of AIDS among black women by giving them condoms to be used by 
their boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1,024 district women who reported having AIDS between  
1995 and 1998, 970 were black, health department statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold says it's easy to talk to her clients about safe sex.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're like a big sister to them after they come to you for a  
while,'' said Arnold, who owns Mode Beauty Salon in a low-income 
area near Howard University in Northwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way I help teen-agers get protection,'' she said. ``They  
might not buy condoms on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The condoms she distributes, unlike those in stores, are hidden  
inside shiny black make-up compacts. Also inside is an insert 
explaining how using condoms can prevent HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Women say they love the compact's design, said Lisa Hill, who  
owns Braid-a-Beauty on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of women feel embarrassed carrying condoms, and carrying  
the compact makes it a little bit easier,'' Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	City health officials designed the compact with that in mind,  
said Ronald E. Lewis, director of the D.C. Administration for 
HIV/AIDS, saying the concealment removed a ``psychological 
barrier'' to carrying a condom. Each compact with a condom costs 
the city $1.85, said spokeswoman Judith Johnson. In stores, condoms 
cost $3 to $4 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's policy is to distribute condoms to those 16 or older,  
he said, but some salon owners give the compacts to younger 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catholic Archdiocese of Washington contends city health  
officials should be encouraging abstinence, particularly among 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only way to protect the sexual health of women and to  
end pregnancies out of wedlock,'' said archdiocese spokeswoman 
Susan Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
	She also questioned whether hair stylists should play a role in  
the fight against AIDS. ``It's questionable to use beauty salons to 
distribute medical supplies,'' Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill disagreed: ``They feel very comfortable talking about this  
with me. They're here for a long time, and we develop an intimate 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The D.C. Department of Health seems undeterred by criticism. It  
has given each participating salon 300 compacts and 1,000 condom 
refills. Salon owners say they give out five to 25 compacts a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the program may be expanded throughout the city and  
beyond its borders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will closely evaluate and refine the program in coming  
months, and hope that it provides a model for other cities,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> US Airways Workers Get Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Ticket agents, gate workers and other  
service workers at US Airways have won the right to join the 
Communications Workers of America after a lengthy legal battle with 
the airline, union officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 7,806 workers eligible to vote, 5,215 cast ballots in  
favor of the union, according to the National Mediation Board, 
which counted ballots Friday. About 10,000 workers will be covered 
by the union, but only those working for US Airways in 1996 were 
eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge victory,'' said Candice Johnson, spokeswoman for  
the CWA. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways spokesman Richard Weintraub said simply: ``We will be  
working with the union.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was ordered in June by the mediation board after two  
previous votes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first vote, held Jan. 30, 1997, the Communications  
Workers fell short of a majority but appealed to the mediation 
board. The board ruled US Airways had tainted the election by 
holding employer-employee discussions and ordered a second vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 29, 1997, a majority of workers voted in favor of  
unionizing. The airline sued in U.S. District Court and lost, but 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia subsequently 
ruled in favor of the airline and set aside those results. 
</P>
<P>
	That threw the matter back to the National Mediation Board,  
which ordered the third vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson said the vote indicates workers are frustrated by  
contract talks with the airline, based in Arlington. The union will 
press for improvements in the retirement plan, family health care 
benefits and job security, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways ticket agents are among the best-paid in the  
industry, with a top scale of $20.30 an hour, thanks to a nearly 14 
percent increase approved in early June by the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay raises, however, were the result of pressure from the  
union, Ms. Johnson said. The union had negotiated with the airline 
for months before the second unionization vote was overturned by 
the appeals court.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court CD-ROM Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supremes have a new greatest-hits  
collection, but don't expect to hear Diana Ross. The featured 
vocalists are Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the late Justice 
William J. Brennan and other current and past members of the 
nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court's Greatest Hits'' is a CD-ROM compiled by a  
Northwestern University political science professor, with 
recordings of oral arguments in 50 major cases dating back to 1957, 
plus texts of the court's opinions and graphics showing how the 
justices voted. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone with a computer and the proper software can hear:  
</P>
<P>
	--The late Justice Felix Frankfurter sparring with a lawyer in an  
obscenity case; 
</P>
<P>
	--Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski arguing for release  
of the Nixon tapes; 
</P>
<P>
	--Justice John Paul Stevens' announcement of the court's  
unanimous 1997 decision that let Paula Jones immediately pursue her 
sex-harassment case against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the joke that went as flat as a pancake  
during the argument in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion-rights case. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sarah Weddington finished arguing and took her seat beside  
co-counsel Linda N. Coffee, assistant Texas attorney general Jay 
Floyd took the podium and said, ``It's an old joke, but when a man 
argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they're going to 
have the last word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was met with dead silence.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the power of the audio,'' says Jerry Goldman, the  
Northwestern political science professor who compiled the CD-ROM 
using Supreme Court audiotapes available through the National 
Archives. The court was not involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be easy to use,'' Goldman said. ``I wanted it  
to be accessible, authoritative, and if I could make it engaging, 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Users of the CD-ROM can listen to the full oral argument in 50  
cases and decision announcements in many of them. Arguments are an 
hour long -- or two hours in cases before 1969 -- so there's a guide 
to help listeners zip to high points. 
</P>
<P>
	While listening to an argument, users can read the court's  
written opinion or see a picture of the justices who decided that 
case, with highlights showing who voted in the majority and who 
voted in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeners can click on a voice sample of each justice, so they  
can tell who is speaking during an argument. And there are 
biographies of the 26 justices who sat on the 50 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The CD-ROM is an offshoot of the ``Oyez'' Internet Web site  
created by Goldman three years ago. Visitors to the Web site can 
listen to more than 800 Supreme Court arguments since 1955, when 
tape-recording began at the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The court decided in 1993 to let virtually anyone get copies of  
the argument recordings from the National Archives after another 
law professor put out a set of cassette tapes with excerpts from 
high court arguments. No television cameras are allowed in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In choosing the 50 cases, Goldman said, ``I tried to identify  
core cases I thought would be included in a two-semester course in 
constitutional law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are some gems. When Frankfurter peppers an attorney with  
questions in the 1957 obscenity case, ``He's just so crotchety,'' 
Goldman said. ``You know that's a tough guy to please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the 1996 opinion that  
required Virginia Military Institute to admit women students or 
give up public funding, ``She spoke to the American public ... and 
brought the decision into lay terms,'' Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I entitled it the greatest hits because ... I wanted to make  
this mostly inaccessible institution accessible,'' Goldman said. 
``I want people to know they too can have this experience'' of 
hearing law made at the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- The CD-ROM can be purchased for $29.95 from the  
Northwestern University Press or through the Association of 
American University Presses catalogue at aaup.uchicago.edu on the 
Internet. The Northwestern University Press can be reached at

<HEADLINE> Bengals Safety Injured in Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Cincinnati Bengals safety Kelvin Moore was  
strapped to backboard and taken from the field on a cart Friday 
night after his head hit the knee of Detroit Lions wide receiver 
Brian Stablein. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Lions officials, Moore sustained a cervical spine  
injury and was conscious and had motor functions when he was taken 
to POH Medical Center where he was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore landed awkwardly and lay motionless on the turf at the  
Silverdome after falling injured at 9:47 of the third quarter with 
the Lions leading 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was delayed about 12 minutes while medical personnel  
placed him on the backboard and put a neck brace on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Tressa Gardner of POH Medical Center said Moore was in  
stable condition but declined to immediately discuss the extent of 
the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	After his team's 16-0 loss, Bengals coach Bruce Coslet said  
Moore had injuries to two vertebra in his neck, and ``that's all I 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They said he gained some feeling in the extremities on the  
field, so that's a real good sign, but who knows,'' Coslet said. 
``We'll just wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything I'd say at this point is pure speculation, and I am  
completely out of my area of expertise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, a 24-year-old rookie free agent out of Morgan State,  
spent most of last season on the practice squad but was on the 
active team for the last four games, playing mostly on special 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	As medical personnel tended to Moore, the Silverdome's sparse  
crowd fell silent, reminiscent of two years ago when Lions 
linebacker Reggie Brown sustained a career-ending neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit offensive lineman Mike Utley was paralyzed from the  
waist down after falling on his head after a collision in a game in 
1991.

<HEADLINE> ABC's `Millionaire' Quiz Show Goofs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Association Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A graduate student got the $64,000 question  
right, but a game show called it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ABC's new quiz show is making up for its prime-time goof by  
giving David Honea another shot at becoming a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
	Honea, a 31-year-old doctoral student in computer engineering  
from Raleigh, had won $32,000 on the new show, ``Who Wants to Be a 
Millionaire.'' But his bid for $1 million, taped Wednesday and 
broadcast Thursday night, ended with a question asking which of the 
five Great Lakes is the second largest in area after Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
	A correct answer would have given him $64,000 and put him only  
four questions away from the big prize. Honea said Lake Huron. The 
show said Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Honea accepted the results from show host Regis Philbin, but  
decided later to voice his doubts. ``A couple of other contestants 
said, `You've got to talk to them because you were right,''' Honea 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After several hours of fact-checking, the show's executive  
producer, Michael Davies, returned with the news: Honea was correct 
and the show was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You don't have to worry. I can tell you right now  
you've won $64,000 and you are going to get a chance to win from 
here,''' Honea said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt awful,'' Davies told The New York Times. He said the  
confusion stemmed from the fact that Lake Michigan is 
second-largest in volume but Lake Huron is second-largest in 
surface area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game show makes mistakes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the end of Thursday's broadcast, the show explained that it  
had erred and that Honea would be back to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to appear in the final show, to be taped Aug. 28  
and broadcast Aug. 29. ABC is running the show nightly for two 
weeks with a day off for ``Monday Night Football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Honea answers another question correctly, he wins $125,000  
and a chance to keep playing. If he answers incorrectly, it's back 
to $32,000. He also can choose not to answer after hearing the 
question and keep the $64,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'll take too many risks with that amount of  
money,'' Honea said. ``After that, I might be scared to answer even 
if they were asking your mother's name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show was intended to evoke the old quiz shows that  
enthralled the nation in the 1950s until some were found to be 
rigged. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first three airings, Monday through Wednesday, the show  
was the most-watched during its time period, according to Nielsen 
Media Research figures measuring roughly half the nation.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Exchange OKs Late Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Accelerating a move toward longer trading days,  
the Chicago Stock Exchange said Friday it will extend its trading 
hours into the late afternoon to snare an increasing number of 
investors who want to buy and sell outside traditional market 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driving factor here is listening to investor needs,''  
exchange chief executive Bob Forney said Friday. Investors ``don't 
believe that the only time to buy is between 9 o'clock and 4 
o'clock,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by the nation's third-largest stock exchange -- which  
accounts for about 3 percent of U.S. stocks traded daily -- beats 
industry stalwarts the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock 
Market to the punch in shaking up the way financial markets have 
done business for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have announced plans to extend their hours, but have put  
off implementation until at least next year to further study the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange is one of several regional stock exchanges  
that trade the same stocks as those traded in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in October, it will allow limited trading of a variety  
of top corporations between 4 p.m. Eastern time and 6:30 p.m. 
Eastern time. Included will be stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poors 100 
index and Nasdaq 100 index, as well as the 50 to 100 most-active 
issues that aren't in those indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect investors from wide price swings that might take  
place when only a small number of people are trading, investors 
will only be allowed to buy and sell through ``limit orders.'' This 
means buyers will have to state beforehand the maximum price they 
are willing to pay and sellers will have state the minimum price at 
which they are willing to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision gives an increasing number of individual investors  
a more traditional outlet for doing business than online firms. 
</P>
<P>
	With U.S. markets' current hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern  
time, investors on the West Coast get shut out after lunch, 
although the Pacific Exchange allows trading until 4:30 p.m. 
Between 20 percent to 25 percent of online trades by individual 
investors are placed after hours. 
</P>
<P>
	That has led to the creation of a number of electronic  
competitors vying for after-hours business. Just this week, ETrade 
Group Inc. -- the second-biggest online broker -- said it would work 
with Reuters Group Plc's Instinet, which operates the largest 
electronic trading network, to begin offering after-hours trading 
to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an important step -- the first move by a traditional staid  
exchange into a world that has been solely an e-commerce place,'' 
said James Punishill, a securities analyst for Forrester Research 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange also could profit from being the first to  
experiment with new ways as the ``stodgy'' NYSE and Nasdaq, 
``locked themselves out of this market for the next 12 months,'' 
Punishill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange said it expects fast approval from the  
Securities and Exchange Commission because it already has a 
sophisticated electronic trading system in place and would have 
minimal effects on staffing. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending hours is expected to put additional stress on the  
financial service industry, which is currently scrambling to fix 
any potential Year 2000 computer problems and switch next year to 
stock prices quoted in decimals instead of fractions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realize the hours may change at a time that's not real  
convenient to everybody,'' Forney said. ``We're willing to take the 
risk and see if we're right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several large brokerage firms in Chicago declined comment Friday  
on how the change would affect their staffing. But the exchange is 
confident of participation by the largest of the 150 brokerages 
connected to its electronic system, Forney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move could be trouble for smaller firms.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this would become effective, it would almost put a little  
company like this out of business,'' said Jay Klopfenstein, owner 
of Chicago-based Norwood Securities. ``We could not afford to hire 
somebody to go those extra hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC and others have expressed concern about the risks for  
individual investors in after-hours trading because of thin trading 
volume, which could results in large price swings. 
</P>
<P>
	Forney said such concerns will be addressed by the  
limit-orders-only rule and the decision to extend trading only to 
6:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European shares closed higher Friday, spurred by  
news of merger talks among utilities and good performances by 
banks, pharmaceuticals and technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	European shares also were buoyed by the strong opening by U.S.  
stocks, as the dollar perked up against the yen from Thursday's 
seven-month low. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies closed up  
2.61 points, or 0.9 percent, at 305.55. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 
Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined the 
single currency, was up 3.34 points at 319.44 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was up 35.91 points at  
3,715.39 points, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was up 29.17 points at 
3,666.40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	News that German utilities Veba and Viag are discussing a merger  
that could be worth around $5 billion drove the Dow Jones Stoxx 
Conglomerate index 1.8 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The 8.4 billion euros double bid by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux for  
Belgium's Tractebel and Sita also buoyed the utility sector, 
pushing Tractebel's shares sharply higher. The Dow Jones Stoxx 
Utility index closed up 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The entry of several banks and of pharmaceutical giant Roche  
into the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index gave the banking and drug 
sectors a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, HSBC bank, which became a component of the Dow Jones  
Stoxx 50 index, closed up 16 pence at 765 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE-100 index of blue-chip shares was up 1 percent at  
6,180.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In other domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was up  
1.3 percent to 5254.14, the Paris CAC-40 index was 1.4 percent 
higher to 4,472.00, and Milan's MIBtel index rose 0.9 percent to 
33,280.00. Amsterdam's AEX Index rose 0.7 percent to 564.54 and 
Belgium's Bel-20 index rose 0.6 percent to 3,108.59.

<HEADLINE> Naval Observatory Erects Time Ball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A large bronze-colored ball has risen on a  
tall metal mast over the U.S. Naval Observatory, awaiting its 
chance to mark the arrival of the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time ball will be the official marker of the beginning of  
the year 2000 and the beginning of the Third Millennium in 2001,'' 
the Naval Observatory announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the popular Times Square New Year extravaganza in New York  
is the best known example of dropping a ball to mark an event, the 
tradition was begun by the Naval Observatory in 1845. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, the Observatory was near the Potomac River and a  
ball was dropped every day at noon to help ship's masters set their 
chronometers. That was last done in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	The dropping of the time ball to usher in the year 2000 will be  
the local culmination of a ``round-the-world time ball drop,'' in 
which time balls will mark the beginning of the New Year as it 
sweeps westward from the International Date Line across New 
Zealand, Australia, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Calculating and reporting the exact time has been part of the  
Naval Observatory's mission since its beginning, as correct time is 
needed for accurate navigation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the time ball drop to mark the arrival of the year 2000  
will be part of a worldwide celebration, the Observatory will 
repeat the process a year later, stressing that the new millennium 
does not begin until that date. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end of the second millennium and the beginning of the  
third will be reached on Jan. 1, 2001,'' the Observatory says in a 
statement. ``This date is based on the now globally recognized 
Gregorian calendar. Rather than starting with the year zero, years 
in this calendar begin with the date Jan. 1, 1 Anno Domini. 
Consequently, the next millennium does not begin until Jan. 1, 
2001.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Stumbles on Drug Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Why now? For months, George W. Bush  
successfully dodged questions about whether he used drugs with an 
artful reply that he acted irresponsibly in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His sudden decision to offer partial, unsatisfying answers is  
baffling. 
</P>
<P>
	The hubbub over have-you-ever questions squandered momentum Bush  
had built with a convincing victory in Iowa's straw poll last 
Saturday. It also exposed weaknesses that were ignored or unnoticed 
while his campaign rocketed almost effortlessly to the top of the 
Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift of strategy left veteran political consultants shaking  
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't need to be talking about this,'' said Ed Gillespie,  
a Republican operative. Even supporters who commended Bush for 
talking about the subject said he did so clumsily. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, he was back on message and would only say: ``I told  
the American people that years ago I made some mistakes. I've 
learned from those mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle suggested that Bush's  
background was getting less scrutiny than President Clinton's, the 
questions about drugs started picking up. News organizations 
surveyed the candidates about past drug usage. Bush, alone, refused 
to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there is no evidence or credible allegation that he has  
ever violated drug laws, Bush kept getting peppered with the 
questions. He finally lost his cool during a home state news 
conference. Leveling dark accusations against unnamed rivals who 
``planted'' the rumors, Bush vowed not to answer the questions. 
``The people of America are sick and tired of this kind of 
politics,'' he said. ``And I'm not participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, he decided to participate, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News wanted to know if he could answer the  
question posed to federal employees in standard background checks: 
Did he use illegal drugs in the last seven years? 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought clarification of the question, which a senior  
adviser later said was confusing. That gave him a little time to 
consider whether to reply -- and how to frame his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush  
decided it was fair to expect a presidential candidate to answer 
the same question posed to federal employees. He also felt it would 
be a political benefit to put some distance between his campaign 
and any ``mistakes'' he refuses to talk about. And, finally, Bush 
assumed the headlines would be that he was committed to federal 
background checks -- and would live by the same standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush team was surprised the next day when news reports  
focused on him saying he hadn't used illegal drugs in seven years. 
That left open the possibility that he had broken the law when his 
father was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference Thursday allowed Bush to cast any past drug  
usage as a more distant memory. He used a more stringent 15-year 
standard set by the Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference also gave television networks footage of  
Bush calmly discussing the matter, replacing the heated exchange 
networks had on videotape from the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks, Bush said he could meet the anti-drug  
standards of his father's White House. At least one top aide 
thought that meant he was ruling out drug usage for the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked whether he could have passed the test when  
his father was president, Bush said yes. That was the first clue 
for some aides that Bush was going back 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It raised more questions.  
</P>
<P>
	What about when his father was vice president?  
</P>
<P>
	Why not answer the question posed to current White House  
employees? The FBI asks them if they used drugs since their 18th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he must draw the line somewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides insist that will be the last Bush will say about the  
matter. But he has already redrawn the lines. Seven years. Fifteen 
years. Twenty-five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush may be able to finesse the drug issue throughout the  
campaign, political consultants in both parties say. But the 
episode revealed what can happen to a cautious, coached candidate 
when he is knocked off message; he changed course twice in two 
days, lost his cool and is still open to accusations that he won't 
play by the rules set for White House workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is still largely untried in a national campaign, when a new  
crisis can emerge almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's next? Abortion. Let's watch him handle that  
under fire one day,'' said Democratic consultant David Brown. 
``He's great with smiling. He shakes hands well, but when it gets 
down to answering tough questions, he's just not ready.''

<HEADLINE> Irvan Crashes at Michigan Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Ernie Irvan had only a bruised lung and a  
mild head injury after crashing Friday at Michigan Speedway, five 
years to the day after a near-fatal wreck on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan was in fair condition at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in  
nearby Ypsilanti. He will not race this weekend, and will be 
replaced Sunday in the Pepsi 400 by Dick Trickle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither of the conditions requires any surgical  
intervention,'' Dr. Errol Erlandson said Friday in a statement 
released about six hours after the 9:45 a.m. crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan, 40, was knocked unconscious in the crash in turn 4 during  
a Busch Grand National practice session, but became responsive as 
he was being transported to the infield medical center. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers trying to get Irvan out had to cut the roof from his  
car. The Winston Cup star appeared to lose control of his Pontiac 
and spun in turn 4 on the 2-mile superspeedway. The rear quarter 
panel struck the concrete wall before the driver's side made 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was removed from the car, Irvan appeared to pick his arm  
up in what looked like a wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was alert, oriented and able to move his arms and legs,''  
track spokesman Tommy Cameron said. ``He was talking to the 
doctors. He was answering their questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Frye, general manager of Irvan's team, said the seriousness  
of 1994 accident was part of the reason for Irvan's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was scary,'' Frye said. ``Anytime anything like this  
happens, it makes you stop and think. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe he's going to be just fine,''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, it brought back horrible memories.  
</P>
<P>
	When Irvan crashed in turn 2 during Winston Cup practice on Aug.  
20, 1994, he was unconscious for two days. Irvan had critical brain 
and chest injuries. He was given only a 10-percent chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But he returned to the circuit on Oct. 1, 1995, in North  
Wilkesboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan had planned to compete in both the Busch Series race  
Saturday and the Winston Cup event . He co-owns the Busch car, and 
is in his second year driving the Winston Cup car for MB2 
Motorsports. Last month, Irvan's contract was extended through the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan has 15 Winston Cup victories, but none since taking the  
June race at Michigan in 1997. He is 26th this year in the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvan was attempting to make his third Busch start this season.  
His only other Busch races were in Richmond, Va., on May 14, and in 
Dover, Del., on June 5. He was involved in a three-car crash and 
failed to finish the Dover race. 
</P>
<P>
	Trickle, a 57-year-old driver without a Winston Cup ride this  
weekend, had planned to race his Busch car against Irvan. Trickle 
had mixed emotions about replacing Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't deserve this,'' Trickle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Several other drivers also made contact with the wall Friday.  
Ted Christopher and Gus Wasson hit during Busch practice. 
Christopher was examined in the infield care center and released 
with a bruised right knee. Wasson was examined and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Hubert hit the wall in turn 2 during Winston Cup practice.  
He was examined and released.

<HEADLINE>  WNBA's Kim Perrot Dies at 32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Kim Perrot never gave failure a second thought.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had to battle,'' Perrot said through tears when  
she made her cancer public last February. ``And this is just 
another battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the drive that took the 5-foot-5 dynamo from  
Louisiana to Europe and eventually to WNBA championships with the 
Houston Comets, the gritty point guard died Thursday at the 
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. She was 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Her closest friend, two-time league Most Valuable Player Cynthia  
Cooper, was at Perrot's bedside when she died. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world is not as good as it was before,'' said Carroll  
Dawson, the Comets' executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lafayette, La., native wasn't even a contender at draft time  
before the Women's National Basketball Association's debut season 
in 1997. Six seasons playing in Europe guaranteed her nothing more 
than a tryout with Comets coach Van Chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
	But her petite frame belied a fierce determination that won over  
Chancellor and her teammates and later electrified fans. Her 
ferocious play helped the Comets clinch back-to-back championships 
in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Perrot averaged 8.5 points and 4.7 assists, totaled  
84 steals in 30 regular-season games and placed second in voting 
for WNBA Defensive Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire WNBA family is devastated by this tragic loss,''  
WNBA President Val Ackerman said a statement. ``We will remember 
Kim as a woman of great heart and indomitable courage who refused 
to be daunted by any challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, severe headaches forced her to doctors'  
offices, and they delivered a painful diagnosis: A type of lung 
cancer that hits young nonsmokers had spread to her brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally changed my life,'' Perrot told Houston television  
station KTRK shortly after disclosing her illness. ``I've never 
been really sick or injured and now I'm faced with life or death. 
It's just tough. All I can do is put it in the hands of the Lord.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as she battled cancer, Perrot suffered additional heartache  
when her sister, Linette, was stabbed to death in April by a 
roommate in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, where the Comets were preparing for tonight's  
game against the Los Angeles Sparks, Chancellor said Perrot's 
infectious positive outlook will be her legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You meet a person as warm and sincere as Kim is, even though  
she's left us at this time, she'll continue to be an inspiration to 
teammates, to me,'' he said. ``What a wonderful human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Tammy Jackson said the Comets have lost a family  
member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kim's faith and determination in life will constantly inspire  
us both as individuals and as a team,'' she said. ``Her fire will 
always motivate us to not only win games but to enjoy life. Number 
10 will always be a member of the Houston Comets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, Perrot's family issued a statement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Kim was an inspiration to each of us, and she has touched all  
of our lives in so many ways,'' the statement said. ``We will 
always love her and cherish her in our hearts, and we know that 
each of you will too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets plan to play tonight's game against the Sparks.  
</P>
<P>
	``They thought she would want them to play, and I can guarantee  
you that she did. She would be kicking their tails if they didn't 
play,'' Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot's condition worsened during a second trip to Mexico,  
where she had been receiving alternative treatment. She returned to 
Houston last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the will to win. I won't accept anything less than  
winning.'' she told the television interviewer. ``With this type of 
illness I'm facing now, I take the same approach. I won't be 
defeated. I just feel confident this is just a challenge, just a 
trial for me ... I work really well under pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After brain surgery, Perrot entered radiation treatment to  
attack tumors in her head. She went to Mexico for alternative 
medical procedures rather than submit to chemotherapy prescribed by 
her Houston doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her fight off the court against cancer was heroic and brave,''  
Houston Mayor Lee Brown said. ``Although she lost her battle, she 
leaves the legacy of a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot played four seasons, 1986-1990, for the University of  
Southwestern Louisiana's Ragin' Cajuns. While there, she scored 58 
points in a game against Southeastern Louisiana in 1990, the 
second-highest total in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot held 26 other Ragin' Cajuns records, including the career  
scoring mark of 2,157 points. 
</P>
<P>
	From Louisiana, she traveled to Europe, playing for women's  
professional basketball teams for six seasons in Sweden, Germany, 
Israel and France before returning to the United States in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of her last public appearances, on June 22, Perrot  
accepted her second championship ring at a Comets home game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would have thought Kim Perrot would be a two-time WNBA  
champion?'' she said. ``When no one else believed in me, my 
teammates and the fans stuck with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her illness, Perrot made about 100 public appearances as  
a motivational speaker, often at schools. In one of her last 
regular columns for the Houston Chronicle's teen supplement 
``Yo!,'' she told young women there was nothing they could not 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such an exciting time to be a female athlete in the  
U.S.A,'' she wrote. ``I encourage you young women to follow your 
dreams. It will take a lot of hard work and determination, but 
there are no limits to what you can do.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Sues Hospital for Saving Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A doctor who attempted suicide two years ago  
is suing the hospital he worked for after doctors saved his life 
following a stroke -- ignoring his instructions to let him die. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Marshall Klavan wrote a living will in 1993 asking that he  
never be kept alive on life support after being haunted for years 
by memories of his father's stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, 67-year-old Klavan is living the life he tried to avoid.  
After doctors helped him recuperate from a stroke that followed his 
suicide attempt, he now sits in a wheelchair unable to talk. 
</P>
<P>
	The stroke left him physically and mentally incompetent, his  
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The irony of all this is he was determined not to go through  
what his dad went through. His dad had a devastating stroke and 
lived for years just drooling from the mouth,'' attorney James 
Lewis Griffith said Friday. ``Now, look where he's at. He's a man 
who can't see, can't read, can't speak, can't take care of 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to court documents, Klavan could live another 18 years  
in a nursing home that costs his family $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The court-appointed guardian for Klavan has filed a ``wrongful  
life'' lawsuit against Crozer-Chester Medical Center in federal 
court, arguing that doctors used ``heroic lifesaving measures'' to 
save Klavan twice, but violated his 14th Amendment right to refuse 
unwanted medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Klavan's situation cries out for prompt and definitive  
judicial resolution,'' U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell ruled 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, that the case needs to be addressed in state  
court before being heard in federal court. Griffith said he is 
reviewing his options. 
</P>
<P>
	Klavan was chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the Delaware  
County hospital in April 1997 when he wrote his suicide notes and 
took an overdose of drugs in his office. His secretary found him 
the following morning, near death. He was rushed to the hospital 
and resuscitated. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, hospital officials took Klavan off life support as  
requested in his living will. When his condition worsened the next 
day, the hospital increased its care and Klavan had a stroke, 
according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith thinks doctors' emotions played a part in their  
decision to save their colleague's life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hospital records show they agreed to follow the living will,''  
he said. Then hours later, he said, they ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
	Crozer-Chester attorney Rebecca Prince declined to comment  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In court filings, however, hospital lawyers said the living will  
was put in doubt because it was not signed by two witnesses, as 
required by law. They also cited the suicide notes that cast doubt 
on Klavan's state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the attorneys' motion to have the case dismissed,  
the right to die ``is balanced against the state's interest in 
protection of third parties, prevention of suicide, and protection 
of the ethical integrity of the medical community and preservation 
of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A staff attorney for Choice in Dying -- the nonprofit  
organization that created the living will in 1967 -- said most 
living wills are uncomplicated and properly executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is not a pure case,'' Carol Sieger said. In all  
cases, people are usually resuscitated in 911 emergency situations 
despite living wills, which usually only pertain to long-term 
illnesses or deteriorating medical conditions -- not suicide, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would never had a stroke if he had not attempted suicide,''  
she said. ``If it were me, I would not put much credence to a 
doctor's living will right before an attempt at suicide.''

<HEADLINE> First Union Hooks Up With Dell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- First Union Corp. is encouraging its  
70,000 employees to buy personal computers so they can work at home 
and become more familiar with the company's online banking 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering $500 discounts on PCs made by Dell and loans at prime  
rate, or 8 percent, officials at the nation's sixth-largest bank 
believe the program will create a contented, more productive and 
computer-savvy work force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really taking off,'' Sandy Morgart, a vice president at  
the bank's training center, said Friday. ``We're averaging about 
150 orders per week. And we're registered 3,000 hits to an internal 
bulletin board and more than 2,500 calls to a special toll-free 
hotline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program began when officials at the training center were  
brainstorming for ideas to encourage new employees to use the 
bank's online products on their own computers. The bank has been 
making a strong push in online bill-paying, securities trading and 
other Internet-based products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	While employees were training on the latest PCs at work, Morgart  
said, some did not have their own computers at home. Others own 
computers that weren't powerful enough to run the bank's software. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt if they couldn't afford to buy them, let's find a way  
to make it more affordable,'' she said. ``First Union already is 
recognizing that our customer base is moving in this direction, and 
it's the same thing for our employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell told First Union, ``the best participation rate they have  
achieved in this type of program was 50 percent at a company with 
15,000 employees. We're hoping to match that,'' Mogart said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean as many 35,000 new computer sales for Dell.  
First Union officials say they got the Dell computers at a big 
discount because they are buying so many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell spokeswoman Ann Birlin said the collaboration will benefit  
everyone involved.

	``Some companies go a little further than others,'' she said.  
``For example, Shell Oil went the extra mile by offering (computer) 
notebooks to its employees at a discount and they even helped pay 
for them for 12 months. I believe at least 30 percent of the 
workers went for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides improving the skills of its workers, the program allows  
workers to hook into the office from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have a lot of telecommuting happening across the  
company,'' Morgart said. ``And this is not just something for 
people with kids. Workers who are single also need a little balance 
in their lives, and this allows them to do their work the way they 
want to.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Bans Aussie From Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Australian Olympic official Phil Coles,  
already stripped of most of his duties as an IOC member, was told 
Friday he also is banned from attending meetings of the Australian 
national Olympic committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was virtually suspended by the International Olympic  
Committee in June for ``serious negligence'' in writing notes about 
his colleagues, some not very flattering. 
</P>
<P>
	He was barred from serving on any IOC commissions for two years  
and forced to resign from the board of the Sydney organizing 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles had petitioned IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch to be  
allowed to attend meetings of the Australian Olympic Committee, 
where he has been a senior official for many years. But the request 
was rejected Friday at a meeting of the IOC executive board in 
Seville on the eve of the World Athletics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Kevan Gosper of Australia said Samaranch sent  
Coles a letter stating that ``his responsibility between now and 
2001 enables him only to attend an IOC session, and that's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said Samaranch had offered Coles the chance to visit him  
in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the matter. But he stressed 
that Samaranch would not change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mr. Coles wants to go and talk about it, fine, but the  
decision is final,'' Gosper said. ``The letter is very clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also received a ``most severe'' warning from the IOC in  
March for accepting lavish hospitality from Salt Lake bidders. 
Coles escaped expulsion, while 10 IOC members either resigned or 
were ousted in the Salt Lake vote-buying scandal.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Gains on Storm Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose sharply for the fourth day in a row  
Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as Tropical Storm Bret 
threatened to shut down Gulf Coast production rigs. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures gained, while grains and soybeans  
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for September delivery rose 4 cents to $2.938 for  
each 1,000 cubic feet amid predictions from the U.S. National 
Hurricane Center that the storm would strengthen into a hurricane 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas supplies in storage have fallen 5.6 percent below  
levels of a year ago after blistering heat forced utilities to 
power up plants to meet consumer demand from air conditioners and 
fans running overtime. It now must be replaced ahead of the busy 
winter heating season, and the threat of production outages for 
offshore platforms is causing concern that a colder-than-normal 
fall will bring shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Other energy futures finished mostly lower amid profit-taking  
after the spot crude contract, representing cash prices, jumped 
above $22 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude fell 9 cents to $21.88 a barrel; September heating  
oil fell .08 cent to 57.42 cents a pound; September unleaded 
gasoline fell .23 cent to 65.97 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
October rose 9 cents to $20.99 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures posted strong gain on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange amid higher prices on the cash market. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were expected to face pressure next week, however, from  
the latest U.S. cold storage report, which was expected to show 
frozen supplies reached a 10-year high in June. 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs rose 1.45 cents to 44.65 cents a pound;  
February pork bellies rose 1.17 cents to 55.32 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of  
Trade after some private forecasters predicted a greater 
possibility of rain in some dry growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some meteorologists were calling for increased rainfall in the  
next few days across the Midwest, while a tropical storm in the 
Gulf of Mexico opened the possibility for rain in the U.S. Delta. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ignored reports out of a crop tour of Midwestern  
farms, which indicated yields are likely to be far lower than 
current U.S. Agriculture Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the latest forecasts gave the market a chance to  
take a rest from strong gains made earlier this week. Still, the 
National Weather Service's 10-day forecast, released after trading 
had ended, called for only normal to below-normal precipitation in 
major growing states. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.86 1/2 a bushel; December corn  
fell 3 3/4 cents to $2.22 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 cent to 
$1.14 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5 cents to $4.72 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Says Food Supplements Spiked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Spiked food supplements are apparently  
responsible for the recent flood of positive tests for the banned 
steroid Nandrolone, track and field's medical chief said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation's medical committee, said athletes may have ingested 
Nandrolone unwittingly in unlabeled over-the-counter supplements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be totally inadvertent,'' he said in an interview on  
the eve of the World Championships, which have been overshadowed by 
a series of high-profile doping scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have been puzzled by the sudden resurgence of  
Nandrolone, a muscle-building drug that has been around for decades 
and detectable in urine tests for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint stars Merlene Ottey and Linford Christie are among those  
athletes who have tested positive for Nandrolone. On Friday, Dutch 
sprinter Troy Douglas' name was added to the growing list. 
</P>
<P>
	The wave of Nandrolone cases spread Friday to the Arab Games in  
Amman, Jordan, where two Moroccan women athletes were stripped of 
their medals after positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seeming epidemic spread of this stems from food  
supplements spiked with Nandrolone,'' Ljungqvist said. ``The 
problem is that athletes may have taken it without real control. 
The food supplements may not have been labeled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Supplements, increasingly popular with athletes looking for a  
legal way to sharpen their fitness and performance, are readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``The producers of food supplements are not producing solely for  
the sports community,'' Ljungqvist said. ``They do it for the 
general public, for elderly people. In some countries, even today, 
some of the banned substances are not looked upon as pharmaceutical 
drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungqvist said the unusually high number of veteran athletes  
being caught could be the result of their reliance on food 
supplements to stretch their careers an extra few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ottey and Christie are 39, Douglas is 37.  
</P>
<P>
	Under IAAF rules, an athlete is considered guilty of a doping  
offense based on the presence of a banned substance in his body -- 
regardless of how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungqvist said this policy will not change even if athletes  
took Nandrolone unwittingly. But he said athletes could have a 
legal case to challenge any suspension from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the athlete can clearly show that he has got a contaminated  
substance or food supplement from somewhere, then it's up to the 
lawyers to evaluate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungqvist cited a recent case in his native Sweden of an  
athlete who took ``what was supposed to be a pure substance and 
turned out to be contaminated. He was disqualified from competition 
but exonerated from any further ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ljungqvist said the burden of proof would be on the athlete.  
</P>
<P>
	``The athlete has to make sure that no banned substance enters  
his body,'' he said. ``He is responsible. The athlete can't just 
claim, `I didn't know.' He has to give solid proof.''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Begins Specialty Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet retailer Amazon.com has a new way to  
help gift buyers find its most popular products in 3,000 different 
cities, universities and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, called Purchase Circles, can help shoppers track  
everything from the most popular CDs in Miami to best-selling books 
at Harvard University. The Purchase Circle service will appear on 
Amazon.com's Web site on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an example of the company's use of technology to collect  
consumer data, and then use the information to make online shopping 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Amazon.com has already found great success with a  
service that suggests merchandise to suit shoppers' own interests. 
A customer selecting a CD of a trumpet concerto by Haydn now sees a 
list of CDs that others who have bought the same recording have 
also ordered from Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amazon has really been one of the pioneers in using data about  
a particular person to better their business,'' said Ken Cassar, an 
analyst at the Internet research firm Jupiter Communications. 
``This is just another effort by Amazon to make their site more 
than just a place to go to buy. They are giving customers lots of 
information at their fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To find the right Purchase Circle, Amazon.com customers will  
browse through lists of places, companies, schools, organizations 
or government agencies. Once the right circle is found, the 
customer chooses whether to search for a book, video or music. Then 
a list of the 10 most popular items bought by Amazon.com customers 
in that Purchase Circle appears. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance in Los Angeles right now, Amazon.com's No. 1 video  
is ``The Stanley Kubrick Collection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers in Anchorage, Alaska, like the book ``Hide Your Assets  
and Disappear: A Step-by-Step Guide to Vanishing Without A Trace'' 
by Edmund J. Pankau. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the U.S. Army, the most popular book is ``The Patterns of  
War Since the Eighteenth Century'' by Larry H. Addington. 
</P>
<P>
	To create a Purchase Circle, Amazon.com collects buying  
information based on what products it ships to a particular Zip 
code. It also tracks goods bought by people with the same e-mail 
address, such as allstate.com or army.mil. 
</P>
<P>
	In developing each top-selling list, the company also factors in  
what is unique about the products being bought in each particular 
area. For instance, books on the Mormon Church will likely be 
included in a Purchase Circle for Salt Lake City if a comparatively 
large number of such books sell in that city versus other areas 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say there are no privacy concerns with the new Purchase  
Circle service since the company does not release the preferences 
of any individuals and only creates a Purchase Circle after 
hundreds of items are bought in a particular area. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's new service exemplifies how it is integrating the  
Internet company PlanetAll into its business. 
</P>
<P>
	PlanetAll, which Amazon.com bought for $90 million a year ago,  
enables users to create an Internet address book and calendar that 
can be shared with others. That same ``community'' concept can be 
seen in the Purchase Circles.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Hostage Film Said Ill-Timed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Miramax Films picked the worst possible time  
-- back-to-school season -- to release ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' a 
black comedy about teens who hold their mean-spirited teacher 
hostage, education groups say. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's Friday opening comes four days after classes resumed  
at Columbine High School in Colorado for the first time since two 
students gunned down 12 schoolmates and a teacher and wounded 23 
others before killing themselves last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing is really unfortunate,'' said Kathleen Lyons,  
spokeswoman for the National Education Association. ``We find it 
appalling that Miramax would release a movie about kids hunting 
down teachers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax did not immediately return phone calls from The  
Associated Press, but sent a fax detailing the plot and a comment 
from first-time director Kevin Williamson, who has written several 
horror screenplays, including ``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did 
Last Summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope audiences find this movie to be funny, wicked and  
incredibly entertaining, but in addition I hope they take away the 
idea that we have all had bad experiences that can later become 
assets in life. You can turn the tables,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Tingle'' stars Helen Mirren as a malevolent teacher who  
is kidnapped by three students. Originally called ``Killing Mrs. 
Tingle,'' the movie's title was toned down after the Columbine 
shootings. The teacher is not killed, although she's injured and 
several scenes involve a menacing crossbow. 
</P>
<P>
	A United Artists theater in Alexandria, La., pulled ``Mrs.  
Tingle'' after receiving complaints about the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Tingle was directed by Kevin Williamson, screenwriter for  
horror films ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2.'' Last year, a Los Angeles 
County teen-ager stabbed his mother to death while a cousin held 
her down in a murder they said was inspired by the slasher in the 
``Scream'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Columbine, the entertainment industry has faced criticism  
that the violence in films, television and video games contributes 
to real-life violence. President Clinton and Congress have appealed 
to Hollywood to show more restraint. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of talk about Hollywood's role in this  
atmosphere of school violence,'' said David Griffith, director of 
governmental and public affairs for the National Association of 
State Boards of Education. ``This is turning a tin ear to pick the 
worst time to put this movie out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism may boost the box office for ``Mrs. Tingle,''  
which has not caught much advance attention from moviegoers, said 
Robert Bucksbaum, a film analyst for Reel Source Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie is a fairly harmless movie and has a happy ending,  
opined Bucksbaum, who saw it at an advance screening. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, teachers do have a right to go crazy about this  
movie because they're not represented well by Helen Mirren's 
character,'' Bucksbaum said. ``She really is the worst of the 
worst.''

<HEADLINE> Senator: Panama May Take US Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell said Friday he believes  
the government about to take office in Panama might allow U.S. 
counterdrug surveillance flights even though Panama Canal treaties 
require withdrawal of all U.S. forces by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are perfectly willing to consider it,''  
Coverdell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on 
Western Hemisphere affairs, said in a conference call with 
reporters after a visit to Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell, R-Ga., discussed the question with Panama's  
president-elect Mireya Moscoso, who takes office Sept. 1. He also 
visited Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. counternarcotics surveillance flights from Howard Air Force  
Base in Panama were a key element of American efforts to curb the 
flow of cocaine and heroin from South America. 
</P>
<P>
	The base was shut down in May as part of a phased withdrawal of  
U.S. forces from Panama. When Panama assumes control of the canal 
Dec. 31, all U.S. forces must be gone. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill the void left by the loss of Howard, surveillance  
flights are being flown from Aruba and Curacao, with a coastal base 
in Ecuador scheduled to perform a similar role in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell said U.S. operations from these locations would  
continue even if a deal is reached with Panama. Any such 
arrangement would not happen quickly, Coverdell indicated, because 
serious negotiations are not under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell said the United States, because of its resources, and  
Panama, because of location on the Colombian border, have a 
``special responsibility'' to work together to combat drug flows. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Panama tried for two years to negotiate a  
continued U.S. counternarcotics presence under a multinational 
umbrella. The talks ended in failure. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colombia, Coverdell said he came away with a sense of  
optimism that police, military and other components of 
counternarcotics operations are showing the necessary resolve to 
deal with the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not shrinking from it,'' he said. ``They are massing  
their capacity to take it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Coverdell said he does not dispute the  
characterization by White House counterdrug chief Barry McCaffrey 
that an emergency situation exists in Colombia, resulting partly 
from an explosion in coca cultivation.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Approves Gun-Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After prolonged lobbying by Gov. Gray  
Davis, the state Assembly has approved a bill aimed at curtailing 
the manufacture and sale of handguns known as Saturday Night 
Specials. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law will give California one of the strongest handgun  
safety standards in the country,'' said Luis Tolley of Los 
Angeles-based Handgun Control, which proposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved 43-26 on Thursday, would make it a  
misdemeanor to make or sell an unsafe handgun in California after 
Jan. 1, 2001. Handguns would have to have a safety device and pass 
firing and drop-safety tests in independent laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis already has signed bills to restrict assault weapons and  
limit gun purchases to one per month. The Senate, which backed an 
earlier version of the bill, now must consider the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, including the National Rifle Association, said the  
bill would not get handguns off the streets, since current guns 
would not be banned or confiscated. Existing guns could still be 
sold by private parties, though not by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't ban the old stuff. Everybody can have everything  
that exists,'' said NRA lobbyist Stephen Helsley. ``The 
black-market sale of handguns will increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat, also directed state agencies to halt their  
sales and transfers of confiscated firearms after a state inquiry 
found that more than 6,000 guns had been sold, traded or 
transferred by state government to gun dealers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Buford Furrow Jr., the man accused in the Aug. 10 shootings at a  
Jewish community center in Los Angeles, is believed to have used a 
gun once owned by a Washington state police department that sold 
the weapon to a gun dealer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Chief To Visit S. America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy  
chief, said Friday he plans to visit his counterparts in four South 
American countries during a tour next week. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control  
Policy, begins his trip in Brazil before moving on to Bolivia, Peru 
and Argentina. His visits will include meetings with each country's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey made a similar tour last month and met with leaders  
from Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. He also made stops in Aruba 
and Curacao. 
</P>
<P>
	``On this trip we'll continue to listen to the viewpoints of  
countries who have been very active in trying to build hemispheric 
cooperation,'' McCaffrey said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey recently requested a $1 billion increase in U.S.  
anti-narcotics aid to fight drug problems in Colombia, saying 
current efforts were falling short and the situation had become an 
emergency. On Friday, he said the production of coca, which is used 
to make cocaine, doubled in Columbia in three years, and heroin 
production went from nonexistent to six tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The `billion dollar proposal' is out there to allow the  
administration to seize the initiative,'' McCaffrey said. ``Have we 
moved fast enough? Of course not. But what I would also underscore 
is that this is not a U.S. problem, and it's not a Colombian 
problem. It's a multinational problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey also announced that his office will sponsor a Western  
Hemisphere drug policy leadership conference here in November. More 
than 30 governments will be invited to the gathering.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Rejects Air Canada Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Air Canada has asked the federal government to  
approve a plan that would see it take over Canadian's international 
business while the smaller airline focuses on domestic routes. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Airlines rejected the proposal, however, saying Friday  
that it's not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canadian's international routes are the most profitable part  
of our operation,'' Canadian Airlines spokesman Jeff Angel said 
from the airline's headquarters in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Canada proposal will form the basis of historic talks  
next week between the two carriers. The talks were made possible 
when Ottawa lifted domestic competition laws for 90 days so the two 
airlines and any other interested investors could share sensitive 
financial data to keep Canadian flying. 
</P>
<P>
	Transport Minister David Collenette gave Canadian and Air Canada  
the freedom to negotiate ticket prices, routes and shared capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Airlines, with 14,000 employees, is desperately seeking  
new investors to keep the debt-ridden carrier flying. Canadian says 
it needs up to $500 million to allow it to restructure and move 
away from what has been a chronic cash crisis over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, filed with the federal government, Air Canada  
said a successful deal with Canadian Airlines would include the 
purchase of Canadian's international routes, along with associated 
assets and liabilities; provide code-sharing opportunities for 
Canadian Airlines on Air Canada international routes; and allow 
Canadian keep its domestic operations to compete with Air Canada. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Auctions Cable TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German telecommunications giant Deutsche  
Telekom said Friday it has received initial bids for its lucrative 
cable television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that said they made offers included U.S.-based  
Callahan Associates International, Dutch-based United Pan-Europe 
Communications and Germany's PrimaCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. reportedly is in talks with Deutsche Bank to  
form an alliance for a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom spokesman Hans Ehnert said the bid deadline  
passed at noon Friday, but refused to release details on the 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has been ordered by the government to shed its  
cable TV units in the interest of competition. Telekom is Germany's 
leading cable provider, with a 34 percent market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehnert said the sale of all nine regional cable networks -- which  
have been valued at up to $10 billion -- isn't expected to be 
completed before next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not under time pressure,'' he said from the company's  
headquarters in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	The bids received Friday are non-binding offers that could lead  
to negotiations with any of the bidders, Ehnert said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were various reports Friday of companies forming groups to  
bid for Telekom's network, including European and U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan Associates International confirmed Friday it is leading  
a group of companies in a bid. They includes BancAmerica Equity 
Partners, Blackstone Capital Partners III, Capital Communications 
CDPQ, Texas Pacific Group and Angelo Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan Associates' chairman and founder is Richard J.  
Callahan, the former president of U S West Inc.'s international 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Pan-Europe Communications said it planned to make an  
initial bid for most, if not all, of the network. Spokeswoman 
Henrietta Hearst confirmed UPC plans to make a bid, though she said 
she couldn't discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's PrimaCom also said Friday it has bid for four of nine  
of Telekom's regional cable television units.

<HEADLINE> Congress Talks Back Through E-Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Erin Latta heard a rumor there might be  
new charges tied to people's use of e-mails, she whipped off an 
e-mail to her congressman and said she was dead set against it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., e-mailed her back within a day, saying  
there was nothing to the rumor, and he would oppose such fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very impressed,'' said Latta, 32, a homemaker in  
Redmond, Wash. ``I thought I probably would get (an e-mail 
response). I didn't think it would be so fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate members who used to rely on the postal service  
and news media to reach constituents are increasingly using e-mail 
to take their message directly to voters, although no one seems 
inclined to ditch the taxpayer financed system of mail for 
lawmakers known as the congressional frank. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, some offices now are sending bulk e-mails --  
hundreds of messages at a time -- with a single push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., e-mails his legislative schedule  
and an update on issues each Monday to about 5,000 constituents. 
Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., sends a cybernewsletter to between 
600 and 700 each Friday, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
R-Texas, has 10,000 names on his bulk e-mail list. 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 people signed up for bulk e-mails by Rep. Dennis Moore,  
D-Kan., less than a week after he started offering them this month. 
``So many people are on the Internet now, it would be foolish to 
ignore that pool,'' said Jack Martin, Moore's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail can be dispatched more quickly than mailed newsletters  
and don't strain members' postal budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people feel disenfranchised that they don't have  
access to the (political) system,'' said Inslee, whose most 
extensively distributed e-mail so far reached 1,200 people. ``This 
is the best cure for that malaise -- being able to have instant 
communication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inslee and other mass e-mailers point out they are not  
``spamming'' -- sending unwanted e-mails. People on congressional 
e-mail lists sign up at members' World Wide Web sites or by e-mail, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
	As long those guidelines are followed, e-mail is good for  
democracy, said Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., an 
anti-spam group in Green Brook, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to more quickly alienate a voter than to spam  
him,'' Catlett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has been getting steadily more high-tech.  
</P>
<P>
	No members had Web pages before the start of the 104th Congress  
in 1995, and now all but six do, said House Administration 
Committee spokesman Jason Poblete. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. House offices only sporadically had e-mail accounts  
before the 104th Congress, Capitol Hill's e-mail system now has 
about 10,000 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and staff can even order cafeteria food over the  
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, Congress for the first time even e-mailed a bill to  
the president for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, Congress has been slow to embrace  
mass e-mailing. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Administration Committee amended the mass mail -- or  
franking -- privilege in February to include mass e-mails. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, fewer than 3 percent of letters the House Franking  
Commission has reviewed have been e-mails, although the percentage 
is expected to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	The franking commission reviews House members' proposed mass  
mailings -- those going to more than 500 people -- to make sure they 
meet guidelines including that they lack campaign-related material 
or are being sent too close to an election, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, which will spend about $13 million this year on  
mail, has no such required approvals because members police 
themselves, according to a spokeswoman at the Senate Rules and 
Administration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and committees spent $29 million on mail last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every congressional office can, and does, receive e-mail  
from voters, most reply through regular mail. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail replies are too informal, impersonal or difficult to  
track, said staff in several offices that were contacted.

<HEADLINE>  Liberty 72, Rockers 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Becky Hammon scored 16 points as the New York  
Liberty romped over the Cleveland Rockers 72-55 on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophia Witherspoon added 15 for the Liberty, who learned of the  
death of Houston Comet guard Kim Perrot before the game. Her death 
was announced to the crowd of 16,782, who stood for a moment of 
silence at Madison Square Garden after a video tribute to Perrot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty, many of whom were crying at the start of the game,  
raced out to a 24-11 lead and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlakia Jones had 14 for the Rockers (6-25), who have lost a  
franchise-high eight consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Robinson added 11 for the Liberty (18-13), who clinched  
the Eastern Conference regular-season title with a victory over 
Washington on Tuesday. New York earned a first-round bye and 
homecourt advantage in the playoffs, which begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty, winners of five of their last seven games, visits  
Cleveland in the final game of the season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 40-21 at halftime, Cleveland came within 47-37 with  
13:05 remaining. New York went on a 13-3 run, capped by three 
consecutive 3-pointers by Sophia Witherspoon, for a 60-40 lead with 
9:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockers guard Michelle Edwards sprained her left ankle in the  
second half and was carried off the floor by her teammates. Teresa 
Weatherspoon left the game early in the first half with a sprained 
left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the league's worst record after winning the  
Eastern Conference title last season. The Rockers have struggled 
without leading scorer and rebounder Isabelle Fijalkowski, who 
chose not to play in the WNBA this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockers lost by 27 points in the season opener at Madison  
Square Garden on June 10. Rebecca Lobo suffered a season-ending 
knee injury 42 seconds into the game.

<HEADLINE> Teen Gets Life for Girl's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTOW, Fla. (AP) -- A 15-year-old boy was sentenced Friday to  
life for murdering an 8-year-old neighborhood girl in a crime a 
judge said would bring an even harsher sentence on Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not perceive you to be a child,'' state Circuit Judge  
Charles Arnold told Joshua Phillips. ``Your monstrous act made you 
an adult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua was tried as an adult last month and convicted of  
first-degree murder in the Nov. 3, 1998 death of Maddie Clifton. 
</P>
<P>
	He had pretended to help in the neighborhood search for Maddie  
when there was hope she was still alive, even though her body was 
stuffed into the frame of his waterbed. The pixie-faced girl lived 
across the street from him in a Jacksonville neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua lifted his eyes briefly as he entered the courtroom and  
smiled at his mother. She smiled back. He stood with his head 
bowed, showing no emotion when told that he would not be sentenced 
as a juvenile but as an adult, and would spend life in prison with 
no hope for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge quoted the Bible, then said: ``I'm certain that on  
your Judgment Day you, Joshua Patrick Philips, will be given a 
harsher sentence than I could impose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing came after emotional pleas from both families.  
</P>
<P>
	Joshua's father, Steve Phillips, said it was ``ludicrous and  
obscene'' to have prosecuted the murder charge. Joshua's mother, 
Melissa Phillips, expressed her sorrow to the Cliftons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time I look out of our kitchen window to the house across  
the street, my heart clutches at the thought of what the Cliftons 
are going through,'' she said through tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry about their grief, but I cannot repair their  
heartbreak any more than I can repair our own,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie's family told the judge of the memory of an effervescent,  
giggly girl and the impact of a murder that ``was cruel and 
senseless and took Maddie from us all,'' said Steve Clifton, the 
father. He said the family expected Joshua to spend his life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one or nothing can look up at me with those big, brown  
eyes,'' Maddie's mother, Sheila, told the judge. ``Pictures and 
memories, that's all I've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida law bars the death penalty for killers under 16. Joshua  
was 14 at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua never denied killing Maddie, but said he accidentally hit  
her in the eye with a baseball as they played in his back yard, 
then panicked at her screams and hit and stabbed her to quiet her. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie's body was hidden for a week until Joshua's mother made  
the grisly discovery.

<HEADLINE> Mall Is Latest in Providence Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- This once-ugly city has become something  
of a Seattle of the East, made trendy by its harbor-like Waterplace 
Park, a new arts district, and a skyline familiar to millions of 
Americans who watch the TV show ``Providence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the city embarked on a new chapter of its much-touted  
rebirth by opening one of the most elaborate shopping malls in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Planners say Providence Place mall, a towering red-brick  
structure whose two halves straddle a river, will draw up to 20 
million shoppers a year -- many from neighboring Massachusetts and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The mall will ultimately have 165 stores, but only 43 opened  
today -- including Nordstrom's, one of the anchor stores. Among 
others to come are Filene's, Lord &AMP; Taylor, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, 
Gap, Ann Taylor, and Borders Books and Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Also coming to the $460 million mall, which stretches over 13  
acres, are a 16-screen movie theater and a 3-D IMAX theater -- 
expected to be ready later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With some justification, perhaps, Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr.  
gloats about his city's renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember when you could roll a bowling ball down the  
streets and you wouldn't hit anybody,'' says Cianci. ``Most 
American cities would drool over Providence now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new mall is the latest piece -- and by far the largest one --  
of an attractive mosaic Cianci has been fashioning out of this city 
of 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
	What's unusual about the new mall is not what's in it, but the  
spectacular view you get of what's outside it. 
</P>
<P>
	Linking the two halves of the multi-level mall is a vaulted  
glass structure called the Wintergarden. As you look out the 
Wintergarden's big glass window you see Waterplace Park, fashioned 
several years ago out of the river that now runs beneath the mall. 
Iron pedestrian bridges arch over Waterplace Park, making it look a 
little like Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing outside the mall, admiring it and Waterplace Park, was  
70-year-old Providence native Larry Orsini. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should have seen Providence in the 1970s. It was really  
down in the dumps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Providence was once home to booming textile and jewelry  
industries, but many of the factories closed and the city's 
industrial base collapsed. The advent of suburban shopping malls 
nearly killed downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	But a renaissance began taking root here about a dozen years  
ago. It might not have happened without Cianci. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the city he governs, Cianci has staged an amazing comeback.  
</P>
<P>
	Cianci pleaded no contest in 1984 to charges of using a  
fireplace log to assault the lover of his estranged wife. He was 
forced out of office for five years but was re-elected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Cianci has poured his energies into rebuilding this  
city -- as well as his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his achievements is Waterplace Park. Others are a  
downtown skating rink and an arts district where artists live and 
work in renovated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	This stunning turnaround has caught the attention of travel  
writers from across the country, and their articles have resulted 
in a surge of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Providence is still healing. You can see that when you walk  
a few blocks from the new mall to the heart of downtown -- called 
``Downcity'' by the locals. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the big department stores that were once in Downcity have  
gone. There are a few clothing stores and a smattering of other 
commercial establishments. There is little life left in Downcity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Downcity retailers worry about that imposing new presence  
up on the hill -- Providence Place mall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could go two ways,'' says Roger L. Gross, co-owner of a  
Downcity men's clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
	The hordes of outsiders expected to visit the mall may also  
discover shops that are in the Downcity area, says Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Or the mall could drain even more business away from Downcity,  
creating, in Gross' words, ``this giant sucking sound as people go 
over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gross says gamely, ``I'm not afraid of competition.''

<HEADLINE> Peregrine Falcon Off Endangered List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Once threatened with extinction from  
pesticides, the peregrine falcon was taken off the endangered 
species list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wonderful story says a lot about the Endangered Species  
Act,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said. ``It is a commitment 
by the American people and a visionary law that says we recognize 
our obligation to God's creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question remains if the act can restore dwindling  
populations of predatory animals of the West like grizzly bears or 
migratory salmon, which require entire river basins to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt made his announcement at The Peregrine Fund's World  
Center for Birds of Prey near Boise, which was instrumental in 
raising young falcons to preserve the world's fastest bird, which 
plunges through the air at up to 200 mph to strike prey such as 
ducks or pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
	DDT and other pesticides decimated its populations in North  
America and Europe to the point that in 1970 there were only 39 
breeding pairs in the continental United States -- all west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates more than  
1,650 breeding pairs of peregrines live in North America. Tom Cade, 
founder of The Peregrine Fund, said about 6,000 birds raised in 
captivity have been released and their progeny are increasing in 
the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping the peregrine from the list means it loses some of the  
strictest protections of federal law, such as shielding its habitat 
from development. The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act still makes 
it illegal to kill the falcons or possess their feathers or body 
parts without a rare federal permit. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to monitor peregrine  
populations for 13 years to ensure they don't get in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	The American peregrine falcon is the sixth U.S. species to  
recover enough to be removed from the endangered species list, 
which currently includes about 1,200 plants and animals in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most important is we work together in a public-private  
partnership,'' said Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho. ``In this 
region, we need to extend the work to wolves, salmon and steelhead, 
and grizzly bear issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho lawmakers refused to get involved with the reintroduction  
of wolves, and oppose the breaching of Snake River dams to revive 
salmon runs, as well as releasing grizzlies in the wild.

<HEADLINE> Peregrine Falcon Off Endangered List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- DDT and other pesticides once pushed the  
world's fastest bird to near extinction in the United States. Now, 
the peregrine falcon has recovered enough to be taken off the 
endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt removed the peregrine from the  
endangered list today in a ceremony at a Boise, Idaho, center for 
breeding birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wonderful story says a lot about the Endangered Species  
Act,'' Babbitt said. ``It is a commitment by the American people 
and a visionary law that says we recognize our obligation to God's 
creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt praised the work of private groups that have helped  
bring the bird back by breeding peregrines in captivity and 
releasing the young into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
	At the falcon's low point in 1970, only 39 breeding pairs  
existed in the continental United States -- all west of the 
Mississippi, said Jeff Cilek of The Peregrine Fund. Now, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service estimates more than 1,650 breeding pairs 
of peregrines live in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest number are in the West, with 167 pairs in  
California, 164 in Utah and 159 in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping the peregrine from the list means it loses some of the  
strictest protections of federal law, such as shielding its habitat 
from development. The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act still makes 
it illegal to kill the falcons or possess their feathers or body 
parts without a rare federal permit. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to monitor peregrine  
populations for 13 years to ensure they don't get in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
	While Babbitt cited the 1973 Endangered Species Act as a big  
factor in the peregrine's recovery, falcon experts say the key to 
saving the birds was the 1972 ban on DDT and later restrictions on 
the use of similar pesticides. Peregrines that accumulate DDT and 
its chemical cousins lay eggs with thin shells that often break and 
kill the chicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that (DDT ban) hadn't happened, we wouldn't be here today,  
Endangered Species Act or no,'' said Peregrine Fund founder Tom 
Cade. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban on DDT was prompted by concerns for such birds as the  
peregrine falcon and the bald eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Private groups like The Peregrine Fund have released more than  
6,000 peregrines hatched in captivity. Falconers prize the 
peregrine for its speed, which can reach more than 200 mph when 
diving to catch prey, Cade said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its performance in the air and courtship aerobatics are really  
spectacular,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peregrines prey on smaller birds such as pigeons and starlings,  
zooming down on them from above to catch and kill them in midair. 
The falcons lay their eggs and raise their young on high ledges 
such as cliffs, skyscrapers, smokestacks and bridges, and they have 
thrived in urban environments. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see a falcon cruising down Wall Street and looking for  
pigeons and moving in on them, as I have, is an amazing sight,'' 
Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The American peregrine falcon is the sixth U.S. species to  
recover enough to be removed from the endangered species list, 
which currently includes about 1,200 plants and animals in the 
United States. The other recovered species are the brown pelican, 
the American alligator, the Rydberg milk-vetch (a small plant in 
the pea family), the gray whale and the Arctic peregrine falcon. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven U.S. species on the list have become extinct, and another  
seven have been removed because scientists discovered they were 
variants of other species or were not endangered in the first 
place.

<HEADLINE>  Red Wings' Lidstrom Gets $22m Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- All-Star defenseman Nick Lidstrom, torn between  
an NHL career and the desire to raise his children back in Sweden, 
agreed to a three-year, $22 million contract with the Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Nick in the lineup, we are a legitimate Stanley Cup  
contender and right up there with the elite of the league,'' 
general manager Ken Holland said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nick's really delighted that we've been able to negotiate this  
contract,'' agent Don Meehan said. ``He's delighted to be back in 
Detroit. We're very pleased today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past 18 months, Lidstrom has been waffling between the  
NHL and finishing his career in Sweden, where he says he wants to 
raise his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue all along has been to do what's best for our kids,''  
Lidstrom said in a statement. ``What finally made the difference 
was that we talked to several friends that lived in the States for 
a time and then returned to Sweden. Like us, they felt it was 
important to raise their families here in Sweden. But they all 
agreed that there was no problem with their kids living there 
longer than what we already have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said he knew he had no control over the Sweden issue,  
but said, ``In the end, it was Nick's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that Nick is very happy here,'' Holland said. ``It  
would be very, very difficult to overcome the loss of someone like 
Nick Lidstrom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Lidstrom has 14 goals and 43 assists in 81 regular  
season games. He scored two goals and nine assists in 10 playoff 
games and was the runner up for the Norris Trophy, awarded to the 
best defenseman. He had only 14 penalty minutes in the 1998-99 
regular season and 4 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He has NHL regular-season career totals of 101 goals and 322  
assists for 423 points in 612 games played. He was Detroit's third 
choice (53rd overall) in the 1989 NHL entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that if Nick is not the best defenseman in  
the NHL, then he's right up there,'' Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lidstrom's leaving would have been ``a loss you can't even put  
into words,'' Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasteras, the Swedish team that Lidstrom had considered playing  
for, offered Lidstrom a $500,000 contract, prime real estate for a 
home, business opportunities for Lidstrom and wife Annika, and 
private education for their two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said Lidstrom and the other Swedish players that he  
represents share concerns about upbringing children when they reach 
school age. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a balancing of considerations ... on the personal end  
and the professional end,'' Meehan said. ``If he was going to play 
in the NHL, it was going 
</P>
<P>
	Lidstrom was just happy the decision-making was over.  
</P>
<P>
	``When this contract is up? Who knows. Right now, we're happy to  
be coming back to Detroit and that we won't have to think about 
where to live for another three years.''

<HEADLINE> Sonics Sign Guard Emanual Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle SuperSonics have signed guard Emanual  
Davis to a two-year contract, general manager Wally Walker said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Davis, who turns 31 on Aug. 27, played in France  
last season for Elan Bearnais Pau-Orthez, which won the French 
Championship. He played for the Houston Rockets during the 1996-97 
and 1997-98 seasons, averaging 5.0 points in 13 games in his rookie 
year and 4.1 points in 45 games during his second year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emanual is a player that we have liked for a long time,''  
Walker said in a release. ``He is an outstanding defensive guard 
who can run a team from the point or slide over to the two guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since coming out of Delaware State with career averages of 17.6  
points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists, Davis has played in Italy, in 
the Atlantic Basketball Association and in the Continental 
Basketball Association. He was named CBA defensive player of the 
year in 1996, when he averaged 13.8 points and 6.6 assists for the 
Rockford Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be back in the league with the chance to play on  
a contending team again,'' Davis said in a release. ``I'm excited 
about the opportunity to fight for some minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Sonics announced the signing of 6-4 guard Fred  
Vinson. Vinson and Davis join a host of offseason acquisitions by 
the Sonics, including forward Horace Grant, center Greg Foster and 
guards Vernon Maxwell and Brent Barry. The Sonics this week also 
announced re-signing free agent forward Vin Baker to a seven-year 
deal.

<HEADLINE>  Liberty 72, Rockers 55 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Becky Hammon scored 16 points as the New York  
Liberty romped over the Cleveland Rockers 72-55 on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophia Witherspoon added 15 for the Liberty, who learned of the  
death of Houston Comet guard Kim Perrot before the game. Her death 
was announced to the crowd of 16,782, who stood for a moment of 
silence at Madison Square Garden after a video tribute to Perrot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty, many of whom were crying at the start of the game,  
raced out to a 24-11 lead and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Merlakia Jones had 14 for the Rockers (6-25), who have lost a  
franchise-high eight consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Robinson added 11 for the Liberty (18-13), who clinched  
the Eastern Conference regular-season title with a victory over 
Washington on Tuesday. New York earned a first-round bye and 
homecourt advantage in the playoffs, which begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty, winners of five of their last seven games, visits  
Cleveland in the final game of the season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 40-21 at halftime, Cleveland came within 47-37 with  
13:05 remaining. New York went on a 13-3 run, capped by three 
consecutive 3-pointers by Sophia Witherspoon, for a 60-40 lead with 
9:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockers guard Michelle Edwards sprained her left ankle in the  
second half and was carried off the floor by her teammates. Teresa 
Weatherspoon left the game early in the first half with a sprained 
left thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the league's worst record after winning the  
Eastern Conference title last season. The Rockers have struggled 
without leading scorer and rebounder Isabelle Fijalkowski, who 
chose not to play in the WNBA this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockers lost by 27 points in the season opener at Madison  
Square Garden on June 10. Rebecca Lobo suffered a season-ending 
knee injury 42 seconds into the game.

<HEADLINE> Call for Milosevic's Ouster Repeated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Their spirits high after a  
successful rally in the capital, key opposition leaders said Friday 
the Serb people have shown they will settle for nothing less than 
the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two sides in Serbia today -- the regime and the  
people,'' said Zoran Djindjic, a key opponent of Milosevic. 
``Everybody will soon have to take one of the sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic, a key leader of the umbrella opposition group, The  
Alliance for Change, spoke at a press conference a day after an 
estimated 150,000 people gathered at an opposition rally to demand 
Milosevic's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens of Serbia want the removal of Slobodan Milosevic  
and they do not want compromise or any deal with the government,'' 
said Vladan Batic, another Alliance leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alliance for Change leaders reiterated Friday that Milosevic  
has until mid-September to step down or he would face nationwide 
protests and a general strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbia's opposition remains fractured over how changes in the  
country should be carried out. The Alliance for Change and some 
other groups are demanding unconditional resignation by Milosevic 
and formation of a transitional government. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuk Draskovic, another key leader, however has agreed to an  
early election organized by Milosevic. But Draskovic was jeered 
when he proposed that idea at Thursday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanting slogans against Milosevic, the crowd at the rally  
roared in approval every time the opposition speakers called for 
his removal. It was the biggest outburst of popular anger against 
Milosevic in years, but the state-run media he controls portrayed 
the gathering as a ``failure,'' and as a ``disappointment'' to the 
organizers, who the media calls pro-NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Belgrade students staged a mock celebration of  
Milosevic's 58th birthday. About 50 people watched as the student 
group lit candles on a huge cardboard cake and made a wish -- for 
Milosevic to step down as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The birthday cake was sliced into pieces representing  
territories of the former Yugoslavia Milosevic lost in the four 
wars he has fought during his decade in power.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals QB Plummer Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Quarterback Jake Plummer sprained his right  
thumb on Arizona's first possession of Friday night's exhibition 
game against the Tennessee Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer went to the locker room for X-rays, which were negative,  
and returned to watch from the sideline with his hand in ice. Team 
officials said he would not play the rest of the game, but the 
injury was not believed to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by backup Dave Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, considered one of the NFL's rising stars, was injured  
on a second-down pass attempt. He stayed in for a third-down 
incompletion, then went to the locker room. When he returned his 
hand was in an ice pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have been beset by injuries throughout the  
preseason. Three players were injured in the first quarter Friday. 
Besides Plummer, defensive tackle Mike Moten sprained his right 
knee and defensive end Thomas Burke pulled his left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, three linemen were injured in an auto accident on the  
way to a morning team meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bush Squanders Momentum Over Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Why now? For months, George W. Bush  
successfully dodged questions about whether he used drugs with an 
artful reply that he acted irresponsibly in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His sudden decision to offer partial, unsatisfying answers is  
baffling. 
</P>
<P>
	The hubbub over have-you-ever questions squandered momentum Bush  
had built with a convincing victory in Iowa's straw poll last 
Saturday. It also exposed weaknesses that were ignored or unnoticed 
while his campaign rocketed almost effortlessly to the top of the 
Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift of strategy left veteran political consultants shaking  
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't need to be talking about this,'' said Ed Gillespie,  
a Republican operative. Even supporters who commended Bush for 
talking about the subject said he did so clumsily. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, he was back on message and would only say: ``I told  
the American people that years ago I made some mistakes. I've 
learned from those mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle suggested that Bush's  
background was getting less scrutiny than President Clinton's, the 
questions about drugs started picking up. News organizations 
surveyed the other candidates about past drug usage. Bush, alone, 
refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there is no evidence or credible allegation that he has  
ever violated drug laws, Bush kept getting peppered with the 
questions. He finally lost his cool during a home state news 
conference. Leveling dark accusations against unnamed rivals who 
``planted'' the rumors, Bush vowed not to answer the questions. 
``The people of America are sick and tired of this kind of 
politics,'' he said. ``And I'm not participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, he was decided to participate, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News wanted to know if he could answer the  
question posed to federal employees in standard background checks: 
Did he use illegal drugs in the last seven years? 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought clarification of the question, which a senior  
adviser later said was confusing. That gave him a little time to 
consider whether to reply -- and how to frame his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush  
decided it was fair to expect a presidential candidate to answer 
the same question posed to federal employees. He also felt it would 
be a political benefit to put some distance between his campaign 
and any ``mistakes'' he refuses to talk about. And, finally, Bush 
assumed the headlines would be that he was committed to federal 
background checks -- and would live by the same standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush team was surprised the next day when news reports  
focused on him saying he hadn't used illegal drugs in seven years. 
That left open the possibility that he had broken the law when his 
father was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference Thursday allowed Bush to cast any past drug  
usage as a more distant memory. He used a more stringent 15-year 
standard set by the Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference also gave television networks footage of  
Bush calmly discussing the matter, replacing the heated exchange 
networks had on videotape from the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks, Bush said he could meet the anti-drug  
standards of his father's White House. At least one top aide 
thought that meant he was ruling out drug usage for the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked whether he could have passed the test when  
his father was president, Bush said yes. That was the first clue 
for some aides that Bush was going back 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It raised more questions.  
</P>
<P>
	What about when his father was vice president?  
</P>
<P>
	Why not answer the question posed to current White House  
employees? The FBI asks them if they used drugs since their 18th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he must draw the line somewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides insist that will be the last Bush will say about the  
matter. But he has already redrawn the lines. Seven years. Fifteen 
years. Twenty-five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush may be able to finesse the drug issue throughout the  
campaign, political consultants in both parties say. But the 
episode revealed what can happen to a cautious, coached candidate 
when he is knocked off message; he changed course twice in two 
days, lost his cool and is still open to accusations that he won't 
play by the rules set for White House workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is still largely untried in a national campaign, when a new  
crisis can emerge almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's next? Abortion. Let's watch him handle that  
under fire one day,'' said Democratic consultant David Brown. 
``He's great with smiling. He shakes hands well, but when it gets 
down to answering tough questions, he's just not ready.''

<HEADLINE> CBS, NCAA Discuss Hoops Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS and the NCAA are negotiating an extension of  
the agreement that gives the network broadcasting rights to the 
Division I basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are occurring amid increasing interest from several  
potential bidders who want to acquire the rights once CBS' 
eight-year, $1.73 billion contract expires in 2002. At least one 
CBS rival is willing to offer at least $4 billion over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wally Renfro, the NCAA's director of public relations, said the  
NCAA is currently negotiating exclusively with CBS for an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been having discussions with CBS for some time and  
those discussions will continue,'' he said. ``We have the ability 
to talk to anybody, and we have not. Certainly what we do have is 
that we will not enter into any agreement until we have concluded 
negotiations with CBS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is trying to secure an extension in order to keep the rights  
off the open market. ABC/ESPN, Fox and ISL, which holds the TV and 
marketing rights to the men's and women's soccer World Cup, have 
expressed interest in the basketball rights. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS declined comment on the negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
	ISL vice president Jim Wheeler said his company would be  
prepared to offer $4 billion for 10 years to secure the rights for 
TV, the Internet, licensing, marketing and sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where we're prepared to start,'' Wheeler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler contacted NCAA president Cedric Dempsey and expressed  
his desire to acquire the rights, although they have not discussed 
numbers, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN/ABC boasts five networks that could be used to televise  
every tournament game throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``All along we have said we have interest in it,'' ESPN  
spokesman Mike Soltys said. ``Our belief is that basketball fans 
would benefit from seeing every game nationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox, which has expressed interest in the past, declined comment.

	Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports who now heads  
the consulting firm Pilson Communications and is a consultant to 
ISL, said CBS' strategy is to wrap up an extension before others 
can bid on the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm CBS, I want to get the deal done before it hits the  
open market,'' said Pilson, who made the original deal to bring the 
NCAA tournament to CBS in 1981. ``When I was with CBS, we did that 
several times, renegotiating the deal before it hit the open 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pilson also said that any contract would include more than just  
TV rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is happening now is that the marketing rights are being  
marketed along with the TV rights,'' he said. ``Television is 
combining with the marketing side to negotiate a single deal 
instead of two separate deals. That's what CBS is trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing rights to the tournament are held by Host  
Communications, and Pilson said it's likely that CBS and Host would 
provide the NCAA with a combined offer.

<HEADLINE> Female Santa Suing Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Should a department store Santa always be  
a man? 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who lost her role as Santa Claus at Wal-Mart when a  
customer complained it was a man's job is seeking $67,000 from the 
nation's biggest retailer for lost wages, pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights heard arguments Friday  
in the sex-discrimination complaint of Marta Brown against Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Brown proved she could play the role of Santa, but she  
was rejected based on her female status,'' said her lawyer, Alteata 
McWilliams. ``Mrs. Brown was totally humiliated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart stands by its decision to replace Brown based on her  
gender, company spokesman Mike Maher said from Wal-Mart 
headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we do believe Santa Claus is a man; he has  
always been portrayed as a man,'' Maher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown, 46, had volunteered in December 1995 to play Santa  
at the store where she worked in the western Kentucky town of 
Morganfield. 
</P>
<P>
	She was replaced after her first day when a child pinched her  
breast and complained to his mother that Santa was a woman. The 
mother complained to store managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart attorney Kathryn Quesenberry said the company feared  
Christmas sales, which account for half the Morganfield store's 
annual revenue, could suffer if children didn't beg their parents 
to take them there to see Santa. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Little kids just like Santa Claus,'' she said. ``They don't  
care if Santa is a man, woman or donkey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to make a decision within four  
months.

<HEADLINE> Unfamiliar Names Top Speed Chart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- It's not business as usual two days into  
practice at the brand new Chicago Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The top of the speed chart after Friday's practice sessions for  
the inaugural Target Grand Prix does not include CART points leader 
Dario Franchitti or sensational rookie Juan Montoya or oval master 
Michael Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	The new one-mile track in this urban suburb west of Chicago has  
shaken up the competitive open-wheel series, putting Helio 
Castro-Neves, Max Papis and ``Super Sub'' Roberto Moreno at the 
head of the line. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, speeds picked up considerably from Thursday's  
opening practice sessions, with Castro-Neves turning a lap of 
161.285 mph, followed by Papis at 161.229 and Moreno at 160.977. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this track very much,'' said Castro-Neves, whose first  
and only career pole came earlier this season on the one-mile oval 
in Milwaukee. ``This is a different track than Milwaukee. The turns 
are not narrow, but they are tight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Papis, who hasn't been known for his oval racing prowess until  
recently, said, ``We've been working for a couple of days on the 
race pace and not worrying too much about speed. But my team is 
still confident from the U.S. 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian driver was referring to the race last month at  
Michigan Speedway, where he dominated on the two-mile oval only to 
run out of fuel on the last lap and watch Tony Kanaan win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny that I've come from road racing and now I'm known  
for my oval performances, but this is a very nice oval,'' Papis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One key characteristic of the new 1.029-mile CMC track is the  
tight turns that Castro-Neves talked about. Combined with CART's 
use of a big rear speedway wing on the cars, the configuration 
forces the drivers to brake hard heading into both turn one and 
turn three. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't carry as much speed into the turns and I think  
that's good,'' Papis said. ``I expect we will see a little more 
overtaking in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno, who filled in for Mark Blundell earlier this season and  
is now subbing for injured Christian Fittipaldi, is 12th in the 
season points despite having no full-time ride and missing four of 
14 races. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to go from 180 to 130 miles an hour in the corners,''  
Moreno said. ``But that's OK. The track is very smooth and very 
wide, so it is just the way you have to drive it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite running hundreds of laps during the first two days, the  
only incidents have been harmless spins on Thursday by Richie Hearn 
and Michel Jourdain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track is a challenge, but it seems like everybody really  
likes it,'' Papis said. ``For a new track, it really has very good 
grip. It's really surprising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who leads Montoya by just one point in the season  
standings and is 28 ahead of third-place Andretti was 12th at 
158.552. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting better every session,'' Franchitti said. ``But we  
need to continue to work for a better balance. We need to keep up 
with the improving track conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti, Moreno's teammate, was frustrated through much of  
Friday's practice before finally moving up to 14th at 157.889. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually we adapt the car to the driver,'' Andretti said. ``For  
this race, we're going to have to adapt the driver to the car. This 
track suits a smooth driver rather than an aggressive one. I'm in 
the second category. But we're making progress with each lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, coming off his series-high fifth win of the season last  
Sunday in Lexington, Ohio, was the slowest of the points leaders. 
He was 15th at 157.815. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed the way the car's been handling,'' he said.  
``It's frustrating, but with a new track maybe we have to expect 
some problems before we can improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More practice, as well as qualifying for Sunday's race is  
scheduled Saturday.

<HEADLINE> AL Ump Not Giving Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Richie Garcia has received plenty of pats on  
the back the past few weeks from well-wishers who think he's one of 
baseball's best umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	All he's gotten from the American League is a kick in the pants.  
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will be in Tiger Stadium on Sept. 2, working behind the  
plate or at one of the bases, just like he has every baseball 
season since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	And he promises the game between the Texas Rangers and Detroit  
Tigers won't be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not quitting. We're not quitting,'' said Garcia, one of 22  
umpires whose resignations were accepted by baseball. ``I've got in 
my mind that I'm going to be working Sept. 3, and if not Sept. 3, 
then some other time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearful that baseball would lock them out after their labor  
contract expires Dec. 31, umpires announced last month that they 
would quit en masse to try to force an early start to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strategy backfired when their union split and 27 of the  
68 umpires either refused to resign or withdrew their resignations. 
Baseball then hired 25 new umpires from the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, a 57-year-old grandfather of four, is one of the game's  
most respected umpires. He's surprised that some of the umpires 
being kept have less experience and lower ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't even talked to me. They haven't had the decency  
to contact me,'' he said. ``I haven't had any contact with the 
league office in this regard or any regard since April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it's because of my stance with the union or  
what. Obviously, they're not going to say. I don't know what 
they're waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has earned a reputation as one of the best  
balls-and-strikes umps in the league. His engaging personality has 
always made him popular with players, managers and fans, some of 
whom best remember him for his controversial call in the 1996 AL 
playoffs. That's when young Jeffrey Maier reached over the 
right-field wall in Yankee Stadium, preventing Baltimore's Tony 
Tarasco from catching Derek Jeter's drive and turning it into a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
	After his name appeared on the list of umpires possibly on their  
way out, Garcia said he was approached by people around the league 
offering kind words and advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've gotten a lot of support,'' he said. ``One manager told me  
to go on a hunger strike, that will get some attention. But this 
isn't about Richie Garcia, this isn't about one umpire. Or good 
ones. Or bad ones. This is about 22 umpires who were let go for no 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation has been a chance for me to realize there are  
people who have appreciated what I've done on the field for 25 
years. Obviously, the American League doesn't appreciate it. All I 
heard from them was, thank you for 25 years and I hope you have a 
nice retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That day is still years away as far as Garcia is concerned, so  
long as he gets to plead his case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a long visit with Richie before the game,'' Texas  
manager Johnny Oates said Wednesday night. ``Don't count on him 
leaving just yet. This thing can get worked out where we're able to 
keep the good umpires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, vice president of the umpires union, said he's spending  
18 or 19 hours each day working to make sure he and the other 21 
umpires are heard. He is in constant contact with umpires and the 
union's lawyers, who are trying to convince the National Labor 
Relations Board to seek an injunction to prevent the 22 from being 
let go. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to the NLRB every couple of days,'' Garcia  
said. ``We're sending more and more evidence of unfair labor law 
practices. We're actually putting our faith in the legal system. 
Hopefully, we can get something negotiated before Sept. 2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last month's upheaval has strained relationships among some  
of the umpires, Garcia said. Friendships have been broken and those 
umpires who crawled back to baseball won't be forgotten. On his 
crew, Mike Reilly broke with the union leadership and Laz Diaz and 
Brian O'Nora agreed to become permanent replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia also blames baseball and the league offices for not  
creating a dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of animosity,'' he said. ``We feel that they  
contributed to the firing of the 22 guys. We've got a lot of young 
umpires involved in this with young families that are possibly 
going to lose their jobs. That's why I'll go down to the last day 
fighting for these young guys, like I always have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inhumane what they did. There's no reason in the world  
that they had to release everybody on that certain date. They had 
more than enough time to send us a letter or contact each guy 
individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia is holding out hope that a solution can be found before  
Sept. 2. He has plenty of ideas on how to fix things, Garcia just 
wishes management would listen. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's hoping the umpires who broke with the union will  
explain why. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need those umpires to come forward and tell the truth,'' he  
said. ``That's all we're asking. Just asking for people to tell the 
truth. That's what our job is based on, telling the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Offers Advice to Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- George W. Bush, still fending off questions  
about whether he used illegal drugs, said Friday that parents 
should ``share the wisdom of past mistakes'' with their children 
but refused to say what he has told his own daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	During a news conference after his tour of a homeless shelter  
that, among other things, treats drug users, the Republican 
presidential front-runner said parents should warn their children 
about drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers is, have  
we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes?'' 
Bush said. ``And I think the message ought to be to all children 
'Don't use drugs. Don't abuse alcohol.' That's what leadership is 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush refused to say if he has been forthcoming with his  
17-year-old twin daughters on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to leave my daughters out of the campaign,'' said  
Bush, although later the governor warmed up the crowd at an Akron 
fund-raiser with a quip that he didn't know whether it was tougher 
to raise his daughters or run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he had learned from an intense 48 hours of questions  
about whether he had used drugs, Bush said, ``I've learned that 
politics can be unnecessarily ugly, and I'm trying to purge the 
system of ugly politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush would not expand on answers he gave earlier this week about  
whether he had ever used illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of Americans -- 84 percent -- said that if Bush used  
cocaine in his 20s, it should not disqualify him from being 
president, according to a Time-CNN poll released Friday. Eleven 
percent said it should disqualify him. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-four percent said they were aware of the ``allegation that  
.... Bush might have used cocaine.'' Of those, 50 percent thought 
the governor had done a good job handling it. Twenty-nine percent 
said he had done a poor job, while 21 percent were not sure. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority -- 58 percent -- said journalists should stop pursuing  
the drug question; 36 percent said Bush should be asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 942 Americans age 18 or older was conducted  
Thursday. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent. The 
question to those who were aware of the cocaine allegation had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After first refusing to answer questions about whether he used  
drugs, the 53-year-old Texas governor said Thursday he had not used 
drugs in the past 25 years. A day earlier, Bush told The Dallas 
Morning News that he had not used drugs in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the fund-raiser, which raised $365,000, Bush mentioned the  
drug issue only in passing as he called on America to start a new 
era of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that we must pass the responsibility message on  
to our children. It's important for our children to hear a unified 
message that drugs will destroy you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, accompanied by Ohio Gov. Bob Taft, Bush toured  
Haven of Rest Ministries, which treats drug users and provides 
shelter, education and child-care services to the homeless and 
low-income people. The shelter is nondenominational but is run by a 
Baptist minister and is funded by donations.

<HEADLINE> Racist Container Find Spurs Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORWALK, Conn. (AP) -- Two containers of medical waste were found  
at synagogues, marked with swastikas and references to last week's 
Jewish center shootings in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	One container was found Thursday morning in front of the  
Congregation Beth El in Norwalk, two days after a similar discovery 
at a temple in Stamford, about 15 miles away. Police in both cities 
said they believe the incidents are linked and have formed task 
forces with members of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no words to describe the evil this represents,''  
Norwalk police Chief Harry Rilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee of the 350-member Congregation Beth El the  
discovered the medical waste, including syringes, in the rear 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	A swastika was drawn on the container and police found a note  
that referred to Buford O. Furrow Jr., the white supremacist 
charged in the shooting of five people at the Jewish center in 
suburban Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also allegedly shot and killed a Filipino-American postal  
worker after fleeing. When he surrendered to the FBI, Furrow 
reportedly said the community center shootings were meant to be ``a 
wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hate,'' said Marvin Rosenbaum, president of Congregation  
Beth El. ``Los Angeles is 2,000-plus miles away ... but now it's no 
further away than walking out your front door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, medical waste was found in a swastika-emblazoned  
container at Temple Beth El in Stamford. A picture of Furrow was 
taped to the container. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamford police said four additional containers of medical waste  
without anti-Semitic symbols have been found in recent months at 
two library branches, a school and a shopping center.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Official Linked to Prostitutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The official who coordinated sexual violence  
awareness training for University of Minnesota athletes twice was 
cited for soliciting prostitution, police records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Rufus Simmons' most recent arrest came in June. His first  
offense was in 1991. Athletic director Mark Dienhart said Thursday 
he wasn't aware of either case until asked about them by the Star 
Tribune of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would personally find it highly inappropriate to have a  
person with this type of a conviction in his background functioning 
in a program designed to provide our students with the information 
to make good choices in life,'' Dienhart said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelation comes less than two months after the school  
concluded an investigation into at least 40 cases of sexual 
misconduct or domestic assault by male athletes. The probe focused 
on whether administrators improperly were involved in decisions to 
prosecute in those cases. Investigators determined that there was a 
culture of insensitivity toward alleged victims and poor judgment 
by officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, a university employee for 27 years, retired July 31  
from his job as associate men's athletic director. It is not clear 
whether the latest prostitution arrest played a role in the 
58-year-old's decision to retire. Simmons did not immediately 
return a phone call today from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Minneapolis police records show that Simmons was arrested June  
15 after he exposed himself to a female undercover officer and 
offered her $20 for oral sex. Police taped the conversation. He is 
scheduled to appear in Hennepin County District Court on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 15, 1991, he was cited for the same offense. Court  
documents show that he pleaded guilty and paid $800 in fines and 
court costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, Simmons was in charge of various programs aimed at  
teaching male athletes to conduct themselves responsibly when 
interacting with women.

<HEADLINE> Female Santa Suing Wal-Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky., (AP) -- A woman replaced as a store Santa after  
a customer complained it was a man's job is seeking $67,000 from 
the nation's biggest retailer for lost wages and pain and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights heard arguments Friday  
in the sex-discrimination complaint of Marta Brown of Morganfield 
against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. A decision is expected within four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Brown proved she could play the role of Santa, but she  
was rejected based on her female status,'' said her lawyer, Alteata 
McWilliams. ``Mrs. Brown was totally humiliated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart stands by its decision to replace Brown based on her  
gender, company spokesman Mike Maher said in a telephone interview 
from the company headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we do believe Santa Claus is a man; he has  
always been portrayed as a man,'' Maher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown was replaced in December 1995 after a child grabbed  
her breast and complained to his mother that Santa is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart attorney Kathryn Quesenberry argued the company feared  
Christmas sales -- which account for half the store's annual 
revenues -- could suffer after a complaint in this town of 3,000 in 
rural western Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wasn't believable,'' Quesenberry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Brown alleges co-workers jeered her over the incident and  
claims that since quitting her job she has been self-conscious 
about her weight and appearance. She cannot leave the house without 
changing blouses several times, she said in her complaint to the 
commission. She did not attend Friday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Maher said the company was only being responsive to the wishes  
of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the business of keeping our customers happy,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Iomega Loses Another CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROY, Utah (AP) -- Iomega Corp. CEO Jodie Glore has resigned,  
forcing the troubled computer equipment market to search for 
someone to lead the company for the second time in the past 10 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Iomega said Thursday that Glore, who also served as president,  
is leaving for personal reasons. ``I expect to take my first 
vacation in three years and spend time with my family,'' Glore said 
in a company statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Glore will remain with Iomega until Aug. 31. David Dunn,  
chairman of the company's board of directors, will act as CEO until 
a replacement is found. Glore also said would be available to the 
board for whatever advice and counsel they would seek from him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Iomega made considerable progress during his tenure and  
he believes the progress will continue after he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	But analyst Howard Rosecrans of the New York research firm H.D.  
Brous had a much harsher prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically he inherited a difficult situation,'' Rosecrans said

<HEADLINE> Bush Squanders Momentum Over Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Why now? For months, George W. Bush  
successfully dodged questions about whether he used drugs with an 
artful reply that he acted irresponsibly in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His sudden decision to offer partial, unsatisfying answers is  
baffling. 
</P>
<P>
	The hubbub over have-you-ever questions squandered momentum Bush  
had built with a convincing victory in Iowa's straw poll last 
Saturday. It also exposed weaknesses that were ignored or unnoticed 
while his campaign rocketed almost effortlessly to the top of the 
Republican field. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift of strategy left veteran political consultants shaking  
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't need to be talking about this,'' said Ed Gillespie,  
a Republican operative. Even supporters who commended Bush for 
talking about the subject said he did so clumsily. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, he was back on message and would only say: ``I told  
the American people that years ago I made some mistakes. I've 
learned from those mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle suggested that Bush's  
background was getting less scrutiny than President Clinton's, the 
questions about drugs started picking up. News organizations 
surveyed the other candidates about past drug usage. Bush, alone, 
refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Though there is no evidence or credible allegation that he has  
ever violated drug laws, Bush kept getting peppered with the 
questions. He finally lost his cool during a home state news 
conference. Leveling dark accusations against unnamed rivals who 
``planted'' the rumors, Bush vowed not to answer the questions. 
``The people of America are sick and tired of this kind of 
politics,'' he said. ``And I'm not participating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, he was decided to participate, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News wanted to know if he could answer the  
question posed to federal employees in standard background checks: 
Did he use illegal drugs in the last seven years? 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought clarification of the question, which a senior  
adviser later said was confusing. That gave him a little time to 
consider whether to reply -- and how to frame his answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush  
decided it was fair to expect a presidential candidate to answer 
the same question posed to federal employees. He also felt it would 
be a political benefit to put some distance between his campaign 
and any ``mistakes'' he refuses to talk about. And, finally, Bush 
assumed the headlines would be that he was committed to federal 
background checks -- and would live by the same standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush team was surprised the next day when news reports  
focused on him saying he hadn't used illegal drugs in seven years. 
That left open the possibility that he had broken the law when his 
father was in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference Thursday allowed Bush to cast any past drug  
usage as a more distant memory. He used a more stringent 15-year 
standard set by the Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The news conference also gave television networks footage of  
Bush calmly discussing the matter, replacing the heated exchange 
networks had on videotape from the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks, Bush said he could meet the anti-drug  
standards of his father's White House. At least one top aide 
thought that meant he was ruling out drug usage for the last 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter asked whether he could have passed the test when  
his father was president, Bush said yes. That was the first clue 
for some aides that Bush was going back 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It raised more questions.  
</P>
<P>
	What about when his father was vice president?  
</P>
<P>
	Why not answer the question posed to current White House  
employees? The FBI asks them if they used drugs since their 18th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he must draw the line somewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides insist that will be the last Bush will say about the  
matter. But he has already redrawn the lines. Seven years. Fifteen 
years. Twenty-five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush may be able to finesse the drug issue throughout the  
campaign, political consultants in both parties say. But the 
episode revealed what can happen to a cautious, coached candidate 
when he is knocked off message; he changed course twice in two 
days, lost his cool and is still open to accusations that he won't 
play by the rules set for White House workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is still largely untried in a national campaign, when a new  
crisis can emerge almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what's next? Abortion. Let's watch him handle that  
under fire one day,'' said Democratic consultant David Brown. 
``He's great with smiling. He shakes hands well, but when it gets 
down to answering tough questions, he's just not ready.''

<HEADLINE> Royal Family Withdraws Dog Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A puppy abandoned at Heathrow Airport by an  
American couple won many hearts and, it appeared, a home with Abu 
Dhabi's ruling family. But the offer of a home was withdrawn when 
media interest got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``All they wanted was the dog, not the press intrusion,''  
Heathrow spokesman Mark Pursey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The American owners of Gucci, a young Maltese terrier, had been  
stopped by customs officials after arriving from Paris by train, 
Pursey said. All dogs entering Britain must undergo a six-month 
quarantine, although the Labor government has announced plans to 
relax the tough anti-rabies regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gucci was placed in temporary quarantine while the unidentified  
couple took a two-week vacation in Britain and the three were 
supposed to return to New York together. But the couple never went 
back to the quarantine center to get the dog. 
</P>
<P>
	When contacted in New York by animal customs officers, the  
couple said they wanted the dog destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a member of the ruling family in the United Arab  
Emirates agreed to adopt Gucci, Pursey said. But the offer was 
followed by phone calls to Heathrow by reporters pretending to be 
members of the royal household and by calls to the family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the family's offer was withdrawn, all is not lost.  
</P>
<P>
	Pursey said there have been hundreds of offers to adopt Gucci.  
</P>
<P>
	If the new owner is British, Gucci will have to spend six months  
in quarantine. But if the owner lives abroad in a country without a 
quarantine, she'll be able to go straight to her new home.

<HEADLINE> China.com Gets Inadvertent Benefit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- An inadvertent stock sale helped Internet  
provider China.com generate a $1.9 million second-quarter profit 
despite a loss from its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In reporting the results Friday, China.com boasted that sales  
are booming. Its U.S. shares shot up nearly 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our operating numbers exceeded internal and external  
projections,'' said Peter Yip, China.com's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the three months ended June 30 soared 174 percent to  
$2.4 million from $881,000 in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com had an operating loss of $3.5 million in the quarter,  
compared with an operating loss of $2.0 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But the gain on dealings in its own stock gave China.com a net  
profit of $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com had intended to sell part of its 3 percent stake in  
the Internet advertising firm 24/7 Media Inc. in June, but brokers 
inadvertently sold the whole stake, said China.com's chief 
financial officer, David Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock then plunged 20 percent over the next three days, and  
China.com bought back the shares it had wanted to keep, pocketing a 
surprise profit of $5.1 million, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been just a hiccup in the market,'' Kim told The  
Associated Press. ``The sale was inadvertent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China.com recently listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market amid much  
criticism from analysts who said the name was far catchier than the 
track record of the Chinese-language Internet content provider 
partially controlled by China's Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a spotty track record, China.com attracted a flurry of  
investors when it went public in mid-July, becoming the first 
Chinese-language Internet company to list in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	On its debut, shares were offered at $20.00 and rallied nearly  
236 percent to $67.10. The early enthusiasm has waned, however. But 
it got a lift Friday with the release of the financial data. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's U.S. stock rose $3.50 to close at $35.50 a share  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report, the company said it wants to expand in Asia by  
acquiring four smaller Internet companies for less than $10 million 
each. It would not identify the targets. 
</P>
<P>
	China.com targets users in mainland China, Hong Kong, and  
Taiwan. But many surveys say China.com is only a minor player in 
the China market -- not even making the top 20 in some surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Yip said it is doing better than that.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are much more than a China play. We still have a long way  
to go,'' said Yip. ``But we believe we are in the top 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China.com posted a $8.5 million loss in all of 1998 on revenue  
of $3.5 million, and analysts were apprehensive about control of 
its content, because of the company's connections with the 
government-run Xinhua. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations that Xinhua was filtering out politically and  
morally sensitive material from China.com surfaced before the 
shares were sold on the Nasdaq, but Yip argued that Xinhua has been 
instrumental in expanding the company's operations in the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly believe that we must work with the government,  
particularly in China,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Xinhua, with a 10.9 percent stake in the company,  
other key shareholders are Hong Kong-based New World 
Infrastructure, with 18.2 percent; and U.S. Internet access 
provider America Online Inc., with 8 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Browns Set for Raucous Home Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Orlando Brown will never forget the ugly scene  
in the old Cleveland Stadium on Dec. 17, 1995, the last time the 
Browns played a home game. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing bleachers and seats ripped up and tossed on the  
field, and batteries and fireworks thrown at the Cincinnati 
Bengals, Brown wanted to visit with some of Cleveland's fans who 
were about to lose their treasured football team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the Dawg Pound at the end of the game,''  
Cleveland's mammoth offensive tackle said. ``I had always heard 
them calling my name, but I never had looked in their eyes. They 
were crying, man. That's when I realized how much people love their 
football here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they take the field Saturday night in the new 72,000-seat  
Cleveland Browns Stadium, the expansion Browns will be welcomed 
like conquering heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	There's sure to be more tears in the stands, but these won't be  
tinged with sadness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns will be home again.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has been waiting nearly three years for Saturday  
night's home opener against the Minnesota Vikings. A giant clock in 
the downtown's Tower City Mall has been counting down the days 
until kickoff since the NFL announced in 1996 it would bring the 
Browns back for the 1999 season as an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns' home opener will culminate a weeklong celebration,  
which included a stadium dedication, a parade through the city 
streets on Friday and a pep rally in Public Square which drew an 
estimated 40,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Kickoff was still 36 hours away, but Cleveland was carrying on  
like it was New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans chanted, ``Here We Go Brownies, Here We Go, Woof, Woof!''  
as Mayor Michael R. White, instrumental in bringing pro football 
back, thanked Browns fans for their support. 
</P>
<P>
	White recalled that when the city was trying to convince the  
league to return the Browns, he was often asked: ``What does 
Cleveland want?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'We want our team, our name and our colors,'' he said.  
``And guess what Cleveland. We have our team. We have our name. We 
have our colors. We have our legacy, and a brand new stadium to 
boot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even a planned rally by the Ku Klux Klan, which has stolen  
recent headlines and increased racial tension in the city, has been 
able to dampen Cleveland's enthusiasm about the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Browns take the field in their traditional orange  
helmets Saturday night, fans may be too excited to care much about 
what is happening on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This town is fired up,'' said cornerback Antonio Langham, who  
like Brown played for the Browns in '95. ``They've waited three 
years for this. Football is back, a new stadium, the whole nine. 
You might see more hitting in the Dawg Pound than you do on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland coach Chris Palmer is hoping for a much better effort  
from his team than he got a week ago in Tampa Bay when the Browns 
(1-1) were awful in a 30-3 loss to the Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer will start rookie quarterback Tim Couch, the team's No. 1  
overall pick in the NFL draft against the Vikings (0-1). Couch, so 
impressive in his pro debut against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall 
of Fame Game, was under siege most of the time last week.

	Death Toll Climbs Again in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Working amid the stench of rotting  
corpses, rescuers warned today that a lack of clean water and 
toilets could spread disease and drive the death toll higher from a 
quake that killed more than 10,000 people and may have trapped tens 
of thousands more. Three people were pulled alive from beneath 
crumbled buildings three days after Tuesday's quake, but time was 
running out and little hope remained that others would be rescued. 
The disaster threatened to rival Turkey's most destructive quake -- 
a 7.9 temblor in 1939 that killed 33,000 people.

<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- A Time-CNN poll has found that 84 percent of  
Americans believe George W. Bush should not be disqualified from 
the presidential race if he used cocaine in his 20s. Eleven percent 
said it should disqualify him. After first refusing to answer 
questions about whether he used drugs, the 53-year-old Texas 
governor said yesterday he had not used drugs in the past 25 years. 
The poll of 942 Americans age 18 or older was conducted yesterday. 
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It wasn't a record month, but for the many  
folks who remember July as hot and dry -- you're right. In 105 years 
of recordkeeping, it was the seventh driest July on record in the 
Central and Southeast states and the ninth driest in the Northeast. 
At the same time it was the seventh warmest July in the Northeast 
and 10th warmest in the East North Central region of the country, 
the National Climatic Data Center reported today. However, 
residents of the East North Central States sloshed through their 
third wettest July on record.

	Headers May Cause Mental Harm  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Adult soccer players appear to suffer a loss of  
some mental abilities over time, possibly from whacking the ball 
with their head, two researchers suggested today. Their study 
bolsters a growing body of research pointing to possible mental 
harm from headers. But researchers caution that no study has 
conclusively demonstrated that headers -- as opposed to concussions 
from colliding with other players -- are to blame. It is also 
unknown if the impairment, as measured by psychological tests in 
such studies, translates into any real handicaps in everyday life.

	Supreme Court CD-ROM Released

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supremes have a new greatest-hits  
collection, but this time the featured vocalists are Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist, the late Justice William J. Brennan and other 
current and past members of the nation's highest court. ``The 
Supreme Court's Greatest Hits'' is a CD-ROM compiled by a 
Northwestern University political science professor, with 
recordings of oral arguments in 50 major cases dating back to 1957, 
plus texts of the court's opinions and graphics showing how the 
justices voted. The court decided in 1993 to let anyone get copies 
of the argument recordings from the National Archives.

	WEST DOVER, Vt. (AP) -- Bicyclist Lance Armstrong, riding in his  
first major U.S. competition since winning the Tour de France, 
placed sixth today in the national championships of mountain 
bicycling. Armstrong led the event about midway through but the 
regular mountain bicyclists showed their experience in some of the 
technical riding. Roland Green of Victoria, British Columbia, came 
on strong in the final 8 miles of the race and won the finals of 
the Chevy Trucks National Off-Road Bicycling Association National 
Championship Series.

<HEADLINE> Burnitz Returns to Milwaukee Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- All-Star outfielder Jeromy Burnitz returned to  
the Milwaukee Brewers' lineup Friday night after a month on the 
disabled list with a broken bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz, hitting in the cleanup spot, went 0-for-2 with two  
walks as the Brewers lost 10-3 in the first game of a three-game 
series against the San Francisco Giants. He went on the disabled 
list July 18 after being hit by a pitch during a game against 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``My bat felt quick when I swung, and I saw the ball great,''  
Burnitz said. ``(It was) way better than I expected, actually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz was hitting .273 with 26 home runs and 73 RBIs, both  
still team bests. He was the National League's player of the month 
for June, when he hit .317 with 12 homers and 31 RBIs, and he 
started in his first All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burnie's our lineup,'' interim manager Jim Lefebvre said.  
``He's like Barry Bonds is to the Giants and Mark McGwire is to the 
Cardinals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who were hovering near .500 when Burnitz went on  
the DL, went 11-19 during his absence and fell out of contention in 
the NL Central. Manager Phil Garner also was fired and GM Sal Bando 
was reassigned during that month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just his presence, I think, is going to help us,'' Lefebvre  
said. ``The toughest thing for him will be patience. Just don't try 
to hit a six-run homer. Just relax and play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers tried several players in Burnitz's cleanup spot,  
with little success. On Friday night Milwaukee failed to hit a home 
run in its 11th straight game, the longest drought in franchise 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Alex Ochoa, who is hitting .308 with four homers and  
13 RBIs since the All-Star break, fared the best. Ochoa moved to 
the fifth spot in the lineup with Burnitz's return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any doubt that when one of your main  
guys goes down it adds pressure to the guys around you,'' Burnitz 
said. ``I think getting back in the lineup is going to take some 
pressure off some guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers briefly fell 10 games below .500 during their recent  
road trip, going 3-4. Friday's loss knocked them back to 10 games 
below .500.

<HEADLINE>  Two Moroccans Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been  
stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building 
steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and  
Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 
400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda 
Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze  
medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building  
steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests 
-- including several at the Pan American Games and even others 
announced this week in advance of the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive  
among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited 
laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field  
events. No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said most gold medal winners were tested. Suspicions about  
Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically 
in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	The track and field events were held Aug. 11-14 while the games  
formally opened on Aug. 15 for other events. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey  
withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for 
Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford  
Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers 
tarnished by positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal. The Arab  
Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban 
athletes. Bans imposed by international organizations range between 
two months and life. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan,  
rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the  
country of working with steroids. We have 100 percent confidence in 
the tests and everything has been conducted according to the 
international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time  
in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon. Twelve 
athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.

<HEADLINE> A Thought on TV Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rock video that Marshall Herskovitz saw 15  
years ago still haunts him. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't even recall which band made it. ``I just remember the  
image: A group of people in a post-apocalyptic society tearing down 
walls. There was smoke and filth all around. Annihilation. 
Anarchy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We might wonder why it left such an impression. TV has never  
shrunk from violent displays, and doesn't now, whether on MTV or a 
Fox newsmagazine, on ``NYPD Blue'' or pro wrestling's ``Monday 
Nitro Live!'' Violence is part of TV's stock in trade, including 
chopper-cam coverage of school shootings and workplace massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	So what's the big deal about some rock-video Armageddon?  
</P>
<P>
	Besides, who's Herskovitz to be beefing? He works in TV. He is  
one of Them. His latest series, produced with partner Edward Zwick, 
is ``Once and Again,'' which premieres on ABC in September. 
</P>
<P>
	No one, it's true, will mistake this new drama for a  
shoot-'em-up. Here, as with their ``thirtysomething'' a decade ago, 
Herskovitz and Zwick probe feelings and relationships. While a 
heart may be broken, a skull seldom is. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't absolve them. They are part of TV, and TV,  
along with movies, music and video games, is (so to speak) under 
the gun. And Herskovitz knows it. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't have been surprised when a recent Senate Judiciary  
Committee report concluded that mass media dominate a child's life, 
and their ``exceedingly violent'' images lead to real-world 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	These findings jibe handily with the received wisdom from the  
past half-century: That TV, along with the rest of the media, is 
often harmful and should somehow be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of us have long agreed. Then we witness recent horrors: the  
shootings at Colorado's Columbine High School, Mark Barton's bloody 
rampage in Atlanta and the siege at a Jewish community center in 
Los Angeles, to name just three. We feel a heightened urgency to 
put things right. 
</P>
<P>
	But as John Romano, co-executive producer of NBC's fall drama  
``Third Watch'' and thus another one of Them, wrote in a recent 
issue of Newsweek magazine, ``The more seriously we take the 
possible dangers of TV watching, and the possible need for 'tough' 
government intervention, the more important it is that we raise the 
IQ of the discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, such discussion has been contentious and  
inconclusive since Marshal Dillon blasted his first bad guy on 
``Gunsmoke.'' It has shown no recent uptick in intellectual rigor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor much sign of common purpose. Hollywood cries censorship. The  
gun lobby screams about the right to bear arms. Moral crusaders 
want entertainment sanitized. Politicians want to court the 
greatest number of voters. In the midst of this deadlock, 
Herskovitz is speaking at a seminar at Manhattan's Museum of Radio 
and TV. The subject is TV violence, and despite being one of Them, 
he seems genuinely troubled by some of TV's messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Like that long-ago rock video. ``It was very well done, very  
powerful,'' he somberly recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he knew when he saw it there was more to the picture.  
</P>
<P>
	``I remember thinking, 'That was filmed on a sound stage, and  
all of these people arrived on time, and they were wearing 
costumes, and they got paid.''' 
</P>
<P>
	When lunch was announced, they must have lined up at the craft  
services table and heaped their paper plates. Then at the end of 
the day, someone called it a wrap and everyone went home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is, they were locked in a cooperative venture to  
create an image of utter destruction and anarchy,'' Herskovitz 
says. However unintended, nonviolence lurked as the underlying 
moral of the video. 
</P>
<P>
	But who besides Herskovitz noticed?  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `All the kids who watch it are just going to take  
this image of anarchy and, somehow, somewhere in their minds, it's 
going to click that THAT'S reality.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What haunts Herskovitz, and with good reason, is the irony that  
chaos can be systematically faked -- then taken as the real thing by 
its audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Herskovitz comes armed with no cure-all. But he does voice this  
modest proposal: ``A really strong structure of education and 
interpersonal connection,'' he says, might help kids see the truth 
outside the box called TV. 
</P>
<P>
	In our homes and in schools, we could promote a healthy balance  
in our kids' outlook. And we can resolve that, before we try to 
curtail TV's power, we will reassert ours as viewers. Then we might 
find that, whatever we're looking at on TV -- from rock videos to 
car commercials -- seeing isn't blindly believing. 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, home remedies like these may not seem like much. But it  
sure beats what we're doing now: Just talking through the 
bloodshed, while we wait for a real conversation to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`20/20': The recent shootings in a Los Angeles Jewish community  
center were a frightening reminder of the prejudice and intolerance 
that exists. Buford Furrow Jr., the reputed white supremacist who 
allegedly killed a postman and wounded five -- mostly children -- is 
said to have claimed his attack was ``a wake-up call to America to 
kill Jews.'' But did this hatred have roots in an earlier wave of 
extremist violence? ``20/20 Friday'' re-examines the evolution of 
one right-wing hate group called The Order, which mounted a reign 
of terror in the early 1980s. Meredith Vieira examines the 
conspiracy of hate, focusing on this group some called ``America's 
terrorists.'' It airs tonight at 10 p.m. EDT on ABC.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Tickets Could Cost Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEBER CITY, Utah (AP) -- Tickets for the 2002 Winter Olympics  
will start at about $25 to $30 and run upward to a couple of 
hundred dollars, the president of the games said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake Organizing Committee president Mitt Romney told about  
70 Heber City residents Thursday that they might be able to watch 
biathlon or cross-country skiing events at nearby Soldier Hollow 
for as little as $30. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, he said, expect to pay ``$400 to $500 for  
women's gold-medal figure skating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC spokeswoman Caroline Shaw said ticket policies should be  
adopted by the end of this year. Tickets go on sale in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.4 million tickets will be sold, and Shaw said more than  
half of the tickets will go for $50 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Romney insisted that most tickets will cost between $40  
and $80, prices could be driven up by scalping, which is legal in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The most expensive tickets will probably be for the opening  
ceremony. Romney wouldn't guess a price, but said tickets to the 
opening gala for the 2000 Summer Games in Australia are selling for 
close to $1,000.

<HEADLINE> Phelps Dodge Makes Bids for Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phelps Dodge Corp. upped its bid Friday to $2.7  
billion to acquire Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., two of 
the world's leading producers of copper and metals, a day after the 
two companies had publicly rejected its overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco and Cyprus had announced a $2.2 billion merger last month  
that would form the nation's largest copper company. Thursday, the 
boards of the two companies rejected a lower bid by Phelps Dodge 
worth about $2.56 billion while affirming their plans to go ahead 
with their own combination. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Clarence Morrison, senior vice president at Prudential  
Securities, Inc. said although Phelps Dodge's bid is reasonable, 
there's no certainty it will be able to aquire its two competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Asarco and Cyprus) feel and have always felt that their two  
companies have been undervalued for many years. Their interest is 
now in seeing that they get the best offer possible for the 
assets,'' Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	The unsolicited offers by Phelps Dodge, ranked No. 4 in the  
United States, come on the heels of a huge consolidation in the 
aluminum industry. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Reynolds Metals. Inc. agreed to a $4.4 billion  
acquisition by Alcoa Inc., while last week, Canadian aluminum giant 
Alcan Aluminium agreed to combine with European rivals French 
company Pechiney and Alusuisse-Lonza (Algroup) of Switzerland to 
form an aluminum giant called Alcan-Pechiney-Algroup. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge's bid for Asarco was worth about $960 million and  
its bid for Cyprus Amax was worth about $1.7 billion. The 
Phoenix-based company said neither offer was contigent on the 
success of the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyprus Amax declined to comment, while Asaroc could not  
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge said the tax-free mergers with the New York-based  
Asarco and Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax, would create ``a 
large, resource-rich portfolio of lower-cost global copper assets'' 
and estimated worldwide copper production of the combined companies 
would reach 3.8 billion pounds annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge recently slashed its production by closing mines,  
smelters and refineries throughout the Southwest, laying off 
approximately 1,650 workers in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The 
company has suffered in the wake of dropping copper prices and 
lower copper sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of all three companies traded higher Friday on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Phelps Dodge closed up 56 1/4 cents to $59.12 1/2, 
Asarco closed up $4, or 22 percent, to $22.43 3/4, and Cyprus Amax 
closed up $2.87 1/2, or 20 percent, to $16.43 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Lieberthal Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal, who overcame a pelvic  
injury to become one of the best catchers in the National League, 
agreed Friday to a $19 million, three-year contract extension with 
the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal missed the last two months of the 1998 season and  
wasn't sure if he'd be healthy enough to play when he showed up at 
spring training. His numbers -- .310 average, 25 homers, 78 RBIs -- 
and his first All-Star appearance provided the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hopefully is the first of many long-term contracts,''  
Lieberthal said. ``I really wouldn't want to play anywhere else. 
This is a great chance for us to win for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest effort by the Phillies to show that they are  
committed to building a winner after entering the season with the 
fourth-lowest payroll in the National League. The Phillies signed 
first baseman Rico Brogna to a $4 million, one-year contract 
extension Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 goal is to win here and be successful on the field  
for a long period of time,'' general manager Ed Wade said. ``Our 
second major goal is to retain the nucleus of this ballclub. To 
sign Rico Brogna to a one-year contract and to add Mike to the list 
of multiyear contracts, that certainly is a clear indication that 
we're committed to doing exactly what we said we were going to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal, 27, is second to New York's Mike Piazza among NL  
catchers in homers and RBIs. He leads the league with a .999 
fielding percentage, having made one error in 106 games and 715 
chances. His 84-game errorless streak is the longest current streak 
in the majors among catchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal, who got a $1 million signing bonus, will make $4.5  
million next season, $6 million in 2001 and $7 million in 2002. The 
deal includes a $7.25 million club option for 2003 with a $500,000 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lieberthal signed, the Phillies now focus their attention  
on right fielder Bobby Abreu, who was third in the league with a 
.340 average entering Friday night's game against the Dodgers. 
Abreu, who is eligible for salary arbitration after the season, did 
not agree to a multiyear deal in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said he spoke with Abreu's agents, Peter and Ed Greenberg,  
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll get us to the finish line this time,'' Wade  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lieberthal was batting .256 with eight homers and 45 RBIs when  
he was placed on the disabled list last July 24. His mysterious 
injury was diagnosed as a ``stress reaction'' in the pelvic region. 
Whatever that was, it kept Lieberthal out for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an injury that really took six months to heal,''  
Lieberthal said. ``It was a long injury. When I came to spring 
training, I don't think I was 100 percent, but I was close. There 
were questions in my head about whether I'd ever be able to play 
the same, if this thing would ever heal. It took a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, Lieberthal became the Phillies' ninth catcher to  
make the All-Star team and the first since Darren Daulton in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone from the media to Lieberthal's batterymate, Curt  
Schilling, has questioned the Phillies' commitment to winning. They 
have two winning seasons in the last 13 years and haven't made any 
significant free-agent signings in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with young talent and a low payroll, a second winning  
season this decade is within reach. The Phillies were a season-high 
13 games above .500 two weeks ago and had a shot at making the 
playoffs until Schilling went on the disabled list with a sore 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year or the year before, I would probably look honestly  
at our team and say we're eight or nine players away from really 
competing with the Braves or the first-place clubs,'' Lieberthal 
said. ``Now I can honestly say that we're really close. We're a 
couple of pitchers away.''

<HEADLINE> Headers May Cause Mental Harm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two researchers suspect that a loss of some mental  
abilities among soccer players over time can be blamed on use of 
the head to hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Their study, outlined Friday at the annual meeting of the  
American Psychological Association, bolsters a growing body of 
research pointing to possible mental harm from headers. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers caution that no study has conclusively  
demonstrated that headers -- as opposed to concussions from 
colliding with other players -- are to blame. It is also unknown if 
the impairment, as measured by psychological tests in such studies, 
translates into any real handicaps in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the findings, I think it may be worth pursuing this  
further by asking: Does a lifetime of soccer playing lead to 
problems with social or occupational functioning?'' said David 
Abwender, a neuropsychologist at New York State 
University-Brockport. 
</P>
<P>
	Abwender and Danielle Symons, a doctoral student in sports  
science at the University of Florida, studied 26 men and women who 
played soccer at the Brockport campus and six current or former 
professionals, ages 30 to 55. A group of swimmers was used for 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
	On tests of reaction time and the ability to deduce unstated  
rules of a card game, soccer players did 12 percent and 16 percent 
worse on average than swimmers. Soccer players who have competed at 
relatively higher levels -- and presumably did more frequent heading 
-- performed significantly worse on five of 11 tests, even when age 
differences were accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Webbe, a Florida Institute of Technology psychologist who  
has also studied mental impairment in soccer players, said the 
Brockport study appears to buttress similar findings elsewhere. He 
said simple common sense suggests headers might do harm in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to go up to someone and say, `Would you bang your  
head against that wall 20 or 30 times a day?' you'd probably say, 
`No,''' said Webbe. 
</P>
<P>
	George Baroff, a psychologist who studies brain impairment at  
the University of North Carolina, said such cognitive loss may stem 
from a mixture of repeated concussions from collisions and banging 
from headers. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews, researchers differed in their recommendations for  
parents and soccer leagues because so many questions remain. 
Several encouraged teaching proper heading technique to children 
and using a small ball; some went as far as broaching the idea of 
soft helmets or even banning headers among children younger than 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Haley, the men's soccer coach at Springfield College, said  
he is interested and awaits further research. ``My greatest concern 
as a coach is two guys going full steam and cracking heads,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Rejoins Devil Rays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- There was never any doubt in Jose  
Canseco's mind that he would play again this season. The only 
question he couldn't answer is how well. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old slugger returned to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays'  
lineup Friday night, less than six weeks after surgery repaired a 
herniated disc in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 0-for-2 with two walks in a 5-4 victory over the Kansas  
City Royals. He also was hit by a pitch in the first inning by Jeff 
Suppan, who struck him out with a runner at third with Tampa Bay 
trailing 4-3 in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically didn't get too many pitches to hit. But I felt  
pretty comfortable,'' Canseco said, adding that his back felt fine 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors originally thought the earliest he could come off the  
disabled list would be Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But the pain in Canseco's back was gone the day after surgery,  
and his rehabilitation went so smoothly that even a cautious Devil 
Rays front office couldn't make a convincing argument for holding 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going a lot by what he's telling me, as well as the  
program he's been on,'' said manager Larry Rothschild, who made the 
decision to activate Canseco after throwing batting practice to him 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean he's going to play every day right now. I may  
give him days off, just to keep him healthy. The object is to keep 
feeling good, not to have him feel good and play him until he feels 
bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco had surgery July 11, two days after injuring his back  
against the Florida Marlins. He had similar surgery in 1996 when he 
was with Boston, and felt that experience helped his recovery this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot easier. It was almost no big deal to me,'' Canseco  
said before facing the Kansas City Royals. ``It was like: `OK, my 
back went bad, go in, have surgery and let's go.' It was like my 
30,000-mile checkup. Cut me open, check me out and put me back 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco was voted the AL's starting designated hitter for the  
All-Star game and was leading the AL with 31 homers when he was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to helping a team that went 14-21 without him,  
Canseco was eager to get back to the lineup to resume the quest for 
his 500th career homer. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 72 shy of the plateau, and also hasn't given up on the  
idea of catching AL home run leader Ken Griffey, Jr., and winning 
this season's title. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite not playing since July 9, Canseco only trailed Griffey  
by six. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a far reach as far as what he's done in the  
past,'' Rothschild said of the speedy recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time he came back from this, it was 48 days. This is  
his 42nd day. And this surgery was a lot less intrusive than the 
last time he had it done. The scar is a lot smaller.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canseco trotted onto the field for pregame warmups to the  
applause of teammates and hit the first pitch to him in batting 
practice for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite swinging the bat well in workouts, he said it will take  
a while to regain his timing under game conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could take a couple of days. It could be a week,'' he said.  
``It's impossible to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room on the roster for Canseco, the Devil Rays put  
infielder David Lamb on the disabled list with a back strain.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks ended the week with a solid  
rally even as the prospect of an increase in interest rates next 
Tuesday kept many investors out of the market. At the close of 
trading Friday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was 
up 136.77 at 11,100.61. The Dow gained 126.96 points for the week, 
or 1.2 percent. Broader stock indicators were also higher today, 
although their gains were more modest. Investors today gravitated 
toward a handful of blue-chip stocks, seeking safe bets in case 
interest rates continue to rise, analysts said.

	Japanese Banks Announce Merger Plan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The deal struck by three Japanese lenders to form  
the world's biggest bank generated optimism Friday that similar 
alliances would follow, thinning the ranks of an overcrowded 
industry that has long lost its knack for turning a profit. But 
analysts approached the $1.2 trillion alliance cautiously, saying 
the marriage of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the Industrial Bank of 
Japan Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd. could founder if they fail to unload 
excess baggage. The merger will create a mammoth financial 
institution with complementary strengths -- investment banking for 
IBJ and retail banking for DKB and Fuji.

said it will add two extra hours of trading to thwart encroachment 
from electronic trading. Pending regulatory approval, it hopes to 
add the extra hours Oct. 1. The Chicago Stock Exchange's move comes 
as other exchanges across the country move to extend stock trading

and become more familiar with the company's online banking 
services. Offering $500 discounts on PCs made by Dell and loans at 
prime rate, or 8 percent, officials at the nation's sixth-largest 
bank believe the program will create a contented, more productive 
and computer-savvy work force. The bank has been making a strong

and Wal-Mart Stores are accused of shipping hazardous materials 
without using the proper packaging and inadequately labeling them. 
The FAA increased its number of hazardous material inspectors after 
110 people were killed in the May 1996 crash in the Everglades of a 
ValuJet airliner, a spokeswoman said. The crash was attributed to 
mislabeled oxygen canisters, which caused a fire. Shares in Sears

five-month low on Friday, pushed by uncertainty about 
deficit-cutting reforms and flagging investor confidence in South 
American markets. Brazil's currency was trading at 1.995 to the 
dollar at midday -- down 6 percent from a week ago -- before 
strengthening late in the day to 1.913. For Brazilians, the 
scramble to buy dollars was uncomfortably reminiscent of the panic 
that followed the 1997 crisis in southeast Asia and last year's 
turmoil in Russia. In January, Brazil was forced to devalue its 
currency and plunged into a recession from which it just now is

sexual harassment against a woman by a male co-worker. The lawsuit 
charges the company violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by not 
stopping the harassment. It seeks back pay, costs and damages which 
could reach more than $300,000. The government is asking the court 
to order MBNA to provide programs that ``eradicate the effects of

buying 32 percent of Paxson, the Wall Street Journal reported 
Friday, citing unidentified sources. The move would be worth more

it had hired Salomon Smith Barney to explore its options following 
a landmark Federal Communications Commission decision that allows a 
single company to own more than one TV station in a local market.

Treasury slowed following an influx from quarterly income tax

track for posting a big surplus this year. The Treasury Department 
said Friday that last month's budget deficit of $25.16 billion was 
slightly higher than the $24.08 billion deficit reported in July 
1998. In July, government outlays totaled $147.07 billion, while

1,650 shares of drkoop.com during a June 8 initial public offering 
for $9 and sold it one month later when prices soared to $41.27 a

<HEADLINE> 'Virtual University' Has Quiet Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- So far, reality isn't so pretty for the  
virtual university that opened a year ago amid a lot pomp and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western Governors University was heralded as a landmark  
online college, and Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt predicted that thousands 
of students would be enrolled within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year after the school opening with an operating budget and  
startup costs totaling $13 million, only about 120 students have 
enrolled in slightly fewer than 130 courses offered over the 
Internet by various universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very possible that (the publicity) has created an image  
for it that it will take some time to fulfill,'' Leavitt said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	It's just that the WGU faces a key visit from accreditors next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	While about 100 more students have signed up for four  
unaccredited degrees in the past four months, officials say it's 
the concept, not the numbers, that people should pay attention to. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pioneering here,'' Leavitt said. ``We haven't succeeded  
at it yet, but we're clearly the furthest along of anyone who's 
attempted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Farr, director of distance education and creative  
services at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, isn't so forgiving. 
She said she'd have a lot more students with the same funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm dumbfounded,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Western Governors University was the vision of Leavitt and  
former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer. It has 39 higher-learning 
institutions in 19 states and Guam offering courses over the 
Internet. The goal is to provide college courses to isolated, rural 
citizens and training to workers in highly technical fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Measuring the success of an institution like WGU is difficult,  
said Leavitt, because, ``there is no model to hold us up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe not for long. Michigan Virtual University was launched on  
Wednesday and Kentucky Commonwealth Virtual University is expected 
to go online in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	While enrollment may be low at WGU, educators agree the school  
has forced traditional universities to embrace, or at least 
grudgingly accept, distance learning as a way to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly has given a vision to all higher education in the  
western United States that there are other ways to get a degree,'' 
said Weldon Sleight, an associate vice president at Utah State 
University, a WGU member. 
</P>
<P>
	WGU President Robert Mendenhall said he suspects thousands of  
students have used WGU's course catalog to find Internet classes, 
only to go directly to the university providing the course to 
bypass WGU's $30 processing fee. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, WGU has abandoned the fee in favor of an  
agreement under which member universities share 30 percent of the 
tuition paid by students signing up through WGU. In exchange, WGU 
will market the courses globally. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt says it is the degree programs that will make or break  
WGU. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor says enrollment in ``on track'' for the two-year  
associate degree programs in general studies, network 
administration and electronic manufacturing, and the masters degree 
program in learning and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt expects 300 students in the degree programs by the end  
of the year and believes that should be enough for accreditors to 
evaluate the university when they visit early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Without accreditation, WGU degrees are of little value. But  
Leavitt believes the school will be accredited and enrollment will 
jump. 
</P>
<P>
	It will have to if WGU is to remain financially viable.  
Mendenhall says the school needs 3,000 students in its degree 
programs to break even, a goal he expects to reach in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's annual operating cost is about $4 million. It  
has relied so far on high-tech sponsors such as Apple, IBM, 
Microsoft and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the overhead doesn't kill them then it has a chance of  
succeeding as people become more familiar with the programs,'' said 
John Dunn, program manager for independent learning at the 
University of Colorado in Boulder, a WGU member. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt argues WGU's costs are slight compared to the $25  
million it takes to construct a single brick-and-mortar classroom 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	And he compares WGU's early problems to the University of Utah,  
founded in 1850. The school's current enrollment is about 25,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how many students the University of Utah had its  
first year?'' Leavitt asked. ``Twelve.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Want To Crack Computer Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Law enforcers would have the authority to  
secretly crack the security codes of crime suspects' home and 
office personal computers, under a Clinton administration plan 
reported today in The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department has drafted legislation that, if approved  
by Congress, would allow federal agents to obtain search warrants 
from a judge to enter private property, search through computers 
for passwords and override encryption programs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an Aug. 4 department memo that lays out the  
proposal, encryption software for scrambling computer files ``is 
increasingly used as a means to facilitate criminal activity, such 
as drug trafficking, terrorism, white-collar crime and the 
distribution of child pornography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, investigators would obtain sealed search  
warrants signed by a judge as a prelude to getting further court 
permission to wiretap, extract information from computers or 
conduct further searches. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy advocates have objected to the plan, dubbed the  
Cyberspace Electronic Security Act by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have taken the cyberspace issues and are using it as  
justification for invading the home,'' James Dempsey, an attorney 
for the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Swire, the White House's chief counselor for privacy, told  
the newspaper the administration supports encryption as a way to 
provide privacy for computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it has to be implemented in a way that's consistent with  
other values, such as law enforcement,'' Swire said. ``In this 
whole issue we have to strike the right balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has for years been seeking a law to require  
computer makers to include a so-called Clipper Chip in their 
products that would give police a ``back door'' into computers 
despite any encryption software they may contain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a backlash, More than 250 members of Congress have signed on  
as co-sponsors to legislation that would prohibit mandating such 
back-door devices on computers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Criticizes Arms Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior Russian military official criticized the  
results of the latest Russian-U.S. arms reduction talks today, 
saying there were just too many differences remaining between 
Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no results,'' said Leonid Ivashov, the chief of the  
Defense Ministry's international cooperation department. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides concluded three days of consultations in Moscow on  
Thursday. Much of the talks focused on U.S. wishes to modify the 
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can build a limited 
missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow strongly opposes any changes, saying a missile defense  
system in the United States would upset the current strategic 
balance and could set off a new arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very approach to the development of a national  
anti-missile system in the United States follows the American 
policy path,'' Ivashov said in remarks cited by the Interfax news 
agency. ``First, they take a decision, finance these projects, and 
then Russia is made to face facts on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. proposal would involve a limited missile defense system  
meant to shoot down a single missile or a small number of them. 
Washington argues the system would not spoil the balance of power 
because it would not be effective against the kind of massive 
attack Russia is capable of launching. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivashov also accused the Americans of trying to link ABM treaty  
modifications to the future of the planned START III treaty. START 
III would cut nuclear warheads to between 2,000 and 2,500 per side. 
</P>
<P>
	At the second round of talks, expected in Washington in  
September, ``we expect a constructive approach from the United 
States, without pressure and linkages,'' Ivashov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivashov also announced that Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev plans  
to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen soon to discuss 
the Kosovo situation. He said the meeting is likely to take place 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	That announcement came as Ivashov and other officials were  
threatening to withdraw Russia's peacekeepers from Kosovo or change 
their role there if conditions become ``unacceptable.'' They did 
not elaborate but stressed that there were no such conditions 
present now, Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has said the current international peacekeeping effort in  
the breakaway province is failing to stop ``ethnic cleansing'' of 
ethnic Serbs, Russia's historic allies and fellow Orthodox Slavs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States and NATO are trying to establish their own  
order in the Balkans, excluding the region's nations in the 
process,'' Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Ref Sentenced on Tax Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- An NBA referee has received two years' probation  
and a $5,000 fine for failing to pay taxes on the money he saved by 
``downgrading'' from first class on his league travel, U.S. 
Attorney Kate Pflaumer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Roy Alexander of Tacoma pleaded guilty May 7 to a charge  
he had filed a false tax return for 1993. Alexander admitted to 
having a travel agency make up two itineraries for his travel in 
1993. The one he submitted with his official NBA expense forms 
showed him traveling by first class, when in fact he had downgraded 
his tickets and kept the money without reporting it as income, 
Pflaumer said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a collective-bargaining agreement with the National  
Association of Basketball Referees, the league was required to 
allow referees to travel in first class on trips longer than two 
hours. The agreement also allowed referees to downgrade their 
tickets to a lower class and keep the difference, ``a major 
employment inducement by which potential NBA referees were informed 
that they could supplement their salaries,'' the release said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plea agreement, Alexander admitted he had known he was  
required to report the downgrade money as income. The NBA had taken 
several steps to ensure that referees were aware of the 
requirement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander is one of 15 NBA referees across the country who have  
been prosecuted on similar charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Mack Suspended for 4 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kick returner-defensive back Tremain Mack, who  
has had a series of alcohol-abuse arrests, will miss the Cincinnati 
Bengals' first four games of the season under a suspension 
announced by the league Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, the Bengals' top kick returner, will not be paid for those  
games as a penalty for violating the league's substance abuse 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also decided that the last four  
games Mack missed last season, while in jail for drunken driving, 
will count as a suspension, which will cost him about %62,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the commissioner said Mack is responsible for  
paying a four-week fine based on his 1998 salary for a previous 
violation of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue met with Mack last month and the commissioner said he  
found him to be serious and thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Tremain acquitted himself well when he came in,''  
Tagliabue said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL declined further comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Bengals spokesman Jack Brennan said the team has known since the  
start of training camp that Mack faced possible discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to face the consequences of his actions, but he has  
demonstrated a commitment to learn from his mistakes by undergoing 
counseling and we'll welcome him back for a fresh start after the 
suspension is completed,'' said Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mack, a fourth-round pick in 1997 from Miami, set Bengals season  
records last year for kickoff return yardage and average per 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first two years with the Bengals, Mack had the two DUI  
arrests in Ohio along with other alcohol-related arrests in Texas 
and Florida.

<HEADLINE> Feds Will Try LA Suspect First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first trial for white supremacist Buford  
Furrow Jr. will be a federal case focusing on the killing of a 
Filipino-American mailman rather than a state prosecution for 
shootings at a Jewish community center. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury on Thursday charged Furrow, 37, with murder  
of a federal employee, which carries a potential death sentence. He 
also was charged with gun violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The mailman, Joseph Ileto, was gunned down Aug. 10, shortly  
after five people were wounded at the North Valley Jewish Community 
Center. Police said Furrow shot Ileto nine times because he was a 
nonwhite federal worker. 
</P>
<P>
	At the community center, Furrow fired 70 shots, wounding a  
68-year-old receptionist, a 16-year-old counselor and three boys, 
police charge. He reportedly scouted three Jewish institutions for 
places to kill Jews before settling on the community center. 
</P>
<P>
	He fled the shootings but surrendered in Las Vegas.  
</P>
<P>
	Months of hearings are likely on such issues as pretrial  
publicity, change of venue, use of Furrow's confession to the FBI 
and whether the death penalty will be sought. 
</P>
<P>
	If a mental defense is sought, complex pretrial litigation could  
delay the trial until next year. Furrow has a history of mental 
problems and has had ties to hate groups in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecution spokesman Thom Mrozek said prosecutors could  
return to the grand jury and seek a superseding indictment adding 
civil rights violations or hate crimes to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We acknowledge this is still an ongoing investigation and  
there is the possibility of additional charges including civil 
rights charges which include hate crimes charges,'' Mrozek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow's post-indictment arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Navy Denies It Expects Y2K Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is denying reports it expects  
widespread failures in power, water and other utility services in 
the United States because of the Year 2000 computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy acknowledged Friday it has not verified that all cities  
and communities near its installations are fully prepared for the 
Y2K problem, but its survey of utilities is showing a steady 
improvement, said Rear Adm. Louis M. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have a problem with utilities,'' Smith,  
commander of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, told 
reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy also issued a statement saying, ``There are no  
indications of likely widespread failures of water, electricity, 
gas or sewers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is compiling a database to track the probability of Y2K  
problems with electric power, water, natural gas and sewer services 
in communities near Navy and Marine Corps installations. A recent 
version of the report said partial failures in electric utilities 
were probable or likely in communities that serve about 60 Navy and 
Marine Corps installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that reflected a ``worst-case scenario'' in which  
those utilities whose Y2K preparedness was unknown to the Navy were 
assumed to be likely problems. The most recent version of the 
database, dated Aug. 19 and including more complete data, showed 
about 20 likely problem utilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own assessment of Y2K readiness, the White House  
concluded recently that national electrical failures are ``highly 
unlikely.'' It also called disruptions in water service 
``increasingly unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the Navy's assessment is ``right in sync'' with the  
White House's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem may occur because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
Because the programs were written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900. The could potentially cause problems with financial 
transactions, airline schedules and electrical grids.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Thomas Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROWLEY, La. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings defensive back Orlando  
Thomas has been put on probation for a year after pleading no 
contest to a simple battery charge stemming from an assault on his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who had a six-month jail term suspended under a plea  
agreement, also was ordered Thursday to pay fines and court costs 
of $601 by State District Judge Jules Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	He also must serve five days of home detention by Aug. 19, 2000,  
the judge ruled. Edwards, who also ordered Thomas to complete a 
domestic abuse and anger program, gave him credit for completing an 
NFL domestic abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was arrested in April after his wife, Demetra, called the  
sheriff's office in Acadia Parish and said she had been assaulted. 
She was treated at a hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was born in Crowley, played high school football there  
and owns a home in the town, which is 140 miles west of New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing, Thomas returned to preseason training with  
the Vikings.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii's Midlife Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii turns 40 on Saturday, and like others  
that age it's in a midlife crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 21, 1959, when President Dwight Eisenhower welcomed the  
islands as America's 50th state, spirits were high and confident. 
Sugar was king and a second boom industry, tourism, had just dawned 
with the arrival a few weeks earlier of the first commercial 
jetliner at Honolulu's airport, an event that brought out 
lei-bearing crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next three decades, the economy underwent spectacular  
growth, but the honeymoon ended in the 1990s. A nine-year economic 
slump shows no clear signs of ending, and it is testing the unique 
institutions of the Aloha State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hawaii is now searching,'' said Leroy Laney, an  
economics professor at Hawaii Pacific University. ``Certainly given 
what Hawaii is used to since statehood, the last 10 years have been 
totally different, and the level of political discontent is 
growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three legs of Hawaii's post-World War II economy -- tourism,  
agriculture and the military -- have shown weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent Asian financial crisis has lowered visitor arrivals  
from that region, keeping Hawaii from America's economic expansion. 
Last year, 6.7 million people visited the islands, a drop of nearly 
2 percent from the year before, the Hawaii Visitors &AMP; Convention 
Bureau said. But the largest foreign segment -- visitors from Japan 
-- declined by nearly 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar and pineapple -- generating $250 million at statehood --  
have slumped to $177 million as growers move operations to cheaper 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, most former cane fields grow subdivisions, and Honolulu's  
signature pineapple cannery hosts a Signature Theatres multiplex. 
Farmers now plant coffee and macadamia nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Statehood opened the door to a flood of mainland and foreign  
capital. By the late 1980s, Japanese investment in Hawaii 
properties caused real estate prices to surge. 
</P>
<P>
	But that wave washed out. Investors now unload properties for a  
fraction of their purchase prices, often losing millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcies jumped 30 percent in 1998 and foreclosures 14  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	June's unemployment rate of 6.2 percent was well above the  
national figure, 4.5 percent. Gov. Ben Cayetano recently said the 
state budget will run a $124 million deficit within four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Voter discontent almost cost Cayetano his job in November.  
Then-Maui Mayor Linda Lingle, a Republican, came within 5,000 votes 
of ending the Democrats' 36-year hold on the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Young Hawaiians looking for work voice disappointment.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of my friends that have good jobs don't live here,'' said  
Chris Reed, 29, a University of Hawaii graduate business student. 
``As much as I would love to live here, it doesn't seem like 
there's a whole lot of possibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tough times are hitting more than wallets. Some say the  
state's famed ``aloha spirit'' is eroding, as the property-crime 
rate ranks fourth in the nation and letters to the editor complain 
of rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before statehood, people were nicer,'' said Richard Ishida,  
72, a retired Honolulu firefighter. ``In those days, everybody was 
close-knit. Not today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Questions that were put aside during more prosperous years are  
getting a loud airing in today's Hawaii, putting pressure on 
powerful institutions such as the Democratic Party and public 
employee labor unions, which have gained influence with the growth 
of state government. At the same time, few politicians publicly 
advocate scaling back social welfare programs that have given 
Hawaii a national reputation for compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	From the uneasy present, it's hard to resist viewing 1959 as a  
more optimistic time. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii, which had been a kingdom and a republic, ended its  
60-year status as a U.S. territory after its congressional 
delegate, John Burns, forged a deal with powerful Texas Democrats, 
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and House Speaker Sam 
Rayburn. The statehood pact brought Hawaii into the Union but 
allowed Alaska to enter first. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Senate Dixiecrats assumed that Hawaii's delegation would  
support civil rights, given the islands' ethnic diversity. Staunch 
anticommunists worried that Hawaii's militant labor unions were 
strongholds of the ``Red Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In granting statehood to Hawaii, we actually invite four  
Soviet agents to take seats in the U.S. Congress,'' Rep. John 
Pillion, R-N.Y., said on the House floor on March 11, 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional approval came the next day.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, Hawaiian economic and political life had centered on  
the plantations, where immigrant workers powered mills and 
canneries, toiling almost as indentured servants. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called ``Big Five'' companies -- Alexander &AMP; Baldwin Inc.,  
Amfac Inc., C. Brewer &AMP; Co. Ltd., Castle &AMP; Cooke Inc. and Theo H. 
Davies &AMP; Co. Ltd. -- controlled life in the fields and in the 
Territorial Legislature. As Republicans, company patriarchs opposed 
statehood, fearing a loss of power and arguing that taxes to run 
the new state government would be high. Washington paid for 
territorial government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union  
infiltrated the fields by night, often passing union cards 
underneath bathroom stalls. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, union-backed Democrats routed Republicans from the  
Territorial Legislature and have controlled state politics since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very easy transition for (the union) to make in  
engaging the rank-and-file members that statehood would extend 
political democracy to them,'' said Ah Quon McElrath, 83, a former 
plantation labor organizer now on the University of Hawaii Board of 
Regents. ``The workers understood they needed all the help they 
could get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, economic realities were changing.  
</P>
<P>
	A Qantas Boeing 707 touched down at Honolulu International  
Airport on June 30, 1959, introducing jet travel to Hawaii. Visitor 
numbered 243,000 that year, and passed 1 million in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, tourism is an $11 billion industry employing more than  
180,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	But that dependency on visitor spending has left the state more  
vulnerable to outside events such as the 1991 Gulf War and the 
Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Now state officials tout efforts to diversify the economy and  
make Hawaii the high-technology, health care, education and 
retirement centers of the Pacific. Most haven't yet reached 
fruition. 
</P>
<P>
	That fragile balancing of Hawaii's sun-splashed identity and its  
high-tech aspirations leaves this 40-year-old state struggling to 
find its niche. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are part of a world community, but how we retain that place  
in the world community is one of the questions in the future that 
we must decide,'' McElrath said.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Signs Veteran Forward Reid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- General manager Ernie Grunfeld continued to  
retool the Milwaukee Bucks' roster Friday, signing free agent 
forward J.R. Reid to a three-year, $6.6 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is the third veteran acquired by the Bucks in two days. On  
Thursday, Milwaukee traded forwards Chris Gatling and Armon Gilliam 
to Orlando for Danny Manning and Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's contract fits under the Bucks' salary cap because of the  
$2.2 million middle-class exception. Milwaukee has 14 players under 
contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding his size, aggressiveness and experience to that of our  
current players bolsters our front line,'' Grunfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid, 31, finished last season with the Los Angeles Lakers,  
where he averaged 9.0 points and 5.2 rebounds. Reid was acquired by 
the Lakers from Charlotte last season in the five-player trade that 
sent Glen Rice to Los Angeles and Eddie Jones to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks are the fifth team for Reid, a former Olympian and the  
fifth overall pick in the 1989 draft. He also has played for San 
Antonio and New York, and he played the 1996-97 season in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've added another key player in J.R., who's not afraid to do  
the little things that make a basketball team successful,'' Bucks 
head coach George Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks have searched in vain for quality big men during the  
1990s, but the team now has six players who are 6-foot-10 or taller 
on its roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's up-and-down career experienced a revival last season. His  
points and rebound averages were his highest since the 1992-93 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	He provided a physical presence and quality minutes, sometimes  
as a starter, for the Lakers late in the season and into the 
playoffs. The Bucks could use some of the same spark that Gatling 
was supposed to provide, but never did. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid became a physical leader for the Lakers during the playoffs  
when he outmuscled and outplayed Charles Barkley during their 
series win over the Houston Rockets. Reid also picked up a $10,000 
fine for knocking Scottie Pippen to the floor during the 
series-clinching win.

<HEADLINE> Feds Sue MBNA for Sex Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  
Commission has filed a civil rights lawsuit against MBNA Corp., 
alleging that the credit card company allowed a two-year pattern of 
sexual harassment against a woman by a male co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, charges the  
company violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by not stopping the 
harassment. It seeks back pay, costs and damages which could reach 
more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims that Maureen Harns, 33, of Newark, was forced to  
take a medical leave of absence when she suffered an emotional 
collapse in February 1997 from ``intolerable'' working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Harns no longer works for MBNA. However, James Hogan, the  
co-worker named in the suit, continues to work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is asking the court to order MBNA to provide  
programs that ``eradicate the effects of its past and present 
unlawful employment practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the company has a policy in place to combat  
sexual harassment, but did not follow it. 
</P>
<P>
	MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said the company would not comment  
on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC said it filed the lawsuit after an investigation and  
failing to settle with the company on behalf of Harns. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second formal charge against MBNA in the past year  
by the federal government. In December, the Labor Department filed 
a complaint against MBNA alleging hiring discrimination against 
minorities who sought jobs as account representatives and 
telemarketers. 
</P>
<P>
	MBNA officials denied those charges at the time, claiming 24  
percent of new hires during the two-year review period of 1994 and 
1995 were minorities. That case is pending.

<HEADLINE> Drug Poisonings Seen To Be Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Tiedemann was pretty prompt for a  
15-year-old, so when his blaring alarm clock and a friend's phone 
call didn't rouse him for school, his stepfather got a bad feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the bedroom door, he found Michael dead.  
</P>
<P>
	Just lying there in bed, a kind of white froth at his lips and  
nose the only clue to why he died. 
</P>
<P>
	An easy-to-get or mix-it-yourself drug -- a growing craze for  
teens and young adults -- killed Michael, described by his parents 
as an honor-roll student who loved karate and wanted to become a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug GHB is luring even people who insist they'd never touch  
``real drugs'' like cocaine, who say it provides that relaxed, 
uninhibited feeling of a few drinks but faster, cheaper and without 
the telltale alcohol smell. 
</P>
<P>
	But GHB, usually sold as a colorless and odorless liquid but  
sometimes as a powder, is dangerous. It causes sudden comas and 
seizures. Originally developed as a surgical anesthetic, it 
depresses breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospitals from Maryland to Colorado are reporting GHB poisonings  
suddenly rising in the past year. Nobody really keeps count, but 
the government estimates at least 32 people have died and 3,500 
others have needed treatment for overdoses since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Add Michael to that list. The coroner determined he vomited  
while in a deep, GHB-induced sleep -- and consequently, unable to 
awaken or turn over like you could during normal sleep, suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
	His parents told Michael's story in hopes others will heed GHB's  
dangers, but they contend even Michael's classmates in Fort Pierce, 
Fla., still use the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just don't think it will happen to them,'' says his  
mother, Debbie Alumbaugh. ``If we can get this through to the kids, 
and one more child does not die, then our child will not have died 
for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some teens say they were never warned. ``You tell us about  
marijuana and alcohol every day. You should have told us about 
GHB,'' a Michigan teen-ager told school officials there last spring 
after a 15-year-old classmate also died from GHB. 
</P>
<P>
	Body builders first abused GHB in the early '90s. Then, easy to  
slip into drinks, it became a date-rape drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, it's the latest trend, touted as a party drug or even a  
sex enhancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that just doesn't seem to go away,'' says John  
Taylor of the Food and Drug Administration, which banned the drug's 
sale nationwide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this year, the FDA has seized or ordered destroyed  
thousands of vials of GHB sold under such names as Invigorate, 
Longevity and Blue Nitro, shut down companies that sold GHB-mixing 
kits on the Internet, and begun prosecuting distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FDA can crack down only on makers or distributors.  
Twenty states make GHB possession by an individual illegal, and 
Congress is debating a similar federal law. But enforcement varies 
widely -- Florida is one of those states, but Michael Tiedemann's 
parents complain the police never could ferret out who gave him 
GHB. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB is hard to staunch, because people can mix up quarts at a  
kitchen sink. Recipes abound on the Internet. All it takes are some 
common chemicals -- the main ingredient is a paint thinner. 
</P>
<P>
	One Internet recipe recommends storing GHB in glass in the  
refrigerator, a very dangerous recommendation because it's so easy 
to confuse with water. A Tennessee woman died in June after 
apparently unknowingly drinking GHB from a water bottle in a 
friend's car. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say most people willingly use GHB, hunting a quick  
high. It's de rigeur on some nightclub scenes, where GHB's potency 
is made far worse by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy to overdose,'' warns Dr. Sandra Frazier of the  
University of Alabama, Birmingham, whose emergency room in a single 
week treated six people in their 20s for GHB poisonings at area 
nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, because one GHB batch can differ greatly from the next,  
a dose that gave you a mild buzz one day could kill you the next, 
Frazier warns. 
</P>
<P>
	If you know a friend has used GHB, don't leave them alone, she  
adds -- you may need to dial 911. 
</P>
<P>
	And remember GHB has lots of names. Aside from ``cherry meth,''  
``liquid ecstasy,'' and ``Georgia homeboy,'' it's also touted by 
its main ingredient, GBL or gamma butyrolactone -- a paint-thinning 
chemical that turns into GHB inside the body.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Bucks Sign J.R. Reid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks have signed veteran forward  
J.R. Reid to a multiyear contract, the third veteran the club has 
acquired in the last two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid finished last season with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he  
averaged 9.0 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. Reid was acquired by 
the Lakers from Charlotte last season in the five-player trade that 
sent Glen Rice to Los Angeles and Eddie Jones to the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bucks are the fifth team for Reid, a former Olympian and the  
fifth overall pick in the 1989 draft. He also has played for San 
Antonio and New York, and he played the 1996-97 season in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``Adding his size, aggressiveness and experience to that of our  
current players bolsters our front line,'' Bucks general manager 
Ernie Grunfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Milwaukee traded forwards Chris Gatling and Armen  
Gilliam to Orlando for Danny Manning and Dale Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've added another key player in J.R., who's not afraid to do  
the little things that make a basketball team successful,'' Bucks 
head coach George Karl said.

<HEADLINE> Old Artist Desgins Modern Camouflage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anyone in Kosovo who has trouble  
distinguishing an American from a Russian soldier can blame the 
confusion on camouflage uniforms designed with the ideas of an 
American artist a century ago in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Uniforms, however, are missing from an exhibit of work by the  
artist, Abbott Handerson Thayer, at the National Museum of American 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, rightly so, since Thayer's work suffered from his  
passionate and eccentric efforts to convert the U.S. and allied 
military to his ideas on camouflage, according to Charles Meryman 
Jr., son of a painter who worked closely with Thayer. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Thayer's main ideas, now visible in uniforms, was that a  
pattern of broken shapes makes a soldier a more confusing target 
for snipers. One painting in the exhibit, done with the elder 
Meryman, shows how even a brightly colored peacock can be hard to 
see among foliage. 
</P>
<P>
	Another picture is an innocuous water color of dead brown  
leaves. Place an overlay mask on it and a nasty copperhead snake 
appears coiled among them. Take off the overlay again and the snake 
disappears to become part of the composition. Artist Rockwell Kent 
helped him on this one, as did his wife Emma and his son Gerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Meryman called him the ``father of camouflage.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Thayer met a lot of resistance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your experiments are of no more value than ... putting a raven  
in a coal scuttle and then claiming he is concealed,'' President 
Theodore Roosevelt wrote him after leaving the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Today the U.S. Army issues a standard ``woodland'' uniform in  
earth colors and a pattern of broken shapes such as Thayer 
recommended. Young civilians have adopted the fabric as a fashion 
statement. British, German, French and Russian soldiers in Kosovo 
all wear similar uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists in France had some ideas of their own. One of Pablo  
Picasso's biographers tells how the painter was walking down a 
Paris boulevard in the winter of 1914 with American writer Gertrude 
Stein and others when they saw a convoy of camouflaged artillery 
roll by. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the ones who did that!'' Picasso said. ``That's  
cubism!'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the French army set up the first unit dedicated to  
camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians redesigned camouflage uniforms after the collapse  
of the Soviet Union. They replaced the green, brown and black 
summer pattern with black, gray and white spots in winter. Chechen 
rebels, various insurgent and government forces also have used 
them, sometimes making it hard to distinguish warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer also was highly regarded early in the century for his  
portraits and landscapes, especially of Mt. Monadnock near his 
home. He also liked painting angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he is mostly remembered, if at all, for a portrait of his  
daughter Mary, 11, dwarfed by huge white wings behind her shoulders 
which appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1993. The original 
is in the current show. 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer died in 1921.  
</P>
<P>

	``Abbott Thayer: The Nature of Art'' will be at the National  
Gallery of American Art through Sept. 6. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Eyes Improved N. Korea Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea's new willingness to negotiate  
about missile tests could provide a timely opening for improving 
relations, an Ohio congressman headed for a tour of the communist 
nation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is there. I see a lot of good signs,'' said  
Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall will make his fifth trip in five years to North Korea next  
week. As with the other visits, the trip will be primarily 
humanitarian. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said in an interview, however, that he also will use the  
opportunity to speak with officials in Pyongyang and tell them how 
important it is for them to abandon efforts to test a ballistic 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a firing ``would create tremendous problems'' for North  
Korea if it hopes to expand trade with the rest of the world, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, an official of the North Korean Foreign Ministry  
said his country is ready for negotiations over its reported plan 
to test-launch a long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea created alarm last August when it launched a  
ballistic missile over Japan. Analysts have said the North Koreans 
were on the verge of testing a missile with an even greater range, 
one that theoretically could reach as far as Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, South Korea and the United States have said North Korea  
would face economic and diplomatic penalties if it test-launches 
the missile. Hard hit by food shortages, Pyongyang gets aid from 
all three countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a golden opportunity to make some progress, and we  
should take advantage of it,'' Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, an expert on hunger and poverty who has traveled widely in  
Africa and Asia, said food shortages are not as great a problem in 
North Korea as they were during his visit last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect to find things a little better,'' he said, but  
contaminated drinking water continues a huge problem as does the 
lack of adequate medicine or heat in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said his visit would include a trip to several remote,  
mountainous regions along North Korea's northern border with China. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be in the country Aug. 26-29.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Names 1st Black Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas hired its first black police chief Friday,  
promoting an assistant chief and 19-year veteran of the force. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant chief Terrell Bolton, 40, will become the city's top  
law enforcement officer on Sept. 30 when the current chief retires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton said that being named the first black chief feels ``very  
good,'' but added: ``I don't get a lot of joy that it's taken so 
long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Ben Click said while it was important to have a black man  
run the city's police department, Bolton was the most qualified of 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see Chief Bolton as an African American. I see him as  
an extremely talented individual,'' Click said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolton joined the force in 1980 and now commands half the  
department's six patrol divisions.

<P>
	Given a second chance, Bill Parcells took Rick Mirer.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Jets, still seeking a backup quarterback, obtained  
Mirer from the Green Bay Packers on Friday for an undisclosed draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells, while with the New England Patriots, bypassed Mirer  
with the first pick in the 1993 draft and selected Drew Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Now as Jets' coach, Parcells has added Mirer into the battle for  
the job of backing up Vinny Testaverde. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirer, who was drafted second in 1993 by Seattle, has never  
lived up to expectations, bouncing from the Seahawks to Chicago and 
then to Green Bay. His competition in New York will be Scott Zolak 
and Ray Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
	In six years, Mirer has completed 867 passes for 9,541 yards,  
with 41 touchdowns and 62 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	After going to Green Bay last September, Mirer was the Packers'  
third quarterback for 12 games and then moved up to No. 2 when Doug 
Pederson was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson left for Philadelphia as a free agent in the offseason,  
but the Packers felt Mirer was expendable because of the progress 
made by Matt Hasselbeck and rookie Aaron Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	Strong safety Tyrone Braxton has decided to rest a strained calf  
muscle in his right leg and miss Denver's exhibition game against 
the Green Bay Packers on Monday in his hometown of Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't just another game for me, but you don't want to  
risk further injury,'' Braxton said. ``They said that if I'm not 
100 percent, they won't let me go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up, Braxton spent a lot of time on the Wisconsin campus  
and dreamed of playing in Camp Randall Stadium and then later 
having a career with the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to sneak into the stadium and watch the Badgers  
play,'' Braxton said. ``I wanted to get a scholarship there, but 
was a little too small.'' 
</P>
<P>

	Surgery is scheduled for Ernest Dye on Sunday to repair nerves  
damaged in a car accident that nearly severed his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors feel confident that Dye's arm will remain viable. The  
offensive lineman has already undergone one operation to repair the 
bone and restore blood flow to his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other players in the car at the time, Lester Holmes and Carl  
Simpson, received only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Right tackle Earl Dotson was back on the field after missing  
every practice this week because of a bulging disk in his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Dotson is not sure what his immediate future is, but hopes to  
play in Monday's exhibition game against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little sore,'' Dotson, a seventh-year player, said.  
``I'm going to try to work through it and aim for Monday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive line coach Larry Beightol isn't sure if Dotson will  
see action in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't decided what we're going to do,'' Beightol said.  
``If the doctors give him the OK, then we'll play him some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dotson took an injection Sunday after Saturday's exhibition  
opener and said he felt fine, but then woke up Monday with pain. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he tweaked his back in the offseason lifting weights and  
then aggravated it two days before an intrasquad scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known it was there for two years. The fact that really  
scared me is when we did an MRI, it actually showed it was worse 
when I first did it. That got me antsy a little bit. After talking 
to our medical staff, they assured me they will try everything to 
get it better without having surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery, which is a last resort, would mean Dotson would miss  
four to six weeks.

<P>
	Tremain Mack, who has had a series of alcohol-abuse arrests, has  
been suspended by the NFL and will not be allowed to play in the 
first four games of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also decided that the last four  
games the kick returner-defensive back missed last season, while in 
jail for drunken driving, will count as a suspension, which will 
cost him about $62,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension, which will complete an eight-game suspension for  
violating the league's substance abuse policy, begins Sept. 5, and 
runs through Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the suspension without pay, the commissioner said  
Mack is responsible for paying a four-week fine based on his 1998 
salary for a previous violation of the policy. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Ty Law, who had one year remaining on his contract, agreed to a  
six-year contract extension that makes him the second-highest paid 
cornerback in football behind Deion Sanders. Both the total package 
and the $14.2 million signing bonus are the biggest in franchise 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first name that you hear when people say cornerback is  
Deion Sanders. ... I would even say Deion Sanders,'' Law said after 
agreeing to a extension that could pay him $50 million over the 
next seven years. ``I want to be at that same level. When I retire, 
five years later I want to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is structured so that it frees up about $450,000 in  
salary cap space this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Law, 25, the Patriots' first-round draft choice in 1995, led the  
team with nine interceptions last season and was named co-MVP in 
the Pro Bowl. He has 18 interceptions in four seasons, good for 
10th on the team's career list.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Charged With Hiring Hit Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Veteran criminal defense lawyer Frederick Ford has  
a new role: defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is charged with hiring a hit man -- actually an undercover  
agent -- to kill two former clients who allegedly could have 
testified about his involvement in the kidnapping of a marijuana 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents detail the alleged deal, including Ford's  
request that the killer empty an entire clip into each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want them dead. I don't want them to suffer,'' he  
allegedly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The burly 6-foot-6 attorney was in federal court Friday as his  
lawyer asked that he undergo a competency evaluation. Magistrate 
Judge Joyce London Alexander granted the request. 
</P>
<P>
	The courtroom was packed to capacity with colleagues and friends  
of Ford, a married father of two who has practiced law in Boston 
since 1991. Before that, he was a federal probation officer for 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ford, 48, wanted the two unidentified former  
clients dead after he learned they might testify against him in a 
federal investigation into the kidnapping last year of a 
``large-scale marijuana dealer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford allegedly proposed the kidnapping and expected to receive a  
share of proceeds from the ransom money. The U.S. attorney's office 
wouldn't release any further information about the kidnapping, 
including its outcome, because it is the subject of an ongoing 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an affidavit by a Drug Enforcement Administration  
agent, Ford confided to a government informant early last month 
that he had learned of the kidnapping investigation and wanted the 
two men dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant later secretly recorded Ford saying he was  
prepared to kill the men himself and had thought about hiding in a 
van and shooting one with a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 26, a special agent from the Department of Labor's  
racketeering division, posing as a prospective hit man, contacted 
Ford. Speaking in an elaborate coded language, the two hatched a 
plan to kill the former clients, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Ford allegedly gave the ``hit man'' $11,000 in a  
meeting at a doughnut shop that prosecutors say was caught on 
videotape, audiotape and in photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where Ford allegedly requested that entire clips be  
emptied into each victim, and offered to bring the men to a 
restaurant so the hit man could ``eyeball'' them before the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The undercover agent told Ford he was involved with stolen  
diamonds, and Ford suggested a second kidnapping -- of a wealthy 
jeweler's son, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the undercover agent met Ford at a hotel and told  
him the killings had been committed. The agent asked if Ford was a 
religious man, and if he had any problems with his conscience.

<HEADLINE> ASU's Redmond a Heisman Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- A national title for Arizona State, a  
Heisman Trophy for J.R. Redmond. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the heady scenario for the Sun Devils a year ago. What  
followed was one of the most disappointing seasons for any team in 
college football in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State finished 5-6, and Redmond limped through an  
injury-plagued season of disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely a test of character,'' Redmond said. ``You  
want to try to be strong to the finish, strong when the others 
aren't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he struggled along with his teammates through the early  
part of the season, Redmond seemed to be hitting his stride against 
Stanford in the seventh game. He scored three touchdowns in the 
game's first 15 minutes, including a 58-yard run and a 76-yard punt 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a stubbed toe changed everything.  
</P>
<P>
	``The game he was hurt, the first time he touched the ball, he  
took my breath away,'' coach Bruce Snyder said. ``I thought `He's 
going to score six or seven touchdowns tonight.' He had that look 
about him. His legs were alive. Then he stubbed his toe, got a 
sprained toe, and it went to his ankle, and it was all downhill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 6-foot tailback, beefed up to 217 pounds, is back,  
healthy and primed for a senior season that he hopes will erase the 
bad memories of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman? Redmond insists that's far down his list of  
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really too much care about that,'' he said. ``I just  
want to play ball. I don't put any time or effort or thought into 
what other people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, who hopes to graduate next May, said he would have come  
back for his senior season regardless of what happened in 1998, but 
quarterback Ryan Kealy said the team's failures last season hit the 
tailback hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a little bit of a bitter taste in his mouth,''  
Kealy said. ``J.R.'s a competitor to the end. He's probably the 
most competitive guy we've got on our team, and competitors hate to 
lose. I think it really bugged him that we went 5-6 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says a lot about him that he came back and finished up  
school and he's ready for a great season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Returning players point to a lack of leadership on last year's  
team as a major reason for its underachievement. The leadership is 
much better this year, Kealy said. But Snyder is hoping the team 
won't have to count on Redmond as being one of the main leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his number one role on our team is to perform,''  
Snyder said. ``I've really felt that way about great tailbacks 
throughout my career. There's enough pressure on them that they 
don't need the added pressure of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's comfortable for him to wear the mantle of a leader,  
fine. The number one thins is to run the football, catch the 
football, return the football. That's his job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kealy also hopes the Arizona State offense is good enough  
elsewhere to ease the pressure on Redmond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to depend on J.R. having a 60-yard punt return  
to win the game anymore,'' Kealy said. ``He's going to do it, 
because that's him. But we're not just going to sit back and wait 
and watch until he does his thing. I think that will help him out 
mentally and pick up the attitude of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond knows that a lot of people in Arizona don't think he's  
even the best tailback in the state. Down Interstate 10 in Tucson, 
Arizona's Trung Canidate is mentioned as a Heisman contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know there was a rivalry,'' Redmond said.  
</P>
<P>
	But there's no doubt Redmond knows what's going on in Tucson,  
and that the Wildcats, not the Sun Devils, are the team mentioned 
as a national title contender this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond' top personal goal for the season?  
</P>
<P>
	``Beat the Wildcats,'' he said. ``That's the only thing I can  
think of. I'm happy to see them do good. I hope they do good, so we 
can knock them off at the end of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Suspended UC Player Was Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Sophomore forward Eugene Land was arrested for  
shoplifting on Tuesday night, two days before the University of 
Cincinnati suspended him for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Land, a 6-foot-8 backup from Cincinnati, is scheduled to appear  
in Hamilton County Municipal Court on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's department said Land was observed selecting  
merchandise from a display at a department store and placing it in 
a shopping bag. He was stopped by security as he left the store. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Post reported that Land was found to have about  
$256 in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Huggins suspended Land on Thursday, but declined to  
give a reason. He would not comment on the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Land will remain on athletic scholarship during the fall  
quarter, but will not participate in conditioning, practice or any 
basketball activities. Land could be reinstated for the winter 
quarter, Huggins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Land averaged 3.2 points and 1.7 rebounds for the Bearcats last  
season.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Gregg Jefferies was activated Friday from the  
15-day disabled list by the Detroit Tigers, who optioned Gabe 
Alvarez to Triple-A Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferies, 31, had been on the disabled list since Aug. 3 with a

	Death Toll in Turkey Passes 9,000  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Rescuers pulled two children out of the  
rubble of Turkey's devastating earthquake today, while the 
government admitted that the lack of water and sweltering heat made 
chances of survival slim for the up to 35,000 people still believed 
trapped. People trapped in such situations usually die of 
dehydration after 72 hours -- a window that passed early today for 
Turkey's quake victims. The death toll surged to 9,082 dead, with 
about 34,000 injured.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian warplanes today attacked  
Islamic rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and raided 
villages held by the militants in neighboring Dagestan, the Defense 
Ministry said. The airstrikes on two villages inside Chechnya 
raises the prospect of widening the two-week-old conflict, which 
has so far been concentrated in several villages in Dagestan. It is 
Russia's most serious internal conflict since the 1994-96 war in 
Chechnya.

	Storm Strengthens in Gulf of Mexico

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A tropical storm moving slowly northward  
through the Gulf of Mexico could strengthen into a hurricane by 
tonight, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reports. 
Tropical Storm Bret was located about 230 miles southeast of 
Tampico this morning and moving northward about 7 mph with maximum 
sustained winds near 65 mph. A tropical storm warning was extended 
northward to the coastal town of La Pesca, 350 miles north of the 
Gulf port city of Veracruz. The center is advising Texans to keep 
an eye on the storm's weekend track.

	Headers May Cause Mental Harm  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Adult soccer players appear to suffer a loss of  
some mental abilities over time, possibly from whacking the ball 
with their head, two researchers suggested today. Their study, 
outlined at the annual meeting of the American Psychological 
Association, bolsters a growing body of research pointing to 
possible mental harm from headers. But researchers caution that no 
study has conclusively demonstrated that headers -- as opposed to 
concussions from colliding with other players -- are to blame. It is 
also unknown if the impairment, as measured by psychological tests 
in such studies, translates into any real handicaps in everyday 
life.

	Congress Talks Back Through E-Mail  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate members are increasingly  
using e-mail to take their message directly to voters, although no 
one seems inclined to ditch the taxpayer financed system of mail 
for lawmakers. Nevertheless, some offices now are sending hundreds 
of e-mail messages at a time. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., e-mails 
his legislative schedule and an update on issues each Monday to 
about 5,000 constituents. Congress has been getting steadily more 
high-tech. No members had Web pages before the start of the 104th 
Congress in 1995, and now all but six do, a House spokesman said.

collection, but this time the featured vocalists are Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist, the late Justice William J. Brennan and other 
current and past members of the nation's highest court. ``The 
Supreme Court's Greatest Hits'' is a CD-ROM compiled by a 
Northwestern University political science professor, with 
recordings of oral arguments in 50 major cases dating back to 1957, 
plus texts of the court's opinions and graphics showing how the 
justices voted. The court decided in 1993 to let anyone get copies 
of the argument recordings from the National Archives.

Jones industrial average was up 123.79 at 11,087.63, building on 
earlier gains and wiping out yesterday's 27-point loss. On the 
NYSE, advancers led decliners 1,579-1,303. The Nasdaq was up 16.60

about whether to play for the Wings or sign with a team in his 
native Sweden. Last season, Lidstrom had 14 goals and 43 assists in 
81 regular season games. He was the runner-up for the Norris 
Trophy, awarded to the best defenseman.

	Turkey Rescuers Worry About Disease  
</P>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Working amid the stench of rotting  
corpses, rescuers warned Friday that a lack of clean water and 
toilets could spread disease and drive the death toll higher from a 
quake that killed more than 10,000 people and may have trapped tens 
of thousands more. Three people were pulled alive from beneath 
crumbled buildings three days after Tuesday's quake, but time was 
running out and little hope remained that others would be rescued. 
The disaster threatened to rival Turkey's most destructive quake -- 
a 7.9 temblor in 1939 that killed 33,000 people.

Americans believe George W. Bush should not be disqualified from 
the presidential race if he used cocaine in his 20s. Eleven percent 
said it should disqualify him. After first refusing to answer 
questions about whether he used drugs, the 53-year-old Texas

The poll of 942 Americans age 18 or older was conducted Thursday. 
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent.

Gulf were closed Friday to small and medium craft navigation. 
Hurricane Bret was located 215 miles east of Tampico and heading

reported. The storm crossed the hurricane threshold with maximum 
sustained winds of 75 mph and was expected to continue building

December parliamentary elections, apparently to counter mounting 
opposition to Boris Yeltsin and his coterie. The bloc will be led 
by Sergei Stepashin, who was sacked as premier last week. It would 
include political parties led by two other ex-premiers: Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia and Sergei Kiriyenko's New Force, 
the Interfax news agency reported.

increase its military observer contingent to 210 and demanded that 
rebels start disarming. The council voted unanimously, as an 
interim measure, to triple the U.N. mission from the 70 military 
observers currently authorized for the West African country. The 
vote reflected the council's concern about the fragility of a July 
7 peace agreement between the government and the rebel 
Revolutionary United Front.

Clinton urged all sides in the conflict Friday to trust each other 
enough to lay aside their arms. ``We have got to help them let 
go,'' he told a fund-raiser for the American Ireland Fund. Clinton 
said peace will not flourish in Northern Ireland if its leaders do 
not put total faith in the agreements that can create it. That can 
start, he said, by laying down arms without insisting that some 
other faction go first.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Auctions Cable TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German telecommunications giant Deutsche  
Telekom said Friday it has received initial bids for its lucrative 
cable television network. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that said they made offers included U.S.-based  
Callahan Associates International, Dutch-based United Pan-Europe 
Communications and Germany's PrimaCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. reportedly is in talks with Deutsche Bank to  
form an alliance for a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom spokesman Hans Ehnert said the bid deadline  
passed at noon Friday, but refused to release details on the 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has been ordered by the government to shed its  
cable TV units in the interest of competition. Telekom is Germany's 
leading cable provider, with a 34 percent market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ehnert said the sale of all nine regional cable networks -- which  
have been valued at up to $10 billion -- isn't expected to be 
completed before next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not under time pressure,'' he said from the company's  
headquarters in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
	The bids received Friday are non-binding offers that could lead  
to negotiations with any of the bidders, Ehnert said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were various reports Friday of companies forming groups to  
bid for Telekom's network, including European and U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan Associates International confirmed Friday it is leading  
a group of companies in a bid. They includes BancAmerica Equity 
Partners, Blackstone Capital Partners III, Capital Communications 
CDPQ, Texas Pacific Group and Angelo Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	Callahan Associates' chairman and founder is Richard J.  
Callahan, the former president of U S West Inc.'s international 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	United Pan-Europe Communications said it planned to make an  
initial bid for most, if not all, of the network. Spokeswoman 
Henrietta Hearst confirmed UPC plans to make a bid, though she said 
she couldn't discuss details. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's PrimaCom also said Friday it has bid for four of nine  
of Telekom's regional cable television units.

<HEADLINE> Bush Offers Parents Drug Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- George W. Bush, holding the door shut today  
against questions about his past, said fellow baby-boomer parents 
must warn their children about drugs and alcohol. ``We owe children 
that responsibility -- to share our wisdom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The morning after the Republican presidential front-runner  
worried allies by abandoning his strategy to ignore have-you-ever 
questions about past drug usage, Bush calmly took reporters' 
questions at a homeless shelter that, among other things, offers 
treatment to drug users. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Texas governor refused to say what anti-drug  
message he might have given his own 17-year-old twin daughters -- 
``I'm going to leave my daughters out of the campaign,'' he said -- 
but did expound on the matter when the question was rephrased more 
generally. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the interesting questions facing Baby Boomers is, have  
we grown up? Are we willing to share the wisdom of past mistakes? 
... I think a baby boomer parent ought to say -- 'I have learned 
from the mistakes I may or may not have made, and I'd like to share 
some wisdom with you and that is -- don't do drugs.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats alike predicted Thursday, after Bush  
denied for the first time any illegal drug use dating back to 1974, 
that he had opened the door to persistent, embarrassing queries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should have stuck with, 'I'm not talking about it,''' said  
Democratic consultant Dave Brown of Washington. ``The sharks won't 
ever stop circling now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he was back on message. Asked if his experience over the  
past two days gave him any empathy for President Clinton, who has 
weathered his own share of personal scrutiny, Bush simply repeated 
almost verbatim what he had been saying for weeks: ``I told the 
American people that years ago I made some mistakes. I've learned 
from those mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he learned this week, he said, is that ``sometimes politics  
can be unnecessarily ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under increasing pressure, Bush told reporters Thursday that he  
has not used illegal drugs in the past 25 years, declaring that if 
voters object to his refusal to reveal more ``they can go find 
somebody else to vote for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could have met the anti-drug standards of his  
father's White House, which inquired about an applicant's drug 
usage 15 years prior to background checks. President Bush served 
from 1989-93. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Bush told The Dallas Morning News that he had not  
used drugs in the past seven years -- the time frame used in normal 
FBI background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The comments were a dramatic departure from Bush's long-stated  
objection to questions about his personal history. He is asked 
almost daily about illegal drug use, though there is no evidence or 
credible allegation that he has ever violated drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Bush advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
he decided to respond to the background check question after having 
aides clarify the precedent in the Bush White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor felt it was relevant to ask whether he could  
abide by the standards required of White House employees, aides 
said, and he hoped that staking out a 25-year time frame would 
settle any anxiety among voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Political consultants expected the questions to persist, but  
predicted little harm would come to Bush's campaign in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's proven his early statement -- that once you engage, it  
doesn't stop the questions -- was right. His initial instincts on 
this were right,'' said GOP political consultant Ed Gillespie, who 
doesn't work for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the amount of fire, this will soon smolder,'' said  
Democratic consultant James Carville. ``But as long as you have 
something smoldering, you can add fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Carville, who has worked for Clinton, said people care  
little about such personal issues -- especially after the Monica 
Lewinsky affair 
</P>
<P>
	``If all that didn't matter, I can't imagine what Bush might  
have stuck up his nose 20 years ago will move people one way or 
another,'' Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some rank-and-file Republicans are displaying signs of anxiety  
about Bush's background. Mike Francis, chairman of the Louisiana 
GOP, said party members eventually may seek more answers.

	``I don't think it's right as a leader of the state party to  
demand this or that (of candidates), but I do think it's a very 
interesting question that Louisiana Republican voters will very 
soon force a 'yes' or 'no' on,'' Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to keep GOP followers from getting jittery, the Bush  
campaign shipped ``speaking points'' to the offices of several 
lawmakers and governors. ``What you are talking about is ALL rumor, 
gossip and worse,'' the memo read. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, confronting the first contretemps of his front-running  
campaign, may have inadvertently exposed himself to questions about 
drug use into his teens by saying he could ``pass the background 
check and the standards'' applied at the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration requires the FBI to ask White House  
applicants about drug usage since their 18th birthdays. Bush 
refused to answer that question Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to tell people I made mistakes and that I have  
learned from my mistakes. And if they like it, I hope they give me 
a chance. And if they don't like it, they can go find somebody else 
to vote for,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of things to come, he was asked at his next campaign  
stop about possible drug usage during his stint in the Texas Air 
National Guard from 1968-73. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never would have done anything to endanger myself,'' he  
replied.

<HEADLINE> Switch in Greek Orthodox Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The appointment of Metropolitan Demetrios of Greece to lead  
America's 1.9 million Greek Orthodox Christians resulted in part 
from an unprecedented campaign to oust his predecessor among lay 
church members. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was led by Greek Orthodox American Leaders (GOAL),  
which raised and spent nearly $1 million in the cause over the past 
three years. Some critics even threatened to break away from the 
patriarchate and declare an independent church. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment came Thursday after the sudden resignation of  
Archbishop Spyridon, the first American-born leader of the U.S. 
church accused by critics of stifling dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon also suffered a severe blow last January when all five  
U.S. metropolitans, or regional bishops, told Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew of Istanbul, Turkey, that Spyridon should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world's 300 million  
Eastern Orthodox Christians, and his advisers appointed Spyridon in 
1996, and have now moved him out in favor of Demetrios, 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, Greek hierarchs serve for life.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from New York City church headquarters, Spyridon  
all but admitted he had been forced out, saying he submitted a 
resignation ``for reasons totally independent of and unrelated to 
my personal intentions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will be temporarily assigned to unspecified church duties in  
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Popps, a McLean, Va., business executive and spokesman for  
GOAL, said ``there's no gloating. This has been a tremendous ordeal 
for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popps said the group's effort was aided by technology: ``Our Web  
site and e-mail allowed us to cut through hierarchical 
structures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the American metropolitans lobbied for Bartholomew to  
appoint one of their number to replace Spyridon, Popps said 
Demetrios has ``an excellent reputation'' among U.S. clergy and 
will be welcomed. Though currently serving in Greece, he formerly 
taught at the Greeks' Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon, 54, spent much of his career in Europe. Critics said  
he could not relate to parishioners who are third- and 
fourth-generation Americans and feel less tied to Byzantine and 
Greek traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Spyridon claimed he was only trying to protect the church's  
values and traditions. In his statement, he referred obliquely to 
church tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart is clean of any malice, ill will, or judgment of  
others,'' he said. He added that he enjoyed the loyalty of ``the 
vast majority of the faithful.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Tobacco Settlement Signed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Tobacco farmers in 14 states could begin  
getting checks by the end of the year from a $5 billion fund 
intended to help agriculture deal with the economic impact of a 
national tobacco settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers farmers and quota holders, or those who  
hold government licenses to market tobacco. It is linked to the 
$206 billion national settlement between cigarette companies and 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake County Superior Court Judge Donald Stephens signed the  
secondary settlement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina farmers and quota owners could receive about $2  
billion over the next 12 years, the largest portion of the 
settlement among the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``The price of the product is going to rise. The consumption of  
this product is going to go down,'' said attorney Phil Carlton, who 
represented the cigarette companies in negotiating the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton said it became obvious in trying to negotiate a federal  
settlement that the tobacco industry has wide-ranging effects on 
the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the settlement, tobacco companies Philip Morris,  
R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard will deposit $190 
million with a state court within 10 days and another $190 million 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A board dominated by state officials is deciding how to divide  
the money between growers and quota holders. 
</P>
<P>
	David Weinstein, a member of the settlement board, said dividing  
the money between growers and allotment holders will be difficult, 
since both groups believe they should get most of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think probably the best we can do is make everybody mad,''  
Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other states involved are Kentucky, Tennessee, South  
Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Missouri, West 
Virginia, Alabama, Maryland and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong 6th in Mountain Bike Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DOVER, Vt. (AP) -- Bicyclist Lance Armstrong, riding in his  
first major U.S. competition since winning the Tour de France, 
placed sixth Friday in the national championships of mountain 
bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong rode a strong race, leading the event about midway  
through. But the regular mountain bicyclists showed their 
experience in some of the technical riding on single-track trails 
in the woods surrounding the Mount Snow resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot harder than I thought,'' Armstrong said after the  
race, surrounded by fans begging for his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner Roland Green of Victoria, British Columbia, rode  
side-by-side with Armstrong through the early and middle of the 
race and was impressed with the American's abilities bouncing over 
roots and around switchbacks in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `That's just strange. Lance shouldn't be this good in  
the technical,''' Green said. ``But that's a testament to what a 
great rider he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green came on strong in the final eight miles of the race and  
convincingly won the finals of the Chevy Trucks National Off-Rode 
Bicycling Association National Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He crossed the finish line of the nearly 24-mile race in  
2:12:07, more than three minutes ahead of sixth-place Armstrong. It 
was Green's first mountain bicycling victory. ``I've been trying so 
hard to win a NORBA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second place went to Travis Brown of Boulder, Colo., who  
finished 49 seconds behind Green. He was followed across the finish 
line by Luke Stockwell of Australia, who was 1 minute, 15 seconds 
behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was clearly Armstrong that the huge crowd at Mount Snow  
turned out to see after his emotional victory in the Tour de France 
last month, just three years after recovering from testicular 
cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unreal thing what he has done to come back,'' Green  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong described the race as ``very, very tough'' and said  
there was no comparison to his regular regimen of road riding. 
</P>
<P>
	He started in the second row of the mass-start race and quickly  
surged forward into the top pack of riders. He remained in the top 
three positions on the first three laps of the six-lap race, taking 
the lead for about a lap. Each lap was 3.8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	But he dropped back about two-thirds of the way through the  
race. Several spectators said they saw him brush into a tree on a 
small descent. It appeared to knock the wind out of him 
momentarily, although he remained on the bike and kept riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bumped a tree and it threw me off my pace,'' Armstrong said,  
adding that did not affect his riding. ``My lack of calories 
(did),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the race, Armstrong said it was not particularly unusual  
for him to be riding a mountain bike race because he does that in 
the off season in his adopted hometown of Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fits into what I consider my job, which is racing  
bicycles,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Noel Elliott Home After Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The brother of San Antonio Spurs forward Sean  
Elliott was released from a hospital Friday, four days after 
donating one of his kidneys for a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliott, 32, one year older than his brother, was  
discharged from Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, where 
doctors said both brothers were recovering ``exceptionally well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery to remove the kidney took place Monday morning. The  
organ was immediately implanted in Sean Elliott's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year NBA veteran who helped lead the Spurs to  
their first league championship in June, needed the transplant 
because of a condition called focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. 
The illness prevents the kidneys from properly filtering waste from 
the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials said Sean Elliott could be released by  
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Crane At Ballpark Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- An ironworker working on the Miller Park  
construction site said Friday the project manager ignored his three 
warnings about lifting a 400-ton piece of roof July 14 that 
eventually killed three workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry King was quoted in Saturday's editions of the Milwaukee  
Journal Sentinel as saying he confronted then-supervisor Victor 
Grotlisch with concerns about high wind and the uneven lift by the 
567-foot crane. 
</P>
<P>
	But King backed down when Grotlisch said the lift would proceed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Victor, someone's going to get hurt,' '' King said.  
``He said, `Like it or not, we're flying it. I said, `All right, 
I'll keep my mouth shut.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, ironworkers Jeffrey Wischer, William DeGrave and  
Jerome Starr were killed when the crane collapsed on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was going to happen. I knew it. I knew from the  
moment I told Victor it's not picking up right,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Grotlisch and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of  
America, the subcontractor in charge of building the retractable 
roof, called King's story bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the day of the accident, there's nothing in anything he's  
told us that would support that he was alone with the ironworker,'' 
lawyer Franklyn Gimbel said. ``Based on my debriefings of Victor on 
several occasions, I think it's a bogus story this person is 
advancing.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Reporter To Give Back IPO Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- ABC's medical correspondent is returning  
more than $50,000 to a Web site after violating insider-trading 
rules by selling shares too soon after the health-care site went 
public, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nancy Snyderman, who appears on ABC's ``Good Morning  
America,'' serves as a director of drkoop.com, an Internet site 
named after its founder, former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett 
Koop. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyderman's husband bought 1,650 shares of Austin-based  
drkoop.com during a June 8 initial public offering for $9 a share 
and sold it one month later when prices soared to $41.27 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a violation of Securities and Exchange Commission rules  
barring corporate officers and directors from profiting from a 
stock sale within six months of purchasing shares, said Sue 
Georgen-Saad, chief financial officer of drkoop.com. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC rules consider husbands and wives to be one person for  
filing purposes. Snyderman's husband, whose name could not be 
obtained Friday, does not work for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said, ``Our understanding at  
the moment is that this is an issue of personal finance not having 
really anything to do with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snyderman didn't return calls to The Associated Press for  
comment. She told The Wall Street Journal that she and her husband 
tried to stop the stock sale after realizing it would violate 
federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she ``notified the authorities and disclosed it  
immediately in compliance with SEC regulations. Compliance with the 
SEC is of paramount importance to me and will continue to be so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her position on the company's board of directors,  
Snyderman also contributes content to the consumer site, including 
a column in which she answers general medical questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyderman has worked for ABC for 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Rockies GM Bob Gebhard Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard  
resigned Friday as the team struggled through the final weeks of 
its third straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies owner Jerry McMorris announced Gebhard's resignation at  
Coors Field while the Rockies played the Cubs in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Geb's decision,'' McMorris said.  
</P>
<P>
	He fended off questions about recent reports that he planned to  
fire Gebhard at the end of the season, saying, ``That would be pure 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Gebhard didn't tell him whether speculation about  
his job contributed to his decision to resign, but added it could 
have been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rumors have been more intensive as time has gone by and it's  
clearly taken its toll on Geb,'' McMorris said. ``It was difficult 
for everybody here. There are a lot of red eyes in the organization 
today. He's our friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard did not attend the news conference and wasn't available  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's responsibilities are being taken over by Pat  
Daugherty, vice president for scouting; Gary Hughes, vice president 
for player personnel; and Tony Siegal, director for baseball 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said Hughes is a candidate to become GM.  
</P>
<P>
	``But we're going to do a thorough search,'' the owner said.  
``There are no external names on the list yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard's job has been in jeopardy for a year. Colorado, which  
made the playoffs in 1995 in its third season, finished 77-85 last 
year. The Rockies kept Gebhard but fired manager Don Baylor and 
replaced him with Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado is last in the NL West, starting Friday with a 54-69  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard, 56, was hired in the fall of 1991, about 18 months  
before the Rockies started play. In the November 1992 expansion 
draft, he selected Vinny Castilla, Curtis Leskanic and Kevin Ritz. 
He also traded for Dante Bichette and signed Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard has made other shrewd deals, notably signing free agent  
Larry Walker before the 1995 season. But he has been criticized for 
other moves, such as the acquisitions of Greg Harris, Darryl Kyle, 
Bill Swift and Bret Saberhagen and the departures of Galarraga, 
Walt Weiss, Andy Ashby, Brad Ausmus, Joe Girardi and Armando 
Reynoso. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making the playoffs, the Rockies have disappointed fans.  
They finished 83-79 in each of the 1996 and 1997 season before 
dropping below .500 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While Colorado has the top batting average in the National  
League, it has the worst ERA in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebhard began his professional baseball career as a pitcher,  
playing 11 years that including stints with the Minnesota Twins and 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a player/coach for Montreal from 1974-75, was promoted to  
minor league field director in 1976 and later to pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Minnesota Twins in 1987 as director of player  
personnel, and became a team vice president the following year.

<HEADLINE> Warnings Earn Pentagon Reassignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Security Service transferred its  
general counsel to another Pentagon agency after he repeatedly 
warned his bosses they were violating regulations by taking 
shortcuts on security background checks, according to a report 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today says counsel Thomas Willess was moved to the National  
Imagery and Mapping Agency about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper says that several current and former Defense  
Department officials said Willess repeatedly cautioned his bosses 
about relaxing standards for conducting background checks. They 
either ignored him or in some cases didn't consult Willess, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The security service does about 120,000 checks a year on  
department employees and military contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	Willess issued a statement saying only he had ``taken positions  
that were not always in lockstep'' with his Defense Security 
Service bosses. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said Willess was never told why he was transferred.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon had no comment.

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Jimmy Armaos, the wrestler and exhibition  
strongman nicknamed ``New Hercules'' who became a celebrity in the 
1950s and 60s for feats of strength, died Aug. 15 from heart 
complications. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Armaos, who reportedly once worked as a bodyguard in the United  
States for singer Frank Sinatra, became famous for such feats as 
lifting weights, snapping chains and bending iron bars. He also 
would lie on the ground while trucks drove over his chest. It is 
said he once benched 617 pounds.

American League record for putouts in a game when he caught Bob 
Feller, died at his home in Metairie on Sunday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	George was called up to the majors by the Cleveland Indians in  
1936 and caught Feller when the pitcher struck out 17 in his major 
league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked later about catching the future Hall of Famer, George said  
``How would you feel if you knew you were making history? Feller 
never knew how to throw easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current AL record for putouts is 20, last done by Dan Wilson  
of Seattle in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	During five years in the majors, George also played with the  
Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Athletics. He 
finished with a .177 batting average in 118 games.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nathaniel Kleitman, a researcher who  
pioneered the study of sleep and was among the first to link rapid 
eye movements to dreams, died Friday. He was 104. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, Kleitman and his students at the University of Chicago  
noticed that people who had rapid eye movements during sleep 
remembered their dreams after they awakened. Those whose eyes did 
not move rapidly awoke with no memory of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, the researchers were able to associate  
patterns of eye movements with motions in dreams. They also found 
the average person dreams for about two hours each night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleitman also performed sleep deprivation experiments, including  
one in which he stayed awake for 180 hours. It was an effective 
form of torture, he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleitman was born in Russia and moved to the United States in  
1915. He spent 35 years as a professor at the University of Chicago 
until his retirement in 1960.

set a precedent that required all funeral homes nationwide to 
provide equal services to blacks and whites, died Thursday. He was 
89. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver gained national attention in 1973 after winning a federal  
lawsuit against Escude Funeral Home for discrimination after the 
business refused to embalm his deceased mother, Martha Pierre 
Oliver, because she was black. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center in  
Montgomery, Ala., pushed the case forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit stated that Escude Funeral Home and Hixson  
Bros. Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with 
blacks or offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same 
prices that were charged to whites.

<P>
	The cause of death was not immediately known. Police released  
few details.

<P>
	There were no signs of foul play or obvious trauma, Defillo  
said.

<HEADLINE> Perrot Will Always Be a Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It will get harder before it gets easier. Everybody who loved  
Kim Perrot understands that now. 
</P>
<P>
	But soon enough, family, friends and her Houston Comets  
teammates will remember what she stood for: that giving anything 
less than all of themselves would be cheating all the others. And 
then soldiering on will not seem quite as hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has lost a member of its family,'' backup center  
Tammy Jackson said Thursday night from the team's hotel in Los 
Angeles. ``Kim's faith and determination in life will constantly 
inspire us both as individuals and as a team. Her fire will always 
motivate us to not only win games but to enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 10,'' she added, ``will always be a member of the Houston  
Comets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot died Thursday afternoon of lung cancer, surrounded by  
family and friends, after six months of fighting the disease. The 
only reason anybody was surprised she lost was because Perrot beat 
everyone and everything else she took on. 
</P>
<P>
	There were tears at the WNBA's only game, Cleveland at New York,  
later in the evening. In Houston, Comets fans wore white ribbons 
and pink hearts with ``Kim'' inscribed on them to honor her at a 
game earlier this week. But in few places was the hurt more 
palpable than in the hotel rooms where Perrot's teammates prepared 
to go on without her. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets were in Los Angeles preparing for tonight's game  
against the Sparks before moving on to play Sacramento on Saturday. 
Postponing the games was never an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``She would be kicking their tails if they didn't play,''  
Carroll Dawson, the club's executive vice president, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing will be tougher for some than others. And the moment you  
saw Cynthia Cooper struggling to hold herself together when the 
national anthem was played at the Comets game Monday night, you 
thought she was going to have the toughest time of all. Instead, 
she went out and dropped 42 points on Utah -- two shy of her 
career-high -- in an 80-71 win. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of those sad-turned-wonderful nights when the games  
seem like the heavy business of life, instead of the other way 
around. Cooper knew she was about to lose a close friend and 
running mate and somebody was going to pay. The redeeming part is 
that the somebody was just a basketball team. And when she was 
done, Cooper ran into the embrace of her own team, exhausted and 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was like that the first few nights for Bo Kimble after he  
lost his friend and sidekick, Hank Gathers. On a Sunday night in 
March, 1990, in the middle of a game, Gathers collapsed on the 
court within shouting distance of his mother and aunt in the 
stands. Moments later, his heart gave out on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Comets, Gathers' Loyola Marymount teammates decided to  
keep playing, if only to dedicate their effort to Gathers. They 
accepted an NCAA bid awarded the team when the conference 
tournament was canceled and immediately took off on one of the 
greatest runs the college postseason has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a comet, Marymount was kept aloft by a high-octane mix of  
anger, grief and nervous energy in the wake of Gathers' sudden 
death. In successive games, Kimble and a supporting cast of 
overachievers zoomed past New Mexico State, Michigan and Alabama 
before crashing back to earth in a loss to eventual national 
champion UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning a championship for Perrot won't be as daunting a mission  
for Cooper &AMP; Co. -- at least the playing part. Cooper has been the 
leading scorer and league MVP in the two seasons completed so far, 
the reason why the Comets are the WNBA's two-time defending 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, Perrot was her Gathers and Houston's catalyst, a  
tenacious defender who could score as well as set up others. 
Replacing her points and assists won't be the hard part; replacing 
her spirit will. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very tough on them,'' coach Van Chancellor said,  
``because they just lost Kim. She was such a vital part of this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the friends Kim Perrot left behind will remember  
that she willed them the desire to keep playing, not a set of 
instructions on how it was to be done. Then each of them will have 
to take the lessons she taught them and figure that out for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the passage of time, they will discover what Bo Kimble  
did: that the hole the death of a friend or a family member leaves 
in your heart doesn't stay empty forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``A day doesn't go by that something doesn't happen that reminds  
me of Hank,'' Kimble said a few years after Gathers' death. ``The 
difference is that not a lot of it is painful anymore. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Reveal New HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients damaged by HMO decisions would get  
limited new rights to sue their health plans under legislation 
disclosed Friday by Republican lawmakers trying to keep their 
fractured party together on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill provides the patient protections that the American  
people have been demanding for years,'' said a statement from Rep. 
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who developed the bill with Rep. John Shadegg, 
R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert has promised to bring the bill to the  
House floor for a vote in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal outlined Friday includes many of the same popular  
measures found in Democratic and some GOP bills. Unlike the bill 
passed by Senate Republicans, the Coburn-Shadegg measure would 
cover all 161 million Americans with private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	It would require health plans to let patients appeal to  
independent panels when care is denied. It would guarantee payments 
for reasonable emergency room visits and allow women direct access 
to gynecologists and obstetricians, without prior referrals. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients harmed by an HMO's actions could sue in federal courts  
but not state courts, which are more prone to large jury awards. 
And health plans that promptly follow recommendations of the 
independent panels would not be liable for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This measured bill demonstrates that Congress can protect  
patients without prescribing costly new benefit mandates or 
encouraging frivolous lawsuits,'' Shadegg said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill leaves out another provision backed by many Democrats,  
giving doctors the right to determine medically necessary care. 
Insurance companies would retain that right. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and other GOP leaders hope the legislation will dissuade  
Republicans from supporting a bill backed by Democrats and 
Republicans led by Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	With only a razor-thin majority in the House, Republicans could  
lose a floor vote on the politically charged issue unless they come 
up with a bill that brings back many of the 20 Republicans who 
signed onto the bill co-sponsored by Norwood and Democratic Rep. 
John Dingell of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Dingell and Norwood announced their coalition,  
Hastert directed Coburn and Shadegg to develop an alternative 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	This represents the first time GOP leaders have backed an  
increased right to sue. Business and insurance companies argue it 
will drive up the cost of health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, in particular, worry that they will be sued,  
although the new legislation tries to clarify that they are 
protected if they are not the ones making the health care decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance and business groups have been using this month, while  
Congress is in recess, to rally opposition to HMO legislation. The 
American Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, aired a 
new television ad this week, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is 
urging its network of businesses to contact members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the fight for affordable health care, it's the trial  
lawyers vs. working Americans,'' says one HMO ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn and Shadegg urged opponents to avoid campaigning against  
their bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a campaign,'' Shadegg said, ``will invite a backlash and  
confirm the widespread sentiment among the public and members of 
Congress that the industry's primary motivation is profit, not 
patient care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backers said the measure ultimately will include provisions  
meant to help the uninsured buy insurance, but those have not been 
fully developed yet and were not released Friday.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond OK After Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond was hospitalized  
briefly Friday after he became dizzy and collapsed at a university 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, 96, told reporters gathered outside Palmetto Baptist  
Medical Center in Columbia that he felt good. 
</P>
<P>
	But he appeared unsteady on his feet as he walked to his car  
about 6:25 p.m., two hours after he was brought to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was admitted after collapsing at a reception for a  
federal magistrate at the University of South Carolina, Thurmond 
spokesman John DeCrosta said. The South Carolina Republican never 
lost consciousness, DeCrosta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond was expected to attend a wedding Saturday in  
Charleston, said state Sen. John Courson, a friend of Thurmond's. 
</P>
<P>
	First elected to the Senate in 1954, Thurmond became the oldest  
person to serve in the Senate at age 93. At age 94 he became the 
longest-serving senator ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond has been hospitalized briefly several times in recent  
years, including for a day in Washington after he became dizzy 
during a Promise Keepers rally in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	That December, Thurmond spent several days in a military  
hospital for a respiratory infection and earlier that year he spent 
several days at a hospital in Washington recovering from the flu.

<HEADLINE> Museum, Mill Town Fight Over Monet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The city of Lawrence says 88 years is enough: It  
wants its Monet back. 
</P>
<P>
	That's Monet, the painter of ``Field of Poppies, near Giverny,''  
which was loaned to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts all those years 
ago along with 16 other works. 
</P>
<P>
	But the museum says the down-at-the-heels community 25 miles  
outside Boston is just going to sell the paintings, and refuses to 
give them up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, attorneys from both sides were in Suffolk Superior  
Court debating the fate of the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people lend you something, you're supposed to give it  
back,'' said Richard Renehan, an attorney for the paintings' 
trustees, the Daniel White Fund of Lawrence. ``The trustees have a 
right to control this art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fund administrators say their desire to reclaim the paintings  
and sell them is consistent with the wishes of the art's original 
owner, the Rev. William Wolcott. The artwork would fetch an 
estimated $5.5 million to $7.5 million at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1911, Wolcott willed the paintings to the fund to ``create  
and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly among the 
people of Lawrence.'' He ordered the pictures housed at the museum 
until a suitable gallery could be built in Lawrence, a city better 
known for industry than culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a century later, such a gallery is still not in the  
city's plans, said Thomas F. Caffrey, president of the White Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	And the works -- which include the Monet, two works by Camille  
Pissarro and paintings by American artists Hugh Bolton Jones and 
Alexander Lawrie -- are not benefiting the people of Lawrence, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only the Monet and Pissarros are on public display. The  
other paintings, which are much less valuable, are in basement 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the museum, Andrew Griesinger, said the will's  
language stipulates that the trustees keep the paintings, not sell 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the museum's possession of the paintings is  
perfectly legitimate unless the trustees make alternate 
arrangements -- such as with nearby Merrimack College -- to house 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to Mr. Wolcott's will, it's clear that the paintings  
right now are where they are supposed to be,'' Griesinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office recently ruled the museum  
should return the paintings, but attorneys for the state said 
Thursday it wasn't clear whether the art can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Margaret Hinkle took the case under advisement and ordered  
both sides to return to court next month.

<HEADLINE> Burnitz Returns to Milwaukee Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- All-Star outfielder Jeromy Burnitz returned to  
the Milwaukee Brewers' lineup Friday night after a month on the 
disabled list with a broken bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz was hitting in the cleanup spot as the Brewers opened a  
three-game series against the San Francisco Giants. He went on the 
disabled list July 18 after being hit by a pitch during a game 
against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz is hitting .273 with 26 home runs and 73 RBIs both still  
team bests. He was the National League's player of the month for 
June, when he hit .317 with 12 homers and 31 RBI, and he started in 
his first All-Star game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burnie's our lineup,'' interim manager Jim Lefebvre said.  
``He's like Barry Bonds is to the Giants and Mark McGwire is to the 
Cardinals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who were hovering near .500 when Burnitz went on  
the DL, went 11-19 during his absence and fell out of contention in 
the NL Central. Manager Phil Garner also was fired and GM Sal Bando 
was reassigned during that month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just his presence, I think, is going to help us,'' Lefebvre  
said. ``The toughest thing for him will be patience. Just don't try 
to hit a six-run homer. Just relax and play baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers tried several players in Burnitz's cleanup spot,  
with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder Alex Ochoa, who is hitting .308 with four homers and  
13 RBI since the All-Star break, fared the best. Ochoa moved to the 
fifth spot in the lineup with Burnitz's return. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was hurt, I realized what I take the most pride in is  
playing everyday,'' Burnitz said Friday after batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers briefly fell 10 games below .500 during their recent  
road trip, going 3-4.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The biggest rally against Slobodan  
Milosevic in years -- a display in which 150,000 people called for 
his resignation -- was denounced today by media loyal to the 
Yugoslav president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failed pro-NATO rally,'' ran a headline in the government-run  
Politika daily, tucked away in the paper's midsection -- a sign that 
state-run media were attempting to downplay Thursday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Politika said only 25,000 attended the Belgrade rally.  
</P>
<P>
	``One can't tell who is more disappointed, the organizers, the  
participants or the NATO bosses and mentors,'' the state television 
said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chanting ``Resignation'' and ``Leave Slobo, leave,'' the crowd --  
the largest to attend an anti-Milosevic rally in two years -- roared 
in approval every time the opposition speakers called for his 
removal. A key opposition figure who proposed a compromise with the 
government was jeered by the masses in front of the parliament 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by the Belgraders' response, leaders of the  
pro-democracy movement reiterated their demands for Milosevic's 
unconditional resignation, rejecting any possibility of an early 
vote organized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens of Serbia want the removal of Slobodan Milosevic  
and they do not want compromise or any deal with the government,'' 
said Vladan Batic, one of the leaders of the Alliance for Change. 
</P>
<P>
	Batic said the group will wait until mid-September for Milosevic  
to step down before it organizes another Belgrade rally followed by 
a general strike and daily protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to carry out the will of the people,'' said Zoran  
Djindjic, Belgrade's former mayor. ``The people can no longer be 
tricked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rally, a key test of the opposition's ability to challenge  
Milosevic and a measure of popular support for the pro-democracy 
political leaders, was also an admonition to bickering opposition 
leaders to get their act together. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no time for what they are doing -- quarreling,''  
opposition figure Mladjan Dinkic said today. ``The people will no 
longer wait or tolerate that ... the citizens can no longer be lied 
to and this is truly the last chance for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, Belgrade students staged a mock celebration of  
Milosevic's birthday -- his 58th. The Resistance, as the students' 
group calls itself, said the party would be like any other -- cake, 
a present and good wishes included. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 50 people gathered to watch the performance, including  
former chief of staff of the Yugoslav army, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, 
who recently turned against Milosevic and pledged to work to oust 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The students sang a birthday song calling for Milosevic's quick  
resignation and sliced a huge cardboard cake into nine pieces, all 
representing territories of the former Yugoslavia that Milosevic 
lost in the four wars he fought during his decade in power. 
</P>
<P>
	The plush Dedinje district in Belgrade, where Milosevic's  
well-guarded house is located, was represented in the middle of the 
``cake,'' symbolizing his diminished stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Thursday rally, Djindjic received thundering ovations  
from the crowd when he announced the two-week deadline for 
Milosevic to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Milosevic, look at this square. This is Serbia that doesn't  
want you,'' he declared. ``Look at this square and go, before we 
come to remove you!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This time we'll go all the way. It's either him or us,''  
Djindjic said. ``It is now or never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempting to extend his tenure before he loses all chance for  
re-election, Milosevic 's Socialist party said earlier this week 
that Milosevic could call early elections -- in November instead of 
the scheduled 2001 date. 
</P>
<P>
	Djindjic and other opposition leaders in the Alliance for Change  
reject the idea of early elections while Milosevic is in power. 
Milosevic controls the state-run media and all levers of power in 
the country. The opposition fears Milosevic would rig any election. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuk Draskovic, a bitter Djindjic rival who once led the most  
powerful anti-Milosevic protests in Belgrade but later served as 
his deputy premier, was booed when he proposed early elections as 
the way out of the current political deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive turnout came despite an intense government campaign  
denouncing opposition leaders as ``terrorists'' and NATO 
collaborators. It was the strongest signal yet that Serb discontent 
with Milosevic's rule was bigger than ever in the wake of the 
spring NATO bombing campaign that led to Milosevic agreeing to the 
de-facto loss of Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-Milosevic protests began in Serbia after the NATO air  
campaign left the country badly damaged, impoverished, isolated and 
without control over the southern province of Kosovo. The campaign 
was launched to force Milosevic to accept a peace plan for Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Takes Lead With 49th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa took over the major league home run  
lead from Mark McGwire on Friday, hitting his 48th and 49th homers 
off Colorado's Pedro Astacio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit a solo shot in the third to tie McGwire and then passed  
him with another solo drive in the sixth. He has three homers this 
season off Astacio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa has hit 151 homers since the start of the 1997 season. He  
is the fifth player in major league history to reach 150 homers 
during a three-year span, joining McGwire, Babe Ruth, Ken Griffey 
Jr., and Jimmie Foxx. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa is ahead of his 66-homer pace of a year ago when he fell  
four short of McGwire. He didn't hit his 49th homer last season 
until the 128th game. Friday's game was the Cubs' 120th this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's first homer followed one by Mark Grace, the fifth time  
this season the Cubs have homered back-to-back.

<HEADLINE> Report: Florida Shelters Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Many of Florida's public hurricane shelters would  
be unsafe in a major storm the size of Hurricane Andrew, according 
to inspectors who say many structures aren't sturdy enough or are 
located in flood plains. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Division of Emergency Management surveyed 800 of  
Florida's 3,000 shelters and found 95 percent of the buildings 
could suffer significant damage in a particularly strong hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	For weaker storms -- Category 1 or 2 hurricanes -- most Florida  
shelters are adequate, said Danny Kilcollins, an engineer with the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But after studying damage from more powerful storms -- including  
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, engineers 
learned a lot about what kinds of buildings can withstand winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in a compliant structure, we can't absolutely guarantee  
safety,'' Kilcollins said this week. ``But we've tried to identify 
buildings that clearly have features that perform well during 
hurricanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Florida shelters are older school buildings, made with  
unreinforced masonry. Steel-reinforced block is rare in buildings 
constructed before the 1990s. In southwestern Florida, many 
shelters also are in flood zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The study has been going on for about five years, and Kilcollins  
said it is likely to continue for at least another three years. The 
draft report released to county officials this week covers 21 of 
the state's 67 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Miami area, where many buildings have been rebuilt since  
Hurricane Andrew, 44 of 62 shelters fell below the recommended 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like two days before Halloween, saying someone has a book  
on the Internet on how to poison candy,'' complained Bill Johnson, 
assistant director of the Miami-Dade Office of Emergency 
Management. ``I don't know where anyone is getting the information 
that my schools have failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Loftus, a spokesman for the state Division of Emergency  
Management, said criteria for a safe shelter were set high by 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perfect world, all our shelters would have generators and  
catered dinners,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some shelters didn't meet the criteria because engineering plans  
for the buildings were unavailable to inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Probes Hate Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Two plastic containers of medical waste  
marked with swastikas and references to the Jewish center shootings 
in Los Angeles were found outside two synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
	One container was found Thursday in front of the Congregation  
Beth El in Norwalk, two days after a similar discovery at a temple 
in Stamford, about 15 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in both cities said they believe the incidents are linked  
and have formed task forces with the FBI and U.S. Attorney's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was an attempt to frighten the congregation and to  
frighten Jews generally, not just here,'' said Rabbi Joshua 
Hammerman of Temple Beth El in Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
	Taped to one of the containers was a newspaper picture of Buford  
O. Furrow Jr., a white supremacist charged in last week's shooting 
of five people at a Jewish community center outside Los Angeles. 
The other had Furrow's name written on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow also allegedly shot and killed a Filipino-American postal  
worker. When he surrendered, Furrow reportedly said the shootings 
were meant to be ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no words to describe the evil this represents,''  
Norwalk police Chief Harry Rilling told The Advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamford police said four additional containers of medical waste  
without anti-Semitic symbols have been found since December 1998 at 
two library branches, a school and a shopping center.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Suspected in Gay Arson Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Two brothers suspected of killing a  
gay couple and setting a series of synagogue fires are also under 
suspicion in an abortion clinic blaze, The Sacramento Bee reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence found at the home, storage locker and vehicle belonging  
to Benjamin Williams, 31, and James Matthews, 29, may link them to 
the June 25 clinic fire, the newspaper reported, citing 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire damaged the Country Club Medical Center, but not the  
clinic. The blaze had earlier been examined for links to fires at 
three Sacramento-area synagogues in June that caused $1 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the fires.  
</P>
<P>
	Both men have pleaded innocent in the July 1 slayings of Gary  
Matson, 50, and Winfield Mowder, 40, who were shot at their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also have reportedly linked the brothers to the  
World Church of the Creator, an Illinois-based white supremacist 
group.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cop Killed After Taking Hostages </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	BRYANT, Ark. (AP) -- A former Texas policeman wanted for a  
federal parole violation and suspected in a car-theft ring was shot 
to death after taking two hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect's two sons fled during the shooting and were later  
caught. 
</P>
<P>
	James B. Frye, a former Orange, Texas, policeman, was killed  
Friday after he refused to go along with marshals who tried to 
arrest him on a warrant for charges in Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The marshals had been waiting for Frye, 36, to arrive at a  
storage facility. He did, but when confronted ran into Middleton 
Heat and Air and took two women hostage at knifepoint. Neither was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just kept telling him to get his hands up and he kept  
bringing his hands down,'' said Mike Ackerman, an auto repairman 
who works at a shop nearby. ``I was telling everybody here that he 
looked like he was fixing to run, and he dropped his hands and 
ran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shop's general manager was hit by a ricocheting bullet but  
not seriously hurt. Frye's sons Derrick, 16, and Damon, 15, were 
caught in a wooded area shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Frye had been a parole officer and also worked as a detective  
during seven years with the Orange police department, Chief Sam 
Kittrell said. Orange is a city of 20,000 about 100 miles east of 
Houston. He left the department in October 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Frye served two years in a Texas prison for stealing and  
transporting tractors across state lines, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal 
Brian Murray said. He was wanted in Texas for a parole violation 
and also was wanted in Louisiana for possessing stolen vehicles. 
</P>

Rock.

<HEADLINE> Surplus on Track Despite Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government recorded a budget  
deficit of $25.16 billion in July as money flowing into the 
Treasury slowed following an influx from quarterly income tax 
payments the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government is still on track for posting a big  
surplus this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department said Friday that last month's budget  
deficit of $25.16 billion was slightly higher than the $24.08 
billion deficit reported in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, government outlays totaled $147.07 billion, while  
receipts totaled $121.91 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Government receipts from individual income tax payments in July  
came to $59.98 billion, following $92.99 billion the month before. 
And corporate income tax payments totaled just $3.4 billion, 
compared with $39.26 billion in June. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first 10 months of fiscal 1999, which began Oct. 1,  
1998, the government posted a surplus totaling $69.11 billion, up 
from the $42.98 billion surplus for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased to announce that we are on track to reach the  
largest annual budget surplus ever,'' President Clinton said in a 
statement. ``Thanks to solid fiscal discipline, the surplus at this 
point in the fiscal year is $69.1 billion -- the largest in history 
over a comparable period and more than $20 billion over last year's 
level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in its midyear economic forecast,  
projected that the surplus, which totaled $69.2 billion in 1998, 
will climb to $98.8 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30, and $142.5 billion in 2000. Congressional accountants are 
predicting a surplus of about $120 billion for all of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the government enjoyed its first budget surplus since  
1969. Assuming administration projections for this year come 
through, this will be the first back-to-back surpluses since Dwight 
Eisenhower was president in 1956 and 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	The June surplus of $53.57 billion was not revised by the  
government, the Treasury Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the opportunity to renew his opposition to  
Republican plans for a big tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax bill passed by Congress would reverse the achievement  
of fiscal discipline that has been so critical in making the 
American economy the strongest it has been in generations,'' 
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Navy Denies It Expects Y2K Failures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy on Friday denied reports it expects  
widespread failures in power, water and other utility services in 
the United States because of the Year 2000 computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Navy has not verified that all cities and  
communities near its installations are fully prepared for the Y2K 
problem, its survey of local utilities is showing a steady 
improvement, said Rear Adm. Louis M. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have a problem with utilities,'' Smith,  
commander of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, told 
reporters at a hastily called Pentagon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy also issued a statement saying, ``There are no  
indications of likely widespread failures of water, electricity, 
gas or sewer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is compiling a database to track the probability of Y2K  
problems with electric power, water, natural gas and sewer services 
in communities near Navy and Marine Corps installations. A recent 
version of the report showed that partial failures in electric 
utilities were probable or likely in communities that serve nearly 
60 Navy and Marine Corps installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that reflected a ``worst-case scenario'' in which  
those utilities whose Y2K preparedness was unknown to the Navy were 
assumed to be likely problems. The most recent version of the 
database, dated Aug. 19 and including more complete data, showed 
about 20 likely problem utilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In its own assessment of Y2K readiness, the White House recently  
concluded that national electrical failures are ``highly 
unlikely.'' It also called disruptions in water service 
``increasingly unlikely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the Navy's assessment is ``right in sync'' with the  
White House's. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem may occur because some computer programs,  
especially older ones, might fail when the date changes to 2000. 
Because the programs were written to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year, such programs could read the digits ``00'' as 
1900, potentially causing problems with financial transactions, 
airline schedules and electrical grids. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy had posted its database on the Internet but took it  
down because of what it considered inaccurate and misleading 
reports of what the data means. Rear Adm. Thomas Jurkowsky said the 
database would be put back on the Internet with accompanying text 
explaining the data.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Taylor Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Elizabeth Taylor was hospitalized after  
breaking a bone in her back during a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The actress fell in her Bel Air home on Thursday night and was  
later admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, her publicist said 
in a statement released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of the fall, Miss Taylor sustained a compressive  
fracture of the 12th thoracic vertebra,'' neurosurgeon Dr. Patrick 
Rhoten said in the statement. ``She is in no danger from a 
neurological viewpoint and she is resting comfortably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She will need four to five weeks to recuperate, the statement  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Taylor, 67, has been bothered with health problems in  
recent years, including a broken back last year and lengthy 
recuperation from hip surgeries. She also had brain surgery in 1997 
to remove a benign tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of her back problems have been traced to 1945 when she hurt  
her back falling off a horse during the filming of ``National 
Velvet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress won Academy Awards for her roles in ``Butterfield  
8'' in 1960 and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	She has appeared in few projects in recent years, but has spent  
much time raising money and awareness for AIDS causes and launching 
new perfumes.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged for Scaling Sears Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A French daredevil known as ``Spiderman'' was  
arrested Friday on top of the Sears Tower after climbing the 
110-story building without the aid of suction cups or a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Robert, 37, of Pezenas, France, was met on the roof by  
officers who handcuffed him and charged him with criminal trespass 
and failure to use a safety device while operating an aerial show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I'm very happy because I got on top of the Sears  
Tower,'' Robert said. ``So it was a very big adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 1/2-hour climb created a spectacle on Wacker Drive, a busy  
downtown thoroughfare. Traffic backed up and TV station helicopters 
hovered to show the stunt live on morning news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalk dust helped Robert keep his grip as he worked his way up a  
seam in the building, but condensation in the low-level clouds 
shrouding the top was an unwelcome surprise. His grip faltered, but 
he was able to recover, said Isabel Hardy, Robert's manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, George Andrews, said he hopes the charges will be  
dismissed once the judge considers Robert's courage and the 
``impressiveness of the feat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy said Robert would return to France to be with his wife and  
three children until his Oct. 13 court date. He could face up to a 
year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert works full-time as professional climber, scaling  
buildings as publicity for his sponsor, the French shampoo company 
Norgil. He has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers, including the 
Empire State Building in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sears Tower held the ``world's tallest'' title until 1996  
when the 1,483-foot Petronas Twin Towers skyscraper in Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia, was ruled taller. Robert tried to climb the 
towers in 1997, but building managers said the exterior fittings 
couldn't support the weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert's effort marks the second time the Sears Tower has been  
conquered by a daredevil. 
</P>
<P>
	On Memorial Day 1981, Dan Goodwin, a Las Vegas stuntman who went  
by the name ``Spider Dan,'' climbed the building using three huge 
glass carrier suction cups. He was convicted of disorderly conduct 
and fined $35.
