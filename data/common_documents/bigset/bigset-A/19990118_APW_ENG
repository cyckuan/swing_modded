	Daschle: Witnesses May Be Inevitable  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conceding witnesses ``may be inevitable,''  
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle signaled today that if Senate 
Republicans choose to have live testimony at President Clinton's 
impeachment trial Democrats might object to placing limits on who 
can be summoned. Daschle, D-S.D., said he continues to believe 
witnesses are unnecessary but acknowledged the political momentum 
was moving toward having some witnesses.

	Clinton Marks King Holiday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is spending the Martin  
Luther King holiday doing volunteer work and practicing his State 
of the Union speech. Clinton and Vice President Gore are visiting a 
Washington retirement home, joining volunteers from the AmeriCorps 
program in a service project. The president wants all Americans to 
volunteer in the spirit of the late civil rights leader. Later, 
Clinton will head back to the White House to practice his State of 
the Union speech, which he will deliver tomorrow night.

	Heavy Fighting Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces today resumed attacks  
against ethnic Albanian rebels despite worldwide calls for an end 
to the violence. Serb and ethnic Albanian sources in Kosovo 
reported heavy fighting in the village of Racak, where the bodies 
of 45 ethnic Albanians were found over the weekend. NATO sent its 
two top generals to Belgrade to demand that Yugoslavia's president 
honor last October's cease-fire. Meanwhile, Yugoslav border guards 
refused to allow chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour to 
enter the country to investigate the massacre.

	Eight Die in Tennessee Tornadoes  
</P>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- At least eight people died and scores of  
others were injured when a fierce storm system raced across 
Tennessee, destroying homes, uprooting trees and snapping power 
lines. A tornado touched down last night in Madison County, where 
six people were killed, official said. At least 71 people were 
hospitalized and 11 are in critical condition, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. Mobile homes, cars and trucks have been 
overturned, and power lines are down.

	Pinochet Case Reopens in Britain  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The legal battle over the fate of Augusto Pinochet  
re-opened today, with a second House of Lords panel considering 
whether to clear the way for the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition to Spain to face criminal charges. Gen. Pinochet is 
fighting extradition on a warrant alleging crimes against humanity 
committed by his secret police during his 1973-to-1990 rule. 
Lawyers for Spain and Britain declared that immunity shouldn't 
protect any leader who commits torture.

	Report Targets Flight Hazards  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Federal officials have failed to keep a 1996  
promise to better control hazardous materials shipped by air on 
cargo and passenger planes, The Plain Dealer reported. The Federal 
Aviation Administration has issued fewer and smaller fines for 
violating rules, opting instead for more warning letters, the 
newspaper reported, citing agency records. The FAA said 1,133 
problems were reported in 1997. As of the end of August 1998, there 
were more than 1,600. An FAA spokeswoman said the number of 
reported violations has increased because of there are more staff 
members.

	18th Century Bookcase Bags $8M  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 18th-century combination bookcase-writing desk  
fetched $8.25 million at a Sotheby's sale, one of the highest 
prices ever paid for a piece of American furniture at auction. The 
bookcase, which dates to around 1745, was discovered last year in 
France, where it had been for nearly two centuries. It appears to 
be the most elaborate piece built by the famous Rhode Island 
cabinetmaker Christopher Townsend.

	Cookes May Keep Role With Redskins  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NFL would like the Washington Redskins to  
remain in John Kent Cooke's hand despite a firm deal to sell the 
team to a higher bidder, The Washington Post reported today. ``The 
continuity of this ownership would be a plus for the league,'' said 
Joe Browne, NFL senior vice president for communications and 
government affairs. The trustees of the late Jack Kent Cooke's 
estate have agreed to sell the team to a group headed by Howard 
Milstein for $800 million. However, the deal needs the approval of 
three-fourths of the NFL owners.

<HEADLINE> Antonio McDyess Eyes Suns, Nuggets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Free agent Antonio McDyess won't be  
joining the post-Jordan, post-Pippen Chicago Bulls. Why? He wants 
to play for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' McDyess' agent,  
James Bryant, told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's most at  
home with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a winner, and 
Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time champion Bulls, meanwhile, will trade Scottie  
Pippen to Houston, The Associated Press learned Monday. Also, Steve 
Kerr is headed to San Antonio and Dennis Rodman and Luc Longley are 
also apparently on their way out after Michael Jordan's retirement 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause did not comment Monday. But he said  
after the lockout ended the Bulls had three options -- bring 
everyone back if Jordan didn't retire; sign their own key free 
agents and mix them with those from other teams; or rebuild 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to McDyess, the Bulls also are interested in free  
agent Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've also heard reports on those individuals,'' new Bulls  
coach Tim Floyd said Monday. ``Jerry is going to target key free 
agents in terms of being as competitive as we can this year. If we 
are unable to get those guys, he will remain vigilant in his plans 
to bring it back to the level where it's been. But that could be a 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, one of the best 3-point shooters in the league, will sign  
a five-year, $11 million deal with the Spurs once the lockout is 
over, according to a source close to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The start of training camps and player signings was delayed  
again Monday as lawyers needed more time to work out details in the 
new collective bargaining agreement. Camps were supposed to open 
Tuesday, but now it will be Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	What is certain is this. The Bulls will have only a handful of  
practices before their first scrimmage Friday and not much more 
time before an exhibition game Sunday against the Indiana Pacers, 
who've been working out together for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have to have a roster in my hands to figure who is out  
there and that isn't great,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can envision the days of playing sandlot  
football and drawing plays in the dirt. We could actually be moving 
Gatorade bottles around the sideline for the game Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what will be his first words to his next team? ``Hello,  
let's go practice,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players under contract to the Bulls -- Toni Kukoc, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- former Bulls and now free agents Kerr, Bill 
Wennington and Dickey Simpkins, ex-Bulls Pete Myers and Matt 
Steigenga, draft picks Corey Benjamin and Corey Carr and free 
agents Cornell David and Rob Werdann were among those working at 
the Berto Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While most participated together, running and shooting, Kerr  
went alone to the other end and worked with his personal coach, 
Chip Englund, almost symbolizing his detachment from the team with 
which he won three championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly for Steve. He really likes it here and it's  
really tough for him,'' Wennington said.

<HEADLINE>  Pinochet Case To Reopen in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain is taking precautions to ensure that the  
next decision in the thorny legal battle over the fate of former 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet will withstand any ethical or 
judicial challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Pinochet reopens today, when a second panel of  
judges from the House of Lords considers whether to clear the way 
for the aging general's extradition to Spain to face criminal 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains under police guard in a rented mansion  
west of London, was arrested on a Spanish warrant Oct. 16 alleging 
crimes against humanity during his 1973-1990 regime. 
</P>
<P>
	In one step taken to ensure the decision stands, lawyers for  
both Pinochet and the prosecution have accepted the makeup of the 
new tribunal. Seven law lords have been chosen to sit on the new 
panel -- two more judges than Britain's highest court usually 
assigns to an appeals case. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of law lords voted 3-2 against Pinochet last month. But  
a second appeal is being heard because Lord Justice Hoffmann, one 
of the law lords who made the original ruling, failed to disclose 
his ties with Amnesty International, a key player in the long 
campaign to have the 83-year-old general charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal arguments in this second round are expected to be much  
the same as the first time. Only now, the Chilean government and 
Amnesty International have been given permission by the House of 
Lords to present arguments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the Spanish and British governments plan to argue  
again that international agreements supersede England's 1978 State 
Immunity Law, and that Pinochet's crimes are so horrific they are 
beyond immunity anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers argue that he should be immune from  
prosecution as a former head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	If the law lords rule in Pinochet's favor, the general will be  
free to go home. If the judges rule against Pinochet, he will 
proceed to an extradition hearing before a magistrate's court, 
which will decide whether he will be sent to Spain to face the 
charges there. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is expected to last several days.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, more than 500 protesters, mainly Chileans and many of  
whom had traveled from across Europe, protested outside the Houses 
of Parliament demanding Pinochet's extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after the 
general overthrew elected Marxist President Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was quoted as telling the British Sunday Telegraph  
newspaper, ``I am resigned to my fate even if that means dying 
here. This is part of my sacrifice to the Fatherland.''

<HEADLINE> Gibson, Sawyer Return to Morning TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- How will viewers receive Charlie, back from  
retirement as ``Good Morning America'' host? 
</P>
<P>
	Will morning become Diane?  
</P>
<P>
	Such were the questions facing these SWAT team co-anchors Monday  
morning, their first ``GMA'' appearance since being summoned to 
keep ABC's wakeup show afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	They signed on with all due camaraderie:  
</P>
<P>
	``Hi, I'm Diane Sawyer from Louisville, Ky. -- the new kid on the  
block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm Charles Gibson, originally from Evanston, Ill. I hope  
you remember the old kid on the block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Sawyer isn't really a new kid on this turf: She had  
the same job at CBS in the early 1980s. Now, after rising to 
prime-time stardom, she, like Gibson, is playing the good soldier 
by returning to the morning-show trenches. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's battle plan, such as it is: to recapture the warm, family  
feeling that once vaulted ``GMA'' to the top of the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	One new family member was officially named on Monday's  
broadcast: ABC correspondent and former ``Good Morning 
America/Sunday'' co-host Antonio Mora as news anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to in effect take this program back to the future,''  
said Gibson, who ended an 11-year ``GMA'' stretch last May. He also 
spoke of his surprise at this unexpected assignment: ``A few weeks 
ago, you'd have knocked me over with a feather if you'd told me we 
were going to be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What wasn't unexpected: emergency measures for the failing  
``GMA,'' especially after one recent week when CBS' ``This 
Morning'' slipped past it to claim second place for the only time 
... since Sawyer was an anchor. 
</P>
<P>
	``So how was it, old kid, getting up in the morning?'' Sawyer  
asked Gibson shortly after 7 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	``That alarm clock was a familiar sound this morning,'' he  
replied. ``I didn't actually throw a pillow at it, but I strongly 
considered it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Same at my house,'' Sawyer said. ``I got up all right, but it  
was not pretty, let me tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how long they'll be getting up at 4 a.m. remains unclear  
(especially since Sawyer will continue as a correspondent on the 
newsmagazine ``20/20''). But their stewardship in ``GMA's'' 
make-believe living room is meant to send a message that ABC is 
serious about getting the broadcast back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, it might more aptly have been titled, ``Good  
Morning ... Anybody?'' Its glory days ended in 1995 as NBC's 
``Today'' caught fire and became the apparently unstoppable 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``GMA'' grew increasingly anemic. Longtime co-anchor  
Joan Lunden left in 1997, and replacement Lisa McRee and Gibson 
successor Kevin Newman could do nothing to boost the show's appeal. 
Now those co-anchors have been reassigned to other ABC News duties. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Gibson took a moment to thank the ousted pair.  
``Nobody has been more helpful to us as we begin the transition ... 
than they have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at the end of the broadcast, Sawyer faced Gibson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a comment to you before we go,'' she said, whereupon  
she pretended to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	After much laughter, Gibson gently reminded her: ``We have  
another show tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The United States dollar edged higher against the  
yen today, buoyed by wary optimism about Brazil's financial 
situation. Tokyo stocks posted a slight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.14 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.68  
yen from late Thursday and little changed from its level late 
Friday in New York of 114.13 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 66.20 points,  
or 0.48 percent, closing at 13,805.06. On Thursday, the average 
gained 335.26 points, or 2.50 percent. Financial markets in Japan 
were closed Friday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar moved as high  
as 114.55 yen in intraday trading amid easing concern over 
financial turmoil in Brazil, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But these early gains were eroded as Japanese exporters and  
overseas hedge funds took profits by selling dollars for yen, 
sending the greenback as low as 113.25 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilian situation is still very murky and no one can  
predict its effects on the U.S. economy,'' said Takayuki Togawa, 
manager of the foreign exchange division at Tokai Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were expected to closely watch testimony by U.S. Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress on Wednesday for 
any indication of monetary policy changes or comments on the 
problems in Brazil, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.34 yen in Tokyo, up from  
132.30 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders said investors were  
heartened by a recovery in U.S. and other world stock exchanges on 
Friday following moves by the Brazilian government to stabilize its 
economy, Latin America's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tokyo market welcomed a temporary relief from worries over  
the Brazilian economy,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the 
investor information group at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points  
to 9,340.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets on Wednesday  
when it devalued its currency, the real, by nearly 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's decision Friday to stop spending heavily to  
support the real generated confidence the government was taking 
appropriate measures to nurse the economy back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was estimated  
at 334 million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 409 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 671 to 439, with 166 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.85 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,075.79. The 
TOPIX had climbed 12.86 points, or 1.22 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.725 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.665 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.60 yen from 101.09 yen the previous 
day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Furniture Sets Auction Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A rare 18th century bookcase sold for a record  
$8,250,500 Sunday at a Sotheby's sale, making it the second highest 
price ever paid for a piece of American furniture at an auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookcase, which dates to around 1745, was discovered in  
France last year. It had been there for nearly two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discovery of this piece has forced us to redefine the way  
we look at American furniture,'' said Leslie Keno, senior vice 
president and director of the American Furniture Department at 
Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookcase appears to be the most elaborate piece built by  
famous Newport cabinet maker Christopher Townsend. It is also the 
only known piece of American furniture with solid silver hardware 
on it signed by celebrated silversmith Samuel Casey, Keno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookcase was originally expected to fetch $500,000 to  
$800,000. But when the bidding began, at least five buyers drew the 
price into the millions. The final bid went to an anonymous buyer 
on the telephone.

<P>
	ROCHESTER, Vt. (AP) -- Tom Pierce and Charlie Martin have been  
friends for years, frequently taking to the snow machine trails 
that surround their Green Mountain hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Both inherited small energy companies from their fathers. Tom is  
the fourth generation in a line of Pierces that have run the 
Rochester Electric Light &AMP; Power Co. since 1897. Charlie and his 
brother Steve operate the Central Vermont Oil Co. Inc., which their 
father, a former dairy farmer, bought in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom gets his oil from Charlie and Charlie gets his electricity  
from Tom. Things seemed to be just fine until Charlie got it in his 
head to use some of his oil to make more electricity for Tom. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, their friendship has run into some tough sledding.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me right from the beginning that he didn't like the  
idea and that he was going to fight me on it,'' Martin recalled 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure enough, the dispute over Martin's bid to make electricity  
in his basement and get Pierce to buy it still simmers in front of 
the Public Service Board. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a case that encapsulates in microcosm many of the big  
issues facing Vermont's larger utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Vermont Public Service Corp. and Green Mountain Power  
Corp. share Pierce's complaint that, under federal law, they must 
buy electricity made by small power producers -- for as much as 
twice what they can recoup in rates from customers. 
</P>
<P>
	There's talk now in utility circles that the next century will  
see a boom in ``distributed generation'' -- tiny power plants 
scattered in homes and businesses across the landscape, generating 
power for their own use and for distribution on the power grid. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's idea was to install a new Intelligen Energy Systems  
Inc. combination boiler-generator that would heat his big 
ranch-style house overlooking Route 100 and make power, all by 
burning common No. 2 home heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	When he didn't need the electricity it was making, he would put  
it onto the electric company's tiny, 850-customer power grid. His 
electric meter would spin backwards, reducing his bill -- or even 
earning him a monthly check from the power company. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, two years after Martin invested nearly $8,000 in the  
Intelligen unit, which he first saw at a home heating oil industry 
trade show, it sits idle next to a pingpong table in his basement. 
His legal bills have reached $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far from Martin's hilltop home, Tom and Sandy Pierce and  
Frank Severy operate their tiny power company out of a big 
19th-century farmhouse the Pierces bought from Severy's family in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom and Frank are the line crew, going out in storms to fix  
power outages. Sandy keeps the books and tries to stay ahead of the 
state's demands that the company do more in energy conservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting opposite the hearth around the corner from the big  
country kitchen, Tom has short words for his friend Charlie's 
basement generator: ``It's a high-priced toy,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	While he wants to dismiss it, he also has several concerns about  
it. One is safety. ``A car hit the pole where (Martin) wants to 
hook it in just this year,'' Sandy Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierces ask: What would happen if they were working on a  
line they had disconnected from their own live system while Martin 
was dumping electricity onto it? 
</P>
<P>
	Another complaint is economic. Martin's power couldn't be  
depended on all the time, so the Pierces would have to sign up for 
power from elsewhere while taking Martin's when he could provide 
it. Often, that would be late on winter nights, when demand at the 
Martin house for heat was high but the lights of Rochester would be 
shut off -- making Martin's electricity an unneeded expense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have energy going to waste in the middle of the night --  
that's the problem,'' Sandy Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Martin expresses surprise at Pierce's reaction.  
His 5-kilowatt generator would be a tiny blip in Pierce's 1.5 
megawatt system -- a third of 1 percent. He denies Pierce's 
assertion that he planned to sell Intelligen units around Rochester 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate before the Public Service Board is complicated by the  
fact that Vermont doesn't have a law that seems to fit Martin's 
proposal exactly. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and his lawyer, Alan George of Rutland, have asked that  
the board put Martin's generator through the same sort of review 
that big utilities would get if they wanted to build a coal-fired 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, the Legislature passed a law allowing small  
generators to do exactly the type of ``net metering'' Martin has 
proposed. But the law applied only to wind, solar and other 
environmentally correct systems, nothing so retrograde as a 
generator running on No. 2 heating oil, a form of diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierces say they have other customers who make their own  
power, but for their own use. ``We just wish he'd use the energy 
in-house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin says one state official said if he pushed the matter, the  
state could force Pierce to take power from him. But he's not keen 
on bringing down the force of law. ``That kind of turns me off. 
Tom's a good friend,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Heavy Fighting Reported in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb police today swept through  
hills surrounding an ethnic Albanian village where dozens were 
massacred, ignoring threats by NATO demanding an end to the 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb and ethnic Albanian sources in Kosovo reported heavy  
fighting this morning near the village of Racak, where bodies of 45 
ethnic Albanians were found over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Though people in the area said the fighting had died down by  
midday, the clashes near Racak raised fears that the fragile 
U.S.-brokered cease-fire was near collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO met Sunday to demand that Serb-led government forces stop  
their assault against ethnic Albanian rebels and that Yugoslavia 
allow the U.N. war crimes tribunal to investigate the killings in 
Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's commander for Europe, and Gen.  
Klaus Naumann are due to arrive today in Belgrade to warn Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to honor a cease-fire agreed to in 
October under threat of NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's Secretary-General Javier Solana on Sunday condemned the  
massacre in the village of Racak, and said Milosevic is 
``personally responsible for the behavior of his security forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb police announced early today they would move into the Racak  
area to conduct a ``search'' for Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas, 
said Col. Mike Philips, an assistant to U.S. diplomat William 
Walker, who heads an international force verifying the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A police ``search'' for KLA fighters usually means a sweep of  
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting also was reported Sunday in Racak, when Serb forensic  
experts tried to enter the village with police escort, despite 
international monitors warning it would provoke clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutilated bodies were found Saturday in a gully outside Racak,  
15 miles south of the provincial capital, Pristina. Serb officials 
said the victims were KLA guerrillas killed in combat, although 
they included three women and a 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana made no specific threats and set no deadlines Sunday  
while speaking for the 16 NATO ambassadors who make up the 
policy-making North Atlantic Council. He noted, however, that an 
``activation order'' -- which put more than 400 allied aircraft on 
alert for possible strikes against Yugoslavia -- remained in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO threatened airstrikes last year to pressure Milosevic to  
call off his offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for 
independence for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic, 
Serbia. Ethnic Albanians form about 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 
million people, and many want independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Following intensive negotiations with U.S. envoy Richard  
Holbrooke, Milosevic agreed Oct. 12 to halt the seven-month 
offensive and begin talks with the ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, however, have rejected U.S. proposals for expanded  
self-rule for Kosovo. With diplomacy at a stalemate, prospects of a 
full-scale resumption of fighting have increased. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's emergency meeting at NATO headquarters in  
Brussels, Belgium, ambassadors agreed to send Clark and Naumann to 
the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, to meet Milosevic today or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
condemned Sunday's violence in Racak, also calling Serb moves ``a 
provocation.'' He said any massacre investigation should be done by 
an international war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunal, Louise  
Arbour, planned to leave for Kosovo today to investigate the 
massacre -- whether or not Yugoslav authorities granted permission. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the bodies of 40 victims were brought to the village  
mosque in Racak, where mourners laid them out under plastic sheets. 
Relatives sobbed and wailed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting broke out before the bodies could be buried.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know when we'll have the funerals,'' said 16-year-old  
Vjollsa Jakupi, who fled with her family as shooting broke out 
anew. ``We want to, but we're too afraid.''

<HEADLINE> `Varsity Blues' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Varsity Blues,'' starring James Van Der  
Beek as a high school football star coming of age in a Texas town, 
rumbled past ``A Civil Action'' into the No. 1 box office spot over 
the weekend, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Varsity Blues,'' a collaboration between Paramount and MTV,  
debuted at No. 1 with $14.3 million. It was the strongest opener 
ever during a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, moving ahead 
of the previous record of $14 million held by 1994's ``Legends of 
the Fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie appeals to the young male audience,'' said Wayne  
Lewellen, president of distribution at Paramount. ``There really 
hasn't been a lot of product out for that audience. They were pent 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action,'' about a real-life legal battle against  
tainted drinking water, dropped to second place with $10.9 million 
after taking the top spot last weekend in its expanded release, 
estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend of wide release, the World War II epic  
``The Thin Red Line'' jumped to a respectable No. 3 with $10.5 
million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Williams' heartwarmer ``Patch Adams'' fell to the No. 4  
spot with $10.2 million in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	``At First Sight'' opened in the No. 5 spot this weekend with  
$7.7 million in ticket sales. Val Kilmer stars in this story of a 
blind masseur who falls in love with Mira Sorvino and regains his 
vision -- but stumbles when thrown into the world of sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping again this weekend were ``Stepmom'' to sixth place with  
$6.3 million; ``You've Got Mail'' at seventh with $5.9 million; and 
``The Prince of Egypt'' in a tie for eighth place with $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virus,'' the science-fiction adventure starring Jamie Lee  
Curtis and William Baldwin, also took eighth place in its opening 
weekend, selling $5 million in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another movie opening this weekend, the thriller ``In Dreams,''  
starring Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. tied with 
``Shakespeare in Love'' for the No. 10 spot with $4 million in 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Varsity Blues,'' $14.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``A Civil Action,'' $10.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Thin Red Line,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Patch Adams,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``At First Sight,'' $7.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stepmom,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``You've Got Mail,'' $5.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Virus,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4 million.

	MONTREAL (AP) -- Part of the snow-covered roof of Olympic Stadium  
caved in Monday, injuring one person. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 workers were setting up an auto show in the stadium at  
the time of the cave-in, which sent water and snow cascading over 
several display booths. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium, home to the Montreal Expos baseball team, has been

<P>
	ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Brian Tobin cut short his first  
term as Newfoundland premier Monday, calling an election for Feb. 
9. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobin said he needed a renewed mandate after just three years to  
continue brokering two major deals on the province's natural 
resources: a hydroelectric pact with Quebec to develop the Lower 
Churchill Falls and ongoing negotiations with Inco over development 
of the Voisey's Bay nickel play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whomever the people of the province select to complete these  
negotiations must be able to do so from a position of confidence 
and a position of strength,'' said Tobin, flanked by his caucus and 
cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics suggest Tobin is only hoping to squeeze in a second term  
before making a bid to seize the federal Liberal leadership. 
Heading for a second term now would certainly help clear a path to 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien's job whenever it becomes vacant.

 *British Columbia To Appeal Ruling Quashing Child Porn Law    	
</P>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The provincial government  
said Monday it will appeal a judge's controversial ruling that 
possession of child pornography should not be a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision that angered many Canadians, Justice Duncan Shaw  
of British Columbia's Supreme Court ruled Friday that the federal 
law against possessing child pornography violated the 
freedom-of-expression clause of Canada's Charter of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	British Columbia's attorney general, Ujjal Dosanjh, said Monday  
the province believed the law was valid and would seek expedited 
hearings in a bid to overturn Shaw's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved John Sharpe, 65, of Vancouver, who was charged  
with possessing child pornography after police raided his home in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said there was no proof that possessing child pornography  
made people more inclined to sexually molest children. 
</P>
<P>
	His ruling, which is binding in British Columbia but not other  
provinces, upheld the existing laws against producing and 
distributing child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association said it agreed  
with Shaw that the law governing child pornography was too broad 
and needed to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	But John Westwood, executive director of the association, said  
the changes should focus on whether real children are used in the 
pornography. Possession of writings and drawings involving 
fictional children should be legal, while possession of pornography 
involving real children should be illegal, Westwood said.

Department.

expressed its support of Canada's measures to prevent U.S. 
magazines from overwhelming domestic publications. Buoyed by that 
vote of confidence, Heritage officials are looking for more moral 
support abroad.

the United States over Canadian legislation that would make it 
illegal for foreign publishers to run advertising directed at the 
Canadian market.

targeting such areas as textiles, forest products and steel if Bill

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lawmakers Join Lobbying Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Rep. Vic Fazio will continue to track  
legislation. He will still meet with friends on Capitol Hill. He 
will still be able to walk onto the House floor or enter the 
cloakroom, both off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fazio will be doing all these things on behalf of corporate  
clients rather than his former constituents in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Fazio, a former member of the House Democratic leadership, is  
among several recently retired lawmakers who have gone straight 
from the Capitol to the influence business, as lobbyists or 
corporate advisers. Others include former Sens. Dan Coats, R-Ind.; 
Wendell Ford, D-Ky.; and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; and former Reps. 
Scott Klug, R-Wis.; Bill Paxon, R-N.Y.; and David Skaggs, D-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have that most precious commodity -- instant access,''  
said Rogan Kersh, a Syracuse University political science 
professor. ``They don't have to spend a lot of time building 
relationships on the Hill. They have longstanding relationships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though legally prohibited from formally lobbying Congress for a  
year, the ex-lawmakers bring high value to their clients. They can 
lobby the White House and federal agencies immediately. They can 
guide their clients through the congressional maze that all 
legislation must pass. And they can tell their clients what is 
going on in Congress, and about issues on the horizon they need to 
be concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're valued for is our ability to help people strategize  
on what they ought to do,'' said Fazio, one of two partners running 
the Washington office of Clark &AMP; Weinstock. The other is former 
Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who began the D.C. operation after he 
retired in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a continuation of what I've been doing to a large  
degree. Instead of doing it for constituents, I'm now doing it for 
people who want to retain my services,'' Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	These lawmakers are following the well-worn path of their  
predecessors, entering the lobbying business where they can trade 
on their legislative contacts and knowledge of the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The nameplates on the doors of the capital's top firms are  
filled with ex-lawmakers. Former Senate Majority Leader Howard 
Baker, R-Tenn., heads a company whose clients include American 
Airlines, Federal Express and RJR Nabisco. Former Rep. Robert 
Walker, R-Pa., is president of the Wexler Group, whose clients 
include Anheuser-Busch, Burger King and Visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxon joined one of Washington's top law and lobbying firms --  
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld -- which represents such blue-chip 
clients as Johnson &AMP; Johnson, the National Basketball Association, 
and Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
	``This firm represents some of the strongest and most enduring  
corporations in America,'' Paxon said. ``One of the things we can 
do is provide them counsel on how the system works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., set up his own company, and  
is sharing clients, employees and space with former Sen. Paul 
Laxalt, R-Nev., whose successful lobbying firm's clients include 
Lockheed Martin and the Nevada Resort Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any of these people coming into a firm bring Rolodexes,'' said  
Bill Hogan, director of investigative projects for the Center for 
Public Integrity, a watchdog group. ``With ex-members, they have a 
lot of people left on the Hill whose livelihoods they're 
responsible for. They brought them to Washington, they employed 
them, and those people owe them something.''

	``I never said they were obligated to do it. We pay them for it,  
this is a business. This isn't a question of obligation,'' Giuliani 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were a retreat from controversial statements last  
week, when he said since out-of-towners benefit from spending time 
in New York, there is a ``reciprocal relationship'' under which 
their home states should accept New York trash. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks inflamed lawmakers in states like Virginia, where  
New York ships thousands of tons of waste for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
	A top aide said the mayor was not shifting his position.  
Cristyne Lategano, Giuliani's communications director, said the 
mayor's earlier statements had been misconstrued in the media and 
by Virginia politicians, and she emphasized Giuliani never used the 
word ``obligation'' in characterizing New York's relationship with 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say, `You should take it,''' the mayor said Monday.  
``I said, `If you want to do business with us, we're willing to do 
business with you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said he wanted to curb the  
dumping of out-of-state trash in Virginia, and ban barges from 
moving trash on state waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reacting to word that Waste Management Inc., a  
trash-disposal company, wants to dump an additional 4,000 tons of 
New York City trash in Virginia every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already ships out 2,400 tons of New York City trash  
daily.

<HEADLINE> Senate Flooded With Mail on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The letter begins with praise from a supporter  
of Republican Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island. What a fine 
governor he used to be! His record in the Senate -- ``splendid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far so good.  
</P>
<P>
	``Please be advised, however, that in the event that you should  
cast a vote in favor of removing William Jefferson Clinton ... I 
shall devote every breath in my body and every nickel in my pocket 
to the noble cause of ensuring your defeat the next time you run 
for re-election. Have a nice Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate mailbags are bulging with everything except tepid  
indecision. The debate over President Clinton's fate may be 
engaging the nation only fitfully, but in the mail to senators it 
beats with a hearty pulse. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-described elderly Episcopalian woman from Port Angeles,  
Wash., writes crisply that Clinton has done a good job in office 
and should only be censured -- ``with a firm smack on those hands 
that fondled that filthy (expletive).'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there is this Dear Senator letter: ``You, sir, are in  
the position to begin to repair the long-term damage to our way of 
life that the Clinton Presidency has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They are coming in by the thousands, by regular mail, electronic  
mail and fax. True to the Senate's way of doing things -- a 
dignified step behind the times -- even the e-mail tends to get 
answered by old-fashioned paper, just as phone calls are usually 
answered by human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters make liberal use of that fine democratic flourish,  
the exclamation mark. Whole words come capitalized or underlined. 
</P>
<P>
	They are brief and biting, appealing for an end to this  
``gruesome episode.'' Or, heartfelt musings on morality: ``It is 
true most people have made youthful indiscretions, but most of us 
have mended our ways by the time we became responsible adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They even offer advice on strategy: ``Why do you let Senator  
Byrd stand in front of the cameras and look like the only statesman 
in all of the Senate, when in reality he is OBVIOUSLY trying to 
pull Bill Clinton's fat out of the fire?'' Sen. Robert Byrd, 
D-W.Va., is widely recognized by his colleagues as keeper of the 
Senate's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Democratic Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, a noted  
trial lawyer, is hearing from fellow attorneys who are parsing the 
legal implications of it all. ``Regular people kind of distill it 
to more basic things,'' said Josh Stein, chief of staff. ``Either, 
'We elected this man, this is a witch hunt,' or 'This man did 
something immoral''' and begone with him. 
</P>
<P>
	In many offices the flow rivals that seen before the Persian  
Gulf War or when groups have organized mass mailings for abortion 
votes -- war and abortion being sure-fire magnets for a Dear Senator 
missive. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe may not have heard so much  
on any issue since she battled federal lobster restrictions, 
spokesman Dave Lackey said. Some 200 faxes alone await the staff 
each morning; more than 10,000 letters, e-mails and phone calls 
have come in since August. 
</P>
<P>
	In the office of Democratic Sen. John D. Rockefeller of West  
Virginia, aides find that when things are going sour for Clinton, 
the mail turns a bit in his favor. When he bounds back, more 
critics emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	That rings true for other senators, too. ``In the same way that  
ire drives mail, so does sympathy,'' said Chafee aide Nicholas 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators in both parties report a rough 50-50 split for and  
against Clinton's removal, making the mail more hostile to the 
president than the nation overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Few aides would allow a peek into the mail. But Republican  
moderates Chafee and Gorton offered a cross-section with names 
blocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators naturally concentrate on mail from their states and  
make sure it all gets answered. On this issue, however, some 
senators say they are avoiding the mail count until the trial ends. 
</P>
<P>
	While people now can send the same e-mail to all 100 senators  
with a few clicks on a computer, that sort of correspondence 
doesn't land with much impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chafee's office, the stack of constituent mail that is  
solidly pro-Clinton is 2 inches thick. Same as the anti-Clinton 
mail. Mail wanting him censured but not removed, or something like 
that, is an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
	``And here is our open-minded pile,'' said an aide, showing off  
the thinnest pickings of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, a few write merely to ask senators to do their best.  
</P>
<P>
	But even these letters can be tough. A constituent tells Sen.  
Slade Gorton, R-Wash.: ``A vote based on anything but your honest 
belief in his guilt or innocence would be a travesty and, assuming 
you have a conscience, would haunt you the rest of your life.''

<HEADLINE> La Salle Films Fla. 'ER' Episode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLERMONT, Fla. (AP) -- Central Florida got a little taste of  
Hollywood when ``ER'' rolled into town to shoot an episode 
featuring Eriq La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty exciting, bringing some of the big productions out  
to our little lakes,'' Scott Hunnel, who watched the filming with 
his wife from their boat, said Monday. ``It's nice to be able to go 
out and see a movie like this ... and be able to point out there's 
our hometown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the episode, La Salle's character, Dr. Peter Benton, spends  
his vacation working in a rural area of Mississippi to raise money 
for medical care for his deaf son. 
</P>
<P>
	La Salle said the show highlights a real problem facing rural  
communities around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have these rural towns that have no health care and we're  
in no rush to fix it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode is scheduled to air Feb. 25.

	Yugoslavia Boots U.S. Peace Verifier  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia today ordered an American  
peace verifier out of the country and refused to let a U.N. war 
crimes prosecutor in while Serb forces pounded the hills outside a 
village where ethnic Albanians were massacred. The Yugoslav federal 
government said William Walker had ``flagrantly'' violated his 
mandate to oversee compliance with the Oct. 12 Kosovo peace accord. 
Walker has been vocal in his criticism of Yugoslav officials since 
last week's massacre of 45 ethnic Albanian civilians. Meanwhile, 
Serb security forces backed by tanks and artillery unleashed a 
barrage on the hills surrounding Racak, ignoring NATO demands for 
an end to the onslaught.

	Clinton Marks King Holiday  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.,  
President Clinton today announced the government reached a $6.5 
billion discrimination settlement with a mortgage company simply by 
enforcing a fair housing law passed just six days after King's 
death. ``Many who voted for the measure said they did it in tribute 
to him,'' Clinton said. Clinton said he Department of Housing and 
Urban Development and Columbia National Mortgage Co., had settled a 
housing discrimination case worth $6.5 billion in loans and 
homeownership programs.

	Daschle: Witnesses May Be Inevitable  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle conceded  
today that there most likely will be witnesses at President 
Clinton's Senate trial despite his party's opposition. Daschle, 
D-S.D., insisted that witnesses aren't necessary, but signaled that 
if Senate Republicans choose to have live testimony, then Democrats 
might object to placing limits on who can be summoned. A decision 
on whether witnesses will be allowed would come after the White 
House wraps up its opening presentations later this week. The trial 
resumes tomorrow with the start of Clinton's defense.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's governors today said the state of  
their states is great, especially in comparison with the ugly state 
of affairs in Washington. Just as President Clinton will do 
tomorrow, governors are taking credit for more jobs, fewer crimes 
and less unemployment than this time last year. And the governors, 
like Clinton, are unveiling plans to create better schools, improve 
health care and fight crime. But operatives in both parties say the 
governors are simply telling voters what they want to hear.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's struggle to steady its  
shaky currency has prompted Argentina to consider abandoning its 
own money and adopting a dollar-based economy. And President Carlos 
Menem has suggested that the entire Latin American region might 
consider doing likewise. Menem has called on his own economic team 
to study ways to replace Argentina's peso with the dollar in an 
attempt to protect the economy from future financial turmoil.

<HEADLINE> High-Scoring Bure Likes Fla. Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- He has lost a half-season waiting for  
Vancouver to trade him. Still, Pavel Bure has no regrets about the 
holdout that encouraged the Canucks to send him to the Florida 
Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an important thing in my life,'' the high-scoring  
``Russian Rocket'' said Monday from his home in Moscow. ``I put the 
goal in front of myself and I was always trying to reach that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you have to make sacrifices, but you have to go all  
the way and never change your mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure's perseverance paid off Sunday when the Canucks shipped him  
to Florida as part of a seven-player deal, giving the Panthers 
their first true offensive star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a young team,'' Bure said. ``I hope we can do  
something good for the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Bure is a three-time 50-goal scorer and  
four-time all-star who has averaged slightly better than a point 
per game over his seven NHL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But a history of confrontations with former general manager Pat  
Quinn apparently soured Bure on the Canucks, leading him to demand 
a trade last summer and vow he would not return to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Bure threatened to sit out the Stanley Cup finals if  
the team didn't move to finalize a five-year contract that had been 
negotiated. When that was done, he said management didn't back him 
strongly enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he made similar complaints after major knee  
surgery and back spasms limited him to just 23 goals in 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure would not discuss his relationship with the Canucks when  
asked Monday. But he disputed a statement by Canucks president 
Brian Burke that he had wearied of living in a fishbowl atmosphere 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so funny. I never said that,'' Bure said. ``People were  
really nice to me there. I have a lot of friends there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Russia, Bure has been working out twice a day  
with CSKA Moscow, the former Red Army team where he spent his first 
four years as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the workouts have left him in good shape, but not  
playing in games became a grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really frustrating for me,'' he said. ``I was missing  
hockey a lot and was missing the fans. It's really hard -- day after 
day going to practice and no games, not knowing when I'd start to 
play. I'm really happy it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure was scheduled to fly Tuesday to New York, where he would  
join the Panthers for games Wednesday against the Islanders and 
Thursday against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unsure about playing Wednesday, saying he wanted to meet  
with Panthers officials before reaching a decision. General manager 
Bryan Murray was guardedly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to play this guy if he's flown 12 hours and  
says he's not ready to play,'' Murray said. ``But we're going to 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure's new teammates greeted the news with enthusiasm. No  
Panther has scored more than 32 goals in a season during the team's 
six years, and Florida's 103 goals this year ranks 18th in the 
27-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a go-to guy now,'' said Ray Whitney, whose 14 goals  
leads the team. ``None of us has to pretend to be a go-go-guy. Now 
we can go to the `Rocket.' This helps all of the guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Niedermayer called Bure's acquisition ``a dream come true.''  
</P>
<P>
	``To get a chance to play with a guy like that -- any centerman  
in the league would relish that,'' Niedermayer said. ``It certainly 
gets me excited.''

<HEADLINE> States Push Fund for Tobacco Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Six tobacco-state governors are united in  
demands for a $5 billion cigarette-industry financed trust fund for 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In advance of negotiations this week with the companies, the  
governors issued a joint statement Monday that says a trust fund is 
``the only viable course of action to ensure the protection of our 
farmers and their future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With demand for tobacco down sharply in U.S. markets and a  
growing public health attack on smoking, the governors are anxious 
about the prospects for farmers who long have depended on a tobacco 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge the companies to do the right thing by establishing  
this $5.15 billion trust fund to compensate them for part of their 
losses,'' said the statement by Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, 
Paul Patton of Kentucky, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Jim Hodges of 
South Carolina, Roy Barnes of Georgia and Don Sundquist of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors, attorneys general and agriculture commissioners  
of tobacco states are scheduled to meet with cigarette company 
officials Wednesday in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations grow out of the $206 billion agreement by  
tobacco companies to settle state lawsuits seeking reimbursement 
for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. That settlement 
also required the companies to meet with political leaders of 
tobacco states to talk about the concerns of the growers, who were 
not included in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The first meeting was held a month ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris, the industry leader, already has said it will  
contribute $300 million to the trust fund this year. But the 
company also said future payments would depend on what is done by 
the other tobacco companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and 
Lorillard. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds initially opposed creation of a trust fund, saying a  
better way to help farmers was to promise to buy more 
American-grown tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that  
cigarette makers plan to purchase 291 million pounds of burley 
tobacco in 1999, a 31 percent drop from a year ago. And flue-cured 
tobacco quotas are down about 30 percent from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors urged the companies to buy more tobacco, but  
acknowledged guaranteed purchases have serious legal obstacles, 
such as raising antitrust questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dramatic reduction in the intent to purchase tobacco for  
the 1999 crop requires immediate and substantial action to avert 
financial disaster as the 1999 crop comes to market next year,'' 
the statement from the governors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national tobacco settlement has already produced huge  
increases in the price of cigarettes and is expected to further 
depress demand for farmers to continue their production. 
</P>
<P>
	But state and farm leaders acknowledge they don't have the same  
legal leverage to get concessions for farmers that states 
negotiated with the industry in seeking reimbursement for Medicaid 
and other health costs.

<HEADLINE> Congressional Critic Forges Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of Russia's fiercest congressional critics  
doubles as a friend of the former Soviet republic, laboring quietly 
behind the scenes to foster better relationships between the House 
and its counterpart in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, whose interest in Russia started in high  
school, has traveled there 17 times. For the most part, the 
Pennsylvania Republican has been known for criticism, not sympathy, 
for the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the House Armed Services research and development  
subcommittee, he has frequently criticized Russian military secrecy 
and called for increased spending on missile defense systems 
designed to protect U.S. cities against nuclear launches from 
Russia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	But away from the television cameras and the heat of debate,  
Weldon plays the role of friend as well as critic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russians respect strength, consistency and candor,'' he said  
in a recent interview. ``I'm tough on proliferation and call them 
when they are (wrong), but they also understand and know I want 
Russia to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional task force that Weldon co-chairs with Rep. Steny  
Hoyer, D-Md., made a second visit to Russia last month as part of 
his mission to improve ties with members of the Duma, the lower 
house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	That role grew out of Weldon's desire to supplement talks  
between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
Weldon said he wants Russia to have a working multi-branch 
government like that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to strengthen the institution of the Duma for Russia  
to succeed,'' he said. ``They need to have a strong parliament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herman Pirchner Jr. of the private American Foreign Policy  
Council, which monitors the former Soviet republics, said Weldon 
``puts himself in a rather unique position, in that somehow he can 
speak very bluntly about those things where there are differences, 
yet he's accepted because he's accepted as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It helps that Weldon speaks Russian, though not fluently. He has  
also distributed more than 1,000 business cards with his name, 
title and House office printed in Russian on one side, which Weldon 
said signals his willingness to meet Russians halfway. 
</P>
<P>
	During the December trip to Russia, the congressional group met  
with leaders of Russia's key political parties, including the 
Duma's speaker, Gennady Seleznyov. The group also met with Russian 
administration officials, but not with Yeltsin directly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian legislators have come to Washington twice and plan a  
third visit this spring. Weldon's chief of staff, Doug Ritter, is 
separately organizing workshops to train the Duma's staff on 
parliamentary procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Between formal trips, legislators communicate by e-mail,  
telephone and letter. Some also make informal visits to the other 
country's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, with the Cold War still on, Weldon brought  
low-level Soviet political leaders to his ``very conservative, very 
Republican'' suburban Philadelphia district as part of an exchange 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	He said judges leaving the county courthouse were shocked to  
find Soviet flags flying in honor of the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Weldon's group has been trying to help Russia develop a  
middle class by making low-interest mortgages available. To do so, 
such concepts as land ownership need to be written into law, Weldon 
said. U.S. approval is still needed to set up a joint commission to 
oversee the financing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Spring, senior defense analyst with the conservative  
Heritage Foundation, said that while formal diplomacy can only be 
conducted by senior officials, the legislative contacts do help 
each side gain understanding of the other. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the countries may disagree from time to time, Spring  
said, individuals can still get along. Weldon and his colleagues 
are on a first-name basis with their Duma counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it might not be appreciated at the time, the best  
friends are people who are frank and honest,'' Spring said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weldon, 51, said he decided to study Russian in high school  
because he grew up at a time of frequent drills simulating a 
nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up wondering, `Are these people that bad, or is it we  
don't understand who they are?''' he said.

</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Shlomo Baum, a founder of a feared Israeli

	LONDON (AP) -- Betty Evelyn Box, one of the most successful  
producers of British films in the post-World War II era, died 
Friday, according to news reports in London. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Box produced such hits as ``Doctor in the House,''  
``Miranda,'' ``Conspiracy of Hearts,'' and the Huggett family 
films. Most of her films were directed by Ralph Thomas, with whom 
she had a successful partnership for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Box was part of a film dynasty. Her older brother Sydney Box  
and his wife, Muriel, were a noted screenwriter-director-producer 
team. In 1949, Betty Box married one of her brother's writers, 
Peter Rogers, who went on to be a producer in his own right.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Optimistic About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Highly dependent on foreign capital,  
Singapore's economy should lure an acceptable amount of overseas 
investment this year despite the lingering economic crisis and 
sobering figures for last year, a government official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investment climate in 1999 will continue to be  
challenging,'' said Economic Development Board chairman Philip Yeo 
in a statement. ``But I am confident that EDB will be able to 
attract investment commitments comparable to what we have achieved 
in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government is ``cautiously optimistic about the overall  
outlook for the manufacturing and service sectors in 1999,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in five years, foreign investment commitments  
in the country's key economic engine -- manufacturing -- shrank in 
1998, said the board, a division of the Ministry of Trade and 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid a worsening regional economic crisis and the city-state's  
first recession in 13 years, new foreign manufacturing investment 
dropped 8.1 percent to 7.8 billion Singapore dollars ($4.7 billion) 
last year, compared to the record-high 8.5 billion Singapore 
dollars ($5.1 billion) in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining investment in Singapore's electronics sector, arguably  
the single most important industry in this small economy, was the 
main culprit, plunging 20 percent to 3.1 billion Singapore dollars 
($1.8 billion) because of a global slump and the regional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But the island state's manufacturing base as a whole did ``OK''  
in 1998, considering the economic disruptions last year, argued 
Yeo. The investment data ``are very respectable numbers compared to 
everyone around,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeo conceded that one notable failure was Singapore's inability  
to lure more new money into the electronics sector.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- From the pulpit where Martin Luther King Jr. once  
preached, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Monday gave 
thanks to King and all American civil rights leaders he credited 
with paving the way for the end of apartheid in his country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We drew enormous courage from your history. That you emerged  
from the furnace of affliction, the furnace of injustice, the 
furnace of oppression of slavery, emerged as strong as you have 
been,'' he told a packed Ebenezer Baptist Church. ``You helped us, 
10,000 miles away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People across the country celebrated Martin Luther King Day on  
Monday with speeches, sermons and volunteerism. Last Friday would 
have been King's 70th birthday. He died April 4, 1968, from an 
assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	Tutu, who teaches at Atlanta's Emory University, observed that  
America still needs to heal a racial split dividing the country 
because of lingering wounds from slavery and the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``God has a dream like Martin Luther King Jr.,'' said Tutu.  
``That this community, the wonderful people in this land, will come 
to realize to say, `Hey we are really members of one family.' ... 
Then, just maybe, this great country will be able to say truly, 
`Free at last, thank God almighty we're free at last.''' 
</P>
<P>
	During the service, King's widow, Coretta Scott King, presented  
the 1999 Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize to John 
Hume, who last year shared the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to 
bring peace to Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believed in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King,'' Hume  
said. ``We believed that true unity among all Irish people was 
unity of the heart, not unity of the soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, President Clinton marked the day by visiting a  
retirement home in Washington as part of an Americorps service 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges, newly sworn in as the  
state's first Democratic governor in 12 years, said at a breakfast 
honoring King that he wants to make King Day a permanent state 
holiday. It is currently an optional day off for state workers and 
state offices are not closed. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire is the only state that does not recognize the  
holiday, although legislation is pending to change the state's 
Civil Rights Day to a holiday specifically recognizing King. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wallingford, Conn., St. Paul's Episcopal Church was crammed  
with 500 people who arrived to sing King's praises. Until this 
year, the town was the only Connecticut municipality that failed to 
recognize the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, more than 500 people attended a breakfast in King's  
honor in Annapolis, where attendees were urged to rededicate 
themselves to carry on King's work. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta, Ebenezer churchgoers were reminded that  
discrimination persists, although perhaps not in the ways of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discrimination with a smile is when a banker looks at you and  
says, `I'm sorry you don't qualify for the loan,'' said Andrew 
Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ``Discrimination 
with a smile is when the employment officer says, `You don't 
qualify for this job,' but really he is only looking at the color 
of your skin.''

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Crowds gathered today at two churches where the  
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached to hear him hailed as a man 
who ``paid the ultimate price'' so that others could be free. 
</P>
<P>
	No other man in modern times has done more to lift the dignity  
of the common man, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop told a packed Ebenezer 
Baptist Church today during the Atlanta service marking the King 
Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He demonstrated that nonviolence is a way to effect change,''  
Bishop said, speaking from the same pulpit where King once 
preached. ``He lived under constant threat of harassment ... and he 
paid the ultimate price -- death -- so that we may have life and have 
it more abundantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, Ala., Gov.-elect Don Siegelman attended a service  
in the church where King preached during the period of the 1955 bus 
boycott that was a landmark in the history of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in this small sanctuary, what happened in these  
streets outside, changed this nation,'' Siegelman said at the 
Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church. He said that in the 
boycott, which began after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to 
give up her bus seat to a white man, ``a spark ignited that changed 
this nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national holiday honors King and his teachings of  
nonviolence and social justice. Last Friday would have been King's 
70th birthday; he was assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton was marking the day by visiting  
with senior citizens at a local retirement home as part of an 
Americorps service project. The visit was part of a national focus 
on service in the spirit of the King. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbia, S.C., today, Gov. Jim Hodges said he wants to make  
King Day a permanent state holiday. In 1978 the South Carolina 
Legislature recognized the holiday but it's an optional day off for 
state workers and state offices aren't closed. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire is the only state that doesn't recognize the  
holiday, although legislation is pending to change New Hampshire's 
Civil Rights Day to a holiday specifically recognizing King.

<P>
	Hodges, newly sworn in as the first Democratic governor in 12  
years, said he would push to make Martin Luther King Day an 
official state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you support of my administration to try to bring  
that dream into reality,'' said Hodges, who won election in 
November with strong black support. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill calling for the day as a required state holiday passed  
the Democratic-controlled Senate last year, but failed in the 
Republican-controlled House. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Atlanta service, King's widow, Coretta Scott King,  
presented the 1999 Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize 
to John Hume, who last year shared the Nobel Peace Prize for his 
efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not seek ideological confrontation,'' Hume told the  
audience. ``We believed in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King. We 
believed in inclusivity, not exclusivity. We believed that true 
unity among all Irish people was unity of the heart, not unity of 
the soil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joseph Roberts, current pastor of Ebenezer Baptist,  
told the audience that there is still a long way to go to achieve 
King's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in the backwater of yesterday,'' he said. ``The  
jury is still out on American apartheid, even in the state of 
Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., echoed King's words that ``injustice  
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' He said every day 
needs to be dedicated to creating a just society.

<HEADLINE> NAFTA Common Currency Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The launch of a common currency in 11 European  
nations is fueling debate in Canada and Mexico over whether North 
America's three trading partners should adopt a comparable monetary 
union. But don't expect a NAFTA-style euro any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinion among experts is sharply divided, and Canadian and  
Mexican leaders don't appear eager for swift action on what would 
be a politically contentious project. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they were eager, Washington might not be. U.S. Commerce  
Secretary William Daley said Thursday a North American monetary 
union is a ``very long-term'' prospect -- one that might warrant 
serious discussion ``a hundred years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the euro to be a success,'' Daley said of the  
European Union's new currency. ``That will not drive us to some 
other integration, currency-wise, with the countries that are our 
neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Canada's ambassador to Washington, Raymond Chretien, echoed  
the views of many Canadian economists when he said the possibility 
of a single currency ``would have to be looked at'' if the euro 
proves a long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	A common currency could provide welcome stability for Canadian  
and Mexican businesses, which have been buffeted by sharp plunges 
in the values of their national currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But monetary union also would mean at least partial surrender of  
control over budget policies, with decision-making almost certainly 
dominated by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Washington dictating Canadian fiscal policy  
appalls Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a 
nationalist group that lobbied vainly against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	She said monetary union would make it difficult for Canada to  
maintain its social and cultural identity and would give American 
corporations pervasive influence over Canadians' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly our economic policy would be made in New York or  
Los Angeles,'' she said. ``Canada as a sovereign financial economy 
would no longer exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Harris, an economics professor at Simon Fraser  
University near Vancouver, disagreed, saying Canada could accept a 
common currency without ceding any authority over domestic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He doubts Prime Minister Jean Chretien's government is willing  
to push for monetary union soon, but says bankers and business 
executives will likely try to put the issue on the public agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depreciation (of the Canadian dollar) and the emergence of the  
euro are going to rekindle interest,'' Harris said. ``It's not on 
the horizon in the medium term, but if we look over the next decade 
and a half, the idea of a common currency in the Western Hemisphere 
is not out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and the United States are the world's largest trading  
partners, but the relationship has been skewed over the past year 
as the Canadian dollar hovered at an all-time low of around 65 U.S. 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists contend that Canada -- and Mexico as well --  
should establish a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar as a 
possible interim step toward full monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nason, an American who teaches economics at the  
University of Vancouver, calls that idea ``a disaster waiting to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's going to happen, and the markets are going to say,  
`That rate doesn't make any economic sense,''' Nason said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is skeptical that Canadian leaders would endorse any  
moves that gave Washington more say in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada's Finance Ministry becomes a junior agency of the U.S.  
Treasury -- why would those guys want to give up all that power and 
prestige?'' Nason asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government says it has no plans to push for monetary  
union, but the Finance Ministry and Central Bank have been studying 
the pluses and minuses of linking the peso to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	An influential Mexican think tank, the Private Sector Center for  
Economic Studies, has endorsed the concept, saying the country's 
economy would be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
	In both Canada and Mexico, any politicians who promoted monetary  
union would be taking a risk because of widespread unease about 
U.S. domination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elections are fought, won and lost on these kinds of issues,''  
said Raymond Chretien, who is Jean Chretien's nephew. ``But there 
is no question that if the European model is successful, our 
descendants will have to deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Injured Rios Out of Aussie Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Marcelo Rios will not get that  
elusive grand slam title at this Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	A back injury forced him to withdraw Monday from the year's  
first major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean, ranked No. 2, spent six weeks at No. 1 last year  
before Pete Sampras overtook him to finish on top for a sixth 
straight year. Sampras is fatigued and not playing in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, who lost in the finals to Petr Korda in Australia last  
year, has been told to rest at least four weeks, and that could 
cost him any chance of reaching No. 1 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATP Tour said Rios could plunge as low as No. 7 after this  
tournament because of his withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament doctor David Bolzonello said Rios should not play  
again until middle or late March. There are two major events in the 
United States that month -- at Indian Wells, Calif., and Key 
Biscayne, Fla. -- and Rios is defending champion in both. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATP system, in which players have to defend points won the  
previous year, works against Rios, whose title defense at last 
week's Auckland Open was also spoiled by the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolzonello said an MRI on Monday showed a small fracture in one  
vertebrae. 
</P>
<P>
	``These injuries are potentially serious for all athletes  
involved in sports that involve extension of the back,'' Bolzonello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Marcelo's case we feel it's new, we've diagnosed it within  
a few days of it appearing. And now we know it's there, he can 
follow the appropriate treatment, which is essentially rest. And 
there's a very good chance it will heal without any concerns in the 
next few weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bolzonello said Rios should take a few extra weeks to make sure  
his rehabilitation succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This fracture is very minor,'' he said. ``Even though it's his  
vertebrae and it sounds dramatic, it'll heal as well as if he'd 
broken his finger, in three or four weeks.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Pitcher Nomo for 1 Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hideo Nomo, still struggling to regain the form  
that made him NL Rookie of the Year in 1995, avoided a salary 
arbitration hearing when he agreed Monday with the New York Mets on 
a one-year contract worth $2,925,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, acquired from Los Angeles last June, was one of six Mets  
who filed for arbitration last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for Hideo to have a comeback year,'' Mets  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``His stuff was great last 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was 4-5 with a 5.04 ERA for the Mets and 6-12 with a 4.92  
ERA overall. He struck out 167 and walked 94 in 157 1-3 innings, 
allowing 130 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he can cut down on his walks, which we think he can, there  
is no doubt in my mind he can again become one of the top starting 
pitchers in the National League,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has a 49-41 career record with a 3.68 ERA. He was 13-6 with  
a 2.54 ERA for the Dodgers in 1995, ushering in a new era for 
Japanese players in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	After his rookie season, Nomo agreed to a $4.3 million,  
three-year contract with the Dodgers, a deal that paid him $2.8 
million last season. His new contract contains performance bonuses 
that could raise his earnings to $3,525,000: $50,000 each for 150, 
160, 170 and 190 innings; $100,000 each for 180 and 200 innings, 
and $200,000 for 220 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Rey Ordonez, infielder Edgardo Alfonzo and pitchers  
Armando Benitez, Jason Isringhausen and Turk Wendell remain in 
arbitration. Players and teams exchange salary figures Tuesday, 
with hearings set for next month.

<HEADLINE> President Will Address Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a dissonant prelude, President Clinton is  
claiming the stage tonight for a State of the Union report he will 
address past his impeachment judges, to tell Americans he is 
performing their work, and well. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the on-the-job side of his case for acquittal in the  
Senate impeachment trial, which is convening to hear his defense 
lawyers, then adjourning to cross the Capitol to the House chamber 
to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
	Not without some complaints that he was going ahead with the  
ritual State of the Union report to a joint session of Congress, 
instead of waiting out the trial or sending his proposals in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I'd rather go to the dentist,'' Republican Sen.  
Phil Gramm of Texas said on ABC. But he'll go to the speech, as 
will other Republicans from the House prosecution team and Senate 
jury, to stand in applause, they said, for the office, not the man 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois said in a letter to House  
members that the Republican Congress is receiving Clinton ``out of 
respect for the office of the presidency and for a desire to hear 
about the state of our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is the custom and precedent, now followed in unprecedented  
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Never has an impeached president gone before the House that  
accused him and the Senate trying him for his job to deliver his 
major annual message on the nation's affairs and his agenda for the 
future. Andrew Johnson, the only other president impeached, sent 
his messages in writing, as was the custom of his time. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's nationally televised address fits his strategy of  
fending off impeachment so that he will have a future in the White 
House for the balance of his term, ending two years from Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers argue the case. He argues that he's attending to the  
business of the American people, the job he was elected to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are on display, with an opening statement for the defense  
in the Senate in the afternoon, Clinton's address at night. He 
won't be brief, taking at least the 73 minutes of his 1998 State of 
the Union address, according to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	How uncomfortable will he be standing in the chamber where he  
was impeached, talking to an audience that impeached him and is 
judging him? 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is always comfortable when he's dealing with the  
issues, dealing with issues that impact real people's lives, and 
dealing with how the government can help provide the tools that 
people need,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	All part of a White House buildup that included a reminder that  
Clinton has a higher job approval rating than Ronald Reagan or 
Dwight D. Eisenhower did at this point in their second terms. 
</P>
<P>
	It is in the 60 percent-plus range, at two-thirds approval in  
some polls. Clinton's ratings went up to those levels after his 
last State of the Union performance, delivered in the stress of the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation, which had just been disclosed. At 
that point he was denying the affair, dishonestly, as he finally 
had to confess. He didn't mention it that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the situation is even more strained. Gramm said it is like  
suspending a trial to have the accused hold a pep really in front 
of the jury. ``I think he believes that it will help him,'' Gramm 
said. ``Every time he gives a State of the Union address, it 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it does every president including, briefly, Richard Nixon  
during Watergate. It is a ritual occasion of state, convening 
Congress, the Cabinet, robed Supreme Court justices, diplomats, all 
come to hear the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Although not necessarily to heed him. Clinton made 30 proposals  
for congressional action a year ago; a program to begin hiring 
100,000 new schoolteachers was the only major one enacted on his 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Congress that night that it must save Social Security  
first, before spending the budget surplus on anything else, and he 
succeeded in holding that line against Republican tax cuts. Both 
his admonition and the GOP push for sharp tax reductions will be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's congressional success rate in the year of scandal and  
ultimately impeachment was relatively weak. He is dealing with an 
opposition Congress, but other presidents did better in the same 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Congressional Quarterly, the administration won in  
51 percent of 154 votes on which it took a position, the sixth 
lowest in the 46 years since the publication began keeping track. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cambodia Discuss Garment Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A United States trade delegation  
began talks Monday with Cambodia's government about a surge of 
garment exports to the U.S. and working conditions in Cambodian 
textile factories that labor organizations describe as appalling. 
</P>
<P>
	A quota on Cambodia-made garments is expected to be set by the  
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative after the negotiations, a 
move that Cambodian Commerce Minister Cham Prasidh argued will 
depress his country's fastest-growing industry and cost local 
workers their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``More jobs are at stake, and the existing jobs as well. That's  
the problem,'' Cham Prasidh said during a break in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry insiders say a quota is likely to be imposed by the  
U.S. to discourage the practice of garment manufacturers exporting 
clothes labeled ``Made in Cambodia'' which were actually 
manufactured in other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The garment industry has boomed in Cambodia in recent years  
after the U.S. granted the Southeast Asian nation trade privileges 
that lower or eliminate tariffs on many American-bound exports. 
</P>
<P>
	But international labor organizations say the industry has been  
built on the backs of underpaid and overworked workers exploited by 
factory owners who ignore Cambodia's new labor law with the help of 
corrupt government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Labor conditions in the garment factories in Cambodia are  
appalling,'' said Philip Robertson of the American Center for 
International Labor Solidarity, a branch of America's largest labor 
confederation, the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO asked Washington last year to withdraw trade  
privileges from Cambodia because of severe labor rights abuses that 
Robertson said include substandard factory conditions, forced 
overtime, failure to pay overtime wages and sexual abuse of the 
predominantly female workers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. trade privileges are linked by law to a country having  
adequate labor protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the U.S. delegation -- led by Donald Johnson, chief  
textile negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative -- are 
scheduled to meet with local labor unions and visit factories 
during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Garment exports from Cambodia in 1998 have been estimated at  
$360 million, with two-thirds of the total going to the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Wyo. Gov. Backs Move Vs. Hate Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) -- Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer is backing a new  
effort for a hate crime law, though supporters expect a difficult 
time in the Legislature despite last year's beating death of a gay 
college student. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers have rejected similar measures four times since  
1995. Even the measure's sponsor Democratic state Sen. Rich 
Cathcart, says opponents ``have a pretty good argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geringer, a Republican who never took a stand on the earlier  
measures, expressed support for Cathcart's measure Friday. He 
mentioned general support for the idea in his State of the State 
address last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Geringer said he wants a law ``that we believe is  
right and (does) not yield to the external pressure that could be 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wyoming, one of nine states without a hate crimes law, has drawn  
attention since Matthew Shepard, 21, was found beaten and tied to a 
ranch fence last October. He died five days after the attack, which 
authorities said was motivated in part by Shepard's homosexuality. 
Two men were charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, four bills proposing bias crime legislation have been  
filed. Testimony is scheduled to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill agreed to by Geringer and Cathcart, a slight expansion  
of Cathcart's original wording, says an increased penalty could be 
imposed for a crime if a victim was selected ``because of the 
defendant's bias or prejudice against a group to which the victim 
belongs or is perceived by the defendant to belong.'' It does not 
list specific groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would increase the maximum fine for a felony by up  
to $5,000 and the maximum prison sentence by up to five years for a 
bias crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Another bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jayne Mockler,  
enhances the penalty if a victim was selected ``because of the 
actor's belief or perception regarding the race, religion, color, 
disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of that 
person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathcart said such lists exclude many individuals.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in college on the rodeo team, I remember a group of  
fellows bragging about taking sheep shears and cutting this 
hippie's hair off. That was assault and it should have been 
prosecuted and it was a bias crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also sees the argument against them.  
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Constitution gives us the right to hate anyone we  
want. When we act on that hatred then we commit a crime and we have 
laws on the books already that make those acts a crime,'' Cathcart 
said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, S.Korea Seek US Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to regain U.S. investors' confidence,  
crisis-hit Thailand and South Korea are wooing American executives, 
telling them new opportunities abound for companies willing to take 
a chance on their recovering economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries' embassies say the domestic reforms forced on  
them by the Asian financial meltdown make investing in there more 
attractive than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases in foreign investment, if they materialize, will boost  
Thai and Korean efforts to build up foreign currency reserves and 
avert a new financial crisis. After nearly two years of economic 
decline, both nations say they expect to record positive growth 
figures by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really are turning around,'' Thai Ambassador Nitya  
Pibulsonggram said in an interview. ``We're putting a lot of 
measures in place to provide a firm foundation for growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said these policies include a major effort to assure  
prospective investors that Thailand is a good place to do business. 
``We're trying to make it easier for foreign companies to operate 
while maintaining social and political stability and following the 
(International Monetary Fund's) advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pibulsonggram said none of the 600 U.S. companies based in  
Thailand, including such giants as Ford, General Motors, Coca-Cola 
and IBM, decided to leave because of the financial crisis. Ford 
continued to build a new car plant that was 90 percent complete, 
helped create several component suppliers and established a 
dealership, a maintenance firm and a new finance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian financial crisis started July 2, 1997 when Thailand  
devalued its currency, the baht, and the contagion spread to other 
Asian nations, Russia and Latin America. In response, the IMF 
assembled multibillion-dollar rescue packages for Thailand, South 
Korea and three other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Reversing years of opposition to foreign investment, South Korea  
quickly realized it could play a big role in turning the country's 
economic situation around. Its Ministry of Finance and Economy 
produced a 73-page booklet, also posted on its Web site, explaining 
why the country is a good place to invest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign investment will play a major role in making the Korean  
economy more efficient and allow for further integration with the 
global economy,'' the booklet declares. ``Foreign investment 
provides stable long-term foreign capital, which is so vital to 
Korea at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dong Kyu Shin, the South Korean Embassy's economic and finance  
counselor, said his government is publicizing ``why we are 
executing economic reconstruction efforts as fast as we can because 
that's the way to get a positive response from investors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats from Thailand and South Korea have been visiting U.S.  
cities to spread the word, escorting visiting ministers to meet key 
Wall Street figures and arranging investment seminars and trade 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambassador Pibulsonggram said Thailand's parliament was set to  
approve 12 laws that liberalize the businesses and professions that 
foreigners can engage in, and open up banks and finance to foreign 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	While the outlook for Indonesia, another beneficiary of an IMF  
rescue package, remains cloudy because of continuing civil unrest, 
financial markets already have recovered significantly in Thailand 
and South Korea, brightening the investment climate. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Korean government said last week it expected foreign  
direct investment in 1999 to exceed $15 billion, compared with a 
provisional $8.85 billion for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Big investors last year included Amkor Technology and Fairchild  
Semiconductor, which agreed to invest $600 million and $445 
million, respectively, to acquire semiconductor operations in South 
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Kopp May Be in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators have evidence that the  
abortion foe wanted for questioning in the sniper slaying of a 
Buffalo, N.Y., doctor may have fled to Mexico, a Justice Department 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some evidence that anti-abortion activist James Charles  
Kopp, 44, was driven to Mexico by a female friend after the Oct. 23 
shooting, this official said. And a Customs Service videotape from 
a border crossing point shows the woman's car returning from Mexico 
later, according to the official who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine reported that credit card receipts reflect a  
trip to Mexico by the woman. In its Jan. 25 issue, Newsweek also 
said FBI Director Louis Freeh, in Mexico on an official visit last 
week, asked the Mexican government for help locating Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal official said investigators have recovered fibers at  
the shooting scene that are being tested to see if they can be 
linked to Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is wanted as a material witness in the killing of Dr.  
Barnett Slepian, a 52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who 
performed abortions. He was gunned down in the kitchen of his 
suburban Buffalo home by a rifle shot fired from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered last month at  
Newark, N.J., International Airport, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said the car was spotted in Amherst, N.Y., a  
Buffalo suburb, in the weeks before Slepian was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the killing is linked to four earlier  
nonfatal shootings targeting doctors who provided abortion services 
in Canada and upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The car had been in the long-term lot about two weeks, said Greg  
Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The car had a New Jersey license plate that didn't belong on it.  
FBI Agent Monica Patton in Newark said she couldn't say whether or 
not the plate had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is believed to have been working on a construction job in  
the metropolitan New York area two days after the shooting, FBI 
Agent Bernard Tolbert said.

<HEADLINE> NFL Said To Oppose Redskins Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The trustees of the Jack Kent Cooke estate  
have a record-setting deal to sell the Washington Redskins, but the 
National Football League isn't so sure that's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Browne, NFL senior vice president for communications and  
government affairs, said the current ownership headed by Cooke's 
son, John, ``has a proven track record,'' The Washington Post 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuity of this ownership would be a plus for the  
league, if it can be accomplished to the satisfaction of the 
trustees,'' Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees of the senior Cooke's estate have agreed to sell the  
team to a group headed by Howard Milstein for $800 million. 
However, the deal needs the approval of three-fourths of the NFL 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
	A sticking point is that NFL rules require that the lead owner  
of a team be capable of putting up at least 30 percent of the cost 
of its purchase out of personal funds -- possibly relying on 
partners or loans for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those guidelines, John Kent Cooke was able to put together  
an offer of about $680 million, placing him third in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the committee really wants to see what John Cooke's  
bid was,'' said Pat Bowlen, owner of the Denver Broncos and a 
member of the NFL's finance committee. ``He has been an owner in 
the National Football League for a long time, and I think there's 
some amount of sympathy for his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you know I don't think we could take it where we are  
saying that the foundation should take substantially less money 
from John Cooke. I think we want to have a closer look at the whole 
financial transaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Jack Kent Cooke, who died in April 1997, was the  
actual owner of the team, Bowlen was referring to John Cooke's 
involvement in day-to-day operations of the team for 20 years. He 
represented the team at league meetings during that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Trustees of the elder Cooke's estate have taken the position  
that they are legally bound to obtain the highest possible price 
for the team and use most of the proceeds to set up a foundation as 
decreed by Cooke's will.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Accounts Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposals to replace Social Security's  
guaranteed benefits with new private retirement accounts are 
unacceptable, a group of congressional Democrats warned President 
Clinton in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers left an opening for an alternative: using the  
budget surplus to subsidize new 401(k)-style accounts that 
consumers could manage themselves as an addition to, but not a 
replacement for, Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That is something being considered by administration officials  
advising Clinton on what to say in his State of the Union address 
Tuesday. Clinton wants to use the address to jump-start action in 
Congress to reform the nation's retirement program, but aides 
wouldn't say Monday just how explicit he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Many congressional Democrats say they would prefer that Clinton  
avoid any explicit policy endorsements in his speech Tuesday, and 
pursue bipartisan talks instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a recent letter to Clinton, 44 House Democrats and  
independent Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont took one stand: ``We 
are firmly united on one principle -- any Social Security 
privatization plan must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was silent, however, on the possibility of  
supplemental accounts using government surpluses, rather than 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I would certainly consider,'' said Sanders,  
who composed the missive to Clinton along with Reps. Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., and Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts wouldn't directly address the cash  
shortfall expected to face Social Security as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. But they could help Americans better prepare 
for retirement and soften the blow of any changes in Social 
Security that might be necessary, such as raising the eligibility 
age for benefits or limiting retirees' yearly cost-of-living 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials consider it one option that Clinton could broach  
without upsetting lawmakers of either political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have long advocated diverting some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks into individual 
accounts Americans could invest in the stock market. Private 
investments would give most people a better return than Social 
Security does, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats, however, strongly oppose moving money out of  
Social Security into such accounts, warning of increasing financial 
risks to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement benefits should be guaranteed, not subjected to the  
whims of the stock market,'' the House Democrats said in their 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri has said he  
could support supplemental accounts, however, as long as taxes 
earmarked for Social Security's guaranteed benefits aren't touched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, meanwhile, have already introduced  
legislation to use surpluses to start new retirement accounts, 
holding open the possibility that some Social Security taxes could 
be transferred into them later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that this idea can be the basis for a bipartisan  
consensus solution to building a secure retirement for all 
Americans,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, 
R-Del., in a separate letter to colleagues last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's proposal would use budget surpluses to guarantee every  
worker a minimum of $250 a year for his account, with additional 
government payments to parallel what each person contributes in 
taxes to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatively, some Democrats suggest Americans with the lowest  
incomes could get the largest government subsidies for their 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In either case, the accounts would be similar to the 401(k)  
retirement savings plans many companies offer. Workers would 
probably be able to add their own money and choose from several 
government-supervised investment plans, such as stock and bond 
mutual funds.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices fell slightly in early trading  
Tuesday amid pessimism about Japan's prospects for an economic 
recovery. The dollar retreated against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average dipped 26.31 points, or 0.19 percent,  
to 13,778.75 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, 
the average gained 66.20 points, or 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 113.83 yen, down 114.14 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also below its level of 114.35 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors continued to stay away from the stock market as few  
signs emerged that Japan was poised for an economic comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr.  
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.49 points, negligible in percentage terms, 
to 1,075.30. The TOPIX closed up 5.85 points, or 0.55 percent, 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreign exchange market was quiet as investors took to the  
sidelines to see if finance officials would comment on currency 
movements at the opening of Japan's regular session of Parliament 
on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.41 yen in Tokyo, up from  
132.34 yen late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.780  
percent from 1.725 percent Monday, driving its price down to 100.16 
yen from 100.60 yen.

<HEADLINE> A Family Tale From Ireland to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``A Couple of Blaguards'' is engaging  
autobiography, a family journey that travels from Ireland to 
America on equal amounts of blarney, sentiment and charm. 
</P>
<P>
	It helps that the storytellers are the McCourt brothers, Frank  
and Malachy, whose literary endeavors have become something of a 
cottage industry. Frank's award-winning ``Angela's Ashes'' and 
Malachy's ``A Monk Swimming'' are the foundations on which this 
genial stage memoir is built. 
</P>
<P>
	The informal evening, on view at off-Broadway's Triad features  
two ingratiating actors: the tall, lanky Mickey Kelly and the 
short, stout Shay Duffin. They play Frank and Malachy respectively, 
as well as other McCourt family members, scolding clerics, amorous 
girlfriends and assorted citizens of the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly's Frank is a quiet, unassuming man, yet possessed of a sly  
humor that gently works its way into the tale, particularly in the 
play's second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 1 is devoted to the lads' early years, their grim growing up  
in the town of Limerick where several siblings died young and their 
father retreated into an alcoholic haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffin offers a particularly affecting recollection of one  
little brother's funeral. The death and burial are described 
matter-of-factly, without placing any blame except on the poverty 
that trapped the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most of the evening remains firmly on the side of a good  
laugh, even when the boys are dealing with the biggest influence of 
their early oppressed lives -- the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank's remembrances of his First Communion are touching and  
funny, done by Kelly with an affectionate exasperation. They make a 
nice counterpoint to Duffin's impersonation of the young boy's 
grandmother. She is a zealous woman who raises the importance of 
her grandson's communion to the level of the Second Coming. 
</P>
<P>
	In Act 2, we get the McCourt migration to the United States, a  
story that doesn't resonate with as much emotion as the childhood 
experiences in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the second half has its pleasures, much of it derived  
from Malachy's attempt to get a job, any job. 
</P>
<P>
	Duffin is a physical comedian as well as a verbal one. His  
Malachy captures the boisterous manner of a man who would never 
turn down the offer of a drink or the opportunity to tell a joke. 
The actor has a craggy face and a ruddy complexion that instantly 
define his heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	One other thing. Duffin and Kelly can sing -- blending their  
voices at the drop of a hat or a drop of whisky. 
</P>
<P>
	If the humor in ``A Couple of Blaguards'' occasionally gets a  
bit too broad for the small Triad stage, the pleasing personalities 
of its two stars put everything back in the proper perspective.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher  
Monday, buoyed by last week's rally on Wall Street following 
Brazil's decision to float its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the key index surged 3.2 percent as foreign  
investors pushed up large-capitalization stocks. The Straits Times 
Index rose 47.29 to 1,547.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers said that institutional investors were returning to the  
Singapore market because they were confident the Brazilian 
financial crisis won't have a significant impact on the Asian 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rose 255.14 points,  
or 2.5 percent, closing at 10,402.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices climbed amid receding fears about the  
impact of the financial turmoil in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil triggered a worldwide market rout on Wednesday after its  
central bank chief resigned and his successor devalued the 
country's currency. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Brazilian government decided to allow its  
currency, the real, to float freely against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision sent share prices soaring in New York on Friday,  
with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising by 219.62 points to 
close at 9,340.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippine shares rebounded strongly from their sharp losses  
last week as worries over the situation in Brazil eased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected companies  
soared 89.35 points, or 4.4 percent, to 2,130.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
66.20 points, or 0.48 percent, closing at 13,805.06. On Thursday, 
the average gained 335.26 points, or 2.50 percent. Financial 
markets in Japan were closed Friday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investors were heartened by a recovery in U.S. and  
other world stock exchanges on Friday following moves by the 
Brazilian government to stabilize its economy, Latin America's 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 114.14 yen in late afternoon  
trading, up 0.68 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and little changed 
from its level late Friday in New York of 114.13 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Malaysia and Indonesia for holidays.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher as  
stronger global financial markets buoyed the local market. The 
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 46.75 points, or 2.2 percent, 
to 2,159.86. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed moderately higher,  
helped by a strong performance in the banking and finance sector. 
The All Ordinaries Index rose 21.1 points, or 0.75 percent, to 
2,830.4. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as investors took profits  
following recent gains. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
fell 106.05 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,377.25. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher amid an easing of concerns  
over Brazil's financial turmoil. The Korea Composite Stock Price 
Index rose 7.95 points, or 1.2 percent, to 622.52. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Thailand SET Index  
rose 5.79 points, or 1.5 percent, to 387.61 (381.82)

<HEADLINE> Report Targets Flight Hazards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Federal officials have failed to keep a 1996  
promise to better control hazardous materials shipped by air on 
cargo and passenger planes, The Plain Dealer reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has issued fewer and smaller  
fines for violating rules, opting instead for more warning letters, 
the newspaper reported Sunday, citing agency records. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said 1,133 problems were reported in 1997. As of the end  
of August 1998, there were more than 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of reported violations has increased because of  
agency improvements, including increasing the number of staff 
members, said FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fines, warning letters and news releases help deter more  
problems, she said. ``The airlines are much more conscious of this 
now because they know we're out there,'' Spitaliere said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines have different rules about what is allowed on board.  
Materials that could be hazardous include paints, flammable 
liquids, adhesives and perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported that passengers and baggage handlers  
found pesticides, engine cleaner, kerosene lamp fuel and a chain 
saw in overhead compartments. Compressed gas cylinders, fireworks 
and leaking contact cement have been found in cargo holds. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA promised to improve oversight of hazardous material  
after a ValuJet plane crashed in the Everglades in 1996, killing 
110 people. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the 
FAA, ValuJet and a contractor shared blame for the crash, caused by 
a fire in a cargo hold triggered by improperly packaged oxygen 
generators. 
</P>
<P>
	After the accident, Congress approved spending $10.5 million to  
hire 130 new employees to improve training and aircraft 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit in March by the Office of Inspector General said the  
FAA and Transportation Department had fallen up to 18 months behind 
schedule to implement many changes promised in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA still has not required that airlines train employees to  
detect and prevent hazardous materials from making it aboard 
airplanes, even though 60 percent of the cargo shipped by air is 
aboard passenger airlines, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA does not know how many of the violations are serious  
because the agency has no method for ranking them, said Gerald 
Dillingham, associate director of transportation issues for the 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitaliere said most inspectors report problems they find.  
</P>
<P>
	She also disputed the newspaper's contention that FAA  
enforcement is inconsistent. Spitaliere said reports from different 
parts of the country vary because some areas handle more cargo than 
others.

<HEADLINE> Two Battle Over Website Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- High-chair Veronica is grappling with high  
school Veronica in the latest Internet domain duel, and it looks 
like the comic book brunette has the upper hand over the 
22-month-old toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sams registered the veronica.org domain name for his baby  
daughter so she could grow up at ease with the Internet. He said he 
spent about $1,500 and several days of work to create the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came trademark trouble. Archie Comic Publications,  
publishers of the Riverdale High School gang comic strips, 
featuring Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica, own the trademark 
for the name Veronica. 
</P>
<P>
	They have threatened legal action if Sams doesn't pull the name,  
and he must decide this week, the Los Angeles Times reported 
Monday. Offices of the Mamaronek, N.Y., company were closed Monday 
and no one answered the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like David and Goliath here,'' said Sams, a television  
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	The human Veronica's Web site (www.veronica.org) shows her in a  
tub and in a high chair, looking perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can a company own my name?'' says the text. ``Veronica, in  
Archie comics, is a brunette. I'm a blonde. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a collision between a large and growing commercial  
use of the Internet and a large and growing community and 
communication use of the Internet,'' said David Johnson, 
co-director of the Cyberspace Law Institute in Washington. 
``Certainly, we have to allow personal and commercial uses of the 
Net to exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sams said he would fight, but he had a backup plan in place: he  
has registered the veronica.cc domain name in the Cocos Islands, an 
Australian territory off Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very difficult for anybody to force them to  
take down our Web site,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Focus on Calif. in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- As he prepares a run for the  
presidency, Sen. John McCain of Arizona is pinning his hopes on 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican war hero, who filed candidacy papers Dec. 30,  
believes that Californians will respond to his Ronald Reagan 
conservatism, maverick image and largely scandal-free past. 
</P>
<P>
	The state has more delegates in the nominating process than any  
other, and last year moved its primary up to the earliest possible 
date, March 7 -- which could give it extra clout. 
</P>
<P>
	``For someone like me who is Western, then obviously that adds  
importance to it,'' he said, citing his understanding of issues 
that loom large in both Arizona and California -- including water, 
land use and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in the West are much more appreciative of those who act  
independently, according to their own judgments,'' he said Friday 
in a phone interview from Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, 62, has a reputation for such independence. In recent  
years, he has heightened his visibility by taking on big tobacco 
and the national campaign-finance system, both of which had 
defenders in his own party. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the GOP-controlled Senate killed his campaign-finance  
bill and his proposal to raise cigarette prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Californians have passed ballot initiatives in the last  
two elections that were meant to revamp campaign finance and 
increase the cost of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also has been a fierce defender of American Indian  
self-governance and gambling. Indians emerged last year as a group 
with enormous political clout in California, pouring some $68 
million into their campaign for a ballot measure that expanded 
tribal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who spoke during a recess from President Clinton's  
impeachment trial, said he would not use the Clinton-Monica 
Lewinsky affair as a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to discuss the Clinton scandal,'' McCain said.  
``I've always believed the scandal in Washington was not Monica. It 
was the abuse of the institutions of government by Clinton and 
Gore. The scandals are absolutely disgraceful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has had his own brush with scandal. He and four other  
senators were rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for 
intervening with regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating during 
the collapse of the Arizona financier's Southern California-based 
Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain would rather remind California voters of his links to  
Reagan, a two-time California governor who carried the state in the 
1980 and 1984 presidential contests. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was a Navy pilot who was shot down in Vietnam, captured  
and tortured for more than five years before returning to the 
United States in 1973. He won a House seat representing Arizona 
nine years later as a Reagan Republican. In 1986, during Reagan's 
second term, he won his Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of my great heroes,'' McCain said.  
</P>
<P>
	Already McCain is surrounding himself with advisers who are  
Reagan associates: Ken Duberstein, who was Reagan's chief of staff, 
is ``on the team''; advisers include Mike Deaver, the master 
image-maker at the Reagan White House, and Stu Spencer, who managed 
Reagan's first campaign for governor and later advised the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who plans to be among the aspiring candidates addressing  
next month's California Republican Party convention, says he 
already has a deep well of support in the state party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was adopted several years ago by the CRP as their senator,''  
he joked, referring to the lock that Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer 
and Dianne Feinstein have had on California for the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Davis Elevates Game in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A year ago, Hall of Fame-bound quarterback John  
Elway handed over the reins of the Denver Broncos to running back 
Terrell Davis, saying, ``It's Terrell's team now.'' The new 
proprietor hasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	On a blustery day when nothing else was clicking for the  
Broncos, Davis was superb. Even as his team was foundering in the 
first half and into the third quarter of Sunday's AFC Championship 
game, Davis, as usual, was flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis played a key role in Denver's third-quarter revival,  
dashing for a 31-yard touchdown that sparked the Broncos to a 23-10 
victory over the New York Jets and into their second straight Super 
Bowl, where they will meet the Atlanta Falcons on Jan. 31 in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year pro has rushed for more than 1,500 yards in each  
of his last three seasons, topped by 2,008 yards this season to win 
both the league rushing title and the MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	But, amazingly, Davis is even more devastating to defenses in  
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he finished with 167 yards on 32 carries, his sixth  
straight 100-yard game in the postseason. Since last year's AFC 
wild-card game, he has rushed for, in succession, 184, 101, 139, 
157, 199 and now 167 yards. The Broncos, not coincidentally, are 
6-0 in those games, including a Super Bowl title. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season when Davis became just the fourth  
player in NFL history to go over 2,000 yards, he averaged 125.5 
yards per game. In his last six postseason games, he has averaged 
157.8 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, I try to focus a little harder,'' he said  
Sunday. ``I try to catch better and block better and run a little 
harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He ran for 75 of Denver's meager 108 yards by halftime. Then,  
after the Broncos fell behind 10-0 just three minutes into the 
third quarter, Davis got even better. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran for 6 yards to help set up Elway's 11-yard scoring pass  
to fullback Howard Griffith. He added a 5-yard gain before Jason 
Elam kicked a tying, 44-yard field goal. Then Davis ripped off a 
20-yard run to set up Elam's 48-yarder, making it 13-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with time running out in the quarter, Davis took a  
pitchout off the left side and danced 31 yards for a clinching 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his scoring run, Davis said, ``It was just a pitch play where  
a lot of times the backside is going to be open, and you have to be 
patient with it. I saw the flow going left and cut behind a block 
and saw a seam there and just tried to get to the end zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Broncos trailed 3-0 at halftime, Davis said his  
team needed to calm down, not get fired up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a little overanxious. I know I was,'' he said. ``At  
the half, we knew we needed to calm down and just do our jobs, just 
go back to the basics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why, Davis said, ``Everybody is excited about playing in a  
game of this magnitude, and I think everybody was trying to do too 
much. And some of it could have been because of John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and his teammates were aware that Sunday's game was likely  
to be the last at Mile High Stadium for Elway, who figures to 
retire after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out and played a great second half and wore them down  
a little bit,'' Davis said. ``We made better adjustments in the 
second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A swirling wind which gusted into the 30 mph range created havoc  
with Denver's passing game in the early going, and Davis said he 
even had problems with the wind on a couple of pitchouts, one of 
which he fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
	Under such conditions, the running game becomes critical. Denver  
had 178 yards on the ground, compared to the Jets' 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter if it's a day like today or not,'' Elway  
said. ``You want Terrell Davis back there. He's the best running 
back in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the 10-0 deficit that quieted the crowd in the third  
quarter, tight end Shannon Sharpe refused to be worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wasn't concerned when we got 10 down because they  
really hadn't stopped Terrell all day,'' he said. ``With Terrell, 
we could do pretty much what we wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fullback Howard Griffith said Davis ``does such a great job of  
going out there and being an effective runner every play and every 
game. In the playoffs and the Super Bowl, you have to be able to 
run the ball, and we can because of Terrell.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Convicted of Murdering Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Thomas Capano's descent from Delaware's  
highest political and legal circles ended when a jury pronounced 
him guilty of murdering his mistress, the governor's scheduling 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the only question is whether the conviction will cost the  
49-year-old former state prosecutor his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-man, six-woman jury that found Capano guilty Saturday of  
murdering Anne Marie Fahey will begin a new hearing Wednesday -- 
this time to determine whether or not it will recommend the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the announcement of the verdict Sunday, lead defense  
lawyer Joseph Oteri said that before exploring an appeal he first 
needs to protect Capano from execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hoped we had convinced the jury there was reasonable  
doubt,'' Oteri said. ``We will go on to the penalty phase and save 
Tom's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty verdict against Capano came after three days of jury  
deliberation that capped a 12-week, high-profile trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a body, a weapon or any concrete evidence to prove how  
Ms. Fahey died, prosecutors used circumstantial evidence to show 
Capano had planned her death. Jurors had to believe the crime was 
premeditated to convict on the sole charge of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano -- a member of one of Wilmington's most powerful families  
and a former aide to both former Gov. Michael Castle and former 
Wilmington Mayor Daniel Frawley -- admitted dumping Ms. Fahey's body 
at sea, but said another mistress had killed her by accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial had Delawareans transfixed, exposing sensational  
details about some of the most influential people in this usually 
staid financial center, with its tightly interlocking circles of 
law, politics and business. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, who Oteri said ``fully believed he was going to be  
acquitted,'' stared stone-faced as the verdict was read to Superior 
Court Judge William Swain Lee's silent courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano's mother, Marguerite, burst into tears and his daughters  
held each other. On the other side of the room, Ms. Fahey's sister, 
Kathleen Fahey-Hosey, cried tears of relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Capano put a lot of people through a lot of distress,  
suffering and pain,'' prosecutor Colm Connolly said after the 
verdict. ``Our hearts go out to the Fahey family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have a just result and someone will pay a price for  
that, we also do not have Anne Marie Fahey here. That's a loss Anne 
Marie Fahey's family and friends will never be fully compensated 
for,'' Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what punishment the Fahey family wished for Capano,  
her brother Robert Fahey said the family will remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really up to the judge and jury to decide. We will be  
very comfortable with any decision they make,'' he said. ``In some 
ways, life in prison could be a crueler punishment than death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 2 1/2 years, Capano had maintained he didn't know what had  
happened to Ms. Fahey, 30, after they dined at a posh Philadelphia 
restaurant on June 27, 1996. She was never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloodstains were found in Capano's house and investigators  
learned that Capano had replaced a rug and dumped a bloodstained 
sofa at a family construction site not long after Ms. Fahey 
vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning turnaround, Capano admitted on the stand that Ms.  
Fahey was killed at his house and he disposed of her body with his 
brother's help. 
</P>
<P>
	He said another mistress, Deborah MacIntyre, had found him and  
Ms. Fahey together and threatened suicide. When she produced a gun, 
Capano said, he lunged for it and it went off, killing Ms. Fahey. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano said he lied to protect Ms. MacIntyre, a former  
administrator at a prestigious private school who had been his 
lover for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury didn't believe it.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre denied being at Capano's house the night Ms. Fahey  
died and told investigators Capano asked her to buy him a gun in 
May 1996, then asked her to lie about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Capano began planning the murder in early 1996,  
as Ms. Fahey's relationship with another man deepened and she tried 
to extricate herself from her three-year affair with Capano, a 
married man with four teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors also relied on the testimony of Gerard Capano, who  
testified that he took his brother in his boat 60 miles off the New 
Jersey coast to dump the body and shot the cooler to try to make it 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
	A pinkish-stained cooler with a slug hole was found by a  
fisherman a week later and was the prosecution's final exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Fahey said Sunday that the discovery of the cooler ``was  
a gift from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While in prison awaiting trial, Capano was indicted on charges  
he tried to have his brother Gerard and Ms. MacIntyre killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. MacIntyre said the verdict was a ``tremendous relief.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a vindictive person. Again I feel the justice system  
has worked,'' she said. ``Today is the first day of the rest of my 
exciting life.''

<HEADLINE> Economics Forum Opens in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Amid growing concern that Brazil's economic  
meltdown will infect the region, President Fidel Castro opened a 
forum Monday on the impact of the global financial crisis on 
developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban leader did not speak during the opening session, but  
later in the afternoon he quizzed economists about the seriousness 
of the crisis compared with the Depression of 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen with the speculation in the markets, the  
speculation of currencies?'' asked Castro, who wore a dark blue 
suit and tie rather than his typical olive fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine economist Jorge Beinstein replied, ``The level of  
destruction, in world economic terms, will be much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro proposed the forum last year, as the financial crisis was  
spreading across Asia. It hit Brazil in August, when investors 
pulled their money out of the country for fear that it would 
default on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, Cuba hosted similar economic forums on the  
foreign debt then weighing down Latin American nations and became a 
regional leader in support of foreign debt moratoriums. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban leader presided over Monday's inauguration of the  
five-day event, attended by hundreds of economists at Havana's 
Convention Palace. Vice President Carlos Lage, the architect of the 
communist country's modest economic reforms, and Economics Minister 
Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia also were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Verrier Castro, president of Cuba's National Association  
of Economists, told participants the current global financial 
crisis required ``a complete revision of traditional economic 
models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The previous dogmas are falling,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Visiting speakers included Brazilian economist Theotonio Dos  
Santos, Guatemalan Romulo Caballeros of the United Nations' 
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Andres 
Solimano of the World Bank, who was scheduled to speak on Monday, 
did not show up. 
</P>
<P>
	Also listed on the schedule were Makarim Wibisono, Indonesia's  
ambassador to the United Nations, and Patrick Low, director of 
general economic studies for the World Trade Organization. Most of 
the other participants were from developing countries, primarily in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro opposes free market policies and points to the current  
global financial crisis as proof of its harm to developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists fear that if Brazil succumbs to an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest -- could 
infect and drag down other economies in the region.

<HEADLINE> Jackie Collins' Home Catches Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- This scenario was too hot, even for  
Jackie Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-story home owned by the novelist known for her steamy  
plots caught fire Sunday night. Firefighters quickly doused the 
flames and rescued a small white poodle, fire Battalion Chief Stan 
Speth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was inside the rental residence at the time. The fire  
damaged an upstairs bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Collins, whose novels include ``Thrill,'' ``Hollywood  
Wives'' and the ``The World Is Full of Married Men,'' does not live 
at the home. The cause remained under investigation, Speth said.

<HEADLINE> Boston Exchange Has New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Stock Exchange opens a gleaming new  
high-tech facility Tuesday, freeing traders from the dim, cluttered 
quarters they've called home for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offices in the city's Financial District boast nearly  
twice the trading floor space as the old building and a chance for 
the public to view the action from a second-story mezzanine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other building was a jumbled mess of cables,'' Joe Lloyd,  
senior vice president of systems, said of the new facility. ``Now 
we're a competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston exchange was founded in 1834 as a market center for  
trading stocks of New England-based companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The 92 local traders who make their livings swapping stocks will  
be moving onto the new trading floor, with more expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offices take up four floors of a landmark building.  
Right outside, a ``data wall'' of televisions tuned to CNN, MSNBC 
and other channels will give passersby real-time information about 
foreign and domestic markets. 
</P>
<P>
	An exchange spokeswoman said public accessibility was an  
important factor in choosing the building, which was constructed in 
1908 and is just down the block from the shopping hub of Downtown 
Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the prime reasons companies like Gillette, McDonald's and  
Lucent Technologies sell their stocks on the exchange is for the 
marketing benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, for example, boasts that about 63 percent of its 1.3  
billion outstanding shares belong to individuals rather than to 
other companies. For firms with such wide appeal to the general 
public, selling stock on regional exchanges like Boston's is just 
one more way to stay close to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that kind of a retail environment, it's very important to  
have yourself as widely available as possible,'' said Lucent 
spokesman Bill Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other regional exchanges -- Philadelphia, Pacific,  
Chicago, Cincinnati, and American -- Boston operates in the shadow 
of the massive New York Stock Exchange, but provides a public 
trading option for smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, more than 2.6 billion shares valued at $113 billion  
were traded on the BSE -- less than 2 percent of the number traded 
on the NYSE. Prerequisites for the regional exchanges are less 
stringent than the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been talk of combining some of the smaller exchanges.  
Boston and Cincinnati ended merger talks last year after failing to 
reach an agreement, but senior staff and board members of the two 
exchanges said at the time they would continue exploring other 
options. 
</P>
<P>
	When companies get big enough, they sometimes move their  
securities to New York, but others choose to keep a second listing 
on the smaller exchanges. No matter where an investor buys such 
``dually listed'' stocks, they pay one price because a computer 
network connects the various exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers To Attend Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has invited student  
volunteers, activist parents and others who ``exhibit what is best 
about America'' to view the president's State of the Union speech 
Tuesday night with Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The guests include a woman who works with single mothers in  
Boston, a Vietnamese refugee who mentors teen-age boys in 
California and a third-grade teacher from Miami who helped develop 
a gun-safety program. The mayor of Denver and an Air Force captain 
also were to sit with the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton is expected to focus heavily on his domestic  
agenda the address to a joint session of Congress and a national TV 
audience, and the guests will serve as embodiments of issues he 
hopes to address over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people chosen to sit with Mrs. Clinton daily exhibit what  
is best about America,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Those joining the first lady are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ashley Dumas, who graduated in 1998 from Wellesley College,  
Mrs. Clinton's alma mater, and enlisted in the AmeriCorps domestic 
service program. She works at Project Hope, a shelter for single 
mothers in South Boston, where she tutors women studying for their 
high school diplomas and provides child care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Loc Truong, who with his parents and five siblings came from  
Vietnam as a political refugee, mentors eight high-risk teen-age 
boys with the San Luis Obispo, Calif., AmeriCorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	--A third grade teacher at Coral Way Elementary School in Miami,  
Joanna Quintana Barroso, has been involved in a curriculum-based 
gun-safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Under Mayor Wellington E. Webb's stewardship, Denver has been  
ranked among the nation's top cities by national news magazines. 
The White House singled out his efforts to ``launch local projects 
to save our history and prepare children for the 21st century.'' 
Denver is also one of three cities vying to host the Democratic 
convention in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Capt. Jeffrey B. Taliaferro is chief of wing weapons for a 28th  
Bomb Wing support squadron, and he served in Operation Desert Fox 
from Thumrait, Oman. He flew in combat operations and was the 
architect of the first B-1 bomber combat mission. 
</P>
<P>
	--Suzann Wilson's 11-year-old daughter Britthney Varner was shot  
and killed when two schoolmates opened fire on a crowd of children 
outside a Jonesboro, Ark., school. Now Wilson is working to pass 
Child Access Prevention laws that would require gun owners to keep 
firearms out of children's reach. The boys used firearms they stole 
after breaking into a grandfather's home. 
</P>
<P>
	--Officer Chris Lonsford received a medal of valor from the  
Fontana, Calif., police department last March for bravery he showed 
in assisting in the arrest of three heavily armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maurice Lim Miller is executive director of San Francisco's  
Asian Neighborhood Design, a community development agency serving 
low-income families that was recognized under Clinton's race 
initiative for work promoting racial reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Elam Hill, 15, won National Science Foundation recognition for  
developing a communications center for homeless families with 
school-age children, making it easier for them to transfer student 
records when they seek shelter. Hill, who lives in one of Atlanta's 
poorest neighborhoods, was inspired by the homeless he passed on 
his way to school. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dr. Rita Colwell, the NSF's first woman chief, is helping  
direct a five-year initiative in information technology that hopes 
to quicken the pace of scientific discovery.

<HEADLINE>  Capriati Makes Progress in Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Jennifer Capriati finally won a  
close match. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to resurrect a career left in tatters by drug and  
shoplifting charges six years ago, the 22-year-old former world 
No.6 won a hard-fought victory Monday in the first round of the 
Australian Open against Evie Dominikovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't pulled out a match like that in a long time, and it  
has always been that I've been the loser,'' Capriati said. ``After 
a while it just brings you so down. You just have to keep fighting. 
This time I just gave all I've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being forced to prove herself in qualifying rounds in  
Sydney last week, Capriati battled to a 5-7, 6-3, 8-6 win over the 
211th-ranked Dominikovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hanging in there and really just trying -- I'm very  
happy I won today,'' said Capriati, nursing a lingering rotator 
cuff injury with an icepack. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati, from Wesley Chapel, Florida, lost the first set and  
was down 3-0 in the second to Dominikovic before rallying. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominikovic, an 18-year-old Australian, served for the match at  
6-5 in the third set but had two double faults to enable Capriati, 
now ranked 101, to break back. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati, the 1992 Olympic Champion, last won a tournament in  
Sydney in 1993, before her career was stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested on drug charges in 1994 and went into  
rehabilitation, putting down the racket for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati's latest win gave her something she had been lacking  
for a long time -- confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty hungry,'' she said. ``I think this match does a lot  
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati has forged a friendship with veteran German Steffi  
Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles who, late in her career, is 
keeping watch over the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she's going through a hard time with her injuries and  
trying to come back but we are just there, always supporting each 
other,'' Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she was trying ``to be there'' for Capriati.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds strange, but with Jennifer we have some kind of  
connection,'' said Graf. ``I think she has so much talent and I 
like her as a person.''

	Capriati has forged a friendship with veteran German Steffi  
Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles who, late in her career, is 
keeping watch over the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she's going through a hard time with her injuries and  
trying to come back but we are just there, always supporting each 
other,'' Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she was trying ``to be there'' for Capriati.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds strange, but with Jennifer we have some kind of  
connection,'' said Graf. ``I think she has so much talent and I 
like her as a person.''

	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Belarussian Dmitri Dashinski  
overcame tricky winds Sunday to win the first World Cup aerials 
contest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqui Cooper of Australia, the current world champion, won her  
second in a row for the women. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds delayed the start of the final day of the Sprint  
Shootout more than two hours. The final jumpers competed as dusk 
approached at Steamboat Ski Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Dashinski, whose best previous finish in three years on the  
World Cup tour was third two years ago at Breckenridge, Colo., 
received 237.08 points from the judges for his two jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Nicolas Fontaine, the two-time World Cup champion who  
won last week, was runner-up (234.16). 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't start so fast but I'm on a bit of a roll for  
these first two contests,'' Fontaine said. ``I want to keep it 
going next week at Lake Tahoe because my goal this season is to win 
the overall Grand Prix and now two podiums give me a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Eric Bergoust of Missoula, Mont., finished  
third with 230.55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little too high on my second jump,'' Bergoust said.  
``We got used to a head wind in practice and then it stopped (for 
the competition) and that messes with your confidence a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's contest, Cooper won received 186.36 points and  
Canadian Veronica Brenner was second with 177.06. Norway's Hilde 
Lid completed the podium, receiving 170.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic and World Cup champion Nikki Stone of Westborough,  
Mass., was fourth after spending a mostly sleepless night with 
stomach problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know whether I'd be able to jump, but I felt OK this  
morning,'' Stone said. ``I was just weak, so I'm pleased just to be 
able to compete and finish as high as fourth.''

<HEADLINE> Poll on King Assassination Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Only about one in eight Americans believe James  
Earl Ray was solely responsible for the assassination of the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., according to a poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone survey by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found  
that while 12 percent believe Ray alone was to blame for the civil 
rights leader's death, 46 percent suspect that Ray was aided by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly one-quarter of the respondents believe that people other  
than Ray were responsible for the 1968 murder. About one-fifth of 
the respondents said they didn't know who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to killing King, but recanted within  
days. He maintained his innocence until his death last year at age 
70 while serving a 99-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 818 Southern residents and 394 non-Southerners was  
conducted from Sept. 23 to Nov. 15, and has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 5 percentage points. Generally, there was little 
difference in the responses given by Southerners and 
non-Southerners. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members of the slain civil rights leader believe Ray is  
innocent and supported his efforts in recent years to obtain the 
trial that he circumvented with his plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy that other people share our conclusions that  
there were others involved,'' said Dexter Scott King, son of the 
slain civil rights leader. ``It's encouraging because... there was 
never a full-blown trial to get to the bottom of everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kings' instigation, the Justice Department opened a  
limited probe last year to investigate some aspects of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that a majority of respondents -- 55 percent --  
believe no further investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to stop dredging all this stuff up,'' said poll  
respondent Amy Cecil, 49, a nursing home employee from Lexington, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 35 percent of poll respondents and 50 percent of black  
respondents said they would like to see more federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many questions,'' said Beverly Niemzak, 40, a  
homemaker in Gadsden, Ala. ``I don't know that the investigation 
was ever taken far enough. ...There are too many things that just 
shout that it wasn't done the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks in particular are likely to believe people other than Ray  
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South, 42 percent of blacks said they believed Ray was  
not involved in the slaying. Outside the South, 46 percent of 
blacks believed Ray was innocent of the crime.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Economy Mired in Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Despite mild improvements Japan's economy remains  
mired in a prolonged slump, the government said Tuesday in a 
closely watched monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	While items such as consumer spending for certain items and the  
number of bankruptcies have shown improvement, employment and 
corporate capital investment deteriorated, leaving the overall 
state of the economy ``very severe,'' the Economic Planning Agency 
said in its December report. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's assessment was unchanged from the previous month.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan is stuck in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden financial institutions scale back on lending, starving 
companies of cash. Unemployment is at a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the yen's recent sharp rise against the dollar  
and the surge in long-term Japanese interest rates last month 
contributed to uncertainties about the outlook for the overall 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are starting to see several scattered signs of improvement,  
but we still can't say they are starting a bigger trend,'' said 
Takashi Omori, director of the national economic division at the 
agency's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment for employment was downgraded, with the agency  
saying the employment situation is ``getting even more severe.'' 
The jobless rate hit an all-time high of 4.4 percent in November, 
the latest month for which statistics were available. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's overall assessment for personal consumption as  
``sluggish overall'' was unchanged from last month. It said that 
category was weighed down by falling wages, adding that 
``consumers' purse strings remain tightened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it said demand for certain ``reasonably priced'' items, such  
as home appliances and mini-vehicles, has stopped declining. 
Bankruptcies, which had been at record highs, also declined in 
November, it said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares Annual Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conceding that families with only one  
breadwinner need tax relief too, President Clinton is proposing a 
credit to offset costs borne by parents who choose to stay home and 
care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget proposal for fiscal 2000 will include a tax  
credit of up to $500 per child age 1 or younger, according to a 
White House official who spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity. It 
is expected to cost $1.3 billion over five years, allowing for an 
average tax credit of $178, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to outline the proposal in his State of the  
Union address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks a  
total of $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and 
middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president put forth a $22 billion child care  
package that was tied to revenue from the proposed tobacco 
settlement. But the proposal went nowhere because Republicans said 
it failed to address parents who do not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	With this plan, the White House hopes to deflate that argument  
and give GOP leaders what amounts to a political dare. 
</P>
<P>
	The child care package is the latest policy item to be previewed  
from Clinton's speech. Others have included plans to reduce 
violence against children, improve military readiness and food 
safety and meet Americans' long-term health care needs. But the 
White House has revealed little about how the president would 
ensure that Social Security remains solvent as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	In yet another proposal expected to be in the speech, Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala told The Washington Post in 
an interview in today's editions that Clinton will call for $1 
billion over five years to improve health care for many of the 
nation's 32 million uninsured adults. The money would be used to 
encourage community clinics and hospitals to work together to keep 
track of patients and make sure they get needed treatment. The 
administration has now made health proposals that would cost about 
$10 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said today the president also plans to  
propose restructuring $20 billion in federal education money to 
require school districts to meet standards such as ending social 
promotions, better informing parents of school performance, 
enhancing teacher training and improving classroom discipline. If 
they do not, they could risk losing some or all their federal 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spent much of Sunday practicing his delivery of the  
State of the Union address. He rehearsed into the night, testing 
and retesting themes that are likely to resonate with members of 
Congress and the 70 million to 80 million Americans expected to 
watch on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The president donned a suit jacket and tie and rehearsed before  
about 20 aides, who tried to listen with the ears of lawmakers who 
voted to impeach him so the White House can try to anticipate 
reactions that can either help or hurt the president. ``The dynamic 
in the room matters,'' one senior official said privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stood at a podium, his remarks queued on prompting  
devices; nearby were two computer terminals for making revisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're beyond drafts now,'' said White House spokesman Joe  
Lockhart. ``There were three or four real drafts, and there were 
considerable changes from draft to draft. They're in the stage now 
that they're just throwing out pages and writing in the margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Sunday television talk shows, some lawmakers renewed a  
plea for Clinton to skip the speech, noting they won't find it easy 
to segue from trying his impeachment case in the Senate chamber a 
few hours earlier. Still, they said they planned to be on hand to 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly, I'd rather go to the dentist. But I intend to  
go,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``I'm 
going to applaud. I'm going to be respectful. Despite all the 
political rhetoric, I don't hate Bill Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter Sunday, Republican leaders told the president they  
will be listening closely to what he says about tax cuts, defense 
spending, expanding local control over education dollars and 
overhauling Social Security ``without tax increases or benefit 
cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., invited Clinton to submit a Social Security 
proposal before March 1, the date they said they have scheduled a 
joint House-Senate committee meeting to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although your presentation of the traditional State of the  
Union address will occur this year under extraordinary 
circumstances, we should not permit those circumstances to distract 
us from the nation's legislative agenda,'' Lott and Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed child care credit would benefit an estimated 1.7  
million families. That would mean a family earning $30,000 per year 
with one working parent would be able to claim $500 in child care 
expenses, rather than the $250 they are allowed under current law. 
The amount of the credit declines as family income increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration official declined to reveal how the tax  
credit would be funded, other than to say it would be financed 
through ``a host of options'' being exercised in Clinton's budget 
and would not be tied to a tobacco tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's tax credit for stay-at-home parents is patterned after  
one offered last year by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., the 
official said. The rest of the $18 billion package incorporates 
elements of a proposal by Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and John 
Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chafee-Hatch bill called for $15 billion to $16 billion over  
five years, and would have expanded the dependent-care tax credit 
for stay-at-home parents up to $900 per year per family.

<HEADLINE> Heart-Burning Operation Found Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An operation in which doctors burn away heart  
tissue to try to eliminate heart rhythm disturbances almost always 
succeeds and has low risks, researchers reported today in the 
biggest study ever on the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, the researchers said, should encourage doctors to  
consider radiofrequency catheter ablation over drugs when treating 
patients with certain irregular heart rhythms, including a rapid 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This procedure has clearly moved into a front-line therapy of  
choice,'' said Dr. Eric Prystowsky of the Indiana Heart Institute 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in today's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheter ablation was introduced about 10 years ago and has  
grown rapidly, with thousands now performed every year. The 
irregular heart rhythms treated by catheter ablation are usually 
not life-threatening but cause palpitations that can frighten 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheters are threaded through blood vessels from the groin or  
an arm or leg into the heart and used to burn away tissue 
containing nerve pathways that cause the heart to misfire. The 
catheter emits radio frequencies so strong that it can destroy 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers looked at 1,050 patients at 18 hospitals who  
underwent a catheter ablation. 
</P>
<P>
	The irregular rhythm, or arrhythmia, disappeared in about 95  
percent of the patients. A few patients needed repeated treatment, 
and 3 percent developed major complications, including three who 
died within a month of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said there was a 1 percent risk that patients  
would eventually require a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who fare poorly after surgery ``generally have the most  
heart disease. Some of them are going to die, period,'' Prystowsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery generally costs $10,000 to $12,000 and up, and it's  
usually covered by insurance, although insurers frequently require 
that drugs be tried first. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies of catheter ablation tended to focus on  
individual, elite hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are numbers we can hang our hats on and will help us  
when we discuss options using this procedure rather than drug 
therapy,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Hugh Calkins of Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth Ellenbogen, director of cardiac electrophysiology at  
the Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, 
said the findings seemed to confirm that the technique is 
relatively safe and is a ``very effective alternative to lifelong 
drug therapy.''

<HEADLINE>  Knicks To Acquire Latrell Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the NBA's baddest boys may be heading to  
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Latrell Sprewell, whose attack on his coach last season led to  
one of the harshest penalties in league history, is expected to be 
traded to the Knicks as soon as the lockout ends, two league 
sources told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks apparently emerged the winning bidder after Golden  
State Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean told all interested 
teams to make their best offers by 4 p.m. EST Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear who the Knicks would send to the  
Warriors. New York was believed to be offering forward Chris Mills 
and guard Chris Childs, with Golden State general manager Garry St. 
Jean asking for John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would work under salary cap guidelines if any two of  
the three Knicks were packaged together. Sprewell was to make $8.3 
million this season, while Childs makes $3.64 million, Mills makes 
$3.6 million and Starks makes $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two NBA sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
Knicks beat out the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat in the bidding 
for the three-time All-Star, one of the most talented shooting 
guards in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks, Sprewell would play alongside the Knicks' other  
shooting guard, Allan Houston, in a three-guard formation much like 
New York used for most of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders in the Sprewell sweepstakes, and the AP learned that a 
complicated four-team trade involving Golden State, Miami, 
Cleveland and Boston also was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along with Bimbo Coles and  
Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State getting Brent Barry, Dan 
Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have received Jamal Mashburn 
and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would have received Paul Pierce 
and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the league's most notorious choke artist -- as Sprewell  
has come to be known for obvious reasons -- will be playing in the 
harsh spotlight of the nation's media capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has averaged 20.1 points in his six-year career,  
including a career-high 24.2 points in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for one year and had his contract terminated by  
the Warriors for his attack on coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 
1997, although an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 68 games and 
reinstated the final two years of his contract after a hearing last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has not played since the incident, and spent most of  
the summer under house arrest after pleading no contest to a 
reckless driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will make $9 million in the 1999-2000 season, but more  
importantly will elevate the Knicks to the status of top Eastern 
Conference contender for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	No deals can be finalized until the lockout settlement is put  
into writing, which won't happen until Tuesday night at the 
earliest. If the deal is finalized Tuesday night, trades and free 
agent signings will begin Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Upset at Inaction on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The meeting was called to talk about  
the Petr Korda drug controversy. But when no one talked about it, 
Patrick Rafter walked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open champion left a players meeting Sunday night after  
many of his peers avoided talking about Korda, who escaped a ban 
after testing positive to the steroid nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's probably killing the sport,'' Rafter said Monday.  
``If someone gets tested in any other sport and they get found 
positive, they are out straight away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the case in tennis and I think that should be the  
case, unless Petr has got a bloody good explanation, and we didn't 
hear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda has cited special circumstances but has not elaborated,  
triggering a player backlash and demands the Czech explain himself 
or be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision of the International Tennis Federation's  
independent appeals committee is being appealed to the Swiss-based 
Court of Arbitration for Sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter said he supported American Jim Courier's stand at the  
meeting. Courier has been one of the most outspoken critics on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I walked out early,'' Rafter said. ``They were avoiding it all  
the time, so I just didn't want to stick around for it any 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter, a back-to-back U.S. Open winner, said he wanted to hide  
after losing in the first round of the Adidas International in 
Sydney and in the second round of the AAPT championships in 
Adelaide. 
</P>
<P>
	But he bounced back to defeat Germany's Oliver Gross 6-2, 6-4,  
6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good to be on the score board,'' Rafter said. ``Just  
winning the match is a great feeling, getting back in the locker 
room having a smile on your face for a change.''

<HEADLINE> Format Aims To Give Track Leg Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In an attempt to lift track and field from the  
doldrums in the United States, the head of the sport's national 
body has devised a program aimed at giving American athletes more 
money and television exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Masback, chief executive officer of USA Track &AMP; Field  
since July 1997, said Monday his organization has signed several 
prominent athletes to compete in domestic meets that would provide 
them with ``meaningful appearances for competition and 
opportunities to make money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masback, speaking before the New York Track Writers, said there  
would be four indoor meets next month, including the USA 
Championships, and six outdoor meets during May and June, including 
the championships, for American athletes to showcase their talents 
in televised events. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six (outdoor) meets within an eight- or nine-week period is  
critical for our development,'' Masback said, without disclosing 
which meets would be in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Masback said USATF was working with meet directors to ensure  
that top athletes compete. The athletes will make promotional 
appearances before meets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a matter of the athletes being willing to run in this  
country,'' Masback said. ``And it's a matter of being given the 
opportunity to run here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national TV series will begin with the Feb. 5 Millrose Games  
at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's premier runners, 1996 Olympic 400-meter  
hurdles champion Derrick Adkins and 1998 U.S. indoor and outdoor 
800-meter champion Mark Everett, spoke Monday of the plight of U.S. 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Both said they did not have shoe contracts, Adkins having lost  
his at the end of 1997 and Everett without one since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Masback pointed out that USATF recently signed two new sponsors,  
one to support its elite programs and one to aid its youth 
development. He said there would be more sponsor announcements the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are attracted to us because we are the sport (the most  
highly watched during the Summer Olympics) and because of the 
personalities in the sport,'' Masback said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the sport's top two personalities -- Michael Johnson and  
Marion Jones -- are skipping the indoor season, Masback noted many 
other stars will compete against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	They include Maurice Greene and Jon Drummond at 60 meters, Suzy  
Hamilton and Regina Jacobs in the women's mile, Joetta Clark and 
Meredith Valmon in the women's 800 and Mark Crear and Reggie Torian 
in the 60 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The athletes are not hesitating to match up, which has long  
been a complaint of the sport,'' Masback said. ``Someone competing 
in a vacuum doesn't help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that Adkins, Everett and 400-meter specialists Tyree  
Washington and Milton Campbell would run the 500 meters at the 
Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an odd distance, but it doesn't matter,'' Masback said.  
``There's no form chart for 500 meters, so anyone can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Americans still are among the best teams in the world,  
the absence of greats like Carl Lewis, who retired in 1997, and 
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who completed her career last year, has posed 
a big problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some incredible superstars,'' Masback said, ``but  
time is an enemy. We have to replace them. We need stars to 
emerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masback said that will happen with more meets and TV exposure.  
He was dismayed track and field did not capitalize on its success 
after the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no organized follow-up to Atlanta,'' he said.  
``Gymnastics, they had a tour. So the response (to track) was 
nothing but a negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masback wants to draw on his sport's ``outstanding  
personalities, outstanding athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact we've made some small progress is encouraging,'' he  
said. ``The support we've gotten from sponsors makes me believe 
we'll make more progress in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to give the kids the opportunities to realize their  
dreams.''

<HEADLINE> Busy Day for Justice Rehnquist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist may pull  
off a unique triple-header Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice is scheduled to preside over the Supreme Court  
in the morning as it issues orders and hears arguments in two 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, he crosses the street to oversee the day's  
proceedings in President Clinton's impeachment trial in the 
Capitol's Senate chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening, Rehnquist can complete the triple-header by  
attending Clinton's annual State of the Union address before a 
joint session of Congress in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court justices traditionally sit on the front row in  
their judicial robes, remaining silent as various members of 
Congress interrupt the president's speech with applause or cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all of the justices attend every time, and it was  
possible Rehnquist would stay away to avoid any appearance of a 
conflict because of his role in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, an amateur artist, once skipped the president's  
address to attend the first night of an adult-education painting 
class in suburban Arlington County. That happened in 1984, two 
years before he was elevated to chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg declined comment Monday on  
whether the chief justice planned to attend the president's 
address. The court typically does not announce in advance which 
justices will attend a State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other chief justice to preside over a presidential  
impeachment trial was Chief Justice Salmon Chase, who oversaw the 
1868 trial in which President Andrew Johnson was acquitted by one 
vote. Presidents sent their State of the Union messages to Congress 
in written form at that time, and Johnson delivered his message 
months before the trial.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Pledges To Respect Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio promised Monday not  
to mess up a Thailand beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor's pledge came in response to environmentalists who say  
the sets being constructed on Phi Phi Le for the film star's latest 
movie, ``The Beach,'' are harming the island national park in the 
Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists are worried about the planting of  
non-native coconut trees and the smoothing over of sand dunes on 
Maya Beach, and have tried to get the courts to halt the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preservation of the environment has always been of utmost  
concern to me, and I would never be part of any project that did 
anything to harm nature,'' DiCaprio said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen extraordinary measures being taken to protect the  
island. And I pledge to remain vigilant and tolerate nothing less 
than these maximum efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star said he was assured the island would be returned to its  
natural state after the shooting.

<HEADLINE>  Elway Got His Groove Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- This is the story of how John Elway got his groove  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver was behind 10-0 to the New York Jets in what was almost  
certainly his last game at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway brought the Broncos to the line of scrimmage with 12  
minutes left in the third quarter. He saw the receiver who was 
supposed to be on his right lined up on his left. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	Being John Elway, naturally, he turned it into the game-breaking  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway made eye contact with Rod Smith and somehow got this  
message across: Run a crossing pattern instead of a post. Then, he 
yelled ``post'' at Ed McCaffrey, loud enough so that the Jets 
linemen, if not the defensive backs, had some idea of what was in 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	Fat lot of good that did. After getting the safeties to bite on  
a play-action fake, Elway hooked up with McCaffrey racing down the 
middle for 47 yards, setting up the first of four straight, 
lightning-fast scoring drives that sent the Broncos to a 23-10 win 
in the AFC Championship and on to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're bright guys,'' Elway said of his receiving tandem,  
``even though they came out of the huddle the wrong way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow you knew it would all work out. Somehow you knew he was  
not going to leave this place a loser. Not for the last time. Not 
without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Elway.  
</P>
<P>
	After wrestling with his emotions and questions about retirement  
all week, then being buffeted by swirling winds and the Jets' 
defense for a half, he turned as tough as the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the comeback nor the stats were vintage Elway -- the  
first came way too early, the second were not worthy of a passer 
who has established himself as perhaps the NFL's best during the 
last 16 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end, retirement was still a question and not a  
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main focus is to finish this year,'' Elway said, ``before l  
figure out the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judged by deed instead of word, he has most likely played his  
last game in Denver. He took a victory lap at the end of this one, 
rare for a player who treats praise the same way he does defensive 
lineman -- by scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of unusual for him,'' Broncos coach Mike Shanahan  
said. ``I had to encourage him to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway's next victory lap -- if there is one -- will take place in  
Miami, with the Atlanta Falcons as unwilling celebrants. And none 
of them will be as unwilling as their coach Dan Reeves. The same 
Dan Reeves who used to coach in Denver and fired Shanahan as his 
offensive coordinator because, Reeves said, Shanahan and Elway were 
usurping his authority behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, neither said anything even mildly critical that would  
find its way back to Reeves -- particularly on this day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times,'' Shanahan said, ``we were best friends.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football coach,'' Elway said.  
</P>
<P>
	A moment later, s x1/2dne asked Elway whether he hoped this would  
be the last time the Reeves-revenge angle is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't wish for things that are not going to happen,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	All things considered, though, the questions could have been  
worse N 
</P>
<P>
	Much worse.  
</P>
<P>
	As in last ye!r's Super Bowl, Elway had sentiment going for him  
at the start and not much else. He was 0-for-his-first five throws. 
His receivers were dropping balls and the Jets defenders were

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Betty Evelyn Box, one of the most successful  
producers of British films in the post-World War II era, died 
Friday. She was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Box produced such hits as ``Doctor in the House,''  
``Miranda,'' ``Conspiracy of Hearts,'' and the Huggett family 
films. Most of her films were directed by Ralph Thomas, with whom 
she had a successful partnership for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Box was part of a film dynasty. Her older brother Sydney Box  
and his wife, Muriel, were a noted screenwriter-director-producer 
team. In 1949, Betty Box married one of her brother's writers, 
Peter Rogers, who went on to be a producer in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
	She started her career in 1942 by joining the company formed by  
her brother to produce training and propaganda films for the 
British government during World War II.

his son, Robert F. Hagan, who was elected in 1986 from a district 
in Youngstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagan had a varied career: steelwork designer, television show  
host, county commissioner and speechwriter for Sargent Shriver, who 
was the running mate for 1972 presidential candidate George 
McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
	Before going into politics, Hagan was the host of his own TV

	GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) -- Mary McAndrew, a former Associated Press  
newswoman who later spent 18 years at NBC News, died Sunday of 
cancer. She was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	McAndrew worked for The Associated Press' New York bureau for  
three years before joining NBC in 1969. While on loan from the AP 
to NBC News during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in 
Chicago, she broke her leg when police told her to jump over a wall 
in Grant Park. Hours later, she was back at work on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McAndrew, the daughter of former NBC News President William  
R. McAndrew, joined NBC in 1969 and worked as chief of the 
network's Newark, N.J., and Connecticut bureaus. She also worked as 
a reporter for WNBC-TV and WNBC radio in New York and later was 
assignment editor for NBC Radio News. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McAndrew left NBC in 1987 to become New York correspondent  
for the Mutual Broadcasting System. She moved to Chicago in 1988 
and worked as a reporter for WBBM-FM and WGCI-FM and was a producer 
for the Chicago bureau of the now-defunct USA Today on Television. 
</P>
<P>
	She moved into public relations in 1993 and worked for the

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Television comedy writer Harvey Miller, who  
won an Oscar nomination for the screenplay ``Private Benjamin,'' 
died Jan. 8 of heart failure. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's film, television and stage career started in the 1960s.  
On the side, he started writing and selling material to standup 
comics, and to his own astonishment, sold material to comedian Dick 
Gregory, Shecky Greene, Alan King, Sandy Baron and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron brought Miller with him to Hollywood in 1967 to work on  
the television series ``Hey Landlord!'' Through that show, Miller 
met the writer-producer team of Jerry Belson and Garry Marshall, 
building a relationship that would last through several television 
shows over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wrote, produced and directed ``The Odd Couple'' in 1973,  
for which he was nominated for two Emmy Awards. He was also 
nominated for an Emmy for work on ``Love, American Style.'' Other 
television credits include writing and directing ``Taxi'' and ``The 
Tracey Ullman Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the Writers Guild of America honored the hit movie  
``Private Benjamin,'' which starred Goldie Hawn, as the year's best 
screenplay. Miller co-wrote the screenplay, which was later was 
nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Miller opened a one-man show called ``A Cheap Date With  
Harvey Miller'' at the Court Theatre in Los Angeles. The show had 
been scheduled for an off-Broadway run in the spring.

<P>
	Page was instrumental in establishing the company's  
international strategy, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 
1970s he helped shape the plan that led to the creation of the 
Saudi International Bank.

	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- AtHome Corp., a high-speed Internet

	The boards for both companies were meeting Monday evening to  
hammer out last-minute details. If a deal is reached, it could be 
announced in New York Tuesday morning.

	AtHome officials couldn't be reached for comment. AtHome  
spokesman Matt Wolfrom told MSNBC on the Internet, ``I can't 
comment on any rumor or speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, if successful, could give telecommunications giant  
AT&AMP;T Corp. ownership of one of the so-called portal companies that 
serve as entryways onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AtHome is controlled by TeleCommunications Inc., Cox  
Communications and several other investors. TCI is in the process

</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. chief executive Michael Armstrong has stated he wants  
to use AtHome as a conduit for delivering a wide-range of 
communications services, including electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, the Internet's second largest portal company behind  
Yahoo!, would provide AtHome with a wider range of online services 
than it now offers on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's shareholders are expected to own about 30 percent of  
the combined company, which would be known as @Home. 
</P>
<P>
	AtHome has more than 330,000 customers for its service. The deal  
would give it access to Excite's more than 20 million registered 
users and to the company's content-development capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``With AtHome's existing stock valuation, it's been surprising  
that they haven't done more deals,'' analyst Michael Harris of 
Kinetic Strategies Inc. said at the MSNBC Web site. ``They've 
certainly got a huge war chest built up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's stock closed at $67.50 Friday on the New York Stock  
Exchange, while AtHome closed at $102. U.S. stock markets were 
closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

	U.N. Condemns Kosovo Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council today strongly  
condemned the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and urged 
the Yugoslav government to rescind its decision to expel the head 
of the peace mission in the embattled Serb province. The council 
called for an immediate and full investigation of the massacre 
uncovered Saturday and urged all parties to cooperate with the 
international war crimes tribunal. The press statement pointedly 
did not pin the blame for the massacre on any party, and it made no 
mention of Yugoslavia's refusal today to allow the chief U.N. war 
crimes prosecutor to enter the country to investigate the atrocity.

	Clinton Team Prepares Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers today prepared the defense  
presentation for President Clinton's impeachment trial that they 
will begin tomorrow. It will focus on conflicts in testimony, a 
strategy that aims at undercutting House charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice but that also could open the way to 
Republican demands for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The 
White House has been fighting that demand, but now expects 
witnesses, officials said. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Practices Annual Address  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today prepared for  
tomorrow's State of the Union address. The speech will touch on 
education, health care and other initiatives. Clinton will deliver 
his State of the Union address at 9 p.m. EST tomorrow in the House 
chamber. It was in that same chamber one month ago Tuesday that the 
House voted for only the second time in history to impeach the 
president. House Speaker Dennis Hastert sent House members a letter 
telling them to be on good behavior despite ``the discomfort'' 
surrounding the Senate trial.

	Pippen To Be Traded to Rockets

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls will trade Scottie Pippen to  
the Houston Rockets when the NBA lockout ends, The Associated Press 
has learned. The Bulls, who will sign Pippen to a deal worth more 
than $70 million for five years before trading him, will get 
forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick in return. The 
acquisition of Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, won't be 
finalized until the lockout is lifted Wednesday or Thursday.

	U.S. Marks Martin Luther King Day  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- From the pulpit where Martin Luther King Jr. once  
preached, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu today gave thanks 
to King and all American civil rights leaders he credited with 
paving the way for the end of apartheid in his country. People 
across the country celebrated Martin Luther King Day with speeches, 
sermons and volunteerism. Last Friday would have been King's 70th 
birthday. He died April 4, 1968, from an assassin's bullet. 

</P>
<P>
	Test Performed on King Probe Papers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A scientific test has failed to discredit two  
documents a former FBI agent said he took from James Earl Ray's car 
in 1968 after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., 
a federal official said today. A former agent came forward last 
March with the two documents, which he said he had kept hidden for 
30 years after the assassination. The documents both have the name 
``Raul'' written on them. James Earl Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to 
the King assassination but recanted within days. Ray, who died in 
prison in April, claimed after he was sentenced that he was set up 
by a smuggler he only knew as Raul.

	U.S., IMF Back Brazil Currency Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the  
International Monetary Fund cautiously endorsed Brazil's move today 
to allow its currency to float freely. Both the IMF and the White 
House were caught by surprise by Brazil's abrupt decision to 
devalue its currency last week. A senior U.S. official said it was 
a shared judgment that the most important thing in Brazil was the 
pursuit of strong policies, especially carrying through on deficit 
reduction measures, strong anti-inflationary monetary measures and 
continuing structural reforms.

30 minutes of trading. U.S. markets were closed today for the 
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- After 99 days in intensive care, lung  
cancer surgery, pneumonia, and an infection that nearly killed him 
and left him in a coma, Joe DiMaggio went home today. DiMaggio 
entered the hospital Oct. 12 and had surgery two days later to 
remove a cancerous lung tumor. He had a series of setbacks after a 
serious infection set in.

<HEADLINE> NBA's No. 1 Pick Plays in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) -- Michael Olowokandi slaps his aching right  
knee, yells something at no one in particular and walks slowly back 
to the bench, where he tosses a towel on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center had just picked up his fifth and last foul  
with 6:04 left in a home playoff game with Kinder Bologna, which 
went on to lose to crosstown rival TeamSystem. 
</P>
<P>
	His stat line Thursday night was not exactly what the defending  
EuroLeague champion had in mind at the start of January when it 
took advantage of the NBA lockout to sign the No. 1 overall pick in 
June's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's not exactly what the 23-year-old Olowokandi envisioned,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have their set ways, their set plays,'' he said. ``They  
rely on their guards more than their big men. I came here to play, 
not just to be part of the roster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what he will be until at least Feb. 15, when he can get  
out of the contract he signed about 24 hours before the NBA and its 
players struck a deal to end the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder is trying to persuade Olowokandi to stay until April --  
and he won't rule that out -- but he sounds as if he's anxious to 
play for the Los Angeles Clippers, who hold his NBA rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to force anything down anybody's throat,''  
Olowokandi said, ``but usually when you're the top pick, they build 
a team around you. They start from scratch. Over here ... their 
actions, the plays being drawn up, are not indicative of me being a 
top pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder is 2-2 since Olowokandi joined the team four months into  
its season. He's averaging 8.5 points, mostly on put-backs, and 7.3 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather you live or you die by me,'' he said. ``Don't make  
me the savior and not give me the chance to be the savior. It's 
somewhat hard to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just playing in Italy must be hard to take, especially for a  
player who one day could make an impact in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Take the scene Thursday at PalaMalaguti, an arena in suburban  
Bologna that was designed for equestrian shows and seats a shade 
over 8,000 when temporary bleachers are wheeled in. Shrill air 
horns, constant whistling and a five-man brass band in the stands 
made it feel more like a high school pep rally than a pro 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very different from the NBA. It's more of a soccer crowd,  
but I'm used to that,'' said Olowokandi, who was born in Nigeria 
and raised in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallying in track and field and soccer while living in England,  
Olowokandi never played basketball until his late teens, when he 
had a growth spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to myself, `If I'm going to play this game at a serious  
level, maybe I need to stop messing around with a bunch of English 
kids who are 5 feet tall, and find more of a challenge,''' he said, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	He wound up at Pacific in Stockton, Calif., where his averages  
went from 4.0 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.32 blocks in his first 
season to 22.2, 11.2 and 2.88 in his third and last year. Including 
his stint in Italy, he has played 80 games of organized basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi will have to skip Clippers training camp and miss the  
beginning of the season, set for the first week of February. His 
game and conditioning suffered during the lockout, he acknowledged, 
and the pounding since he started playing in Italy has aggravated 
tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely no regrets. I did what I had to do,'' he  
said, referring to his decision to play in Italy. ``It looked like 
the season would be canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three NBA players also moved to Europe right before the lockout  
was resolved -- Vlade Divac (Charlotte), Arvydas Sabonis (Portland) 
and Vinny Del Negro (San Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
	Del Negro joined TeamSystem and had an up-close look at  
Olowokandi. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I've seen, it looks like he has good hands for a big  
man. He just needs time,'' said Del Negro, who can return to the 
NBA on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Olowokandi, who'll earn about $600,000 for six weeks' work if he  
leaves in February, does not lack confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to get some games under my belt, a full (NBA) season  
under my belt, and then sit down with the coaches and work out a 
plan,'' he said. ``And I'll carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually had a dream last night that we won the European  
championship,'' he added. ``We were celebrating. You know, if the 
NBA lockout hadn't ended, I'd be one of the few players around 
competing for a championship.''

<HEADLINE> Europe, Asia Markets Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Receding worries about Brazil's economic problems  
touched off a global rally in stock markets Monday as the country's 
central bank announced it would continue to float Brazil's 
currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The steepest gains took place in Europe, with London's blue-chip  
Financial Times Stock Exchange index up 3.1 percent, or 182.9 
points, to 6,123.9. However, other world markets were still 
volatile. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still a lot of uncertainty out there and I would not  
advise people to be investing in shares right now. These gains are 
simply not sustainable,'' said Michael Derks, senior market 
strategist for Nomura Securities in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets Wednesday when  
it devalued its currency by 8 percent, sparking fears that if the 
country could succumb to an Asian-style currency crisis. A crisis 
in its economy, the largest in Latin America, could drag down other 
countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks made strong gains across Europe. Frankfurt's DAX index  
rose 1.8 percent, the Paris CAC 40 index ended 2.4 percent higher, 
Milan's MIBtel index rose 4.6 percent, and Madrid's IBEX-35 index 
was up 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Market-watchers credited the gains to a recovery last week on  
Wall Street and other world stock exchanges following moves by the 
Brazilian government to stabilize its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther  
King Jr. Day holiday. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average 
gained 2.4 percent when it became apparent Brazil's government 
would stop spending its dwindling foreign reserves defending its 
faltering currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian bourses had opened sharply Monday, although many fell back  
by the close of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened up but  
lost much of its steam, finishing up 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index opened sharply higher in Hong Kong. By the  
end of trading, the blue-chip index had soared to a gain of 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Korea Composite Stock Price Index in Seoul closed up by  
1.27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets gained a hefty 4.4 percent in Manila, Singapore's  
Straits Times Index was up 2.7 percent, and New Zealand's NZSE-40 
capital index finished up 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One weak spot was China, where the two stock markets opened  
largely unchanged Monday. Traders said prices could fall because of 
growing numbers of Chinese companies warning of low profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Taiwan also ended lower on profit-taking following two  
sessions of government-led stock fund purchases.

<HEADLINE> Intel Builds Security Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. plans to build computer  
chips that can help scramble data to keep it secret, a move that 
could boost business on the Internet as information and 
transactions become more secure. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Intel's innovation could also conflict with  
restrictions on the export of data scrambling technology, imposed 
by the government to protect the nation from criminals and 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're entering an age where e-commerce transactions will be  
conducted on a global network consisting of a billion connected 
personal computers,'' said Michael Glance, general manager of 
Intel's platform security division. 
</P>
<P>
	However, David Wu, an analyst with the bank ABN Amro Inc., in  
San Francisco, said Intel may face obstacles to selling the 
technology overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These high performance chips are going to get Internet  
commerce more safe,'' he said. ``It helps the overall computer 
industry, but Intel may have to use good, persuasive lobbyists and 
lawyers in Washington to get them accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Data scrambling technology, known as encryption, has mostly been  
the product of software companies, who add it to programs used to 
surf the Internet such as browsers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed limits on export of  
the most powerful encryption technology, fearing it could fall into 
the hands of criminals and terrorists, who would be able to send 
messages to each other that law enforcement authorities won't be 
able to read. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry has long protested the restrictions,  
saying they were hurting business and accomplished little because 
foreign competitors were also selling the technology 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday Intel -- which has about 85 percent of the computer  
chip market -- stepped into the field. It plans to develop computer 
chips that incorporate Intel hardware and leading software security 
tools by RSA Data Security Inc., of San Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel discussed the plans Monday at a security conference in San  
Jose sponsored by RSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Glance, the Intel manager, wouldn't comment on how the company  
plans to get around the export restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which imposes the  
encryption regulations, were unavailable for comment Monday because 
of the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Morales of the high tech research firm International Data  
Corp., said Intel's chips will be part of a growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the market is driven by the Internet, most of the  
equipment is going to have to include this encryption technology,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made some recent moves to relax the  
restrictions on encryption technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In late December, the Commerce Department allowed U.S. companies  
to export technology that uses the so-called 56-bit data encryption 
standard or its equivalent. This standard has an unlocking key with 
72 quadrillion possible combinations, but it isn't the most 
powerful encryption standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also allows more-powerful encryption products to  
be exported by specialized industries such as insurance and health 
care to 46 countries. It also allows sales by U.S. companies to 
their overseas subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the early companies to create hardware with security  
capabilities, Hewlett-Packard Co. announced Monday that it has 
received approval from the Department of Commerce to export its 
hardware-based VerSecure technology to nine additional countries, 
bringing the total to 17 countries representing more than 80 
percent of Internet users worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard's VerSecure program head Doug McGowan said the  
changing status of export laws and policies makes it ``very 
challenging for manufacturers to design strong security into 
exportable products.''

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Reeves Does a Lonely Dance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- After the Atlanta Falcons defeated New  
England 41-10 in early November, Dan Reeves promised to dance the 
``Dirty Bird'' on Peachtree Street if his team made it to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' players did their part Sunday, beating Minnesota 30-27  
in overtime to win the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So Monday morning, on his way to appear on ABC's ``Good Morning  
America,'' Reeves kept his word. The Atlanta coach, who turns 55 
Tuesday, claims he stopped his car along the city's most-famous 
street and performed his version of the Falcons' end-zone 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that helped Atlanta send the game into overtime, wasn't buying 
Reeves' version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a cop out, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Arctic Ozone Loss Could Pose Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are worried that continued ozone  
loss over the Arctic, such as occurred in 1996 and 1997, may allow 
dangerous ultraviolet radiation to reach Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's too soon to declare a definite trend, they say, noting  
that the situation improved a bit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it's considered a pollutant at ground level, ozone in  
the upper atmosphere blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays, which can 
cause sunburn, skin wrinkling, eye damage and even cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to that protective layer was first noticed in the colder  
Antarctic, where circular winds trap air, giving chemicals the 
chance to react with the ozone. Concern that the damage could 
spread prompted the ban on refrigerants and spray propellants that 
can destroy ozone. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chemicals already released remain in the air for years,  
and a significant reduction in the ozone layer over the North Pole 
was recorded in the winters of 1995-96 and 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	This threatens to ``allow the penetration of enhanced UV  
radiation at northern mid-high latitudes,'' warn researchers in the 
latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research, published by 
the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	That potential threat could include heavily populated areas of  
Europe and North America, unlike the relatively small number of 
people endangered by the Antarctic ozone thinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Georg Hansen of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research in  
Tromso, Norway, and Martyn P. Chipperfield of Cambridge University 
in England studied the northern ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, if Arctic (ozone) depletion persists later in  
the year, as in 1997, more UV will penetrate to the surface when 
the sun is higher in the sky in late spring and summer,'' 
Chipperfield said in an interview via electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the possibility that the Arctic may becoming more  
Antarctic-like,'' he said. ``Certainly 1997 was nearer than other 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chipperfield added, ``the winter polar vortex in the  
Arctic is very variable, and last year (1997-98) the vortex was 
warm, weak and there was little ozone loss. It is too soon to 
detect a definite trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern, the researchers said, was the very  
long-lived northern low pressure zone of circular winds, called a 
vortex, located at between eight and 21 miles above the Earth's 
surface. The vortex is a key factor in providing the chemical 
conditions for ozone depletion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Antarctic is usually colder than the Arctic, causing more  
frequent stratospheric clouds of the type that lead to ozone 
depletion within the vortex. In 1996-1997, however, the Arctic 
vortex produced low temperatures and ozone depletion as great as 
that recorded in the Antarctic during the early 1980s, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen and Chipperfield, using data collected from the Norwegian  
island of Andoya, reported that in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, overall 
ozone depletion reached a maximum of 48 percent below the long-term 
average and up to 60 percent at the most affected altitude, 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 1996-1997 vortex lasted exceptionally long, into early  
May, extending the period of reduced ozone levels. This led in turn 
to increased ultraviolet radiation in northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen and Chipperfield also found that in 1997, until the end  
of March, the well-known wintertime chemical action involving 
chlorine in stratospheric clouds was the principal cause of ozone 
depletion. After that, and into early May, further depletion was 
caused by chemical interactions of nitric oxide and nitrogen 
dioxide, which was made possible by the unusual persistence of the 
vortex, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reductions in the northern ozone layer have also been reported  
by scientists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

	MIAMI (AP) -- The Super Bowl may prove to be a super bust for  
South Florida, a new study suggests, contradicting the notion that 
the NFL's premier event generates hundreds of millions of dollars 
for the host city. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at six Super Bowls dating to 1979 -- three in Miami, two  
in Tampa, one in Phoenix -- found no increase in sales revenue over 
previous years without the big game, said Philip Porter, author of 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason may be that the estimated 140,000 fans who attend  
Super Bowl events in tourist-oriented Florida, Arizona or 
California displace the usual visitors from colder regions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be a spike that sticks up like a sore thumb,''  
said Porter, an economics professor at the University of South 
Florida at Tampa. ``It doesn't exist. There is no blip. You don't 
find anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another researcher, Mark Rosentraub, professor of public affairs  
at Indiana University in Indianapolis, said Porter's findings 
appear to hold true for Super Bowls held in warm-weather cities. 
But he said the big game has been a big success for cities that 
would not otherwise draw tourists during the winter, such as 
Pontiac, Mich., in 1982 and Minneapolis in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL, its host committee and tourism officials contend the  
economic benefits will be huge -- as much as $365 million by NFL 
projections -- when the Super Bowl makes its eighth trip to South 
Florida next week. The calculations include direct and indirect 
effects on transportation, meals, lodging, entertainment and other 
retail services. 
</P>
<P>
	A study paid for by the NFL and conducted by  
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP found San Diego County garnered $295 
million from last year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they don't talk about is the publicity value, the fact  
that name is in the media,'' said Jim Steeg, NFL vice president of 
special events. ``For a week, ESPN will show Biscayne Bay in the 
background about 36 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Porter said whatever direct Super Bowl profits are made go  
to large-scale businesses -- airlines, hotels and such retailers as 
Foot Locker. ``The honest local guy who works as the waiter isn't 
getting much richer or even the restaurant owner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two businesses that will be busy during Super Bowl week seem to  
corroborate the study's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't really do the big numbers like everybody thinks --  
maybe there'll be a 10 or 15 percent increase,'' said Steve Sawitz, 
who manages Joe's Stone Crab restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. Fine, vice president of sales for the Doral Golf Resort  
and Spa, said Fox Broadcasting has booked the hotel for the Super 
Bowl. Not that the hotel would have had trouble filling those 
$360-a-night rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, we do well in late January anyway,'' Fine said.  
``This is normally our busiest time of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale  
Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the Super Bowl brings in 
corporate executives scouting for places to hold conventions and 
stockholder meetings. These big spenders can't help but inject 
dollars into the local economy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the kind of spenders that are in town during Super  
Bowl,'' Ms. Grossman said. ``I am not at the least uncomfortable 
with the estimate of a total economic impact of $380 million on 
South Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosentraub said the effect of sports on local economies has long  
been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Porter is right on target,'' said Rosentraub, who  
examined the subject in his book ``Major League Losers.'' Sports 
``has virtually no economic effect. I try to tell everybody to take 
the economics out of it when you talk about teams. It's all 
substitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL uses its Super Bowl economic impact studies to encourage  
cities to build taxpayer-funded stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are being suckered,'' Porter said. ``People who want us to  
do something for them are selling us snake oil.''

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Reeves Does a Lonely Dance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- After the Atlanta Falcons defeated New  
England 41-10 in early November, Dan Reeves promised to dance the 
``Dirty Bird'' on Peachtree Street if his team made it to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' players did their part Sunday, beating Minnesota 30-27  
in overtime to win the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So Monday morning, on his way to appear on ABC's ``Good Morning  
America,'' Reeves kept his word. The Atlanta coach, who turns 55 
Tuesday, claims he stopped his car along the city's most-famous 
street and performed his version of the Falcons' end-zone 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that helped Atlanta send the game into overtime, wasn't buying 
Reeves' version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a cop out, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Revels in Falcons 1st Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Start flapping those arms and jump on the  
bandwagon -- the Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The city awoke Monday with a giant ``Dirty Bird'' hangover,  
celebrating a gritty team that pulled off a stunning upset in the 
din of the Metrodome, conveniently forgetting all those years when 
the Falcons were treated like the crazy uncle that everyone in the 
family tries to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go Braves -- and take the Falcons with you,'' was a popular  
bumper sticker in the 1980s when both teams were at the bottom of 
their respective sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, the Braves have tomahawk-chopped their way to seven  
straight postseason appearances in the 1990s, but it took the NFL's 
winningest coach and a strutting group of has-beens and never-weres 
to take the Falcons to their first championship game after 33 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which defeated Minnesota 30-27 in overtime Sunday for  
the NFC title, will meet the Denver Broncos in the Jan. 31 Super 
Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will begin its preparations on Wednesday, which left a  
couple of days to savor the moment. Actually, the party began 
Sunday night when the team arrived at Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport and was greeted by more than 5,000 people. 
Nary a mention was made of those three years when the team failed 
to sell out a home game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like you were in a dream world,'' said linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons for a dozen, mostly 
losing seasons. ``You always talk about being in a Super Bowl and 
now we've done it. We earned the right to go to Miami. It means a 
lot when it all sinks in, the way everything fell together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another 4,000 or so revelers jammed the team's suburban training  
complex, creating a rush hour-like traffic jam in the middle of the 
night. The scene was surreal when the players appeared on a 
second-floor balcony, saluting the crowd that had spilled onto the 
practice field below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely nuts,'' Tuggle said. ``It was like a rock  
concert in Suwanee, Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, who underwent heart bypass surgery just five  
weeks ago, endured a whirlwind schedule Monday. After getting only 
4 1/2 hours of sleep, he appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' 
stopped by Piedmont Hospital for a routine check-up, and held his 
usual post-game news conference in Suwanee. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there was nothing routine or usual about this day.  
The Falcons have never played at this time of year, suffering 
through 25 losing seasons in their first 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	After Reeves was hired as coach, the Falcons lost seven of their  
first eight games in 1997. Since then, they have won 22 of 26 -- 
doubling the franchise's playoff victories from two to four in the 
span of eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible when you think about it,'' Reeves said,  
``coming from 1-7 halfway through you first year to be in the Super 
Bowl in the second year. I can't say enough about our players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the focus will be on Reeves at this Super Bowl.  
He'll be facing the team he coached for 12 years and took to three 
title games. He'll also be facing the coach he fired for alleged 
subordination and the quarterback who said playing for Reeves was 
``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who was fired by the Broncos after the 1992 season,  
insisted Monday that he has buried any hard feelings for Mike 
Shanahan and John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't live in the past,'' the Falcons coach said. ``If  
you're going to be a football coach and you preach and teach to the 
players that they should look to the next play and not think about 
the last one, I think you have to go through life the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not one of those people who goes through life being mad at  
people. I can be upset for a while, but I want to be friends after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be a stretch to say Reeves has a close relationship  
with his two ex-cohorts from Denver, but they did have a 
reconciliation of sorts when all three wound up playing golf on the 
same day at Augusta National last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves walked over to a group from Denver, congratulating  
Shanahan and Elway on winning the Super Bowl last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus should be on the football game,'' Reeves said.  
``What's done in the past is done. I can look myself in the mirror 
and say I did what was best for my football team at the time. You 
have to make some tough decisions. I can't change them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, there are new debts to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said he fulfilled his promise to perform the ``Dirty  
Bird'' dance in downtown Atlanta, stopping his car on Peachtree 
Street in the pre-dawn hours and flapping his arms with no one 
around. His players said that's not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves also chuckled at the NFL, which clearly expected  
Minnesota to make the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, while meeting with two league officials about the  
schedule of events in Miami, Reeves noticed the itinerary was 
sprinkled with references to the Vikings. Then, on Monday, the NFL 
faxed him a memo that included another faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they weren't expecting us because it said,  
`Atlanta Falcons, head coach Denny Green,''' Reeves said, grinning 
with satisfaction. ``They had chanced the team from Minnesota 
Vikings, but they forgot to change the head coach.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Letters on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from letters written by constituents to Republican  
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Slade Gorton of Washington: 
</P>
<P>
	To Chafee:  
</P>
<P>
	--''I have voted for you during your last two terms of office and  
am proud to have done so. ... If President Clinton is impeached I 
will not vote for ANY Republican candidates for office for the next 
eight years.'' From Rumford. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Senator Chafee, please be not the 'voice of compromise,' nor  
the 'reasonable, bipartisan solution to this ordeal' that Clinton 
has no right to even ask for. Instead be the FIRST voice in the 
Senate to speak loudly and clearly for equal justice under the 
law.'' From a Tiverton independent voter. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I am sickened by President Clinton's behavior. However, I am  
even more deeply offended by the president's impeachment.'' From 
Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	--''It may hurt us for a while but that is not what the law is  
about. It hurts children when their parents are put in jail for 
doing wrong. It also hurts them when they are taken out of the home 
because of neglect or abuse. ... But we do what is right even if 
people get hurt because the person who commits a crime has to be 
punished.'' From a former Clinton supporter in Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
	To Gorton:  
</P>
<P>
	--''The point of view that all politicians are liars and  
Washington would be a ghost town if all liars were removed is an 
exaggeration (I hope). Or that all men are adulterous, fallible to 
a few trailer camp tramps or stalkers.'' From Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Let's cut our losses and lick our national wounds. Let's get  
on with the business of our lives and our nation's business.'' From 
Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I listened to all the folderol (some) and it didn't alter my  
opinion of how well he has taken care of governmental affairs. My 
husband and I are seniors, Episcopalian. ... We think he should be 
censured -- with a firm smack on those hands that fondled that 
filthy (expletive). ... Sorry to be so blunt.'' From Port Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--''For the good of our children, and our country, we need to  
show severe punishment for his serious misdeeds.'' From Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Six Players in Arbitration Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Six more players in salary arbitration,  
including Rick Helling and Hideo Nomo, agreed to contracts Monday 
on the eve of the annual exchange of figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who won 20 games to tie Roger Clemens and David Cone  
for the American League lead, agreed to a $10.5 million, three-year 
contract with the Texas Rangers, a steep increase from his $216,500 
salary last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, traded to the New York Mets by Los Angeles last June, got  
a one-year deal worth $2,925,000, a raise of $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also settling Monday were St. Louis reliever Ricky Bottalico  
($2.25 million), Boston outfielder Damon Buford ($1.1 million), 
Chicago White Sox right-hander Bill Simas ($1.1 million) and 
Anaheim right-hander Mark Petkovsek ($800,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 62 players who filed for arbitration Friday, 53 were  
still set to exchange figures with their teams Tuesday. The top 
names were Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera of the New 
York Yankees; Aaron Sele of the Rangers; Carlos Delgado of the 
Toronto Blue Jays and Charles Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, according to several player and management sources, was  
contemplating asking for $9 million or more. The record asking 
price of $9 million was set last year by New York Yankees 
outfielder Bernie Williams, who settled at $8.25 million and agreed 
after the season to an $87.5 million, seven-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, a first baseman, made $2.4 million last year, when he  
hit .292 with 38 homers and 115 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who don't settle will be scheduled for arbitration  
hearings during the first three weeks of February, but fewer than 
10 cases are expected to go to hearings. This year, 75 percent of 
the cases will be scheduled before three-man panels rather than 
individual arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati pitcher Jason Bere ($1.2 million) settled immediately  
after filing Friday. Settling over the weekend were San Diego 
right-hander Dan Miceli ($4.6 million for three years) and Houston 
right-hander Jose Lima ($1.95 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who went 20-7 with a 4.41 ERA in 33 starts, will make  
$2.25 million in 1999, $3.75 million in 2000, and $4.5 million in 
2001. He has less than three years of major league service but 
qualified as a ``Super Two,'' one of the dozen of so players each 
year with 2-3 years of service who became eligible under the 1990 
lockout settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I felt it was a good deal and we're happy with the  
confidence the Rangers showed in us for the long term,'' Helling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year, was 4-5 with a 5.04 ERA  
for the Mets and 6-12 with a 4.92 ERA overall. He struck out 167 
and walked 94 in 157 1-3 innings, allowing 130 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for Hideo to have a comeback year,'' Mets  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``His stuff was great last 
season. If he can cut down on his walks, which we think he can, 
there is no doubt in my mind he can again become one of the top 
starting pitchers in the National League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among free agents, Toronto agreed to a $500,000, one-year  
contract with second baseman Joey Cora and a one-year deal with 
third baseman Willie Greene.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Remains Atop AP Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee remained an overwhelming choice as the top team in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll today, breaking a tie with 
Louisiana Tech to become the overall leader in No. 1 rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols received 40 of 41 first-place votes from a media  
panel to lead a top 16 that was virtually unchanged from last week. 
This is the second straight week Tennessee (15-1) has led the poll 
and the 84th time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	There was considerable change in the lower half of the Top 25  
and two teams appeared for the first time this season: No. 24 
Tulane and No. 25 Oregon. Kansas and Boston College dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which regained the No. 1 spot last week after its big  
win at Connecticut, ran its winning streak to 14 with decisive 
victories over Georgia and Kentucky. The Vols received 1,024 points 
in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The only changes in the next 15 places were No. 4 Louisiana Tech  
and No. 5 Georgia trading places and a similar flip-flop involving 
No. 11 Duke and No. 12 Old Dominion. Only two teams in that group 
lost during the past week and both were beaten by higher ranked 
teams: Georgia by Tennessee, and Clemson by Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut was second with 976 points, Purdue third with 947  
and Louisiana Tech fourth with 881. Purdue, which handed Tennessee 
its only loss, received the remaining first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia bounced back from its loss at Tennessee to beat Auburn,  
so the Lady Bulldogs dropped just one spot. Texas Tech, North 
Carolina, Colorado State, Notre Dame and UCLA completed the Top 
Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Old Dominion headed the second 10 and were followed by  
Virginia Tech, Iowa State, Rutgers and Clemson. With Georgia 
losing, Virginia Tech (16-0) is the nation's only unbeaten Division 
I team. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State jumped three places to 17th after winning three games  
in the past week, Alabama was 18th, Virginia 19th and Auburn 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were Florida, Ohio State, Nebraska, Tulane and  
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane (14-2) was ranked for seven weeks last season, making its  
final appearance the week of Jan. 6. The Green Wave's most 
impressive victory recently was a 98-51 rout of Memphis, which was 
ranked 24th at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon (14-3) has won nine of its last 10 -- the loss was by four  
points at UCLA -- to make the Top 25 for the first time since Jan. 
24, 1995. After being ranked the entire 1980-81 and 1981-82 
seasons, the Ducks appeared in the poll only seven times over the 
next 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (13-5), which had been ranked all season, fell out after  
a 20-point loss to Nebraska. Boston College (13-3), which made the 
poll for the first time ever two weeks ago, has lost twice since 
all-Big East guard Cal Bouchard was sidelined by a torn knee 
ligament.

<HEADLINE> Congress Resuming Legislative Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to the Capitol in force  
Tuesday with its leaders eager to begin focusing on Social 
Security, education and other issues of concern to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton continues,  
top Republicans are intent on showing that they are not obsessed 
with it. As a result, many House and Senate committees plan full 
slates of hearings beginning this week -- and are trumpeting them to 
make sure their activity is noticed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am committed to moving forward with the people's business,''  
said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., as he 
announced his schedule for 11 hearings on taxes, Social Security 
and other topics. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, House Speaker Dennis Hastert moved on Monday to  
pressure Clinton on Social Security. He announced he would reserve 
H.R.1, the House's first bill of the new Congress, for the 
president's legislation on strengthening the pension program for 
the elderly and disabled. Clinton has called for buttressing the 
program for the impending retirement of baby boomers, but has 
provided no details on how he would do it and is not expected to 
reveal any soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the 106th Congress' legislative start will be  
leisurely, as is traditional for the first weeks of a new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The House meets Tuesday, but mainly so it can be around for  
Clinton's State of the Union address in the evening. It will then 
recess until Feb. 2, although many committees will remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will spend Tuesday morning with leaders of each party  
introducing their first five bills of the new Congress, a biennial 
ritual aimed at publicizing their top issues. The GOP's top bills 
will address Social Security, education, tax cuts, crime and drugs 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	After lunch, senators will resume their more familiar mode of  
late, hearing the Clinton impeachment trial. Topping off what will 
unavoidably be a peculiar day, those same senators will then troop 
across the Capitol after dinner to hear the president's address. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate's legislative schedule is uncertain after that,  
mainly because of the unsure timing of the impeachment trial. It is 
possible that the Senate will meet for legislative business on 
Wednesday and Friday mornings, though little more than speeches are 
likely because there are no bills ready for passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee was planning almost daily  
hearings in preparation for its work later this year on spending 
bills for 2000. GOP leaders want to get those bills finished as 
early as possible, in hopes of avoiding a replay of last fall's 
mammoth $520 billion spending measure, which handed Clinton several 
victories just before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels planning early hearings include the House Ways and  
Means Committee, at which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
will testify on economic issues; the House's renamed Armed Services 
Committee, which will hear from the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will consider 
efforts to impose new controls on health-maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the early activity, lawmakers are already displaying their  
taste for legislative combat over high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP senators said Friday that they would reintroduce their bill  
to give patients of HMOs more rights, such as the setting up of 
external review boards to handle complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling how Democrats killed a similar Republican measure last  
year, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., pointedly said, 
``It is our hope that the Democrats will join us in a bipartisan 
effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, Democratic leaders retorted with a news  
conference of their own, and like last year accused Republicans of 
producing a bill that doesn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can absolutely guarantee we'll have an opportunity to  
protect all people involved in HMOs, not just the small fraction 
the Republican bill provides,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Date Rape Drug Suspected in Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROSSE ILE, Mich. (AP) -- A 15-year-old girl died after drinking  
alcohol that police believe was laced with a date rape drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief William Barron said the girl and two others went  
with three boys to an apartment complex Saturday night. Barron said 
two of the girls had drinks, and soon after, the 15-year-old 
started vomiting. She died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her name was not released. The other girl, who turns 15 on  
Tuesday, was in stable condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was being performed on the 15-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
	Barron said investigators believe the girls' drinks had been  
laced with gamma-hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, which is known as a date 
rape drug because it has been used to render women helpless against 
sexual advances. 
</P>
<P>
	It can cause euphoria and, in higher doses, breathing problems,  
seizures, coma and death. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration 
blamed GHB for at least three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were questioning one of the girls' companions.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons' Reeves Does a Lonely Dance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- After the Atlanta Falcons defeated New  
England 41-10 in early November, Dan Reeves promised to dance the 
``Dirty Bird'' on Peachtree Street if his team made it to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' players did their part Sunday, beating Minnesota 30-27  
in overtime to win the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	So Monday morning, on his way to appear on ABC's ``Good Morning  
America,'' Reeves kept his word. The Atlanta coach, who turns 55 
Tuesday, claims he stopped his car along the city's most-famous 
street and performed his version of the Falcons' end-zone 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that helped Atlanta send the game into overtime, wasn't buying 
Reeves' version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a cop out, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Currency Plan Is Backed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the  
International Monetary Fund cautiously endorsed Brazil's move on 
Monday to allow its currency to float freely while stressing the 
critical need for the country to quickly get its budget deficit 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsements were sought by a team of Brazilian finance  
officials led by Finance Minister Pedro Malan who have engaged in a 
nonstop round of talks that started Saturday in an effort to 
explain Brazil's decision to stop trying to keep the value of the 
country's currency, the real, linked to the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to meeting with top staff at the IMF and World Bank,  
Malan held a series of talks with Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers, the administration's point man on the global 
currency crisis, and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	While both the IMF and the Clinton administration were caught by  
surprise by Brazil's abrupt decision to devalue the real last week, 
officials insisted after the talks with Malan that they better 
understood the pressures that forced the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discussions were comprehensive and constructive and  
provided useful clarification of the policy stance of the Brazilian 
authorities,'' IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official said it was a shared judgment that the  
most important thing in Brazil was the pursuit of strong policies, 
especially carrying through on deficit reduction measures, strong 
anti-inflationary monetary measures and continuing structural 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration official, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said Malan had stressed the determination of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso to win approval for promised deficit 
reduction measures in a very complex political environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF and the United States combined forces last fall to  
assemble a $41.5 billion support package for Brazil in hopes of 
preventing that country from falling victim to the same currency 
troubles that have leveled a number of Asian nations and Russia 
beginning in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America, a region that  
accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports. With American 
manufacturers and farmers already reeling from a loss of Asian 
markets, the administration hoped to keep the currency upheavals 
that have pushed 40 percent of the globe into recession from 
striking Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time it appeared that the pre-emptive credit line for  
Brazil would work as global markets stabilized and U.S. stocks, 
which had lost 20 percent of their value after Russia's summer 
collapse, recouped those losses and climbed to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
	But fears of further turbulence resumed last week when foreign  
investors began to dump their Brazilian holdings after Cardoso was 
defeated in a series of efforts to gain political support for his 
deficit reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has already received $9 billion from the IMF package  
announced in November, with another $9 billion scheduled for the 
end of February. 
</P>
<P>
	While Malan told reporters on Saturday it was possible he could  
ask for early release of the second loan installment, he insisted 
at a news conference Monday that Brazil had not sought that. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank said Monday in a statement that it was  
considering accelerating some of its support in the areas of 
assistance to the poor, banking and government reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the $41.5 billion, $18 billion is coming from the IMF, $9  
billion from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank 
and the rest from 20 wealthy nations, including $5 billion from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Both IMF and U.S. officials expressed unhappiness last week  
about the abrupt nature of Brazil's decision to devalue the 
currency. Asked about that criticism, Malan told reporters, ``I can 
assure you that what happened last week is water under the bridge. 
... We are looking ahead instead of looking back.''

<HEADLINE> NAFTA Common Currency Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The launch of a common currency in 11 European  
nations is fueling debate in Canada and Mexico over whether North 
America's three trading partners should adopt a comparable monetary 
union. But don't expect a NAFTA-style euro any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinion among experts is sharply divided, and Canadian and  
Mexican leaders don't appear eager for swift action on what would 
be a politically contentious project. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they were eager, Washington might not be. U.S. Commerce  
Secretary William Daley said Thursday a North American monetary 
union is a ``very long-term'' prospect -- one that might warrant 
serious discussion ``a hundred years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the euro to be a success,'' Daley said of the  
European Union's new currency. ``That will not drive us to some 
other integration, currency-wise, with the countries that are our 
neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Canada's ambassador to Washington, Raymond Chretien, echoed  
the views of many Canadian economists when he said the possibility 
of a single currency ``would have to be looked at'' if the euro 
proves a long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	A common currency could provide welcome stability for Canadian  
and Mexican businesses, which have been buffeted by sharp plunges 
in the values of their national currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But monetary union also would mean at least partial surrender of  
control over budget policies, with decision-making almost certainly 
dominated by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Washington dictating Canadian fiscal policy  
appalls Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a 
nationalist group that lobbied vainly against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	She said monetary union would make it difficult for Canada to  
maintain its social and cultural identity and would give American 
corporations pervasive influence over Canadians' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly our economic policy would be made in New York or  
Los Angeles,'' she said. ``Canada as a sovereign financial economy 
would no longer exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Harris, an economics professor at Simon Fraser  
University near Vancouver, disagreed, saying Canada could accept a 
common currency without ceding any authority over domestic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He doubts Prime Minister Jean Chretien's government is willing  
to push for monetary union soon, but says bankers and business 
executives will likely try to put the issue on the public agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depreciation (of the Canadian dollar) and the emergence of the  
euro are going to rekindle interest,'' Harris said. ``It's not on 
the horizon in the medium term, but if we look over the next decade 
and a half, the idea of a common currency in the Western Hemisphere 
is not out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and the United States are the world's largest trading  
partners, but the relationship has been skewed over the past year 
as the Canadian dollar hovered at an all-time low of around 65 U.S. 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists contend that Canada -- and Mexico as well --  
should establish a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar as a 
possible interim step toward full monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nason, an American who teaches economics at the  
University of Vancouver, calls that idea ``a disaster waiting to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's going to happen, and the markets are going to say,  
`That rate doesn't make any economic sense,''' Nason said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is skeptical that Canadian leaders would endorse any  
moves that gave Washington more say in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada's Finance Ministry becomes a junior agency of the U.S.  
Treasury -- why would those guys want to give up all that power and 
prestige?'' Nason asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government says it has no plans to push for monetary  
union, but the Finance Ministry and Central Bank have been studying 
the pluses and minuses of linking the peso to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	An influential Mexican think tank, the Private Sector Center for  
Economic Studies, has endorsed the concept, saying the country's 
economy would be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
	In both Canada and Mexico, any politicians who promoted monetary  
union would be taking a risk because of widespread unease about 
U.S. domination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elections are fought, won and lost on these kinds of issues,''  
said Raymond Chretien, who is Jean Chretien's nephew. ``But there 
is no question that if the European model is successful, our 
descendants will have to deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Intel Builds Security Protections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp. is teaming up with a  
computer security company to make processors designed to keep 
hackers away from credit card numbers and digital signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker, and RSA  
Data Security, Inc., a leading encryption company, announced Monday 
that their joint effort will support e-commerce growth worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Intel's innovation could also conflict with  
restrictions on the export of data scrambling technology, imposed 
by the government to protect the nation from criminals and 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're entering an age where e-commerce transactions will be  
conducted on a global network consisting of a billion connected 
personal computers,'' said Michael Glance, general manager of 
Intel's platform security division. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wu, an analyst with the bank ABN Amro Inc., in San  
Francisco, said Intel may face obstacles to selling the technology 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These high performance chips are going to get Internet  
commerce more safe,'' he said. ``It helps the overall computer 
industry, but Intel may have to use good, persuasive lobbyists and 
lawyers in Washington to get them accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Data scrambling technology, known as encryption, has mostly been  
the product of software companies, who add it to programs used to 
surf the Internet such as browsers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed limits on export of  
the most powerful encryption technology, fearing it could fall into 
the hands of criminals and terrorists, who would be able to send 
messages to each other that law enforcement authorities won't be 
able to read. 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech industry has long protested the restrictions,  
saying they were hurting business and accomplished little because 
foreign competitors were also selling the technology 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday Intel -- which has about 85 percent of the computer  
chip market -- stepped into the field. It plans to develop computer 
chips that incorporate Intel hardware and leading software security 
tools by RSA Data Security Inc., of San Mateo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel discussed the plans Monday at a security conference in San  
Jose sponsored by RSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Glance, the Intel manager, wouldn't comment on how the company  
plans to get around the export restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which imposes the  
encryption regulations, were unavailable for comment Monday because 
of the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Morales of the high tech research firm International Data  
Corp., said Intel's chips will be part of a growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the market is driven by the Internet, most of the  
equipment is going to have to include this encryption technology,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made some recent moves to relax the  
restrictions on encryption technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In late December, the Commerce Department allowed U.S. companies  
to export technology that uses the so-called 56-bit data encryption 
standard or its equivalent. This standard has an unlocking key with 
72 quadrillion possible combinations, but it isn't the most 
powerful encryption standard. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also allows more-powerful encryption products to  
be exported by specialized industries such as insurance and health 
care to 46 countries. It also allows sales by U.S. companies to 
their overseas subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the early companies to create hardware with security  
capabilities, Hewlett-Packard Co. said Monday that it has received 
approval from the Commerce Department to export its hardware-based 
VerSecure technology to nine additional countries, bringing the 
total to 17 countries representing more than 80 percent of Internet 
users worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard's VerSecure program head Doug McGowan said the  
changing status of export laws and policies makes it ``very 
challenging for manufacturers to design strong security into 
exportable products.''

<HEADLINE> Dozens Hospitalized in Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, Ill. (AP) -- Forty-six people on their way to a  
riverboat casino were rushed to the hospital after the charter bus 
they were riding in lost control and flipped onto its side. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was headed from Chicago to the President's Riverboat  
Casino in Davenport, Iowa, when it apparently lost control on an 
icy patch of Interstate 80 near Princeton, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all talking and the next thing you know the bus  
swerved and everybody was on one side of the bus,'' passenger Tara 
Lockett, 24, an optician from Chicago, said. ``It was kind of 
awful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still investigating the accident and have not  
decided whether driver Isiah Golden, 52 of Chicago, would be 
ticketed, said Master Sgt. David Spahm of the Illinois State 
Police. Golden was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	No other vehicles were involved in the accident, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	A woman answering the phone at Neal's Bus Company, the  
Chicago-based company that operates the bus, declined to comment on 
the accident Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Boyd, 56, of Chicago, was transferred to OSF Saint  
Francis Medical Center in Peoria in critical condition, suffering 
from several broken bones, according to hospital spokeswoman 
Michele Sheppard. Ella Abram, 50, also of Chicago, was transferred 
to Saint Francis in serious condition with head injuries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven passengers were treated and released at Perry Memorial,  
nursing supervisor Carol Howes said. Four were admitted in good 
condition, she said.

<HEADLINE>  Capriati Makes Progress in Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Jennifer Capriati finally won a  
close match. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to resurrect a career left in tatters by drug and  
shoplifting charges six years ago, the 22-year-old former world 
No.6 won a hard-fought victory Monday in the first round of the 
Australian Open against Evie Dominikovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't pulled out a match like that in a long time, and it  
has always been that I've been the loser,'' Capriati said. ``After 
a while it just brings you so down. You just have to keep fighting. 
This time I just gave all I've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being forced to prove herself in qualifying rounds in  
Sydney last week, Capriati battled to a 5-7, 6-3, 8-6 win over the 
211th-ranked Dominikovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hanging in there and really just trying -- I'm very  
happy I won today,'' said Capriati, nursing a lingering rotator 
cuff injury with an icepack. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati, from Wesley Chapel, Florida, lost the first set and  
was down 3-0 in the second to Dominikovic before rallying. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominikovic, an 18-year-old Australian, served for the match at  
6-5 in the third set but had two double faults to enable Capriati, 
now ranked 101, to break back. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati, the 1992 Olympic Champion, last won a tournament in  
Sydney in 1993, before her career was stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested on drug charges in 1994 and went into  
rehabilitation, putting down the racket for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati's latest win gave her something she had been lacking  
for a long time -- confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty hungry,'' she said. ``I think this match does a lot  
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capriati has forged a friendship with veteran German Steffi  
Graf, a winner of 21 Grand Slam titles who, late in her career, is 
keeping watch over the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she's going through a hard time with her injuries and  
trying to come back but we are just there, always supporting each 
other,'' Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said she was trying ``to be there'' for Capriati.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds strange, but with Jennifer we have some kind of  
connection,'' said Graf. ``I think she has so much talent and I 
like her as a person.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Few Following Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are not engaged by the impeachment  
process, and the trial so far has not changed their minds about 
turning President Clinton out of office, a poll released Monday 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than a third of Americans are paying very close attention  
to the trial in the Senate, the survey by the Pew Research Center 
for the People and the Press indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 1,200 adults polled by telephone Jan. 14-18, 69 percent said  
the trial has not changed their opinions about whether the 
president should be removed from office or resign. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady two-thirds of the public wanted Clinton to remain in  
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those polled, 76 percent said Republicans and Democrats are  
mostly bickering instead of working together as only the nation's 
second presidential impeachment trial gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans won approval from 32 percent of those  
polled for their handling of the investigation, and Democrats 
scored a 44 percent approval rating. Clinton himself scored a 45 
percent approval rating, and 35 percent said they approve of the 
way the media are handling their task. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William Rehnquist did better than other trial  
participants, with a 50 percent approval rating, although he has 
been little visible in the trial so far.

	Study authors suggested those polled may have reacted more to  
Rehnquist's stature than his performance in the impeachment 
proceedings. Only 19 percent could name Rehnquist as presiding over 
the trial, although 48 percent could name Larry Flynt as the 
publisher who offered money for proof that members of Congress 
committed adultery.

	Meanwhile, the public continues to give Clinton good grades on  
the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew poll indicated 63 percent of Americans approve of  
Clinton's performance in office. That's down some from late 
December, when 71 percent gave Clinton a favorable rating, but 
about the same as his 61 percent approval rating in the same survey 
when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey indicated 53 percent of Americans are satisfied with  
the way things are going in the country -- up from 46 percent a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And 45 percent of those polled said they are very satisfied with  
their standard of living, up substantially from 35 percent in late 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are even happier about their family lives -- 71 percent  
rate themselves as very satisfied. Asked about their housing 
situations, 61 percent said they are very satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey has a margin or error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage  
points.

<HEADLINE> `Varsity Blues' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Varsity Blues,'' starring James Van Der  
Beek as a high school football star coming of age in a Texas town, 
rumbled past ``A Civil Action'' into the No. 1 box office spot over 
the weekend, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Varsity Blues,'' a collaboration between Paramount and MTV,  
debuted at No. 1 with $14.3 million. It was the strongest opener 
ever during a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, moving ahead 
of the previous record of $14 million held by 1994's ``Legends of 
the Fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This movie appeals to the young male audience,'' said Wayne  
Lewellen, president of distribution at Paramount. ``There really 
hasn't been a lot of product out for that audience. They were pent 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A Civil Action,'' about a real-life legal battle against  
tainted drinking water, dropped to second place with $10.9 million 
after taking the top spot last weekend in its expanded release, 
estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first weekend of wide release, the World War II epic  
``The Thin Red Line'' jumped to a respectable No. 3 with $10.5 
million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Williams' heartwarmer ``Patch Adams'' fell to the No. 4  
spot with $10.2 million in its fourth week. 
</P>
<P>
	``At First Sight'' opened in the No. 5 spot this weekend with  
$7.7 million in ticket sales. Val Kilmer stars in this story of a 
blind masseur who falls in love with Mira Sorvino and regains his 
vision -- but stumbles when thrown into the world of sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dropping again this weekend were ``Stepmom'' to sixth place with  
$6.3 million; ``You've Got Mail'' at seventh with $5.9 million; and 
``The Prince of Egypt'' in a tie for eighth place with $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virus,'' the science-fiction adventure starring Jamie Lee  
Curtis and William Baldwin, also took eighth place in its opening 
weekend, selling $5 million in tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Another movie opening this weekend, the thriller ``In Dreams,''  
starring Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr. tied with 
``Shakespeare in Love'' for the No. 10 spot with $4 million in 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were to be released today: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Varsity Blues,'' $14.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``A Civil Action,'' $10.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Thin Red Line,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Patch Adams,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``At First Sight,'' $7.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Stepmom,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``You've Got Mail,'' $5.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``The Prince of Egypt,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. (tie) ``Virus,'' $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. (tie) ``In Dreams,'' $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Awaits Police Report on Gun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rapper ODB awaited results Sunday of paraffin  
tests that could indicate whether he fired a gun during an 
encounter with undercover cops on a Brooklyn street. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives also were seeking a handgun they say was fired after  
police stopped his sport utility truck for a routine traffic 
violation Friday night. As of Sunday, no gun had been found, 
detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Wu-Tang Clan singer has used the name ODB in the  
past and more recently goes by Big Baby Jesus. His real name is 
Russell Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent Saturday to attempted murder in the first  
degree, attempted murder in the second degree and two counts of 
criminal weapons possession. The main charge carries a maximum 
penalty of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Bail was set at $150,000 and Jones was ordered to reappear in  
court Jan. 21.

<HEADLINE> 1745 American Bookcase Brings $8 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 18th-century combination bookcase-writing desk  
fetched $8.25 million at a Sotheby's sale, one of the highest 
prices ever paid for a piece of American furniture at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	It was thought the bookcase, which dates to around 1745, would  
sell for between $500,000 and $800,000. But soon after the bidding 
began Sunday, at least five buyers drew the price into the 
millions. The final bid was made by an anonymous buyer on the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The mahogany bookcase was discovered last year in France, where  
it had been for nearly two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discovery of this piece has forced us to redefine the way  
we look at American furniture,'' said Sotheby's American furniture 
department director Leslie Keno. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookcase appears to be the most elaborate piece built by the  
famous Newport, R.I., cabinetmaker Christopher Townsend. It has 
silver fixtures by noted silversmith Samuel Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's sale prices usually include a buyer's premium of about  
15 percent.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson helped Muhammad Ali celebrate his  
57th birthday at an emotional birthday party that paid tribute to 
the former boxing champ. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, fresh from his victory over Francois Botha on Saturday  
night, posed for pictures with Ali and family during the private 
dinner party. Also on hand was singer Gladys Knight, a longtime 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight noted that one of her sons is named after Ali.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was not only the greatest outside, he was the greatest  
inside,'' she said of the legendary boxer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, did not speak to the  
crowd Sunday night. But he helped cut his birthday cake, made in 
the shape of a boxing ring, as the crowd chanted ``Ali, Ali.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali's wife, Lonnie, said her husband had been ``an inspiration  
to everyone he has met and everyone he has touched from afar.''

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia Sidewalk Law Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of  
Pennsylvania vowed to file a federal lawsuit to block an ordinance 
taking effect today that allows police to fine and remove vagrants 
on city sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit will be filed on behalf of the homeless, ACLU legal  
director Stefan Presser said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Homeless advocates lay down on the sidewalks along a busy  
shopping district Monday to protest the ``sidewalk behavior'' 
ordinance that outlaws lying or sitting on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 protesters bearing signs reading ``The City of  
Brotherly WHAT?'' and chanting ``Stop the war on the poor'' staged 
a rally at City Hall then walked to the posh Rittenhouse Square 
area, where they lay down in the rain along a two-block stretch of 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bill specifically targeting the homeless, and that's  
fundamentally unfair,'' said William O'Brien of Project H.O.M.E, a 
nonprofit group that helps the homeless find housing and jobs. ``It 
says some people are welcome in Philadelphia and some are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance also offers more shelter beds, mental-health  
programs and substance-abuse counseling. Advocates say it will help 
the homeless by providing treatment when needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents say the measure criminalizes homelessness and  
violates the right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, aggressive panhandling could result in a $100  
fine. Sitting or lying on a public sidewalk for more than one hour 
in a two-hour period could bring a $20 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Police officers would have to call an outreach team of mental  
health or drug treatment counselors before removing someone from a 
sidewalk. They also would have to give warnings before taking 
enforcement action. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters of a similar sidewalk ban in downtown Tempe, Ariz.,  
held a sit-in honoring Martin Luther King Jr. The ban, which took 
effect Sunday, carries a fine of up to $500 and 30 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not about sitting. It's about one group attacking  
another,'' said protester Luis Fernandez, a 29-year-old researcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities from New York to San Francisco are tightening  
restrictions on sleeping and begging in public places, according to 
a report released this month by the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Homeless advocates lay down on the sidewalks

<P>

<HEADLINE> Vikes QB Wants To Start, or Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- One day after a disappointing end to  
his own disappointing season, Brad Johnson said he hopes the 
Minnesota Vikings trade him if he won't be their starting 
quarterback in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's something available and it's a good situation for  
the Vikings first -- because that's the way it'll be decided, the 
Vikings first and me second -- then I'm open to that,'' Johnson said 
Monday. ``If it's a situation where I can hopefully have that 
chance as a starter, then I'm all for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a career backup who earned the starting job late in the  
1996 season, began this season as Minnesota's starter. He had come 
back from a neck injury that cost him the last five games of the 
1997 season, but he broke a bone in his leg in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham replaced him and flourished, earning Pro Bowl  
and All-Pro recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson returned Nov. 8 when Cunningham injured his knee against  
New Orleans, but Johnson broke the thumb on his throwing hand in 
the second half that day. Even though he finished the game he also 
was finished playing for six more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the Vikings gave Cunningham a $28 million contract  
extension late in the regular season, and Johnson's future became 
uncertain. He discussed it for the first time following Sunday's 
painful 30-27 overtime loss to Atlanta in the NFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Vikings have said repeatedly they want to keep both  
players and believe they can afford starter's salaries for two 
quarterbacks -- Johnson has three years left on a $15.5 million 
contract -- Johnson seems unlikely to accept a role as Cunningham's 
permanent backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it here in Minnesota, but I feel like I want to play, I  
want to be a starter,'' he said. ``I deserve that opportunity. I 
don't know if it will happen here. It might, but I'm just going to 
wait things out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Vikings publicly say they are committed to keeping  
Johnson, the possibility of getting a top-5 draft pick as part of a 
deal for him might be too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Diamond, Minnesota's senior vice president of football  
operations, maintained the company line Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take a look at the whole situation, and our  
intent is to try to keep them both,'' Diamond said. ``Brad is a 
class guy, a terrific guy. We'd like to see him stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson made it clear that would be his preference, but only as  
a starter. He paused when asked if he would consider staying if 
coach Dennis Green guaranteed him a chance to compete with 
Cunningham in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to play, but whatever they decide, I trust Denny,''  
Johnson said. ``Randall had a great year this year. Whatever they 
decide to do, that's what we go with regardless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green suggested last month that Cunningham might return to the  
backup role the Vikings brought him in to fill in 1997. Cunningham 
said Monday he hopes Johnson returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll win with either one of us, and that's the  
decision they have to make,'' Johnson said. ``No matter who plays 
or if I'm here or not.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Takes a Holiday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. financial markets are closed Monday in  
observance of Martin Luther King Jr. day. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market ended a four-day losing streak Friday as  
investors gained confidence that Brazil, the largest country in 
Latin America, is getting a handle on its economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil decided to temporarily stop using its cash reserves to  
prop up its beleaguered currency, the real. Investors concluded 
this would allow interest rates in that country to fall, 
stimulating new business investment and perhaps helping the country 
back to economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points to 9,340.55,  
making up a large portion of the 522 points it lost earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow still ended the week down 302.77 points. It was just  
last Friday that the Dow hit a new high of 9,643.32 on continued 
domestic economic strength and highflying technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue chip index, which gained 5 percent in the first week of  
the year, ended Friday's session just 1.7 percent higher for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes also rose sharply Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index advanced 71.38 to 2,348.20. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 gained 31.07 to 1,243.26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin America's largest --  
skyrocketed as Brazilian shares began to look like a bargain for 
foreign investors. The exchange closed up 33.3 percent Friday -- the 
second highest rise in its history. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil rocked world financial markets on Wednesday when it  
devalued its currency, the real, by 8 percent. Two top government 
finance officials resigned, raising doubts about Brazil's political 
resolve to get its economy in order. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday and Thursday, the Dow lost a total of 353 points,  
as U.S. investors feared that Brazil's problems would spread 
throughout Latin America, most importantly to Mexico, a key U.S. 
trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America accounts for 20 percent of U.S. exports, so any  
region-wide downturn could cut deeply into profits of American 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers felt that if Brazil were serious about turning  
its economy around, it would stop using its currency reserves to 
prop up the real. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday the government said it would do just that, at least  
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said investors now hope that Brazil won't start a  
regional economic crisis as big as Asia's, which began in 1997 
after Thailand devalued its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think there's recognition that it isn't quite as bad as  
Asia, that it doesn't necessarily have to reverberate around the 
globe,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment strategist at 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We survived Asia very well, because the (U.S.) Federal Reserve  
reduced interest rates, and in fact that's what pulled the market 
up in the final quarter of last year,'' he said. ``I think people 
increasingly recognize that these kinds of dilemmas, as long as 
they don't spread, can actually be constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks led the rebound on Wall Street after  
having taken big hits earlier this week on fears that Brazilian 
companies would default on their loans. Dow component American 
Express rose 8 5/8 to 104 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of consumer companies, which are heavy exporters to  
Brazil, were mixed after taking big hits earlier this week. Procter 
&AMP; Gamble rose 1 7/16 to 86 5/8, but Philip Morris fell 3/4 to 52 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 3 to 1 margin  
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to a moderately heavy 
953.8 million shares as of 4 p.m., up slightly from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 12.32 to 593.39, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 11.13 to 709.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.95 to 427.05.  
</P>
<P>
	The gains in U.S. trading helped lift European stocks from  
midday losses. Germany's DAX index closed up 1.4 percent, Britain's 
FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In overnight trading, Asian stock markets were mostly higher.  
Tokyo's stock market was closed for a holiday.

<HEADLINE> 'Varsity Blues' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Teen males who had the day off from school  
Monday helped the new football movie ``Varsity Blues'' with James 
Van Der Beek tighten its hold on No. 1 at the North American box 
office, estimates showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other new films opened to disappointing business, however.  
``At First Sight'' with Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino had $8.7 
million for fifth, ``Virus'' with Jamie Lee Curtis had $6 million 
for ninth and ``In Dreams'' with Annette Bening had $4.7 million 
for 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Varsity Blues'' raked in $17.6 million to become the  
biggest-opening movie for Martin Luther King Day weekend, a dubious 
title since studios traditionally release weaker films this time of 
year. The previous record-holder was ``Higher Learning'' in 1995, 
which went on to gross a modest $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the four-day box office period, ``Varsity Blues,'' and its  
core audience of teen males knocked ``A Civil Action'' into second 
place with $11.8 million. ``Patch Adams'' was third with $11.7 
million and will top the $100 million mark this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The war film ``The Thin Red Line'' went into expanded release  
for the first time and brought in a respectable $11.4 million for 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stepmom'' was sixth with $7.8 million, ``You've Got Mail''  
seventh with $6.7 million and ``The Prince of Egypt'' eighth with 
$6.2 million. ``Shakespeare In Love'' rounded out the Top 10 with 
$4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Monday. Final figures were to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Varsity Blues,'' $17.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``A Civil Action,'' $11.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Patch Adams,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Thin Red Line,'' $11.4 million.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> USDA To Set Up Gene Research Center / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- In an effort to provide a valuable resource  
of genetic data on key crops, the Agriculture Department will set 
up a national gene research center at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
	The new facility, the Center for Bioinformatics and Comparative  
Genomics, is expected to open this spring, said Judy St. John, an 
associate deputy administrator with the USDA's Agricultural 
Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USDA-funded center will aid researchers around the country  
and the world in the quest to discover all the genes in grains -- 
like corn, wheat and rice -- and plants in the family that includes 
tomatoes, potatoes and peppers,'' St. John said in a statement 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Genomics refers to the study of the gene map, and bioinformatics  
is the use of computers to help researchers answer life-science 
questions. Once a gene's structure is mapped, scientists can use 
computers to look for similar structures in genome databases of 
plants, humans, mice and other life forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a gene's function is identified, scientists can begin  
experiments to see if that gene can be rebuilt in a way to make it 
more effective. For example, disease-resistant genes can be moved 
into plants that lack resistance, and those plants should require 
fewer chemical pesticides. 
</P>

	SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- After three months of record high milk  
prices for the producer, the retail price of cheese, butter and 
milk should begin a slow decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer demand powered a run-up in the milk prices for  
producers during October, November and December. That was reflected 
in consumer costs at the dairy counter. 
</P>
<P>
	After record highs, it was inevitable that prices would come  
back down, said Chris Nubern, director of economic research for the 
National Milk Producers Federation in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Nubern said the U.S. milk supply increased last year, but not as  
much as expected. At the same time, there was exceptional demand 
for cheese, ice cream and butter. 
</P>
<P>
	``All those products really turned the market around for us,''  
Nubern said. ``This was just an unbelievable year in terms of price 
strength for dairy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, regional prices for milk on the farm averaged more than  
$17 per hundred pounds in December and set a yearly average high of 
$14.20 in 1998. Even though the prices paid to producers have 
topped out and are headed down, milk still ranks as one of the few 
profitable commodities on the farm these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy farmer Jim Gilkerson of Brookings, S.D., said milk  
producers needed the period of prosperity after tough prices in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a struggle there for several years. I hope the dairy  
industry has had its hard years, and now it will stay up there for 
a while,'' Gilkerson said. ``We've probably had four or five months 
of prosperity now. And for the next two months, it should still be 
pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor that has helped dairy farmers has reflected the  
pain elsewhere in agriculture. Feed costs for alfalfa and 
especially corn have fallen sharply from exceptionally high levels 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that's one of those bright spots, the reduced feed  
costs,'' said dairy farmer Ralph Schelske of Reliance. But he added 
that he wasn't particularly happy about getting ahead that way 
``when somebody else is going broke.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Resuming Legislative Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Senate Republicans are unveiling an agenda  
focusing on Social Security, tax cuts and other issues as the new 
Congress begins burrowing into its legislative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other Senate GOP  
leaders today planned to reveal their first five bills of the 106th 
Congress, which began its two-year life earlier this month. The 
announcement of each party's initial bills is a biennial ritual 
that each uses to publicize its top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative work will begin slowly as usual, with little but  
committee work going on this month. But with polls showing most 
members of the public disenchanted with GOP efforts to remove 
President Clinton from office, Republicans are especially 
interested in demonstrating that they are eager to address issues 
of concern to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A good message is the work moves forward,'' said Rep. Jennifer  
Dunn, R-Wash., in an interview Monday. Dunn and Rep. Steve Largent, 
R-Okla., will be delivering the GOP response tonight to Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Senate Republicans' first five bills will focus on  
Social Security, tax cuts, education, anti-crime and anti-drug 
initiatives, and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats also plan to unveil their top five bills.  
</P>
<P>
	In the House, new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Monday he  
would reserve H.R.1, the House's first bill of the new Congress, 
for the president's legislation on strengthening the pension 
program for the elderly and disabled. Clinton has called for 
buttressing the program for the impending retirement of baby 
boomers, but has provided no details on how he would do it and is 
not expected to reveal any soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol  
in full force, in time to hear Clinton's address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The House meets Tuesday, but mainly so members can be around for  
Clinton's address in the evening. It will then recess until Feb. 2, 
although many committees will remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was meeting briefly this morning for speeches on  
legislation. After lunch, senators will resume their more familiar 
mode of late, hearing the Clinton impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping off what will unavoidably be a peculiar day, those same  
senators will then troop across the Capitol after dinner to hear 
the president's address. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate's legislative schedule is uncertain after that,  
mainly because of the unsure timing of the impeachment trial. It is 
possible that the Senate will meet for legislative business on 
Wednesday and Friday mornings, though little more than speeches are 
likely because no bills are ready for floor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee was planning almost daily  
hearings in preparation for its work later this year on spending 
bills for 2000. GOP leaders want to get those bills finished as 
early as possible, in hopes of avoiding a replay of last fall's 
mammoth $520 billion spending measure, which handed Clinton several 
victories just before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels planning early hearings include the Senate Budget  
Committee, with 11 hearings on budget topics; the House Ways and 
Means Committee, at which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
will testify on economic issues; the House's renamed Armed Services 
Committee, which will hear from the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will consider 
efforts to impose new controls on health-maintenance organizations.

<HEADLINE> UConn Stays Atop Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The last time the Miami Hurricanes were ranked in The Associated  
Press college basketball poll, Rick Barry was still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Monday, the Hurricanes were in the poll at No. 25, the  
school's first appearance since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's more exposure, so it's good for us,'' forward Johnny  
Hemsley said. ``We're an up-and-coming program, and people are 
starting to notice it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things remained the same at the top, with Connecticut at No. 1  
for the eighth straight week and Duke a solid No. 2 for the sixth 
week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were changes at the bottom as Louisville also moved in  
for the first time this season at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (15-0), an easy winner over Notre Dame and  
Pittsburgh last week, received 53 first-place votes and 1,755 
points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (17-1), which beat Wake Forest and Florida State last week,  
was No. 1 on 18 ballots and had 1,721 points, 134 more than 
Stanford, which moved up one spot to No. 3 following road wins over 
Southern California and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland also moved up one place to fourth, while Cincinnati,  
which lost for the first time this season last week at North 
Carolina Charlotte, dropped two spots to No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, along with Connecticut the only unbeaten teams in  
Division I, jumped from eighth to sixth, and was followed in the 
Top Ten by Kentucky, St. John's, Arizona and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn plays at Kentucky on Wednesday night, and this week's  
other Top Ten matchup will have Duke at St. John's on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 11th followed by New Mexico and UCLA. Then  
came five straight Big Ten teams -- Iowa, Wisconsin, Purdue, 
Minnesota and Indiana. Kansas was 19th and Syracuse 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	The Top 25 was rounded out by Texas Christian, Arkansas,  
Oklahoma State, Louisville and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes (11-3) were ranked for all but the first poll of  
the 1959-60 season, reaching as high as No. 8. Barry, who went on 
to a Hall of Fame NBA career, played at Miami from 1963-65, and six 
seasons later the school dropped the sport because of a lack of 
interest in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was restarted for the 1985-86 season and the  
Hurricanes, under coach Leonard Hamilton, been close of the Top 25 
in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that's trying to build a tradition,'' said  
Hamilton, 109-132 in his ninth season at Miami. ``Once we get 
there, I hope we'll stay there. But you have to earn that by being 
consistent over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes entered the rankings having won nine of their  
past 10 games, the only loss to Notre Dame. Their other losses have 
been to North Carolina-Charlotte and Kentucky; wins have included 
Ohio State and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge opportunity for us. I know it's the highest  
opportunity of my career,'' said forward Tim James, Miami's leading 
scorer with an 18.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking will get a test right away, with No. 1 Connecticut  
visiting Miami Arena for a Big East game Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning Big East games are important. The fact this is the No.  
1 team in the country -- that's a bonus,'' Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisville (10-3) has won four straight games since a loss at  
Michigan State. The Cardinals are ranked for the first time since 
the second week of last season when they were 19th. Louisville is 
on a probation and will miss the Conference USA and NCAA 
tournaments this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which entered the poll last week for the first time  
this season, dropped out from No. 21 following losses to Iowa and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson, which came in with the first poll of the regular season  
and reached as high as No. 14 under first-year coach Larry Shyatt, 
fell out from No. 25 following losses to Florida State and 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's departure ends the Big Ten's record run of seven  
teams at one week. It was the second time the conference had seven 
teams ranked and the last time, January 1993, also lasted one week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's entrance gives the Big East four teams, joining  
Connecticut, St. John's and Syracuse. Only the Big Ten, with six 
teams, has more.

<HEADLINE> King Day Triggers Talk of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- On the eve of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday,  
the widow of the slain civil rights leader gathered with others 
Sunday to discuss how world leaders can promote reconciliation from 
South Africa to Cuba to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that when you look at conflict anywhere in the world  
... and you boil it down, it's all about the same thing. It's all 
about difference,'' said Nobel Peace Prize winner John Hume of 
Northern Ireland. ``The answer to difference is to respect it, not 
to fight it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hume, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young,  
head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa 
Desmond Tutu and King's widow, Coretta, tried to get that message 
across during a discussion that often included the themes espoused 
by King. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin Luther King was a great example for people in Northern  
Ireland,'' Hume said. ``He was seeking equality, not victory for 
any one section.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The peace he strove for has not been won, Mrs. King said at the  
meeting of Global Circle, a group founded 25 years ago to discuss 
world issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped that we would be a lot further in building bridges  
... this close to the turn of the century,'' she said. ``There is 
still too much demonizing of enemies as is evident in the United 
States' relationship with Cuba and Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tutu said the world can learn from South Africa's example, in  
which the country turned what could have been a potential blood 
bath into a scene in which people were hugging instead fighting at 
the end of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Africa has given this unbelievable hope of saying it is  
possible,'' he said. ``And it is not just possible, it is going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tutu said openness was necessary, including a full disclosure of  
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a history that all of us have to accept,'' he said.  
``And by doing that we close the chapter, not to forget, but to 
remember we don't repeat what happened.''

<HEADLINE> Daschle Concedes Witnesses Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's Democratic leader conceded on  
Monday that witnesses ``may be inevitable'' in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial but said that once live testimony starts the 
Senate could lose much of its control over the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican victory on calling Monica Lewinsky and others could  
extend the trial indefinitely, said Sen. Tom Daschle of South 
Dakota. And he speculated that it also could lead to a Senate-floor 
spectacle of 100 senators watching her ``point to where the 
president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona dismissed the warning as  
``all-or-nothing'' scare tactics -- ``just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Daschle commented, White House lawyers honed the defense  
presentation they will begin Tuesday. It will focus on conflicts in 
testimony, a strategy that would be aimed at undercutting House 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice but that also could 
open the way to Republican demands for witnesses to help resolve 
the disputes. The White House has been fighting that demand, but 
now expects witnesses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff will spend several hours  
presenting opening defense arguments before the trial recesses for 
Clinton's State of the Union address in the House chamber where the 
president was impeached. Senate Republican aides, who asked not to 
be indentified, said GOP leaders would prefer that senators adopt 
the demeanor of Supreme Court justices and not express themselves 
during the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has said he will  
not attend the speech, but his absence won't be related to the 
trial. The lawmaker said he prefers to avoid the crowds and has 
missed the address in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle, in an interview with The Associated Press, acknowledged  
the Democrats apparently have lost their fight with majority 
Republicans to conclude the trial without live testimony from 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the potential results were still being hotly disputed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once we say we have to have witnesses, then it seems to me  
we've given up the ability to tell the House or White House how to 
present their case,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said anew that the  
Clinton side is ready to argue its case without witnesses even 
though live testimony might bring ``exculpatory information'' to 
the Senate. ``I'll repeat again, the one thing that bringing 
witnesses into this case will definitely do is extend and delay 
this process,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyl, who said he believes other Senate Republicans would endorse  
his views, called Daschle's comments ``totally inconsistent with 
the rules. ... He appears to say it's all or nothing -- if witnesses 
are called, there's not much the Senate can do about controlling 
it. That's just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Republican said the Senate could reject witnesses  
and added, ``There clearly were discussions in our conference about 
ways salacious material could be handled. The Senate has the 
ability to set limitations on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot believe the White House will engage in tactics that  
would deliberately and obviously delay the process. I think it's 
more of a bluff and bluster,'' Kyl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, fresh polling indicated most Americans are not  
impressed by any of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center  
for the People &AMP; the Press, a steady two-thirds of Americans want 
it all to end with Clinton still in office and less than one-third 
are paying close attention. The only participant who got even a 50 
percent approval rating for his handling of the process was Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist -- and only 19 percent could identify him 
by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said in his interview that witnesses ``may be  
inevitable,'' a reference to the 55-45 majority held by 
Republicans, who favor witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that once a decision is made to have witnesses, ``who  
are we to tell either the House or the White House how they're 
going to run their case?'' He predicted that the Senate couldn't 
keep ``salacious details'' out of the trial if Ms. Lewinsky 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will happen. That is really one of the only questions in  
dispute, whether she touched him or he touched her,'' Daschle said. 
``We will have 100 senators watching Monica Lewinsky point to where 
the president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the White House finishes its presentation Friday or  
Saturday, the Senate will submit questions in writing to both 
sides, to be read by Rehnquist as presiding trial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Daschle have agreed on  
a format that would divide the time for questions -- limited to 16 
hours -- equally between Republicans and Democrats, switching back 
and forth between the two sides every two hours, according to a 
Lott aide. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions will be reviewed by each party to avoid at least  
some repetition. Before each question, Rehnquist is expected to 
name the senator who asked it. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial rules provide for a two-step process on witnesses.  
Each side would submit a proposed list of those to be questioned in 
depositions -- and each list could be accepted or rejected in its 
entirety. In the second step, there would be a vote on each deposed 
witness to decide whether he or she should testify before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers will use past testimony, federal laws and the  
Founding Fathers' own words to dispute the prosecutors' case that 
the president lied under oath or obstructed justice and should be 
removed for it, administration officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Honors King, Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After knocking down a wall with  
``therapeutic'' zeal, President Clinton used Monday's holiday 
honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to announce a $6.5 billion fair 
housing settlement reached by enforcing a law passed days after 
King's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, dressed in blue jeans, cited King's philosophy as  
he joined Vice President Al Gore and a team of AmeriCorps 
volunteers in tearing down a wall to make way for a health clinic 
at the Regency House retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	Their work was part of a national focus on volunteerism in the  
spirit of King, the nation's most celebrated human rights activist 
who was born Jan. 15, 1929, and died April 4, 1968, from an 
assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attacked the wall using a hammer with one hand and a  
crowbar with the other. Gore did, too. Tiny chunks of plaster 
pelted reporters standing nearby. They asked Clinton whether the 
work was therapeutic for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all highly therapeutic,'' said Clinton, who gave  
instructions to others and dragged away a set of metal bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did the vice president and me a lot of good to pick up  
those hammers and crowbars and tear something down,'' Clinton 
laughed. ``We do this desk work all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the words to one of King's favorite hymns -- ``If I  
can help somebody ... Then my living will not be in vain'' -- and 
said all Americans should heed the call to serve others. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton bought three books at a local bookstore and  
returned to the White House to practice his State of the Union 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	At Regency House, Clinton announced that the Department of  
Housing and Urban Development and Columbia National Mortgage Co. 
had settled a housing discrimination case worth $6.5 billion in 
loans and homeownership programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the Columbia, Md.-based lender will make  
$6 billion in home mortgage loans available over five years to 
minorities and low- to moderate-income families in the District of 
Columbia and 26 states where they did business in 1997. The company 
also will spend $529 million on programs designed to increase 
homeownership among minority and poor families. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia National was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act  
-- which bars discrimination in home sales and rentals -- by making 
too few loans to minority or low- to moderate-income families. In 
1997, its loans to such borrowers totaled only $51.6 million, less 
than 5 percent of its volume; In 10 states, none of its loans went 
to minorities or the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the eighth settlement negotiated by HUD to resolve  
alleged unfair lending practices uncovered through testing by the 
Fort Worth Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If companies know we're going to enforce the law, you'll see  
more compliance. And $6.5 billion says we're going to enforce the 
law,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who attended services 
in Atlanta commemorating King. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final months of his life, King had pressed for passage of  
the Fair Housing Act. Congress approved it April 10, 1968, six days 
after King's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had worked for years to outlaw discrimination in housing,  
and many who voted for the measure said they did it in tribute to 
him,'' Clinton said. ``So here, all these years later, ... we are 
proud that this happened on Dr. King's national holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the settlement is the largest of its kind. HUD  
negotiated the second-largest lending discrimination settlement, 
$2.1 billion, with AccuBanc Mortgage last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, announced that the administration will request  
a 15 percent increase in federal spending on civil rights 
enforcement. Last year, the administration asked for an $86 million 
increase and got $64 million from Congress. The administration is 
seeking an additional $84 million this year, to bring the total to 
$663 million.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up, Japanese Stocks Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The United States dollar edged higher against the  
yen today, buoyed by wary optimism about Brazil's financial 
situation. Tokyo stocks posted a slight gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.14 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.68  
yen from late Thursday and little changed from its level late 
Friday in New York of 114.13 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 66.20 points,  
or 0.48 percent, closing at 13,805.06. On Thursday, the average 
gained 335.26 points, or 2.50 percent. Financial markets in Japan 
were closed Friday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar moved as high  
as 114.55 yen in intraday trading amid easing concern over 
financial turmoil in Brazil, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But these early gains were eroded as Japanese exporters and  
overseas hedge funds took profits by selling dollars for yen, 
sending the greenback as low as 113.25 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Brazilian situation is still very murky and no one can  
predict its effects on the U.S. economy,'' said Takayuki Togawa, 
manager of the foreign exchange division at Tokai Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were expected to closely watch testimony by U.S. Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress on Wednesday for 
any indication of monetary policy changes or comments on the 
problems in Brazil, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.34 yen in Tokyo, up from  
132.30 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders said investors were  
heartened by a recovery in U.S. and other world stock exchanges on 
Friday following moves by the Brazilian government to stabilize its 
economy, Latin America's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Tokyo market welcomed a temporary relief from worries over  
the Brazilian economy,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the 
investor information group at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points  
to 9,340.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets on Wednesday  
when it devalued its currency, the real, by nearly 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's decision Friday to stop spending heavily to  
support the real generated confidence the government was taking 
appropriate measures to nurse the economy back to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section was estimated  
at 334 million shares, down from Thursday's turnover of 409 million 
shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 671 to 439, with 166 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 5.85 points, or 0.55 percent, to 1,075.79. The 
TOPIX had climbed 12.86 points, or 1.22 percent, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.725 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.665 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.60 yen from 101.09 yen the previous 
day.

	Europe, Asia Markets Gain  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Receding worries about Brazil's economic problems  
touched off a global rally in stock markets today as the country's 
central bank announced it would continue to float Brazil's 
currency, the real. The steepest gains took place in Europe, with 
London's blue-chip Financial Times Stock Exchange index up 3.1 
percent, or 182.9 points, to 6,123.9. However, other world markets 
were still volatile. 

</P>
<P>
	Brazil Will Allow Currency To Float  
</P>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil announced today that it will  
continue to allow its currency to trade freely on foreign exchange 
markets, an important step toward overcoming its financial crisis. 
Brazil's currency, the real, has plunged 21 percent since last 
week, when the government said it would no longer spend foreign 
exchange reserves to prop up the overvalued currency. The real 
traded lower at 1.60 to the dollar late today. 

</P>
<P>
	Argentina Considers Using Dollar  
</P>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's struggle to steady its  
shaky currency has prompted one Latin American neighbor to consider 
abandoning its own money and adopting a dollar-based economy. 
Argentine President Carlos Menem has called on his economic team to 
study ways to replace the peso with the dollar in an attempt to 
protect the economy from future financial turmoil. Menem also 
suggested the entire region consider doing the same. 

</P>
<P>
	Economics Forum Opens in Havana  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Amid growing concern that Brazil's economic  
meltdown will infect the region, President Fidel Castro opened a 
forum Monday on the impact of the global financial crisis on 
developing nations. Castro proposed the forum last year, as the 
financial crisis was spreading across Asia. It hit Brazil in 
August, when investors pulled their money out of the country for 
fear that it would default on its loans.

	Wall Street Takes a Holiday  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. financial markets, government offices and  
banks are closed today in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
The stock market ended a four-day losing streak Friday. The Dow 
Jones industrial average rose 219.62 points to 9,340.55, making up 
a large portion of the 522 points it lost earlier in the week. The 
Dow still ended the week down 302.77 points. The Nasdaq composite 
index advanced 71.38 Friday to 2,348.20. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 
gained 31.07 to 1,243.26.

	NAFTA Common Currency Unlikely  
</P>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The launch of a common currency in 11 European  
nations is fueling debate in Canada and Mexico over whether North 
America's three trading partners should adopt a comparable monetary 
union. But don't expect a NAFTA-style euro any time soon. Opinion 
among experts is sharply divided, and Canadian and Mexican leaders 
don't appear eager for swift action on what would be a politically 
contentious project.

	Social Security Accounts Criticized  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposals to replace Social Security's  
guaranteed benefits with new private retirement accounts are 
unacceptable, a group of congressional Democrats warned President 
Clinton. But the lawmakers left an opening for an alternative: 
using the budget surplus to subsidize new 401(k)-style accounts 
that consumers could manage themselves as an addition to, but not a 
replacement for, Social Security benefits.

	AOL Pulls Thesaurus After Complaint  
</P>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online and Merriam-Webster Inc.  
pulled an online thesaurus after gay rights organizations 
complained about the synonyms given for ``homosexual.'' The 
thesaurus listed the slurs ``fruit,'' ``homo'' and ``faggot.'' The 
thesaurus was taken offline Friday, and the slurs will probably be 
removed when the feature returns in about a week, said Deborah 
Burns, marketing director for Merriam-Webster.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mercedes, Lexus and other high-end cars have  
an eye-catching feature that may soon be found on everyday 
automobiles: bright, bluish headlights. High-intensity discharge 
lamps, which started as a $1,000 option, provide about twice the 
brightness of ordinary headlights, closely approximating daylight. 
At the same time, HID lights use less power and can last for 
100,000 miles of driving time.

	Complaints by Federal Workers Swell  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the federal work force shrank,  
employee complaints alleging discrimination or other mistreatment 
swelled in the 1990s and have already cost taxpayers more than $866 
million, federal records show. Federal workers are seven times more 
likely to file a civil rights complaint than private sector 
employees, one analysis by federal managers found. Those who study 
such matters say federal workers are supersensitive about their 
rights, partly because the system makes it easy to seek redress.

<HEADLINE> Gary Kubiak To Stay With Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gary Kubiak is staying with the Denver Broncos.  
</P>
<P>
	The offensive coordinator rejected an offer today to become  
coach of the University of Colorado, saying he does not want to 
leave the Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak had spoken repeatedly with Colorado athletic director  
Dick Tharp and was said to be the choice to replace Rick Neuheisel. 
Neuheisel quit Jan. 9 to coach Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those kids need a commitment. They need someone that would  
give them 100 percent. I'm not ready to do that,'' Kubiak said at a 
news conference at Broncos headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak, who interviewed with the Cleveland Browns last month and  
attracted the attention of other NFL teams, said he had no plans to 
leave the Broncos any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year Gary Kubiak will not be a candidate for any  
opportunities,'' Kubiak said. ``I've got to grow as a coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak's announcement came one day after the Broncos beat the  
New York Jets 23-10 to advance to the Super Bowl for the second 
straight year. Denver will play Atlanta in the NFL title game on 
Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, after Denver's victory, Kubiak said he planned to  
decide ``within 24 to 48 hours'' whether to accept the Colorado 
offer, but that regardless he would remain with the Broncos through 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was ``not good at doing two things,'' Kubiak said the  
last five days -- during which he was preparing the Broncos for the 
AFC championship game while being identified as the front-runner 
for the Colorado job -- have been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak spoke with Tharp on Wednesday night, and spoke again with  
Tharp after Sunday's game. He gave Tharp his decision, who asked 
Kubiak to sleep on it. They talked again this morning, and Kubiak 
remained firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to give an answer from my heart,'' Kubiak said.  
``Everything kept coming up the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak said he realized it wasn't the best thing for him or his  
family. He insisted there were no negatives about the Colorado job 
and Tharp ``bent over backwards to make this work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity there is tremendous,'' Kubiak said.  
</P>
<P>
	Colorado is looking to get a new coach on board since national  
signing day is Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates mentioned for the Colorado job were  
Northwestern coach Gary Barnett and Purdue's Joe Tiller.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises vs. Other Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar posted slight gains against the yen  
and was mixed against European currencies Monday as traders 
continued to take their cues from developments in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of slender market activity due to the Martin Luther  
King Jr. Day holiday, the dollar rose to 114.35 yen in late New 
York trading, up from 114.13 late Friday. The euro was quoted at 
$1.1601, up from $1.1588 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Central Bank Monday confirmed its plan to allow the  
nation's currency, the real, to float freely against the dollar. 
But the bank reserved the right to intervene in markets from time 
to time in order to prevent extreme fluctuations of the real's 
value. The dollar strengthened against the real Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lingering caution prevented any major gains, as currency traders  
have already begun anticipating Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's testimony before Congress Wednesday. If Greenspan 
appears nervous about Brazil's impact on the U.S. economy, U.S. 
stocks and the dollar are both likely to falter. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, the dollar was quoted at 1.3811 Swiss francs,  
down from 1.3833 Friday, and 1.5283 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.5243. The British pound rose to $1.6529 from $1.6518. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6861 German 
marks, down from 1.6878; 5.6529 French francs, down from 5.6593; 
and 1,669.45 Italian lire, down from 1,672.24.

<HEADLINE> Russia IOC Member Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior Russian Olympic official, one of the 13  
International Olympic Committee members cited in the investigation 
into the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Olympic Committee and a  
former IOC vice president and executive board member, has replied 
to a letter from the IOC demanding an explanation for his conduct 
during Salt Lake's bids for the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Ratner, a spokesman for Smirnov and the Russian  
committee, said today that Smirnov gave explanations regarding two 
specific cases cited by IOC investigators looking into allegations 
that IOC members sought or received favors from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both incidents related to a trip Smirnov made to Salt Lake in  
late 1990 or early 1991, Ratner said. At that time, Salt Lake was 
bidding for the 1998 Winter Games, which were eventually awarded to 
Nagano, Japan. In 1995, Salt Lake was awarded the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first case, Smirnov asked officials in Salt Lake City to  
help with the medical treatment of hockey player Alexander Ragulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said the Soviet Union, then teetering on the verge of  
collapse, had neither the funds nor medical facilities to help 
Ragulin, who faced the possible amputation of both his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov wrote letters to officials in Salt Lake City and the  
U.S. Olympic Committee, asking them to help Ragulin and proposing 
to host American athletes in return. Ratner said the bill from the 
Salt Lake hospital was paid by the Salt Lake bid committee. He 
wouldn't say how much it cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly eight years after, Ragulin is fine, walking on his own  
legs and even stepping on ice occasionally,'' Ratner said in a 
telephone interview. ``Vitaly Smirnov feels proud he could help a 
prominent athlete, three-time Olympic champion. He considers that 
as a display of Olympic solidarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second case, Smirnov said he was presented a Browning  
hunting rifle while on the same trip to Salt Lake City. He said he 
couldn't accept it, but the his hosts packed the rifle in his 
luggage without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a stopover in Atlanta on his way to Moscow, Smirnov  
was asked about the gun by customs and was completely bewildered, 
Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov left the weapon behind, but two years later the gun was  
delivered to Moscow by Salt Lake City people. Smirnov turned it 
over to a sports facility in Krasnodar, southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said IOC officials seemed satisfied with Smirnov's  
response, and added that Smirnov would travel to Lausanne, 
Switzerland, to attend a session of the IOC panel Saturday and 
personally answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Smirnov is fully backing the IOC investigation, open to  
any questions and deeply convinced that the IOC will make a correct 
decision,'' Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was one of the most powerful  
and influential figures in the Olympic movement in the 1980s and 
early '90s and a close adviser of IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a first vice president of the organizing committee  
for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. He was vice president of the Soviet 
Olympic Committee from 1969-1991, and president of the Russian 
Olympic Committee since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a member of the IOC executive board from 1974-82 and  
1986-90 and a vice president of the IOC from 1978-82 and 1991-95.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Generals To Warn Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two top NATO officials plan to warn Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic that NATO is prepared to act 
militarily against Yugoslav targets unless he abides by commitments 
to Kosovo Albanians that he agreed to three months ago, a senior 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	As the two generals were preparing to depart for Belgrade,  
tensions escalated over a Yugoslav demand that William Walker, the 
American head of the international peace verification mission in 
Kosovo, depart the country within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Milosevic was  
``playing with fire'' through his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning about a possible military strike will be conveyed  
directly to Milosevic in Belgrade on Tuesday by Gen. Wesley Clark, 
supreme allied commander in Europe, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, a 
German who chairs the NATO Military Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	They also will demand that Milosevic bring to justice those  
responsible for the massacre last Friday of 45 ethnic Albanians, 
Rubin said. Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's meeting will take place against a background of the  
most serious crisis over Kosovo since last October when only a 
last-minute cease-fire averted NATO air strikes against Yugoslav 
military targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker apparently ran afoul of the Yugoslavs when he accused the  
Serb police of last week's massacre. Belgrade had claimed the dead 
were guerrillas in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said it was unacceptable for the Serbs to demand Walker's  
departure. ``We're calling for it to be reversed,'' he said, 
deriding the decision as ``spurious and unworthy.''. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision by the Serbs is only digging a deeper and deeper  
hole for themselves internationally,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official said NATO authorities have been  
told to be prepared to act on short notice to implement an air 
operation against Yugoslavia similar to the one approved last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and Naumann will remind Milosevic that NATO is prepared to  
act militarily if the alliance approves such a move, said the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They also will 
demand that he reduce military and police forces in Kosovo to the 
levels agreed to last fall, the official said, adding that force 
levels have crept up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutilated bodies of the ethnic Albanian victims were found  
Saturday, 15 miles south of Pristina. Serb officials said the 
victims were guerrillas killed in combat, although they included 
three women and a 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic will be  
making a ``grave mistake'' if he does not abide by the commitments 
he made last October when he agreed to a cease-fire and promised to 
negotiate a political settlement with the Kosovo Albanians. She 
called the atrocities ``unacceptable'' and said the international 
community is united in condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin expressed ``grave concern'' over the Yugoslav decision to  
block an attempt by Louise Arbour, the chief U.N. war crimes 
prosecutor, to enter Yugoslavia to visit the massacre site and to 
meet with those suspected of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, he said ``there can be no excuse'' for  
Yugoslavia's failure to meet its obligations to the U.N. Security 
Council and to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia.

hole for themselves internationally,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior administration official said NATO authorities have been  
told to be prepared to act on short notice to implement an air 
operation against Yugoslavia similar to the one approved last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and Naumann will remind Milosevic that NATO is prepared to  
act militarily if the alliance approves such a move, said the 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They also will 
demand that he reduce military and police forces in Kosovo to the 
levels agreed to last fall, the official said, adding that force 
levels have crept up in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The mutilated bodies of the ethnic Albanian victims were found  
Saturday, 15 miles south of Pristina. Serb officials said the 
victims were guerrillas killed in combat, although they included 
three women and a 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic will be  
making a ``grave mistake'' if he does not abide by the commitments 
he made last October when he agreed to a cease-fire and promised to 
negotiate a political settlement with the Kosovo Albanians. She 
called the atrocities ``unacceptable'' and said the international 
community is united in condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin expressed ``grave concern'' over the Yugoslav decision to  
block an attempt by Louise Arbour, the chief U.N. war crimes 
prosecutor, to enter Yugoslavia to visit the massacre site and to 
meet with those suspected of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, he said ``there can be no excuse'' for  
Yugoslavia's failure to meet its obligations to the U.N. Security 
Council and to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Antonio McDyess Eyes Suns, Nuggets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Free agent Antonio McDyess won't be  
joining the post-Jordan, post-Pippen Chicago Bulls. Why? He wants 
to play for a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' McDyess' agent,  
James Bryant, told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's most at  
home with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a winner, and 
Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time champion Bulls, meanwhile, will trade Scottie  
Pippen to Houston, The Associated Press learned Monday. Also, Steve 
Kerr, Dennis Rodman and Luc Longley are apparently on their way out 
after Michael Jordan's retirement last week. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jerry Krause did not comment Monday. But he said  
after the lockout ended the Bulls had three options -- bring 
everyone back if Jordan didn't retire; sign their own key free 
agents and mix them with those from other teams; or rebuild 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to McDyess, the Bulls also are interested in free  
agent Brent Barry if he is not dealt from Miami to Golden State as 
part of a Latrell Sprewell trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've also heard reports on those individuals,'' new Bulls  
coach Tim Floyd said Monday. ``Jerry is going to target key free 
agents in terms of being as competitive as we can this year. If we 
are unable to get those guys, he will remain vigilant in his plans 
to bring it back to the level where it's been. But that could be a 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, for instance, could end up in San Antonio. His agent says  
he's close to a deal with the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new. We're at a standstill until the  
collective bargaining agreement gets straightened out,'' Kerr's 
agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Monday. Another Bartelstein client, 
Jud Buechler, has had feelers from a ``lot of teams,'' the agent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really going to talk about it until it's a done  
deal,'' Kerr said after working out again in Bulls' attire at the 
Berto Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've waited this long, a few more days isn't going to hurt,  
assuming everything works out,'' Kerr said. ``I'll just keep coming 
here and working out and as soon as they tell me to go somewhere, 
I'll go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The start of training camps and player signings was delayed  
again Monday as lawyers needed more time to work out details in the 
new collective bargaining agreement. Camps were supposed to open 
Tuesday, but now it will be Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	What is certain is this. The Bulls will have only a handful of  
practices before their first scrimmage Friday and not much more 
time before an exhibition game Sunday against the Indiana Pacers, 
who've been working out together for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have to have a roster in my hands to figure who is out  
there and that isn't great,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can envision the days of playing sandlot  
football and drawing plays in the dirt. We could actually be moving 
Gatorade bottles around the sideline for the game Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what will be his first words to his next team? ``Hello,  
let's go practice,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players under contract to the Bulls -- Toni Kukoc, Randy  
Brown and Keith Booth -- former Bulls and now free agents Kerr, Bill 
Wennington and Dickey Simpkins, ex-Bulls Pete Myers and Matt 
Steigenga, draft picks Corey Benjamin and Corey Carr and free 
agents Cornell David and Rob Werdann were among those working at 
the Berto Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While most participated together, running and shooting, Kerr  
went alone to the other end and worked with his personal coach, 
Chip Englund, almost symbolizing his detachment from the team with 
which he won three championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel badly for Steve. He really likes it here and it's  
really tough for him,'' Wennington said.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Bidders Gave IOC Painting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A painting worth thousands of dollars was among the  
apples, crafts and other gifts that Nagano bidders gave the IOC in 
an effort to win the 1998 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada, a senior member of the bidding  
committee, said Monday that Eisetsu Shiratori, a Nagano artist, 
donated his work as a gift to the IOC and the bidders passed it on 
to an IOC official. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in his city's  
bid, commented by fax in reply to questions from The Associated 
Press. He refused to identify the IOC official and would not say 
whether he saw the gift as possible bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We relayed Mr. Shiratori's goodwill to the IOC,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal in Salt Lake City has rekindled doubts about  
long-rumored lavish gifts as well as wining and dining during 
Nagano's 1989-1991 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials are banned from accepting gifts of more than $150.  
But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has said the rule does not 
apply to him because he does not vote in the selection of cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese-style paintings, including those by contemporary  
artists, are often valued at extremely high prices and used as 
investment vehicles by wealthy buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada said he did not have the painting assessed. Works by  
Shiratori, a respected painter in Japan, are rarely sold and 
difficult to value, but the painting presented to the IOC is 
believed to be worth at least $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiratori did not immediately return telephone messages asking  
for his comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Nagano and the Japanese Olympic Committee said  
Monday they do not plan an investigation into the bid for last 
year's games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asahi newspaper in a weekend editorial accused Nagano  
bidders of trying to cover up their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nagano city and the Nagano prefectural government are bound by  
duty to offer the public the facts about the Olympic Games,'' Asahi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumikazu Yamaguchi, a senior official with the bidding  
committee, said last week that he had ordered the records of the 
bidding expenses burned in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bidding committee has already disbanded,'' Shigenobu  
Koyanagi, a Nagano city official in charge of the Olympics, said 
Monday. ``And the records have all been disposed of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nagano bidders say they spent nearly $18 million -- more than  
half of that for entertainment, air and hotel fares for IOC 
officials and a contract with a foreign agent to gather information 
about the IOC and rival cities.

<HEADLINE> Man Survives Crash, Killed by Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A man who survived a head-on crash into  
a tree died when he got out of his car and was hit by a utility 
pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernan Herrera, 36, was killed instantly Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	He had apparently lost control of his car and hit a tree and two  
utility poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he may have been waiting for his father or warning  
other drivers of the downed electrical wires when another car hit 
the dangling lines. That caused a utility pole behind Herrera to 
snap.

<HEADLINE> Patient May Have Shot Fla. Surgeon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVENTURA, Fla. (AP) -- When Dr. Bradley Silverman arrived at work  
last week, police say, a former patient was waiting to see him. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Herndon didn't have an appointment. Authorities say he  
was there to seek revenge for surgery that left him with limited 
use of his arm, a side effect Silverman had warned could happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon is accused of shooting and killing Silverman as the  
41-year-old doctor arrived at his Miami-area office on Jan. 11. 
Witnesses heard angry words, followed by the doctor's cries of 
``No! No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police tracked down Herndon at a Port Richey hospital near St.  
Petersburg. The carpenter and handyman was returned to Miami on 
Friday and charged with first-degree murder. He was placed under a 
suicide watch in the Miami-Dade County jail, where he remained 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, 45, suffers from Crohn's disease, a debilitating  
illness destroying his intestines, and he came to Silverman for 
treatment last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman operated on Herndon to remove underarm polyps that  
other doctors had failed to cure. But the surgery didn't work, 
restricting movement in the arm. Herndon filed a complaint against 
Silverman with no success. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman was shot several times at close range. Herndon had  
allegedly waited in the stairwell and confronted the doctor as he 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Police records in Miami Shores, where Herndon once lived, showed  
he has a history of mental problems. Officers were called to his 
home several times between 1988 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1991, officers found Herndon ``distressed and impaired''  
after he shot his waterbed because he did not like it. He later 
spent some time at state and private mental institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also had been arrested on assault charges in 1978 and 1984  
but the charges were either dropped or reduced.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Will Allow Currency To Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil today announced it would continue  
to allow its currency to trade openly on foreign exchange markets 
on a long-term basis, a move seen as a step toward overcoming its 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, Brazil's central bank will let financial  
institutions determine the exchange rate by buying and selling the 
currency according to their own needs, bank official Demosthenes 
Madurerira de Pinho said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank may intervene in the market occasionally and  
in a limited form with the objective of preventing disorderly 
movements in the exchange rate,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the announcement, Brazil's currency, the real,  
opened against the dollar at between 1.42 and 1.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows the market's positive reaction to  
action taken by the government on Friday, when Brazil announced it 
would temporarily abandon its defense of the real by not dipping 
into its cash reserves to prop up its beleaguered currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The real plunged as low as 1.60 to the dollar before  
strengthening slightly to 1.43 at the close of trading. That was 
down from 1.32 at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That move came just two days after the Central Bank tried a  
smaller devaluation of 8 percent by extending the band in which the 
currency could trade to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the currency has fallen more than 15 percent since  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan and new Central Bank chief  
Francisco Lopes met in Washington on Sunday with U.S. officials and 
the International Monetary Fund, which in November put together a 
$41.5 billion aid package for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors pulled money out, fearing the government couldn't 
cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, more than $40 billion has left the country, dropping  
reserves to around $35 billion.

	AtHome Corp. May Buy Excite  
</P>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider AtHome  
Corp. is set to announce it has acquired Excite Inc., one of the 
top Web search engines, sources told MSNBC and the Wall Street 
Journal Web edition. The amount of the deal was unclear, though 
based on closing stock prices last Friday, Excite is worth about 
$3.5 billion. The deal, if successful, could give 
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T Corp. ownership of one of the 
so-called portal companies that serve as entryways onto the 
Internet. AtHome is controlled by TeleCommunications Inc., Cox 
Communications and several other investors. TCI is in the process

	Clinton Team To Focus on Case Facts  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned that some witnesses may be summoned,  
President Clinton's lawyers will use past testimony, federal laws 
and the Founding Fathers' own words when they begin their opening 
statements in the impeachment trial Tuesday. They will dispute that 
House prosecutors have made a case worthy of ousting the president. 
Witnesses ``seem to us to be a foregone conclusion,'' a senior 
White House adviser said today. Another source in the Clinton camp 
said that by focusing on the facts of the case, the president's 
legal team has made a ``major shift in strategy'' which will look 
at contradictions in evidence even if it hands House managers a 
reason to request witnesses.

off a unique triple-header Tuesday. The chief justice is scheduled 
to preside over the Supreme Court in the morning as it issues 
orders and hears arguments in two cases. In the afternoon, he 
crosses the street to oversee the day's proceedings in President 
Clinton's impeachment trial in the Capitol's Senate chamber. In the 
evening, Rehnquist can complete the triple-header by attending 
Clinton's annual State of the Union address before a joint session 
of Congress in the House chamber.

	NATO Commander Warns Milosevic

<P>
	MALOPOLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In comments broadcast on CNN,  
NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said NATO could be 
prepared to act militarily against Yugoslavia within days or hours. 
Defying global outrage at a massacre of 45 civilians last week, 
Serb forces pounded villages in Kosovo Monday with artillery. The 
U.N. Security Council on Monday strongly condemned the massacre. 
Clark and German Gen. Klaus Naumann planned to fly to Belgrade 
Tuesday to warn President Slobodan Milosevic he faces military 
action unless he abides by a deal to end the fighting.

	Complaints by Federal Workers Swell  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the federal work force shrank,  
employee complaints alleging discrimination or other mistreatment 
swelled in the 1990s and have already cost taxpayers more than $866 
million, federal records show. Federal workers are seven times more 
likely to file a civil rights complaint than private sector 
employees, one analysis by federal managers found. Those who study 
such matters say federal workers are supersensitive about their 
rights, partly because the system makes it easy to seek redress.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS intends to sharply increase spending  
on children's television, with part of the money going toward a 
24-hour PBS Kids Channel that will debut with limited reach because 
of its digital format. The new channel, scheduled to begin in 
September, will include such popular PBS shows as ``Barney &AMP; 
Friends'' and ``Teletubbies,'' PBS President Ervin S. Duggan said 
Monday. By the end of 1999, about a third of the country will be 
able to receive the new channel through PBS stations with digital 
capability, Duggan said.

Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 Monday

assist, had his first multi-goal game since his hat trick against 
the Maple Leafs on April 9 of last season.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls agreed to a sign-and-trade  
deal sending Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets for Roy Rogers 
and a second-round draft pick, and the New York Knicks were 
expected to acquire Latrell Sprewell from Golden State, numerous 
league sources told The Associated Press. The NBA lockout will last 
at least another day longer, meaning the upcoming trades will be on 
hold until Wednesday at the earliest.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes in Tenn. Kill 9 People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Nine people died and scores of others were  
injured when a fierce storm coupled with several tornadoes ripped 
through parts of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the deaths Sunday came when a tornado touched down in  
Madison County in western Tennessee, said Kurt Pickering, spokesman 
for the state's Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 71 Madison County residents were hospitalized,  
including 11 critically, and dozens of homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I've never seen anything like it,'' sheriff's  
Capt. Dexter Bowles said. ``Mobile homes, cars and trucks have been 
overturned, and power lines are down. The whole area is totally 
demolished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 homes were damaged or destroyed in Henderson County,  
where a woman's body was found in the ruins of her home, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was killed in Hardeman County, authorities said,  
but details on how that person died were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages were reported in many areas as high winds whipped  
through the state, snapping tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes were seen or touched down in at least a dozen  
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado that hit near Jackson heavily damaged the Tennessee  
National Guard's helicopter maintenance and training facilities, a 
shopping center and apartment complex, said Dan Vaughn, deputy

<HEADLINE> Clinton Team To Focus on Case Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resigned that some witnesses may be summoned,  
President Clinton's lawyers will use past testimony, federal laws 
and the Founding Fathers' own words to dispute that House 
prosecutors have made a lies-and-obstruction case worthy of ousting 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior White House adviser said Monday that ``we can't worry  
about'' the repercussions of delving into the facts of the Monica 
Lewinsky case to aggressively highlight inconsistencies among 
various accounts of witnesses, including some House prosecutors 
want to question. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses ``seem to us to be a foregone conclusion,'' said the  
adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We plan to make the 
most forceful case we can against the evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another source in the Clinton camp said that by focusing on the  
facts of the case, the president's legal team has made a ``major 
shift in strategy'' which will look at contradictions in evidence 
even if it hands House managers a reason to request witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	This source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
presidential lawyers believe ``witnesses will help our case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the witness testimony that could come up in a protracted  
Senate trial: 
</P>
<P>
	--Ms. Lewinsky says that she got a call from Clinton's secretary  
Betty Currie arranging to pick up presidential gifts, a few hours 
after Ms. Lewinsky told Clinton of her concern that she'd have to 
turn over the presents he'd given her to Paula Jones's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Currie says she thinks it was Ms. Lewinsky who initiated  
the gift return and Mrs. Currie has testified that she has no 
recollection of ever talking to Clinton about returning the gifts, 
before or after she picked them up. The Clinton legal team credits 
Mrs. Currie's account, while noting that both witnesses testify 
that the president did not ask Ms. Lewinsky to surrender the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	--In rebutting the obstruction charge, Clinton's lawyers in a  
Senate filing last week highlighted Mrs. Currie's testimony that 
she didn't feel any pressure ``whatsoever'' when Clinton asked 
questions like ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' In 
another part of her testimony, however, Mrs. Currie said she felt 
as though Clinton wanted her to agree with his statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually looking forward to turning the lights on for  
the American people on how little evidence there is to back up the 
smoke and innuendo of the House Republican case,'' former White 
House special counsel Lanny Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond challenging the evidence, the White House is expected to  
make several political points as well: 
</P>
<P>
	--The charges against Clinton, even if proven, don't meet the  
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' standard for impeachment. In a 
Senate filing last week, the Clinton team highlighted the views of 
one of the framers of the Constitution that impeachment refers to 
``great and dangerous offenses'' or ``attempts to subvert the 
Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The evidence doesn't meet the standard that a federal  
prosecutor would use to bring perjury or obstruction charges 
against an average citizen and therefore shouldn't be used to 
reverse the will of Americans expressed in two elections. 
</P>
<P>
	--The differences between Clinton's and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony  
on the details of their relationship -- when it began and what sort 
of intimate contacts it involved -- are insignificant, not criminal, 
and are nothing more than honest differences of recollection. 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton isn't on trial for denying his affair with Ms.  
Lewinsky, something he did in the Jones case, but which the House 
rejected as an article of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most polls show that a majority of the American people think  
President Clinton lied about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
before the grand jury,'' said Davis. ``The American people are 
going to be amazed when they learn that the president told the 
truth before the grand jury about his relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The perjury Clinton is accused of delves with such issues as  
when the affair began. He says it was in February 1996 and Ms. 
Lewinsky says it began three months earlier when she was still an 
unpaid White House intern. She says he touched her in a sexual 
manner in nine intimate encounters. He denies doing so.

<HEADLINE> Jets Give Nod To talk To Belichick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- The Kansas City Chiefs and Chicago Bears  
have been given permission to talk with New York Jets assistant 
head coach Bill Belichick about head coaching vacancies with those 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether he intends to interview with either or  
both, but I gave him permission to do so,'' said Jets coach Bill 
Parcells, who also serves as chief football operations officer. 
``Bill and I have talked about things so I think that will be a 
relatively short process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belichick is the heir-apparent to Parcells as Jets coach.  
Parcells announced Monday that he will return to coach the AFC East 
champions in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets also on Monday re-signed all their assistant coaches,  
Belichick, Maurice Carthon (running backs), Romeo Crennel 
(defensive line), Al Groh (linebackers), Dan Henning 
(quarterbacks), Todd Haley (offensive assistant), Pat Hodgson 
(tight ends), John Lott (strength and conditioning), Eric Mangini 
(defensive assistant), Bill Muir (offensive line), Mike Sweatman 
(special teams) and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said 90 percent of the assistants got two-year  
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The status of veterans Pepper Johnson, Dave Meggett and Keith  
Byars remains uncertain next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells told Johnson he would be looking for a younger  
linebacker while Meggett was told by the coach that he would not be 
kept if it stifled the progress of a younger return man (Leon 
Johnson). Byars is considering retirement, and Parcells told the 
fullback to consider carefully whether he wants to return for a 
14th season. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, which lost the AFC championship game to Denver 23-10  
on Sunday, also signed seven free agents on Monday, including tight 
end Johnny Mitchell, their former 1992 first-round draft who has 
not played football in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell played for the Jets from 1992-95 and then briefly with  
Dallas in 1996 after signing as a free agent. He had 154 catches 
for 2,086 yards and 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he is looking for a good pass receiving tight end  
who can get down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's at the end of the line, he knows that,'' Parcells said.  
``So we'll see what an opportunity it is for him. He's not an old 
guy, he's only 27.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets also signed their practice squad players for next year,  
RB Robert Farmer, WRs Chris Brazzell and Brian Musso, TE Lawrence 
Hart and DT Geno Bell. Former Georgia RB Odell Collins was signed 
as a free agent.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Floats Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Desperate to heal its financial wounds,  
Brazil permanently floated its beleaguered currency on Monday and 
sought to assure the rest of the world that it will drive ahead 
with further tough reforms. Global markets rallied on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan -- anxious to win  
investors' confidence and another piece of a $41 billion 
international aid package -- was in Washington to explain to the 
Clinton administration, the International Monetary Fund and 
investors how his government will meet its reform promises. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Cardoso, meanwhile, defended his government's  
move to end once and for all its expensive four-year defense of the 
currency's value, saying it was a necessary first step in efforts 
to turn around the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving into a new phase where we will need to put into  
place as rapidly as possible the fiscal austerity plan so interest 
rates could fall and Brazil can begin to grow again,'' Cardoso told 
a joint news conference with the heads of both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest 
-- could drag down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and hurt the U.S. economy, which has about 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Central Bank made permanent a temporary decision  
last week to allow the currency, the real, to trade at market rates 
in foreign exchange trading without any intervention. The move 
risks sparking a new surge of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the real -- which closed Monday at 1.59 to the  
dollar -- has plunged 24 percent from its value late Tuesday, just 
before the government made its first steps to devalue the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Before floating the currency, the government had spent $45  
billion of its foreign currency reserves to prop up the real in a 
bid to curb inflation. The Central Bank used to intervene by 
spending reserve dollars to buy reals, driving up their value. 
</P>
<P>
	With the devaluation, Cardoso said, ``we are more dependent on  
ourselves. ... We no longer have to worry about speculators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World markets applauded the news with sharp gains, especially in  
Europe. London's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index rose 3.1 
percent to close at 6123.9, while all Europe's main markets posted 
gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 2.5 percent, while 
Tokyo's Nikkei Average backed off a surge early in the day to close 
up 0.48 percent. Wall Street was closed Monday for Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Brazil's largest market, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, share  
prices closed up 5.4 percent on top of a stunning 33 percent gain 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received around $9 billion of a $41.5 billion IMF-led  
rescue package and it is now seeking the release of $9 billion 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fund is requiring that Cardoso's government first impose  
tax increases and budget cuts to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will undertake all efforts we have submitted to the fund,''  
Finance Minister Malan told reporters at IMF headquarters in 
Washington. ``We know additional measures may be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement that  
he was ``personally very satisfied with the conversations that IMF 
staff and management have had'' with the Brazilian team. 
</P>
<P>
	He welcomed Malan's pledges on attacking the budget deficit and  
said an IMF team would go to Brazil to consider adjustments to IMF 
targets in light of the currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan also met with Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
on Sunday and was to hold talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment requires that we be aware of our responsibilities  
and be austere in balancing our accounts,'' Cardoso said earlier 
Monday as he attended the inauguration of a Volkswagen/Audi plant 
in the southern state of Parana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso is seeking quick approval of austerity measures to cut  
the 1999 budget by about $23 billion. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes pledged to pass the measures as quickly as 
possible even if it means gathering legislators for weekend 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal austerity, plus the free exchange rate, will drop  
interest rates to about 15 percent a year and stimulate economic 
growth, said Paulo Guedes, an economist in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures, which have stalled in Congress, would increase  
social security taxes and place a tax on all banking transactions, 
yielding $4.5 billion this year and $7 billion next year, said 
Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga. 
</P>
<P>
	But approval by the fractious Congress could be complicated by  
increasingly vocal opposition from state governors, who claim they 
lack the means to pay their multibillion-dollar debts to the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Monday in Minas Gerais state, seven opposition  
governors said in a statement they ``will seek a dialogue with the 
federal government for immediate renegotiation of states' debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government, in the midst of its own belt-tightening,  
has refused to renegotiate the states' debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors withdrew their money for fear that the government 
couldn't cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on 
its loans.

<HEADLINE> Russia IOC Member Denies Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A senior Russian Olympic official, one of the 13  
International Olympic Committee members cited in the investigation 
into the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Olympic Committee and a  
former IOC vice president and executive board member, has replied 
to a letter from the IOC demanding an explanation for his conduct 
during Salt Lake's bids for the Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Ratner, a spokesman for Smirnov and the Russian  
committee, said today that Smirnov gave explanations regarding two 
specific cases cited by IOC investigators looking into allegations 
that IOC members sought or received favors from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Both incidents related to a trip Smirnov made to Salt Lake in  
late 1990 or early 1991, Ratner said. At that time, Salt Lake was 
bidding for the 1998 Winter Games, which were eventually awarded to 
Nagano, Japan. In 1995, Salt Lake was awarded the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first case, Smirnov asked officials in Salt Lake City to  
help with the medical treatment of hockey player Alexander Ragulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said the Soviet Union, then teetering on the verge of  
collapse, had neither the funds nor medical facilities to help 
Ragulin, who faced the possible amputation of both his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov wrote letters to officials in Salt Lake City and the  
U.S. Olympic Committee, asking them to help Ragulin and proposing 
to host American athletes in return. Ratner said the bill from the 
Salt Lake hospital was paid by the Salt Lake bid committee. He 
wouldn't say how much it cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly eight years after, Ragulin is fine, walking on his own  
legs and even stepping on ice occasionally,'' Ratner said in a 
telephone interview. ``Vitaly Smirnov feels proud he could help a 
prominent athlete, three-time Olympic champion. He considers that 
as a display of Olympic solidarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second case, Smirnov said he was presented a Browning  
hunting rifle while on the same trip to Salt Lake City. He said he 
couldn't accept it, but the his hosts packed the rifle in his 
luggage without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	While making a stopover in Atlanta on his way to Moscow, Smirnov  
was asked about the gun by customs and was completely bewildered, 
Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov left the weapon behind, but two years later the gun was  
delivered to Moscow by Salt Lake City people. Smirnov turned it 
over to a sports facility in Krasnodar, southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said IOC officials seemed satisfied with Smirnov's  
response, and added that Smirnov would travel to Lausanne, 
Switzerland, to attend a session of the IOC panel Saturday and 
personally answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Smirnov is fully backing the IOC investigation, open to  
any questions and deeply convinced that the IOC will make a correct 
decision,'' Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was one of the most powerful  
and influential figures in the Olympic movement in the 1980s and 
early '90s and a close adviser of IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a first vice president of the organizing committee  
for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. He was vice president of the Soviet 
Olympic Committee from 1969-1991, and president of the Russian 
Olympic Committee since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a member of the IOC executive board from 1974-82 and  
1986-90 and a vice president of the IOC from 1978-82 and 1991-95.

<HEADLINE> Bush Urges Americans To Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Former President George Bush warned Monday that  
the nation needs to shore up the Social Security and Medicare 
programs before millions of baby boomers enter retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't be waiting for the big problems to fall into our  
laps,'' Bush told a crowd of about 700 during a daylong workshop 
sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and 
American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a father of five, I know you don't prepare for the arrival  
of a new baby the week it's due. It just takes a little common 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The workshop, ``Building a Better Future: An Exercise in Hard  
Choices,'' is one of 10 being held across the country to solicit 
debate about keeping the nation's two largest entitlement programs 
afloat for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Without action by lawmakers, it's estimated that Medicare could  
go broke by 2008, with Social Security following suit about 24 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American symbol is an eagle, not an ostrich and now is not  
the time to go burying our heads in the sand,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, who admitted that he is not an expert on  
entitlement programs, said he didn't want to offer his opinion on 
what Congress should do because it might pressure his sons -- 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- to follow his 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the problem of endangered federal entitlements rests  
with President Clinton, who has asked Congress to consider devoting 
the 1999 budget surplus -- $76 billion -- to fix Social Security.

<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- George Irvine, a former player, coach  
and vice president of basketball operations with several teams, on 
Monday was named an assistant coach with the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, 49, joins John Hammond, Gar Heard and Bob Ociepka on  
coach Alvin Gentry's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited to be back on the bench,'' said Irvine, who  
was a scout for Indiana last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine played six seasons in the American Basketball Association  
with the Virginia Squires and Denver Nuggets before a knee injury 
forced him to retire at the start of the 1976-77 season. He then 
worked four seasons as an assistant with the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine was an assistant at Indiana for five seasons, coached the  
Pacers for two years and was vice president of basketball 
operations for eight seasons. Irvine also was an assistant for the 
Golden State Warriors for two seasons.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ex-President Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A former Zimbabwean president convicted  
of homosexual assault and sodomy was sentenced today to 10 years in 
prison, though a judge suspended all but one year of the jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku said former head of state Canaan  
Banana will effectively serve one year in prison if he pays 
compensation to a policeman he was convicted of raping and to the 
family of another officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana's lawyers said they would appeal the conviction and  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana, 63, a Methodist minister and theology professor, fled  
the country in November after he was convicted of 11 sex-related 
charges. He returned on Dec. 15 and has been under house arrest 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana was convicted of using his power as president to force  
bodyguards, a cook and a gardener to perform homosexual acts. The 
offenses occurred from 1980 to 1987, when he served in the largely 
ceremonial role of president. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana was brought to trial after a police inspector who had  
worked as his bodyguard killed a colleague who had taunted him for 
his relationship with the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefta Dube, serving a 10-year prison term for that killing,  
testified that he was forced into a sexual relationship with Banana 
from 1984 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he would rule on bail later today.  
</P>
<P>
	He sentenced Banana to eight years for one charge of sodomy and  
one of ``unnatural acts,'' suspending seven years on condition that 
he commit no further such offenses and pays $6,000 to the victim 
and $6,000 to the family of the police officer who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Banana also received two years for nine counts of indecent  
homosexual assault, with one year suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sentences were to be served concurrently, for a total of  
a year, the judge said.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Kubiak Says `no' to Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After a few sleepless nights, Denver Broncos  
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak rejected an offer Monday to 
become coach at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was ``not good at doing two things,'' Kubiak said the  
past five days -- during which he was preparing the Broncos for the 
AFC championship game against the New York Jets while at the same 
time being courted for the Colorado job -- were unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, after Denver's 23-10 victory, Kubiak said he planned  
to decide ``within 24 to 48 hours'' whether to accept the Colorado 
job, but that regardless he would remain with the Broncos through 
the Super Bowl Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	About 12 hours later, he rejected the Colorado offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today not to give the answer everybody thought I was  
going to give, but I'm here to give the answer from my heart,'' an 
emotional Kubiak said Monday. ``I've thought extremely hard about 
everything. I'm positive I'm doing the right thing, for me and for 
the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I couldn't do this for another two weeks. Those  
kids at Colorado need somebody with a 100 percent commitment to 
getting going. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't go through another day thinking about the next game  
plan and wondering what I'm going to be doing two weeks from now. 
I've got to think about one job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak also insisted his answer would have been the same had the  
Broncos lost to the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak spoke with Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp last  
Wednesday night, and spoke again with him after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave his decision to Tharp, who asked Kubiak to sleep on it.  
</P>
<P>
	They talked again Monday, and Kubiak remained firm.  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the press conference, Tharp issued a statement  
expressing his disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had every reason to believe that Colorado would have a new  
football coach by today or tomorrow,'' Tharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak said he discussed the possible move with Broncos coach  
Mike Shanahan, owner Pat Bowlen, quarterback John Elway, his wife 
Rhonda and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big-time struggle, but everything kept coming up the  
same,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kubiak, who also has interviewed with the Cleveland Browns for

<HEADLINE> States Push Fund for Tobacco Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Faced with shrinking quotas, falling  
demand and several legal questions, tobacco state governors will go 
after money from cigarette manufacturers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Six governors issued a joint statement Monday saying that a  
$5.15 billion trust fund to be financed by cigarette companies is 
``the only viable course of action to ensure the protection of our 
farmers and their future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governors, attorneys general and agriculture commissioners  
of tobacco states are scheduled to meet with cigarette company 
officials Wednesday in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there has been a strong sentiment for guaranteed  
purchases, the potential legal issues associated with this course 
of action may be considerable and would be time-consuming to 
resolve,'' the governors said in the statement. ``The dramatic 
reduction in the intent to purchase tobacco for the 1999 crop 
requires immediate and substantial action to avert financial 
disaster as the 1999 crop comes to market next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina,  
Paul Patton of Kentucky, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Jim Hodges of 
South Carolina, Roy Barnes of Georgia and Don Sundquist of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge the companies to do the right thing by establishing  
this $5.15 billion trust fund to compensate them for part of their 
losses,'' the governors' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations grow out of the $206 billion national tobacco  
settlement, in which the companies agreed to settle suits over 
smoking-related health care costs incurred by the states. The 
settlement stipulated that the companies meet with political 
leaders of tobacco states to talk about the concerns of the 
growers, who were not included in the deal. A first meeting was 
held a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But state and farm leaders acknowledge they have none of the  
legal leverage to get concessions for farmers that states did in 
seeking reimbursement for Medicaid and other health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, Philip Morris, already has said it will contribute  
to the trust fund. But the company also said future payments would 
depend on what is done by the other major tobacco companies -- R.J. 
Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds initially opposed the trust fund, saying a better way  
to help farmers was to promise to buy more American-grown tobacco. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that 
cigarette makers plan to purchase 291 million pounds of burley 
tobacco in 1999, a 31 percent drop from a year ago. And flue-cured 
tobacco quotas are down about 30 percent from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The national tobacco settlement has already produced huge  
increases in the price of cigarettes and is expected to further 
depress demand for farmers to continue their production.

<HEADLINE> Connery's New Film To Open Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His latest character is rumpled, supportive,  
sensitive -- decidedly unlike James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just fine with Sean Connery, who plays a husband  
dealing with marital crisis in the romantic film, ``Playing by 
Heart,'' which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who wears Rockports with a tux,'' Connery told  
the Daily News in its Sunday editions. The character is also a man 
who remains very much in love with his wife of 40 years, played by 
Gena Rowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that life is a dance, as it were -- that intimacy and  
romance don't end when you reach a certain age,'' the 67-year-old 
actor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suave as ever, Connery says he loves the film's optimism and  
takes issue with one reviewer who found the movie a bit 
over-the-top in the romance department. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can a movie be too romantic -- it says something about  
where we are, I suppose,'' he lamented.

<HEADLINE> Is a Devoted Small Audience Better? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The television industry's latest  
buzzword, narrow-casting, doesn't sound at all inviting. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the inverse of broadcasting, which seeks programs that  
appeal to as wide an audience as possible. A successful 
narrow-caster grabs a small, dedicated following and holds on 
tight. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ideal world of narrow-cast television, dad sits on the  
couch watching a football game on ESPN, mom's in the kitchen 
picking up decorating tips on HGTV, little Timmy watches 
Nickelodeon's cartoons in the playroom and teen-ager Jenny blares 
'N Sync on MTV in her room. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe they'll meet later and talk. Probably not.  
</P>
<P>
	Television is losing its status as an electronic campfire for  
the family to crowd around. With digital TV and hundreds of channel 
choices around the corner, those embers are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Narrow-casters, like the WB and cable networks CNBC and  
Nickelodeon, are either gaining in viewers or making fistfuls of 
money, sometimes both. Old-time broadcasters are losing viewers and 
foundering financially and creatively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't particularly look at us as one giant audience any  
longer,'' said Jamie Kellner, chief executive officer of the WB. 
``I look at us as groups of viewers that have to try to be 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner believes television will follow the road that radio has  
taken during the past decade or so. The most successful radio 
companies have fragmented listeners into ever-smaller groups: a 
station for people who grew up with the soul music of the '70s, 
another for fans of alternative rock, talk radio for people who 
like their politics conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB is nominally a broadcaster and won't turn away viewers,  
but it really doesn't care much about anyone over 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner's chief competitor, UPN, failed miserably with its  
stated goal to reach as many viewers as possible in America's broad 
middle class. Now UPN is looking to narrow-cast, eyeing an audience 
of the boys who made ``Waterboy'' a hit movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives of the traditional Big Three networks, in meetings  
with TV critics here last week, all promised not to give up on 
broadcasting. CBS Entertainment President Nancy Tellem blamed 
narrow-casters for many of network television's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to maintain being broadcasters,'' she said. ``And I  
think the problem is that the other guys are really buying into the 
niche programming and, in my opinion, it'll become 
indistinguishable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Based on CBS' audience demographics, rivals consider the network  
a narrow-caster for people over age 50. That's not by design, 
though, and CBS is trying to broaden its base. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC President Patricia Fili-Krushel said her goal is to make ABC  
the first network for as many viewers as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be a broadcast network,'' said Alan Wurtzel, an ABC  
senior vice president. ``And by a broadcast network we want to be a 
network that has something for everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet in some ways, ABC has hedged its bets by drawing up plans  
for dozens of spin-off networks for the digital age. Some day, 
there may be a separate ABC channel for soap opera, another that 
airs comedies, still another for dramas. And Fili-Krushel's own top 
entertainment executives seemingly contradicted her by saying they 
really don't create programs for anyone over 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters listen intently to advertisers who want to hawk  
their wares to young people on shows designed to appeal to them. It 
may ultimately be a strategy antithetical to the idea of 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's decision to fill its schedule with comedies featuring hip  
young urbanites -- designed to entice hip, young and wealthy 
urbanites -- has cost the network respect and viewers, said Dorothy 
Swanson, founder of Viewers for Quality Television, a nonprofit 
citizens' watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	New NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa seemed to agree. He  
said he wants the network's shows to simmer down the sex, be less 
focused on New York and cast a wider ethnic net for actors. ``We 
want to be as broad as possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shows like ``ER'' still pull together millions of people who  
talk about the episodes at work the next day. Even the WB's Kellner 
believes there will one day be a show to match the popularity of 
``Seinfeld.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have those kinds of shows happen,'' he said. ``But when  
you look at the gap between these shows and the rest of them, it's 
getting harder and harder to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television producer Bruce Nash, Hollywood's hottest maker of  
reality shows, was attracted to the TV business by viewing 
experiences like ``Roots,'' the miniseries about a slave family 
that absorbed the nation two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He wonders whether the miniseries would have the same impact in  
today's TV world. It's possible that if ``Roots'' went up against 
his ``When Good Pets Go Bad,'' the marauding animals would probably 
get a higher rating. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, he believes, would be a shame.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	WONDERLAND: Making the TV movie, ``Alice in Wonderland,'' which  
airs Feb. 28 on NBC, must have been a surreal experience. Certainly 
promoting it is. Talking in a film clip shown to critics last week 
while dressed in full costume as a caterpillar, actor Ben Kingsley 
kept a straight face when he said, ``I've always wanted to play a 
segmented worm.'' It's a long way from ``Gandhi.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Woes To Hit U.S. Automakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Brazil's economic crisis is hitting some U.S.  
companies harder than others. Automakers General Motors and Ford 
are sure to receive body blows from the downturn there, but large 
banks like Citigroup have been able to cut back their exposure in 
Brazil following the upheavals in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	A big factor behind Brazil's economic stagnation is the  
government's policy of keeping interest rates a sky-high 30 percent 
in order to keep its currency strong an attract foreign investors. 
The high rates have made borrowing money prohibitively expensive, 
hurting many parts of the country's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Brazil has abandoned its attempt to prop up its  
overvalued currency, many are hoping that interest rates will come 
down. In the meantime, however, Brazil's weakened currency could 
hurt U.S. exports there by making them more expensive to Brazilian 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's recession and high interest rates have already  
clobbered sales of big-ticket items, which many Brazilians buy on 
credit. Sales of autos and household appliances, U.S. industries 
that have significant operations in Brazil, both declined around 25 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ford had hoped to make money in Brazil this year, but now they  
may lose between $100 and $200 million. Likewise for GM,'' said 
Maryann Keller, an auto analyst with ING Baring. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. recently laid off 2,800 workers at one of its  
Brazilian plants, but many of those workers have returned to the 
factory staging protests and demanding their jobs back. Local media 
reported Sunday that Ford plans to shut down its plant until Feb. 1 
because of the disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, Ford spokeswoman Caroline Burke says the  
company remains optimistic about Brazil over the long term and is 
proceeding with plans for a new vehicle plant, the company's fourth 
in Brazil, which will cost $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Whirlpool Corp. has seen its sales of refrigerators, clothes  
washers and air conditioners slump badly in Brazil, but the company 
may actually benefit from the currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak currency makes exporters based there more competitive  
by allowing them to sell their goods more cheaply overseas. That 
could help Whirlpool's Brazil-based maker of refrigerator 
compressors, which is one of the largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not clear what the combined impact of Brazil's  
troubles will be on Whirlpool, chief financial officer Ralph Hake 
says. ``I think we're going to have to let this thing evolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. business are sure to be hurt because of the spending  
cuts expected to be made by large companies and the government, 
which is trying to cut Brazil's massive budget deficit. That could 
hit makers of office equipment like Xerox Corp. as well as makers 
of computers and other high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, some U.S. banks appear to be well prepared  
for the trouble. Ever since suffering losses in the financial 
blowups in Asia and Russia last year, these banks have been 
reducing their risk in volatile developing markets such as Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Citigroup has cut its total exposure in Brazil,  
including loans, investments and other assets, to $3.9 billion as 
of September 1998 versus $4.4 billion at the end of 1997. Banks 
have also been taking more steps to reduce their risk from currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something they haven't just woken up to,'' said Diana  
Yates, a banking analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``They were 
properly positioned for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect consumer products makers like Colgate-Palmolive  
Co. and Gillette Co. to pull through. Sales of daily necessities 
like soap and toothpaste often do steady business even in economic 
downturns. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for a few companies, Brazil's problems may even have a  
silver lining. Avon Products Inc., which counts Brazil as its 
second-largest market outside of the United States, says its 
operations there are ``very robust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon added 100,000 new representatives last year in Brazil as  
people tried to supplement their eroding income. It now has a sales 
force of 500,000 there. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in 45 different countries you're always going to  
have ups and downs in different markets,'' said company spokesman 
Brian Martin.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Considers Using Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Brazil's struggle to steady its  
shaky currency has prompted one Latin American neighbor to consider 
abandoning its own money and adopting a dollar-based economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentine President Carlos Menem has called on his economic team  
to study ways to replace the peso with the dollar in an attempt to 
protect the economy from future financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem also suggested the entire region consider doing the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Pablo Guidotti, a senior economic official, told a local  
newspaper on Monday that there's no deadline for completing work on 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Any plan to switch over to dollars would likely require several  
years of examination followed by approval from Argentina's congress 
and the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a proposal that will be decided in the months to  
come,'' Roque Fernandez, Argentina's economic minister, said on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time Argentina has considered making such  
a switch. The government's talk of dollarizing helped stave off 
more severe effects of the Mexican peso devaluation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists said Argentina's renewed interest in changing  
currencies was intended to distinguish itself from the region's 
more troubled economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem said last week, amid Brazil's economic problems, that  
Argentina would not consider devaluing the peso no matter how 
severe conditions turned. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency has stood strong in the face of the recent economic  
turmoil, bolstered by a plan that pegs the peso to the dollar at a 
rate of one-to-one. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil's struggles have kept Argentina on edge because of  
its deep trade ties to Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries' economies are inextricably linked through the  
Mercosur trading bloc, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay. 
Nearly 30 percent of Argentine exports go to its giant northern 
neighbor.

<HEADLINE> Stones' Jagger May Contest Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mick Jagger's publicity agency has come up with a  
novel argument to contest Jerry Hall's divorce petition: The couple 
was never legally married. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Hall, 42, said Friday that she has begun proceedings  
to end the tumultuous eight-year marriage to the Rolling Stones 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the statement from LD Publicity gave no further details  
on the claim, Britain's national news agency, Press Association, 
said it related to allegations Jagger and Hall's marriage at a 
Hindu wedding ceremony on the Indonesian island of Bali was not 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the 55-year-old Jagger are expected to argue that  
the religious part of the marriage ceremony was completed but not 
the civil part, and that consequently the marriage is not legally 
recognized in Indonesia and so cannot be recognized in Britain, 
Press Association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Though their wedding took place in 1990, Jagger and Hall have  
been together for 21 years and have four children: Elizabeth, 14, 
James, 13, Georgia May, 6, and Gabriel, 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's divorce proceedings followed newspaper reports about a  
29-year-old Brazilian model, Luciana Giminez Mora, who claims she 
is five months pregnant with Jagger's child. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger was divorced from his first wife, Bianca Jagger, in 1979.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons To Take Shot at Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Denver opened as an 8 1/2-point Super Bowl favorite against  
Atlanta, which means the Falcons probably have the Broncos right 
where they want them. Remember, they opened as 10-point underdogs 
against Minnesota in the NFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody paid much attention to Atlanta all season, probably from  
force of habit. That's because the Falcons live in the NFC West, 
dominated for years by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was a perpetual also-ran, with just seven playoff games  
and two postseason victories in franchise history. And everybody 
knows a domed stadium team has never reached the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves pieced together a talented team built around  
the running of Jamal Anderson, who ran for 1,846 yards, and 
journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who has played for six teams 
in 11 seasons. After losing seven of their first eight games under 
Reeves, the Falcons finished last season on a 7-2 roll. This 
season, they picked up where they left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Falcons' key parts are castoffs. Chandler's  
receivers are Tony Martin, who came over from San Diego, and 
Terence Mathis, an ex-New York Jet. The defense is anchored by 
linebacker Cornelius Bennett and safety Eugene Robinson, both with 
Super Bowl experience elsewhere. Bennett played for Buffalo, 
Robinson for Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons sneak up on people. That's how they beat the 49ers  
in the playoff opener, and that's how they beat Minnesota in the 
NFC Championship game. They play opportunistic football, leading 
the NFL with 44 takeaways, 25 fumble recoveries and a plus-20 
turnover differential. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson led the NFC in rushing and all-purpose yards (2,165).  
He had 12 games with 100 yards or more, and another in the playoff 
opener against the 49ers. That helped Atlanta lead the NFL in time 
of possession (33:10). And that will be the Falcons' strategy 
against Denver -- keep John Elway off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos bring a formidable attack to the Super Bowl. MVP  
Terrell Davis led the league with 2,008 rushing yards, the fourth 
2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. Denver likes to spread 
its offense to open running lanes for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Falcons, however, he will face a defense that has  
permitted just one 100-yard rusher in the past 26 games and has an 
NFL-best record of 22-4 over that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Falcons, the Broncos are resilient. Shut out by the New  
York Jets through the first half, they found a way to take over the 
game and won comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they both bring heavy duty running backs to the Super  
Bowl in Anderson and Davis, and capable receivers and defenses, the 
quarterback matchup is vastly uneven. Elway is on his way to the 
Hall of Fame. Chandler is the favorite quarterback of travel agents 
with previous stops with Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Phoenix, the Los 
Angeles Rams and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The head coaches have an intriguing history.  
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves was at Denver -- his teams lost three Super Bowls in  
four years from 1987-1990 -- current Broncos coach Mike Shanahan was 
his offensive coordinator. They were best friends until 1992, when 
Reeves fired Shanahan, believing he was exercising too much 
influence with Elway. The quarterback also was in the middle, 
complaining bitterly about Reeves' style when the Broncos fired the 
coach the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're all back together again in the NFL's ultimate  
showcase, Denver trying to defend its championship and Atlanta 
trying to convince people that it is as good as a 16-2 season 
suggests.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons To Take Shot at Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Denver opened as an 8 1/2-point Super Bowl favorite against  
Atlanta, which means the Falcons probably have the Broncos right 
where they want them. Remember, they opened as 10-point underdogs 
against Minnesota in the NFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody paid much attention to Atlanta all season, probably from  
force of habit. That's because the Falcons live in the NFC West, 
dominated for years by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was a perpetual also-ran, with just seven playoff games  
and two postseason victories in franchise history. And everybody 
knows a domed stadium team has never reached the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves pieced together a talented team built around  
the running of Jamal Anderson, who ran for 1,846 yards, and 
journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who has played for six teams 
in 11 seasons. After losing seven of their first eight games under 
Reeves, the Falcons finished last season on a 7-2 roll. This 
season, they picked up where they left off. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Time Magazine Interviews Judi Dench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She appears on screen as a regal, commanding,  
even frightening presence-- the kind of character who ``if she just 
glanced at you, you'd be pretty dodgy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But watch how British actor Judi Dench -- who plays Queen  
Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love'' -- quivers on the other side 
of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Dench, 64, tells Time magazine in its Jan. 25 editions that she  
can barely stand watching her own performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very squeamish about it,'' she says. ``Once I see it, I  
regret what I've left undone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dench has another confession: After 41 years on the English  
stage, she still gets butterflies.

petrol,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Residents View Tenn. Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Residents of a housing subdivision  
hard-hit by a deadly tornado got their first daylight look Monday 
at the damage -- homes reduced to rubble and debris strewn all 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were killed statewide by twisters and at least 100  
were hurt. At least 600 homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Charles Latham subdivision about two-thirds of 90 homes  
were destroyed by the twister that struck Sunday night. A woman and 
her daughter died there when their home was leveled. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others died in the Jackson area and two died elsewhere in  
the state. Several of those hurt were critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlene Morrow said her sister called to warn her about the  
storm, and minutes later she ran to the bathroom with her 
sister-in-law and 9-year-old niece ``when we heard that train 
sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt like this was the end,'' said Morrow. ``As we got  
in there, it just started caving in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morrow home was destroyed. She and her relatives suffered  
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	After scent dogs finished searching the area for victims,  
Charles Latham subdivision residents who spent the night in 
shelters or elsewhere were allowed back. Amid the widespread 
devastation, an undisturbed dining room table and chairs could be 
seen through a gaping hole in one home. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa McCabe and her husband were taking photos of lightning  
from their deck when they heard the tornado. They ran inside and 
huddled in the bathroom as winds peeled off their roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were praying very loudly to God and he was listening to  
us,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the storm passed, her teen-age son went to check on a  
neighbor and freed him after finding the man trapped under a 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
	The fast-moving storm system that swept across western and  
central Tennessee packed high winds, hail and heavy rain. Tornadoes 
were seen or touched down in 12 counties and damage was reported in 
28 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, a city of 50,000 about 85 miles northeast of Memphis,  
was hardest hit, but wasn't the only area to get severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
	One person died in Henderson County and another was killed in  
Hardeman County. About 35 homes and businesses were damaged in 
Maury County, including Shady Brook Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	About 16,500 customers lost power, including 5,500 in  
Clarksville, according to the Tennessee Valley Authority. At nearby 
Fort Campbell, winds tore off the roof on the Turner Guest House 
and 92 occupants had to be moved. A dozen homes in a subdivision 
near Fort Campbell were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were not prepared for it because it's not the type of  
storm we get this time of year; it's usually April or May when you 
see this,'' said Cecil Whaley, a state emergency management agency 
spokesman. ``We're lucky we didn't have more injuries than we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, whose mother was born in Jackson,  
offered condolences and planned to tour the area Tuesday.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Honors King, Volunteers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After knocking down a wall with  
``therapeutic'' zeal, President Clinton used Monday's holiday 
honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to announce a $6.5 billion fair 
housing settlement reached by enforcing a law passed days after 
King's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, dressed in blue jeans, cited King's philosophy as  
he joined Vice President Al Gore and a team of AmeriCorps 
volunteers in tearing down a wall to make way for a health clinic 
at the Regency House retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	Their work was part of a national focus on volunteerism in the  
spirit of King, the nation's most celebrated human rights activist 
who was born Jan. 15, 1929, and died April 4, 1968, from an 
assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attacked the wall using a hammer with one hand and a  
crowbar with the other. Gore did, too. Tiny chunks of plaster 
pelted reporters standing nearby. They asked Clinton whether the 
work was therapeutic for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all highly therapeutic,'' said Clinton, who gave  
instructions to others and dragged away a set of metal bars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It did the vice president and me a lot of good to pick up  
those hammers and crowbars and tear something down,'' Clinton 
laughed. ``We do this desk work all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the words to one of King's favorite hymns -- ``If I  
can help somebody ... Then my living will not be in vain'' -- and 
said all Americans should heed the call to serve others. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Clinton bought three books at a local bookstore and  
returned to the White House to practice his State of the Union 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	At Regency House, Clinton announced that the Department of  
Housing and Urban Development and Columbia National Mortgage Co. 
had settled a housing discrimination case worth $6.5 billion in 
loans and homeownership programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the Columbia, Md.-based lender will make  
$6 billion in home mortgage loans available over five years to 
minorities and low- to moderate-income families in the District of 
Columbia and 26 states where they did business in 1997. The company 
also will spend $529 million on programs designed to increase 
homeownership among minority and poor families. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia National was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act  
-- which bars discrimination in home sales and rentals -- by making 
too few loans to minority or low- to moderate-income families. In 
1997, its loans to such borrowers totaled only $51.6 million, less 
than 5 percent of its volume; In 10 states, none of its loans went 
to minorities or the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was the eighth settlement negotiated by HUD to resolve  
alleged unfair lending practices uncovered through testing by the 
Fort Worth Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``If companies know we're going to enforce the law, you'll see  
more compliance. And $6.5 billion says we're going to enforce the 
law,'' said Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who attended services 
in Atlanta commemorating King. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final months of his life, King had pressed for passage of  
the Fair Housing Act. Congress approved it April 10, 1968, six days 
after King's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had worked for years to outlaw discrimination in housing,  
and many who voted for the measure said they did it in tribute to 
him,'' Clinton said. ``So here, all these years later, ... we are 
proud that this happened on Dr. King's national holiday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the settlement is the largest of its kind. HUD  
negotiated the second-largest lending discrimination settlement, 
$2.1 billion, with AccuBanc Mortgage last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, announced that the administration will request  
a 15 percent increase in federal spending on civil rights 
enforcement. Last year, the administration asked for an $86 million 
increase and got $64 million from Congress. The administration is 
seeking an additional $84 million this year, to bring the total to 
$663 million.

<HEADLINE> NAFTA Common Currency Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The launch of a common currency in 11 European  
nations is fueling debate in Canada and Mexico over whether North 
America's three trading partners should adopt a comparable monetary 
union. But don't expect a NAFTA-style euro any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Opinion among experts is sharply divided, and Canadian and  
Mexican leaders don't appear eager for swift action on what would 
be a politically contentious project. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they were eager, Washington might not be. U.S. Commerce  
Secretary William Daley said Thursday a North American monetary 
union is a ``very long-term'' prospect -- one that might warrant 
serious discussion ``a hundred years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect the euro to be a success,'' Daley said of the  
European Union's new currency. ``That will not drive us to some 
other integration, currency-wise, with the countries that are our 
neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Canada's ambassador to Washington, Raymond Chretien, echoed  
the views of many Canadian economists when he said the possibility 
of a single currency ``would have to be looked at'' if the euro 
proves a long-term success. 
</P>
<P>
	A common currency could provide welcome stability for Canadian  
and Mexican businesses, which have been buffeted by sharp plunges 
in the values of their national currencies against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But monetary union also would mean at least partial surrender of  
control over budget policies, with decision-making almost certainly 
dominated by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospect of Washington dictating Canadian fiscal policy  
appalls Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a 
nationalist group that lobbied vainly against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	She said monetary union would make it difficult for Canada to  
maintain its social and cultural identity and would give American 
corporations pervasive influence over Canadians' lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly our economic policy would be made in New York or  
Los Angeles,'' she said. ``Canada as a sovereign financial economy 
would no longer exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Harris, an economics professor at Simon Fraser  
University near Vancouver, disagreed, saying Canada could accept a 
common currency without ceding any authority over domestic matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He doubts Prime Minister Jean Chretien's government is willing  
to push for monetary union soon, but says bankers and business 
executives will likely try to put the issue on the public agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Depreciation (of the Canadian dollar) and the emergence of the  
euro are going to rekindle interest,'' Harris said. ``It's not on 
the horizon in the medium term, but if we look over the next decade 
and a half, the idea of a common currency in the Western Hemisphere 
is not out of the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada and the United States are the world's largest trading  
partners, but the relationship has been skewed over the past year 
as the Canadian dollar hovered at an all-time low of around 65 U.S. 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists contend that Canada -- and Mexico as well --  
should establish a fixed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar as a 
possible interim step toward full monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Nason, an American who teaches economics at the  
University of Vancouver, calls that idea ``a disaster waiting to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Something's going to happen, and the markets are going to say,  
`That rate doesn't make any economic sense,''' Nason said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is skeptical that Canadian leaders would endorse any  
moves that gave Washington more say in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Canada's Finance Ministry becomes a junior agency of the U.S.  
Treasury -- why would those guys want to give up all that power and 
prestige?'' Nason asked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican government says it has no plans to push for monetary  
union, but the Finance Ministry and Central Bank have been studying 
the pluses and minuses of linking the peso to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	An influential Mexican think tank, the Private Sector Center for  
Economic Studies, has endorsed the concept, saying the country's 
economy would be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
	In both Canada and Mexico, any politicians who promoted monetary  
union would be taking a risk because of widespread unease about 
U.S. domination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elections are fought, won and lost on these kinds of issues,''  
said Raymond Chretien, who is Jean Chretien's nephew. ``But there 
is no question that if the European model is successful, our 
descendants will have to deal with it.''

<HEADLINE> Wilson's State of the Union Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On an April afternoon in 1913, Woodrow Wilson  
stepped before an irritated Congress, shattered an ancient but 
unwritten rule and gave the modern presidency its voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson chose to deliver the annual message on the state of the  
union in person, not have it read by a faceless clerk as 24 other 
presidents had done. Some senators grumbled he was issuing a 
``speech from the throne'' and wrapping himself in the tarnished 
tinsel of royalty. Congress was ``nettled,'' the Washington Evening 
Star reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday night, nearly 86 years later, President Clinton will  
follow Wilson's example, using his seventh State of the Union 
address to reach beyond his antagonists in the Capitol to the 
nation at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is ignoring grumblers on Capitol Hill who contend an  
impeached president should cancel the speech and wait out his trial 
in the Senate. ``It's like adjourning a trial to have the accused 
give a pep rally before the jury,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
complained Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the 14 presidents who have personally addressed  
Congress since Wilson on April 8, 1913, Clinton has used the State 
of the Union address to energize his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he called on Americans to resist siren calls to slash  
taxes and ``save Social Security first.'' Although Clinton was 
already under investigation for sexual misconduct, the speech 
raised his approval rating in the polls to 71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Clinton, Wilson saw the president's annual message as an  
opportunity too large to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a chance to supercharge his fledgling administration,  
then just a month old. And it was a chance to steal some of the 
still-echoing thunder of that Republican hurler of lightning bolts, 
Theodore Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
	Trumping TR was a point nearly everyone saw, including Wilson's  
wife, Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
	As the presidential car drew away from the Capitol, she leaned  
over and told her husband the speech was exactly what Roosevelt 
would have done ``if only he had thought of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the new president chuckled. ``I think I put one over on  
Teddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The wonder is that in seven years Theodore Roosevelt never  
thought of this way of stamping his personality upon his age,'' a 
New York Times editorial said on April 9, the day after the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution requires presidents from time to time to give  
Congress ``information of the state of the union'' along with such 
proposals ``as he shall judge necessary and expedient.' 
</P>
<P>
	George Washington and John Adams had taken that literally,  
delivering their addresses in person, if not always in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The third president, Thomas Jefferson, had other ideas. The idea  
of the head of state addressing Congress was too much like the 
speech of a British monarch opening Parliament. Better to send a 
message in writing, avoid an unwanted royal trapping and thus 
``fortify republicanism,'' Jefferson believed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dozen presidents did just that, the clerks of the House and  
the Senate droning their often-forgettable words over 112 years. 
Never has such a message produced a sensation, ``often it has 
produced sleep,'' the Evening Star editorialized. 
</P>
<P>
	But now Wilson was making a change, breaking a precedent.  
Congress was astonished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am sorry to see revived the old Federalistic custom of  
speeches from the throne,'' said Sen. John Sharp Williams, D-Miss., 
said at the time. ``I regret this cheap and tawdry imitation of 
British royalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first words before an audience that filled the House  
floor and galleries, Wilson demolished that notion. 
</P>
<P>
	His purpose, he said, was to ``verify for myself the impression  
that the president of the United States is a person, not a mere 
department of the government hailing Congress from some isolated 
island of jealous power, sending messages, not speaking naturally 
and with his own voice -- that he is a human being trying to 
cooperate with other human beings in a common service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After this pleasant experience, I shall feel quite normal in  
all our dealings with one another,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then to the issue at hand: He proposed legislation to cut the  
protective tariffs that for decades had sheltered American products 
from international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	When Wilson actually looked over the packed House chamber ``it  
was all so unusual that it seemed almost unreal,'' the Evening Star 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state of the union address, revived so skillfully by  
Wilson, used masterfully by such presidents as Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, has become in the television age a platform that no 
chief executive would willingly surrender. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Abortion Foe Kopp May Be in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The search for an abortion foe wanted for  
questioning in the sniper slaying of a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor is 
extending to Mexico, a Justice Department official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators have some evidence that anti-abortion  
activist James Charles Kopp, 44, was driven to Mexico by a female 
friend after the Oct. 23 shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a 
52-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist who performed abortions, this 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Customs Service videotape from a border crossing point shows  
the woman's car returning from Mexico later, according to the 
official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine reported that credit card receipts reflect a  
trip to Mexico by the woman. In its Jan. 25 issue, Newsweek also 
said FBI Director Louis Freeh, in Mexico on an official visit last 
week, asked the Mexican government for help locating Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have recovered fibers at the shooting scene that  
are being tested to see if they can be linked to Kopp, the Justice 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is wanted as a material witness in the killing of Slepian,  
who was gunned down in the kitchen of his suburban Buffalo home by 
a rifle shot fired from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said Kopp's car was spotted in Amherst, N.Y., a  
Buffalo suburb, in the weeks before Slepian was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp's 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier was discovered last month at  
Newark, N.J., International Airport, the FBI said. The car had been 
in the long-term lot for about two weeks, said Greg Trevor, a 
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The car had a New Jersey license plate that didn't belong on it.  
FBI Agent Monica Patton in Newark said she couldn't say whether the 
plate had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp is believed to have been working on a construction job in  
the metropolitan New York area two days after the shooting, FBI 
Agent Bernard Tolbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the Slepian killing is linked to four  
earlier nonfatal shootings targeting doctors who provided abortion 
services in Canada and upstate New York.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Considers a 'Ventura Highway' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura took a strange road to  
the governor's office. Now, two state lawmakers want to name a 
highway after him. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Linda Scheid and Rep. Darlene Luther have proposed naming  
U.S. Highway 610, which is under construction between Brooklyn Park 
and Maple Grove, ``Ventura Highway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They say the former professional wrestler deserves the  
recognition because he lobbied Congress for $36 million for the 
project when he was the mayor of Brooklyn Park, from 1991 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ventura Highway'' is the name of a 1972 song by the group  
America. The band played the song at Ventura's inaugural bash 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Ventura shouldn't be singled out for praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would take it as sort of a personal affront if that would  
happen,'' said James Krautkremer, another former Brooklyn Park 
mayor. He was defeated by Ventura in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Krautkremer said Ventura was one of many officials who pushed  
for the $141 million highway and that his contribution came at the 
end of more than two decades of planning and lobbying by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Ventura and other suburban mayors visited Congress  
in 1991, the highway project received $36 million in federal 
funding. Ventura later said that getting the money was perhaps his 
biggest accomplishment and suggested the name ``Ventura Highway'' -- 
saying it would be ``hilarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Darlene Luther's effort,'' Ventura spokeswoman Teresa  
McFarland said. ``I guess I would say it's flattering, (but) the 
governor's not going to be pursuing it necessarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature would have to approve the designation.  
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, whose given name is James George Janos, chose his stage  
name after picking the California city on a map. The highway 
stretching between Ventura and Los Angeles is called the Ventura 
Freeway.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Have Stake in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the impeachment trial of President Clinton entering its  
second week, many blacks spent Martin Luther King Day asking 
whether the proceedings prove that any man embraced by their 
community is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody that I know that is black thinks that if he wouldn't  
have employed so many black folks and passed so many laws that 
benefited them, this wouldn't be much of an issue,'' Armon Henry, 
an Atlanta business owner, said Monday at the Martin Luther King 
Day parade in the neighborhood where the slain civil rights leader 
grew up. ``Clinton really is the first black president we've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of miles away, Victoria Mares Hershey had a similar  
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My question is, are they really hounding him for his personal  
transgressions, or (to punish) him for making his administration 
the most diverse that the country's ever known?'' said Hershey, a 
vice president of the NAACP in Portland, Maine. ``That, to me, 
seems the undertone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks have praised Clinton for his urban policy, focus on  
race relations and record number of black federal appointments -- 
and have rewarded him with their support. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll taken after the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's report last September showed that blacks were more 
supportive of the president than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In Congress, black legislators have followed suit. All but six  
members of the Congressional Black Caucus opposed releasing Starr's 
report, and the entire caucus rose to his defense when the House 
considered impeaching him. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, blacks from all walks of life, at parades and prayer  
breakfasts, at work or at home, said it was particularly painful 
for them to watch the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think black Americans have a lot at stake if President  
Clinton is impeached,'' said Alicia Burbank, a 31-year-old 
homemaker and mother from New Orleans. ``It doesn't take a brain 
scientist to figure out that these are a bunch of right-wing 
conservatives trying to get a liberal Democrat out of the White 
House by any means necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mikel Holt, editor of the Milwaukee Community Journal, a black  
newspaper, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Clinton is removed from office, that's a slap in the face  
for black America,'' said Holt. ``That's in essence, derailing the 
civil rights freedom train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has long enjoyed black support, both from the public and  
in Congress, because he socializes and prays with black people, 
appoints them to high positions and understands the struggle of 
racism, blacks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even summoned King's name and message in Clinton's defense  
-- saying the two men shared a common dream of equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. King would be suspect of the impeachment process because  
he would be suspect of the impeachers,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
said after a breakfast honoring King in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson specifically mentioned Senate Majority leader Trent  
Lott, who was recently linked by his uncle to an ultraconservative 
group accused of promoting white supremacy. Lott denied last week 
that he was affiliated with the group and said he is opposed to 
racism and white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Bailey, a historian and author from Montgomery, Ala.,  
said he too was suspect of some of Clinton's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (blacks) are most uncomfortable with the way matters  
are being handled and with the key players,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few blacks said the trial is an outrage -- no matter what color  
you are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about the same for everybody,'' said Millard Johnson, 58,  
a maintenance man at a downtown Cleveland. ``Congress just doesn't 
have any business fooling with the man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said Clinton is getting exactly what he deserves, and  
that race is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the president lied and the Senate will do what it  
has to do,'' said Alex Mitchell, 20, a student in Lincoln, Neb.

<HEADLINE> Blacks in Ohio Mark King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEFIANCE, Ohio (AP) -- Steve Coleman understands that today's  
holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. probably means 
more to him than it does to his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, who is black, believes many in this rural town see the  
holiday as little more than a day off school or work -- rather than 
a chance to celebrate King's legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a problem with that, I really do,'' Coleman said  
Sunday. ``But I think that's because of a lack of education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While dozens of prayer breakfasts and marches are scheduled to  
honor the slain civil rights leader across the country, many blacks 
scattered throughout Ohio's farming communities and countryside 
will be left to remember King alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Until about five years ago, there weren't any organized  
celebrations for the King holiday in this northwest Ohio town. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Coleman and a small group of friends plan to put up a  
display at the shopping mall to showcase the civil rights leader's 
accomplishments. They'll also hold meetings at churches to remember 
King and educate neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to carry on what he was trying to do, and that's  
bringing people together,'' Coleman said. ``As more of us get 
together and celebrate it makes a difference. The more people 
understand, the more this will grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks make up about 3 percent of the town's 17,000 residents, a  
typical ratio for the area, where more than 90 percent are white. 
Hispanics who came to work in the cucumber and tomato fields 
account for almost everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	While the holiday will be subdued in rural Ohio, several  
thousand people will walk through downtown Columbus before joining 
a King day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cleveland, museums and Rapid Transit Authority rides will be  
free. Later this month, Martin Luther King III, his oldest son, 
will speak in Toledo at the opening of the Conference for Aspiring 
Youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Thomas, 67, lives not too far from Defiance. He's the only  
black farmer in Paulding County, an agriculture-rich area near the 
Indiana border where silos dot the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	He's lived here all his life. His five daughters and their  
families all live within a half-hour drive. On most holidays, 
except this one, they get together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess we never thought about it,'' he said. ``Usually, we  
just watch TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because he grew up in northwest Ohio, Thomas thinks King's  
crusade for civil rights didn't impact him as much as it did the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never really had those kinds of problems,'' he said, also  
admitting that he doesn't know much about King. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot about Martin Luther King,'' interrupted  
Jacqueline Thomas, his 8-year-old granddaughter. The third-grader 
said she uses her home computer to study King and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman hopes that more children, black and white, will take an  
interest in the legacy of King. He plans to speak to elementary 
school classes during black history month in February and believes 
that someday the holiday will take on more meaning for everybody -- 
even here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will just take time,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Two IOC Officials Deny Wrongdoing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two of the IOC's most prominent members, including  
a contender for the top job, are among 13 of the agency's delegates 
under investigation in the Salt Lake City bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's Kim Un-Yong, a powerful member of the IOC  
executive board, and Russia's Vitaly Smirnov, a former vice 
president, denied any wrongdoing Monday. They said they were 
prepared to defend themselves when the IOC inquiry convenes in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday. The six-member panel will make 
recommendations to the full executive board Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating allegations that members or their  
relatives received cash, scholarships, medical care, lavish gifts 
and other inducements from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said last week that nine  
members were accused of ``serious'' misconduct and could face 
expulsion. Four others, he said, were cited for lesser violations 
and could escape with a warning or no punishment at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Members found guilty of corruption will be suspended pending an  
expulsion vote by the full IOC assembly in March. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference in Lausanne, IOC director general Francois  
Carrard said most of the 13 members had replied to letters from IOC 
investigators. The deadline is Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 67-year-old Kim is by far the biggest name on the list, a  
member of the IOC's inner circle and considered a candidate to 
succeed Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	SportIntern, a German-based newsletter specializing in Olympic  
news, said Kim was one of the four members implicated for a minor 
violation and has ``nothing to fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said the allegations were an attempt to defame him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did not do anything that I should be ashamed of,'' he said  
in Seoul. ``I don't even feel it necessary to comment on it, 
because I have absolutely nothing to do with the scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was asked for explanations for help he gave Smirnov  
in getting a 19-year-old Russian woman enrolled in a U.S. 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was simply an effort to help a friend,'' Kim said.  
``Considering a difficult situation in Russia in 1991 after the 
former Soviet Union collapsed, I introduced the student to former 
Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom Welch. I did not receive any money or 
gift in return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the arrangement, including the name of the  
university, were not revealed. Welch, who resigned from the 
Olympics job after pleading no contest to spouse-abuse charges, has 
said Salt Lake bidders ran scholarship programs for 
``humanitarian'' reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Ratner, a spokesman for Smirnov, said two cases cited  
by IOC investigators involved a trip Smirnov made to Salt Lake in 
late 1990 or early 1991, when Salt Lake was bidding for the 1998 
Winter Games eventually awarded to Nagano, Japan. In 1995, Salt 
Lake was awarded the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said Smirnov asked officials in Salt Lake to help with  
medical treatment for ice hockey star Alexander Ragulin. The Soviet 
Union, on the verge of collapse, had neither the funds nor medical 
facilities to help Ragulin, who faced possible amputation of both 
legs, Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratner said the medical bill was paid by the Salt Lake bid  
committee. He wouldn't say how much it cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly eight years after, (Ragulin) is fine, walking on his  
own legs and even stepping on ice occasionally,'' Ratner said. 
``Vitaly Smirnov feels proud he could help a prominent athlete, 
three-time Olympic champion. He considers that as a display of 
Olympic solidarity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the second case, Smirnov received a Browning hunting rifle.  
He said he couldn't accept it, but hosts packed the rifle in his 
luggage without his knowledge, Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a stopover in Atlanta on his way home, Smirnov was asked  
about the gun by customs and was completely bewildered, Ratner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov left the weapon behind, but two years later the gun was  
delivered to Moscow by Salt Lake City organizers. Smirnov turned it 
over to a sports facility in Krasnodar, Russia, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Smirnov is fully backing the IOC investigation, open to  
any questions and deeply convinced that the IOC will make a correct 
decision,'' Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, an IOC member since 1986, has been on the executive board  
since 1988, was a vice president from 1992 until 1996, and is 
chairman of the radio and television commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A key figure in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Kim is president of the  
South Korean Olympic Committee, the World Taekwondo Federation and 
the General Assembly of International Sports Federations. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov, an IOC member since 1971, was one of the most  
influential figures in the Olympic movement in the 1980s and early 
'90s and a close adviser of Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a first vice president of the organizing committee  
for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, vice president of the Soviet Olympic 
Committee from 1969-1991 and is president of the Russian Olympic 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov was a member of the IOC executive board from 1974-82 and  
1986-90 and a vice president from 1978-82 and 1991-95.

<HEADLINE> AOL Pulls Thesaurus After Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online Inc. and Merriam-Webster Inc.  
pulled an online thesaurus after gay rights organizations 
complained about the synonyms given for ``homosexual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thesaurus listed the slurs ``fruit,'' ``homo'' and  
``faggot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Burns, Merriam-Webster's director of marketing, said the  
company decided Monday to remove all synonyms for ``homosexual'' to 
conform with a 25-year-old policy not to offer entries for racial 
or ethnic groups such as Jews, Hispanics or blacks, Ms. Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along the way, we should have incorporated sexual groups into  
that same policy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriam-Webster, a leading publisher of dictionaries and  
language reference books, has also begun a review to check for 
other disparaging entries in its Collegiate Thesaurus. 
</P>
<P>
	``But first, we're making an apology about this. We were in  
error in a couple of ways and we're glad someone has brought it to 
our attention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights groups had asked not that the words be removed but  
that they be flagged as derogatory, said Cathy Renna, a spokeswoman 
for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they are words that people don't know and don't  
use, but in 1999, they are words that should be presented in some 
sort of context,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Three Trains Collide in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPOLEON, Ohio (AP) -- Fog that limited visibility to a few feet  
may have contributed to a crash of three freight trains that killed 
two crew members, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash early Sunday scattered cars over a quarter-mile on  
Conrail's busiest route in the Midwest. One engine burned for hours 
and a handful of homes in Bryan, about 50 miles west of Toledo, 
were evacuated for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	It was too early to determine a cause, Jay Kivowitz,  
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said 
Sunday night at a news conference in the nearby town of Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to speculate, but we'll be looking into the  
weather conditions,'' Kivowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of freight cars and pieces of the trains were scattered  
across the two tracks that run parallel through the flat farmland 
of northwest Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	A train taking mail from Morrisville, Pa., to Chicago hit  
another westbound train carrying trailers and containers from 
Boston to Chicago, said Bim McGeehan, a spokesman for 
Philadelphia-based Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	A third train, with 50 empty cars, hit debris from the crash  
within seconds. The train was traveling east from Portage, Ind., to 
River Rouge, Mich., near Detroit, McGeehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators plan to interview the crews from each train today.  
The on-site investigation will take at least another three days, 
Kivowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were R.H. Bell, 57, of Oregon, Ohio, and R.A. Corell, 52,  
of Angola, Ind., said Conrail spokesman Robert Libkind. First names 
for the dead were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell and Corell were thrown from the engine of the mail train  
and died of head injuries, said Williams County Coroner John Moats. 
</P>
<P>
	The three trains had a total of eight locomotives and 149 cars.  
</P>
<P>
	McGeehan said track, computer and electronic signals are  
supposed to keep trains from getting close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those systems are designed to prevent these kinds of things  
from occurring,'' he said. Investigators did not know how fast the 
trains were going when they hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The rail line is Conrail's primary link between Chicago and the  
East Coast, Libkind said. 
</P>
<P>
	Train traffic was being rerouted through a line in Michigan  
until debris can be cleared and the track repaired.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Pledges To Respect Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio promised Monday not  
to mess up a Thailand beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor's pledge came in response to environmentalists who say  
the sets being constructed on Phi Phi Le for the film star's latest 
movie, ``The Beach,'' are harming the island national park in the 
Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmentalists are worried about the planting of  
non-native coconut trees and the smoothing over of sand dunes on 
Maya Beach, and have tried to get the courts to halt the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Preservation of the environment has always been of utmost  
concern to me, and I would never be part of any project that did 
anything to harm nature,'' DiCaprio said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen extraordinary measures being taken to protect the  
island. And I pledge to remain vigilant and tolerate nothing less 
than these maximum efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The star said he was assured the island would be returned to its  
natural state after the shooting.

<HEADLINE> Part of Expos Stadium Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- A part of the Olympic Stadium's problem-plagued  
roof caved in Monday as some 200 workers were setting up for an 
auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche of snow tumbled down and five people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been at my booth, I would be dead.'' said 28-year-old  
Todd Joel, who was working inside at the stadium at the time. ``It 
was bloody scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel, who is from Toronto and works for a company that sets up  
display booths for Subaru, said the ``the roof has been raining on 
us'' for days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest chapter in the difficult history of the  
stadium, built for the 1976 Summer Olympics and home to the 
Montreal Expos baseball team. The Expos insist they must have a new 
baseball-only stadium to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people were inside the stadium when one of the 63  
panels on the latest edition of the roof -- made of fiberglass with 
Teflon coating -- gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were preparing the stadium for an auto show when the  
mid-afternoon collapse occurred, sparked apparently by recent heavy 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Gilbert, a spokesman for the Montreal fire department,  
said two people were taken to a hospital and three others were 
treated on the scene for slight injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous incidents, chunks of outer wall of the stadium  
crashed to the ground but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The original roof was built to be retractable but didn't work.  
It had to replaced by synthetic material at a cost of about $37 
million Canadian ($24 million U.S. at current rates). 
</P>
<P>
	An American firm, Birdair, has been installing the new roof,  
which is largely complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers setting up for the auto show said they had been told  
repeatedly by the agency that runs the Olympic Stadium not to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the Regie des Installations Olympiques (RIO) told them  
there was a bit of a problem with leaks but everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, water was falling on the Subaru booth. Other booths,  
including the Jaguar and Land Rover displays, also were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can say we are embarrassed by this,'' said Andre  
Huberdeau, vice president of marketing for the RIO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to condemn them (Birdair) but we have to wait  
to have their explanation,'' RIO president Andre Tetrault. 
</P>
<P>
	The RIO recently asked Birdair whether it needed to clear the  
roof because of all the heavy snow and rain. Tetrault said the 
company answered no.

<HEADLINE> Schools To Get Civil Rights Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A handbook on civil rights for students and  
teachers and how they can be protected by school policies is slated 
for distribution this month to schools across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In honor of Martin Luther King Day, the U.S. Department of  
Education on Monday announced the creation of the 60-plus page book 
called ``Protecting Students from Harassment and Hate Crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts Attorney General's Office of Civil Rights came  
up with the idea after visiting schools across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some schools only had policies because there had already been  
a lawsuit or a crisis,'' said Richard Cole, the office's chief of 
civil rights. ``We want schools to look at this handbook, look at 
the examples and set up policies before problems arise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book defines potential violations such as name-calling,  
graffiti, harassment, unwanted touching and physical threats, and 
offers ways to address problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically know about all the racial stuff but a lot of kids  
at school don't know what harassment is or what types of touching 
is cool, or when enough is enough,'' said Thomasina Disola, a 
17-year-old senior at John D. O'Bryant High School in Boston. ``I 
think this guidebook will help a lot.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox have agreed to a $1.1  
million, one-year contract with right-hander Bill Simas, avoiding 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Simas, 27, made $250,000 last year, when he went 4-3 with 18

	Simas limited opponents to a .206 batting average last season,

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout To Last Until Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout will last at least another day  
longer, meaning the upcoming trades of Scottie Pippen and Latrell 
Sprewell -- along with all other league business -- will be on hold 
until Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a written agreement didn't keep teams from pulling  
off deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls agreed to a sign-and-trade deal sending Pippen  
to the Houston Rockets for Roy Rogers and a second-round draft 
pick, and the New York Knicks were expected to acquire Latrell 
Sprewell from Golden State, numerous league sources told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, top free agent Antonio McDyess narrowed his choices to  
Denver and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of other deals were being discussed, including:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Minnesota, Toronto and Denver reaching agreement on a  
three-way trade sending Chauncey Billups to the Nuggets, Dean 
Garrett and Bobby Jackson to the Timberwolves and Micheal Williams 
and two No. 1 picks to the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Los Angeles Lakers sending forward Tony Battie to the  
Boston Celtics for center Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Bulls signing and trading Steve Kerr to the San Antonio  
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those deals cannot be finalized until lawyers  
representing the league and the union finish putting the lockout 
settlement into writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides were huddled away Monday night trying  
to resolve several differences that have popped up, and a Tuesday 
night settlement appeared to be the best-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know for sure tomorrow (Tuesday) whether we'll be  
starting Wednesday or Thursday,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disagreement between the sides concerns the new  
average salary exception, which allows teams already over the 
salary cap to sign an extra free agent. The union wants the 
exception to be used for six-year contracts; the league wants it 
limited to three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a deal worth $67.2 million for  
five years -- with another $15 million in incentives -- before 
trading him, and get forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft 
pick in return, said league sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the  
deal is allowable under NBA rules because Houston will have enough 
salary cap room to fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this 
season will be $10.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, talked to the  
Rockets about signing with them as a free agent. It was not 
immediately clear why he agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, but other 
teams also were discussing similar deals involving Pippen with 
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited about my new career in Houston, and even though  
everything seems to be changing, I hope Bulls fans everywhere will 
understand that it is time for a new era to begin in Chicago,'' 
Pippen said. ``Chicago has been my home for nearly half my life, 
and with family and friends here I will always treat the city as 
home. I only hope the city of Chicago will continue to treat me as 
one of their own. Thanks for all the great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston for the $1 million minimum, giving 
the Rockets a formidable front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem 
Olajuwon, and allowing Barkley to keep his Larry Bird rights for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks apparently won the Sprewell sweepstakes after Golden  
State Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean told all the 
interested teams to make their best offers by 4 p.m. EST Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a three-time All-Star, drew the longest non  
drug-related suspension in league history last season for choking 
his coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear who the Knicks would send to the  
Warriors. New York was believed to be offering forward Chris Mills 
and guard Chris Childs, with Golden State general manager Garry St. 
Jean asking for John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders, and the AP learned that a complicated four-team trade 
involving Golden State, Miami, Cleveland and Boston also was 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	In that scenario, Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along  
with Bimbo Coles and Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State 
getting Brent Barry, Dan Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have 
received Jamal Mashburn and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would 
have received Paul Pierce and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess is expected to decide Tuesday between re-signing with  
Phoenix or going to Denver. The Rockets and Bulls were among his 
earlier choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' agent James  
Bryant said. ``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's 
most at home with those two options: Pheonix is going to stay a 
winner, and Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If McDyess stays in Phoenix, the Nuggets are expected to make a  
final push for Timberwolves free agent forward Tom Gugliotta. If he 
chooses to return to Denver, where he played in the 1995-96 and 
1996-97 seasons, it is unclear what the Suns' fallback plan will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way trade involving the Timberwolves, Raptors and  
Nuggets had been rumored since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP learned of the Battie-Knight trade from two league  
sources. It will reunite Knight with the Lakers, the team he played 
for before signing with Boston as a free agent. The Lakers acquired 
Battie from the Denver Nuggets in last June's Nick Van Exel trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr will sign with the Bulls for $11 million over five years,  
then be shipped to the Spurs. San Antonio was undecided on exactly 
who it would send back to the Bulls, although Monty WIlliams was a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other previously undisclosed deals in the works:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Clippers free agent forward Loy Vaught was close to accepting  
a five-year offer from Detroit for about $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hornets center Vlade Divac was due back from Europe on Tuesday  
to decide between competing offers from Sacramento, the Clippers 
and other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barkley and Rockets guard Matt Maloney were expected to  
re-sign with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hawks free agent guard Eldridge Recasner was close to agreeing  
to a deal with Charlotte for four yars and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Celtics center Popeye Jones was expected to re-sign with  
Boston for $8 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wizards forward Harvey Grant was headed to Philadelphia for  
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the league and union also were squabbling over  
changes to so-called circumvention rules. The league wants to 
prohibit wink-and-nod deals in which a team would sign a free agent 
for one year with the unwritten understanding that a long-term deal 
would follow using the Bird exception. The union contends changes 
to that rule were never discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a realistic chance of getting it done by the  
end of the day tomorrow (Tuesday),'' said Jeffrey Kessler, lead 
outside counsel for the union.

<HEADLINE> Angels Pitcher To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim Angels pitcher Jack McDowell will  
have exploratory arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell, a right-hander who re-signed for $500,000 in December,  
was 5-3 record and a 5.09 ERA in 14 starts last season. He had two 
stints on the 15-day disabled list, once for an inflamed right 
elbow and another for a stress reaction in his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, McDowell was hampered by right elbow problems while  
pitching for Cleveland and underwent arthroscopic surgery to 
alleviate pinching of soft tissue. During his comeback, he 
sustained an elbow bruise that sidelined him for the remainder of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	McDowell first signed with the Angels as a free agent last  
February.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Have Stake in Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At Martin Luther King Day parades and prayer breakfasts, in  
their offices and in homes, many blacks said Monday they have a 
particular stake in the impeachment trial of President Clinton -- a 
man described as ``the best thing that has happened for blacks in a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Clinton is removed from office, that's a slap in the face  
for black America,'' said Mikel Holt, editor of the Milwaukee 
Community Journal, a black newspaper. ``That's in essence, 
derailing the civil rights freedom train.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has long enjoyed black support, both from the public and  
in Congress, because he socializes and prays with black people, 
appoints them to high positions and understands the struggle of 
racism, black leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial entered its second week, some summoned the name and  
message of the slain civil rights leader in Clinton's defense -- 
saying the two men shared a common dream of equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. King would be suspect of the impeachment process because  
he would be suspect of the impeachers,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
said after a breakfast honoring King in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson specifically mentioned Senate Majority leader Trent  
Lott, who was recently linked by his uncle to an ultraconservative 
group accused of promoting white supremacy. Lott denied last week 
that he was affiliated with the group and said he is opposed to 
racism and white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Bailey a historian and author from Montgomery, Ala.,  
said he too was suspect of some of Clinton's critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think (blacks) are most uncomfortable with the way matters  
are being handled and with the key players,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the conservative people who are trying to impeach the  
president come into power, it will be a turnback of the clock for 
Afro-Americans,'' said Edward Lewis Jr., president of the NAACP for 
Idaho, Nevada and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Any current alternative to Clinton could be worse, said Vicki  
Washington, director of Equal Opportunity and Diversity at the 
University of Wisconsin-Extension in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all of our presidents in the recent past, Clinton seems to  
be more in tune with the impact of historic discrimination and how 
it continues to have both a political and economic impact on 
African Americans and other people of color today,'' Washington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, the impeachment itself is being driven by fear of  
minority power. 
</P>
<P>
	``My question is, are they really hounding him for his personal  
transgressions, or (to punish) him for making his administration 
the most diverse that the country's ever known? That, to me, seems 
the undertone,'' said Victoria Mares Hershey, first vice president 
of the NAACP in Portland, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Nan Stovall, another NAACP member from Portland, said Clinton is  
``the best thing that has happened for blacks in a long time,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Heart-Burning Operation Found Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An increasingly common operation in which doctors  
burn away heart tissue to try to eliminate heart rhythm 
disturbances almost always succeeds and carries low risks, 
according to the biggest study ever done of the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the results should encourage doctors to  
consider radiofrequency catheter ablation over drugs when treating 
patients with certain irregular heart rhythms, including a rapid 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This procedure has clearly moved into a front-line therapy of  
choice,'' said Dr. Eric Prystowsky of the Indiana Heart Institute 
in Indianapolis, one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheter ablation was introduced about 10 years ago and has  
grown rapidly, with thousands now performed every year. The 
irregular heart rhythms treated by catheter ablation are usually 
not life-threatening but cause palpitations that can frighten 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheters with heated tips are threaded through blood vessels  
from the groin or an arm or leg into the heart and used like a 
soldering iron to burn away tissue containing nerve pathways that 
cause the heart to misfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers looked at 1,050 patients at 18 hospitals who  
underwent a catheter ablation. 
</P>
<P>
	The irregular rhythm, or arrhythmia, disappeared in about 95  
percent of the patients. A few patients needed repeated treatment, 
and 3 percent developed major complications, including three who 
died within a month of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said there was a 1 percent risk that patients  
would eventually require a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients who fare poorly after surgery ``generally have the  
most heart disease. Some of them are going to die, period,'' 
Prystowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery generally costs $10,000 to $12,000 and up, and it's  
usually covered by insurance, although insurers frequently require 
that drugs be tried first. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies of catheter ablation tended to focus on  
individual, elite hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are numbers we can hang our hats on and will help us  
when we discuss options using this procedure rather than drug 
therapy,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Hugh Calkins of Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth Ellenbogen, director of cardiac electrophysiology at  
the Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, 
commented: ``I think the findings actually are consistent with what 
most people in this field believe, that this is a technique that's 
been around seven or eight years now and is a relatively safe 
technique and it's a very effective alternative to lifelong drug 
therapy.''

<HEADLINE> Ranking of NBA Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the NBA lockout settlement is finally  
signed, it will unleash a flurry of free-agent signings throughout 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 players are waiting to see where they'll be playing,  
and only a handful have reached tentative agreements on new 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some of the top free agents, ranked by position and  
listed with their former team, and the status of their 
negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
 *CENTERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Rik Smits, Pacers: A lock to remain with Indiana with a healthy  
raise from his 1997-98 salary of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff, 76ers: Also a lock to stay with his old team, with  
Philadelphia outbidding several suitors infatuated by the 
shot-blocking machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlade Divac, Hornets: Scheduled to arrive back in the U.S. on  
Tuesday to decide between offers from the Sacramento Kings, the Los 
Angeles Clippers and other teams. Charlotte has almost no chance of 
retaining him. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Austin, L.A. Clippers: Looks like he will end up in  
Orlando after being pursued by several teams, including the Suns 
and Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Arvydas Sabonis, Trail Blazers: Made about $1.7 million for  
Portland last season, and should get a decent bump when he re-signs 
with the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Geiger, Hornets: Has reached an agreement to join the  
Philadelphia 76ers, getting a six-year, $54 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Longley, Bulls: Was expected to sign with Phoenix, but a  
number of sign-and-trade scenarios have developed since then 
involving several teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dudley, Knicks: One of the few big men still considered to  
be available. New York is in danger of losing him to a team willing 
to overpay for height. 
</P>
<P>
 *POWER FORWARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess, Suns: Has narrowed his choices to staying with  
Phoenix or returning to the Denver Nuggets -- the team he played for 
during the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons. Considered signing with 
Houston or Chicago, but decided against both choices. Should make 
up his mind Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gugliotta, Timberwolves: Word last week was that he'd stay  
in Minnesota, but things changed over the weekend with Denver and 
Phoenix re-entering the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayson Williams, Nets: Will stay in New Jersey under a  
seven-year deal that will be worth in excess of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, Bulls: His agent says the Bulls are looking to  
execute a sign-and-trade deal for the seven-time rebounding 
champion, and plenty of teams could use him despite his checkered 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Coleman, 76ers: Has reached an agreement to join  
Charlotte, where he is likely to be the starting center because 
Anthony Mason plays power forward. Will get $40 million for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Henderson, Hawks: Expected to re-sign with Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
	Loy Vaught, Clippers: Leaning toward Detroit, which would pay  
him about $23 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley, Rockets: Expected to stay in Houston and sign  
for the $1.75 million salary cap exception as long as the Rockets 
are able to sign Pippen or Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Weatherspoon, Warriors: The subject of numerous  
sign-and-trade rumors, the strongest of which has him going to 
Miami in a Latrell Sprewell deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Laettner, Hawks: Rumored to be bringing his busted  
Achilles tendon and questionable attitude to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 *SMALL FORWARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen, Bulls: Will either sign in Houston, taking all  
of the Rockets' $9.5 million in cap room, or be involved in a 
sign-and-trade deal sending him elsewhere. As of Monday, the 
Rockets looked to be the likeliest possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fox, Lakers: Expected to sign with Atlanta, taking over the  
starting job from Tyrone Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
	Corliss Williamson: A wild card, with no one sure if he'll stay  
in an unstable situation in Sacramento or be involved in a 
sign-and-trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Robinson, Suns: Asked for too much money from Detroit,  
now might end up staying in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Smith, 76ers: The former overall No. 1 pick, who turned down  
$80 million last season, will be lucky to get one-fourth of that 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPhonso Ellis, Nuggets: For the longest time was rumored to be  
headed to Cleveland, but that talk has died down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Ellis, SuperSonics: Will stay in Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
 *POINT GUARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, Wizards: Best offer figures to come from  
Washington, which can exceed the salary cap to re-sign him for an 
annual salary in excess of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Stoudamire, Trail Blazers: Wants the $9 million maximum  
from Portland, but the Blazers are a few hundred thousand south of 
that mark. Only leverage is to take much less money from Houston, 
but only if Pippen stays away from the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Johnson, Suns: Will not stay in Phoenix, and has been  
rumored headed to several teams, most notably the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Ward, Knicks: Wants to re-sign with New York for an  
average salary of about $5 million, but is wary of Knicks 
immediately trading him. Orlando and Detroit are interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Best, Pacers: Will re-sign in Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	Sherman Douglas, Nets: A valuable backup in New Jersey, could  
leave to become a starter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Murdock, Heat: Drawing interest from the Clippers. The Nets  
also interested if Douglas leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, Magic: Looking to sign with a true contender, be  
it Houston, the Lakers or the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 *SHOOTING GUARDS: 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Bulls: Says he is 99.9 percent retired. Another  
comeback, if there will be one, would likely come next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Chapman, Suns: Played for $326,700 last season, likely to  
get a lucrative new deal that will keep him in Phoenix for the next 
five or six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, Pistons: A lock to re-sign in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jackson, Warriors: The subject of numerous sign-and-trade  
scenarios, but first Golden State must figure out where to trade 
Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Curry, Hornets: Was expected to stay in Charlotte, but  
Miami might have entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Barry, Heat: Would like to go to Golden State as part of a  
Sprewell deal. If that falls through, he could be Jordan's 
replacement at shooting guard for the Bulls.

<HEADLINE>  With Loss, Parcells Talks Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- As much as Bill Parcells talked about  
being physically tired and emotionally drained the day after the 
New York Jets lost the AFC Championship game to Denver, his words 
focused elsewhere -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, Parcells and his players on Monday sounded very  
much like a team intent on ending the Jets' Super Bowl drought at 
31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players that I won't rest,'' Parcells told a packed  
news conference less than 24 hours after a 23-10 loss to the 
Broncos on Sunday left them a victory shy of football's biggest 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them that last year my whole idea is to try to improve  
the team each year. We'll see what we can do to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate agenda was already on the table for Parcells, who  
confirmed Monday that he will return as coach next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old man who is now the only coach to lead three  
teams to conference title games already had a full schedule on 
Tuesday. There was a season-ending meeting planned for his coaching 
staff, administrative conferences to discuss the salary cap and 
free agency and a player-expansion list due. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings had already been held with some players on Monday, the  
coaching staff had been re-signed and permission had been given to 
Chicago and Kansas City to talk to assistant head coach Bill 
Belichick about head coaching vacancies with the Bears and Chiefs. 
There also were seven free-agent signings, mostly practice squad 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	All this from a guy who claimed he was very tired, and who tried  
to reiterate that during his news conference by discussing his 
thoughts at the 2-minute warning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think the same thing,'' Parcells said. ``It's another  
offseason. It's another draft. It's another training camp. It's 
another preseason. It's another regular season and it's another 
semifinal game just to get where you are standing. I can remember 
this feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he felt the same way in 1985 when the Giants lost  
to NFC semifinal to Chicago 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants came back the following year and won the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	When reminded of that, Parcells said there is no similarity to  
the teams, even though he admitted the Jets, who were met at 
LaGuardia Airport by owner Leon Hess, had a lot more chances to do 
things on Sunday against Denver than the Giants had against the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Jets led 10-0 and probably were one big play away  
from putting the Broncos away in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It never came though, and New York was eventually done in by six  
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you this, you don't forget,'' said backup  
quarterback and special teams star Ray Lucas. ``I'm not going to 
forget. It's going to be fresh in my mind. It's two years in a row 
we were almost, almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what Parcells told the team on Monday, Lucas smiled  
confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said: `We'll be back,' so you know it,'' Lucas said.  
``We're all right. We'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sentiment echoed by many players after a 12-4 regular  
season and a 1-1 record in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want a small victory and say: `Woo, we got to the AFC  
championship,''' receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. ``I don't want to 
smile and be happy about that. That's not the case. Everyone in 
this locker room is not happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Vinny Testaverde was one of many Jets who had a  
tough night sleeping, knowing the game was there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lose it the way we did, it's hard to accept,'' he said.  
``If you get blown out, it's easier to accept. Then they were the 
better team and you lost. The good thing is we know we can play 
with the best of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets did on Sunday, but for only 30-plus minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we have accomplished a lot, just thinking about  
it,'' cornerback Ray Mickens said. ``But knowing we could have been 
at the big dance, you really want another shot at that opportunity, 
and we have to wait a whole year for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That year has already started for Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to go through the division next year like we did this  
would be an accomplishment to do that,'' he said. ``But I don't 
think it's impossible.''

	Quarterback Vinny Testaverde was one of many Jets who had a  
tough night sleeping, knowing the game was there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lose it the way we did, it's hard to accept,'' he said.  
``If you get blown out, it's easier to accept. Then they were the 
better team and you lost. The good thing is we know we can play 
with the best of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets did on Sunday, but for only 30-plus minutes.

	``We know that we have accomplished a lot, just thinking about  
it,'' cornerback Ray Mickens said. ``But knowing we could have been 
at the big dance, you really want another shot at that opportunity, 
and we have to wait a whole year for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That year has already started for Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to go through the division next year like we did this  
would be an accomplishment to do that,'' he said. ``But I don't 
think it's impossible.''

<HEADLINE> More Criticism Over Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Community activists are demanding that  
state officials and Olympic organizers take further responsibility 
for the bribery scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	One group has called for the resignations of Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee trustees who stand to make money from the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is seeking approval today of a petition drive that would  
give voters a chance to ensure the state is not saddled with any 
Olympic debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposed measure is intended to insulate the people of  
Utah from the financial folly that will result from the tainted 
Utah Games,'' said Stephen Pace of Utahns for Responsible Public 
Spending. 
</P>
<P>
	His group wants to put the issue of Olympic debt on the Nov. 7,  
2000, general election ballot, and planned to ask Lt. Gov. Olene 
Walker today to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace said he will ask Walker to allow his group to gather  
petitions on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Impact 2002 &AMP; Beyond, a coalition representing low-income,  
disabled and minority groups, wrote again to Gov. Mike Leavitt last 
week, demanding that committee trustees doing business with SLOC -- 
Earl Holding and Alan Layton -- resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't pass the smell test,'' said Glenn Bailey, a leader  
of the coalition. ``It's drilled into everyone in nonprofit 
management: you don't do anything that smacks of self-dealing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holding is the owner of Snowbasin Ski Area, which will get $13.8  
million from SLOC as the downhill and super-G venue, and Little 
America Grand, a massive hotel being built downtown. It is expected 
to be IOC's base during the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton's construction company last fall won a $29 million  
contract to enclose the Olympic speedskating oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt said Saturday he had not seen the letter, but rejected  
the notion that SLOC trustees, appointed by him and the mayor, 
should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be conflicts of interest,'' Leavitt said.  
``There just needs to be a way to disclose them and handle them in 
the appropriate way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layton said he will not resign.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we've done is scrupulously correct,'' he said. ``Their  
whole contention that it's a gray area is offensive because it's 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC requires trustee members to disclose possible conflicts  
and not vote when their businesses are involved. Any deals between 
SLOC and its board members must be approved by an independent 
ethics panel that includes a former Utah Supreme Court justice and 
a former U.S. attorney. The SLOC also has a policy requiring 
contracts of any size be put out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no inside information. My competitors are not missing  
out on any of this,'' said Layton, who recused himself before the 
board in October when it approved Layton Construction Company's 
contract for the speedskating oval in Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
	Layton contends that managing an Olympics requires the ``best  
business minds in this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be extremely difficult to line up such leaders  
who have nothing to gain from the Olympics. For instance, two 
trustees are top executives at the state's largest electric and 
natural gas utilities. Another is chief executive of the largest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Holding will not comment about his role on the board while four  
investigations into accusations that Salt Lake's bid executives 
bribed IOC members to secure the games are under way, said Clint 
Ensign, a vice president at Holding's company, Sinclair Oil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel already has rejected a complaint by Impact 2002  
&AMP; Beyond. In a 1998 letter, the panel said Holding has complied 
with the ethics code because he disclosed his conflicts and 
disqualified himself from voting on the Snowbasin Ski Area 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, two IOC members -- South Korea's Kim  
Un-yong and Russia's Vitaly Smirnov -- are under investigation in 
the Salt Lake scandal but deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, the former IOC vice president and current executive board  
member, was cited for a ``minor offense'' and is not expected to 
face expulsion or other punishment from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the German newsletter Sports Intern identified Kim  
Un-yong as one of 13 IOC members who received a letter from the IOC 
asking for an explanation of their conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not do anything that I should be ashamed of,'' he said.  
``I don't even feel it necessary to comment on it because I have 
absolutely nothing to do with the scandal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov has been asked to explain his request for free medical  
treatment of a Russian hockey player and a hunting rifle he 
received as a gift during a trip to Salt Lake.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Conference on Pedophilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- With child pornography increasingly accessible on  
the Internet, experts gathering at UNESCO for the first major 
international conference on the issue hope to hammer out concrete 
ways to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, 250 participants from 40 countries and  
representatives of 75 nongovernmental organizations will discuss 
ways to improve training for police officers, judges and doctors 
handling cases of child sex abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	They will call for the creation of international hot lines and  
an aggressive campaign to educate children and their parents about 
the dangers of pedophilia on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts will examine the socio-economic conditions that allow  
pedophilia and child prostitution to thrive worldwide, especially 
in developing nations, as well as the international legal framework 
necessary to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
	The online revolution has made it easier for pedophiles to  
access illicit materials, but it also has made it easier for police 
to track them down, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	All Internet users leave a record of their visit on the host  
site and on their own computer. Experts say Internet access 
providers must be pressured to improve their screening of sites. 
</P>
<P>
	INTERPOL's Agnes Fournier-Saint Maur, who heads the  
international police organization's special commission on crimes 
against minors, said it was virtually impossible to determine the 
number of Internet sites providing materials for adults who prey on 
children or to know how many pedophiles access the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fournier-Saint Maur said INTERPOL's figures are based on the  
material seized, which in the United States alone, included 500,000 
online photos showing sexual acts involving minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet facilitates the duplication and recycling of old  
materials, and warned that once a child's photo appears online, it 
is extremely difficult to remove it, she said at a news conference 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Kahn, a French lawyer and expert on Internet law, said  
many sites provide materials that are legal in the countries where 
they are created -- places that also often lack laws protecting 
children against kidnapping for sexual exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
	India, Nepal and many developing nations, including sub-Saharan  
African countries, were cited as places where children increasingly 
are being exploited on screen. However, better cooperation has been 
noted between Western European nations and nations such as Thailand 
and The Philippines, which have notoriously lax policies.

<HEADLINE> Are There Crocodiles in the Amazon? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of those Internet stocks have risen so far  
so fast they defy comparison with anything in the past. They are in 
a class by themselves, a rather unruly one where students set the 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	They put a firecracker under eBay's shares and rocketed it more  
than 1,000 percent in a few months. They put Yahoo! on a catapult 
and snapped the rope. They multiplied Amazon.com's price 55 times 
since it went public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't Johnny add?'' asks Michael Flament as he viewed such  
lack of decorum. Could this be rational, wondered Flament, 
economist and market analyst for Wright Investors' Service, a 
conservative money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His wonderment led him to America Online's performance, which by  
mid-January had multiplied its market value 200 times over 1999 
earnings. Note: That's 200 times expected earnings, not last year's 
actual earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it make any sense?'' he asked after doing some additional  
calculations. He decided to find out how large America Online's 
market value was in terms that could provide some relationship with 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what he found:  
</P>
<P>
	AOL's market value is as large as the entire Standard &AMP; Poor's  
publishing group, including Dow Jones, McGraw-Hill, Times Mirror, 
Gannett, Knight-Ridder, Tribune Co. and The New York Times -- plus 
Eastman Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	These are all wonderful companies, tested in the marketplace and  
through various economic conditions. They have long histories, 
great products, lots of real estate, and experienced workers and 
managements. 
</P>
<P>
	Such comparisons, however, serve only to convince some investors  
that stocks such as AOL are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and 
others to argue that they are incredibly overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
	Flament, therefore, chose Amazon.com for comparison with a  
relatively newer company most people, perhaps excepting regulators, 
think they understand. Microsoft was the 1980s version of a new-age 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, when Microsoft's annual sales were in the same $500  
range as Amazon's are now, it was earning $125 million and its 
stock was valued at a high of $4 billion. It had a price-to-sales 
ratio of 8 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the market value of Amazon stock exceeds $20 billion,  
five times what Microsoft was worth a decade ago. It sells at 40 
times sales and, since it has yet to earn a profit, an infinite P-E 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Microsoft's shares almost 10 years from its 1986 initial  
public offering, during which earnings rose nearly 50 percent a 
year, to expand by as much as no-profit Amazon has in little more 
than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	With professional reserve, Flament concludes that ``it appears  
then that investors in Amazon.com are making some extremely 
generous assumptions about the potential for selling books on the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be argued that nobody can say with certainty that  
Internet stocks are overpriced. Some investors maintain we are in a 
new age were old rules do not apply, and that only the marketplace 
itself has answers. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be true, and probably the majority of investors hope  
it is, but the past, including the recent past, has stories to 
tell, and one of them is how often it's heard that one about the 
dawning of a new era.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Remains Atop AP Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tennessee remained an overwhelming choice as the top team in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll today, breaking a tie with 
Louisiana Tech to become the overall leader in No. 1 rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols received 40 of 41 first-place votes from a media  
panel to lead a top 16 that was virtually unchanged from last week. 
This is the second straight week Tennessee (15-1) has led the poll 
and the 84th time overall. 
</P>
<P>
	There was considerable change in the lower half of the Top 25  
and two teams appeared for the first time this season: No. 24 
Tulane and No. 25 Oregon. Kansas and Boston College dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, which regained the No. 1 spot last week after its big  
win at Connecticut, ran its winning streak to 14 with decisive 
victories over Georgia and Kentucky. The Vols received 1,024 points 
in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
	The only changes in the next 15 places were No. 4 Louisiana Tech  
and No. 5 Georgia trading places and a similar flip-flop involving 
No. 11 Duke and No. 12 Old Dominion. Only two teams in that group 
lost during the past week and both were beaten by higher ranked 
teams: Georgia by Tennessee, and Clemson by Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut was second with 976 points, Purdue third with 947  
and Louisiana Tech fourth with 881. Purdue, which handed Tennessee 
its only loss, received the remaining first-place vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia bounced back from its loss at Tennessee to beat Auburn,  
so the Lady Bulldogs dropped just one spot. Texas Tech, North 
Carolina, Colorado State, Notre Dame and UCLA completed the Top 
Ten. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke and Old Dominion headed the second 10 and were followed by  
Virginia Tech, Iowa State, Rutgers and Clemson. With Georgia 
losing, Virginia Tech (16-0) is the nation's only unbeaten Division 
I team. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State jumped three places to 17th after winning three games  
in the past week, Alabama was 18th, Virginia 19th and Auburn 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	The final five were Florida, Ohio State, Nebraska, Tulane and  
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane (14-2) was ranked for seven weeks last season, making its  
final appearance the week of Jan. 6. The Green Wave's most 
impressive victory recently was a 98-51 rout of Memphis, which was 
ranked 24th at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon (14-3) has won nine of its last 10 -- the loss was by four  
points at UCLA -- to make the Top 25 for the first time since Jan. 
24, 1995. After being ranked the entire 1980-81 and 1981-82 
seasons, the Ducks appeared in the poll only seven times over the 
next 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (13-5), which had been ranked all season, fell out after  
a 20-point loss to Nebraska. Boston College (13-3), which made the 
poll for the first time ever two weeks ago, has lost twice since 
all-Big East guard Cal Bouchard was sidelined by a torn knee 
ligament.

<HEADLINE>  Jets Mistakes Doom Super Bowl Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Bill Parcells warned the New York Jets that if  
they made mistakes, they would never reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right.  
</P>
<P>
	``We helped them along quite a bit,'' the Jets coach said after  
Sunday's 23-10 loss to Denver in the AFC championship game. ``You 
can't make those mistakes and expect to win a championship game. 
Mistakes were the difference in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells built his reputation with the New York Giants and New  
England Patriots as a coach whose teams controlled the ball with 
the running game, made the routine plays and almost never turned 
the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what the Jets didn't do on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	They lost four fumbles and two interceptions, botched a Denver  
kickoff, rushed for just 14 yards, blew a coverage that gave the 
Broncos a long gain and missed a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The misplays prevented the Jets from reaching the Super Bowl for  
the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two fumbles, by usually reliable Keith Byars and  
Curtis Martin, kept them from taking more than a 3-0 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We turned the ball over down in the scoring zone twice in the  
first half,'' Parcells said. ``Our mistakes when we were across 
midfield, and when you factor in the missed field goal, that was a 
potential 24 points out the window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Jets took a 10-0 lead following a blocked punt inside  
the 5 in the third quarter, Denver scored 20 points before the 
period was over. 
</P>
<P>
	First, a mistake in coverage by safety Victor Green allowed John  
Elway to complete a 47-yard pass to Ed McCaffrey, setting up a 
touchdown that made it 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault. I bit on the crossing route,'' Green said.  
``If we had made a stop there, we would have been in control of the 
game. They got a touchdown, and then got the ball back on the 
kickoff, and that changed the whole momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the most disastrous blooper. Jets return man Dave  
Meggett failed to field the ensuing short kickoff before James 
Farrior finally fumbled it away, leading to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was no one else's responsibility. I have to take it  
wherever it goes,'' Meggett said. ``The previous kick came to the 
4, but the wind held the second one in the air and I didn't get a 
good read on it. The wind was very tricky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said the Broncos were basically lucky on the botched  
kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me they intended to kick it that short,'' the  
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Broncos leading 20-10 in the fourth quarter, any hope  
of a Jets comeback ended when Alex Van Dyke fumbled the ball away 
after a reception deep in Denver territory and Vinny Testaverde 
threw two interceptions to Broncos cornerback Darrien Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when it was 20-10, I thought we had a chance,'' Parcells  
said, ``but we continued to make mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most shocking Jets shortcoming was the powerless  
running game. Martin had all of the team's 13 carries and finished 
with 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a man matched up on me wherever I went,'' said  
Martin, a Pro Bowl running back. ``I have to give them credit. They 
wrapped me up and made the tackles.''

	Clinton Lawyers Open Defense Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate impeachment trial resumes tomorrow,  
with White House lawyers ready to rebut what Republicans say was 
hard evidence that President Clinton committed perjury and 
obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Partisan 
differences are hardening over the calling of witnesses, with GOP 
lawmakers saying it's inevitable there will be some testimony and 
Democrats warning that a battle over witnesses could prolong the 
trial for months. Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo today said the 
Senate should have no qualms about consulting public opinion polls 
when considering Clinton's fate. Most polls show strong support for 
keeping Clinton in office.

	Heavy Fighting Reported in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb security forces backed by  
artillery today pounded the hills surrounding an ethnic Albanian 
village where dozens were massacred, ignoring NATO demands for an 
end to the onslaught. Serb and ethnic Albanian sources in Kosovo 
today reported heavy mortar and machine gun fire near the village 
of Racak, where the bodies of 45 ethnic Albanians were found 
Saturday. The renewed fighting raises fears that the fragile 
U.S.-brokered cease-fire in Kosovo was near collapse. Meanwhile, 
Yugoslav border guards refused to allow chief U.N. war crimes 
prosecutor Louise Arbour to enter the country to investigate the 
massacre.

	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- A fierce storm system packing a string of  
tornadoes raced across western Tennessee, ripping apart homes, 
killing at least eight people and critically injuring 11 others. At 
least 60 homes and businesses in the Jackson area were damaged or 
destroyed. Power outages were reported in many areas as high winds 
whipped through the state, snapping tree limbs and power lines. 
Tornadoes were seen or touched down in at least a dozen counties.

	Poll on King Assassination Released  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A new poll shows that only about one in eight  
Americans believe James Earl Ray was solely responsible for the 
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. A telephone survey 
by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that while 12 percent 
believe Ray alone was to blame for the civil rights leader's death, 
46 percent suspect that Ray was aided by others. Ray pleaded guilty 
in 1969 to killing King, but recanted within days. He maintained 
his innocence until his death last year at age 70 while serving a 
99-year sentence.

Yeltsin's bleeding ulcer with medicine instead of performing 
surgery, a news report said. A spokesman said Yeltsin is in stable 
condition. Yeltsin underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in 
1996. Since then, he has suffered several serious respiratory 
ailments, including two bouts of pneumonia, the latest in late 
November and early December. Most doctors believe the treatment 
will last two or three weeks, Interfax said. But Yeltsin won't have 
to turn over his presidential powers.

on a long-term basis, a move seen as a step toward overcoming its 
financial crisis. The country's central bank says it will allow the 
foreign exchange market to define the real's value. However, the 
bank says it may intervene occasionally to prevent what it calls 
disorderly movements in the exchange rate. The Brazilian currency 
fell sharply Friday, on word that Brazil wouldn't use its cash

are under investigation in the Salt Lake scandal but deny any 
wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Calls for Euro Cash Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European finance ministers have agreed  
to consider a Belgian proposal to move up the launch date for 
banknotes and coins in Europe's new currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials ordered a study into the feasibly of a proposal  
from Belgium's Jean-Jacques Viseur for introduction of euro-cash 
``a few months earlier'' than the current planned date of Jan. 1, 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``An introduction from Oct. 1, 2001 shouldn't pose too many  
problems,'' Viseur told the meeting. Belgium's Deputy Prime 
Minister Elio Di Rupo last week said the launch could be brought 
forward by a whole year. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium has argued that shortening the transition period will  
take advantage of public enthusiasm generated by the euro's launch 
on New Year's Day as a non-cash currency used for banking, business 
and electronic transactions in 11 of the 15 EU nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have trouble understanding that this new money ... does  
not exist in the most normal form, that is notes and coins,'' 
Viseur said. ``It's like a company launching a new product that's 
only available in three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal received only lukewarm support from other EU  
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be good, but there are so many technical reasons for  
not doing it,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told 
reporters. ``A big majority feels we can't change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe there's much point in re-opening discussion  
on dates,'' added Germany's Oskar Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU set out the three-year introduction period to allow time  
for minting and printing coins and notes, to prepare the public for 
the changeover and to give banks and other businesses -- such as 
vending machine operators -- time to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the arrival of euro cash, Europe's old currencies  
won't disappear immediately. During a further transition period, 
euros will exist alongside marks, francs, pesetas and the rest for 
up to six months before the final death knell sounds for the 
national currencies on July 1, 2002.

<HEADLINE> Poll on King Assassination Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Only about one in eight Americans believe James  
Earl Ray was solely responsible for the assassination of the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., according to a poll published today. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone survey by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found  
that while 12 percent believe Ray alone was to blame for the civil 
rights leader's death, 46 percent suspect that Ray was aided by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly one-quarter of the respondents believe that people other  
than Ray were responsible for the 1968 murder. About one-fifth of 
the respondents said they didn't know who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to killing King, but recanted within  
days. He maintained his innocence until his death last year at age 
70 while serving a 99-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 818 Southern residents and 394 non-Southerners was  
conducted from Sept. 23 to Nov. 15, and has a margin of error of 
plus or minus 5 percentage points. Generally, there was little 
difference in the responses given by Southerners and 
non-Southerners. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members of the slain civil rights leader believe Ray is  
innocent and supported his efforts in recent years to obtain the 
trial that he circumvented with his plea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very happy that other people share our conclusions that  
there were others involved,'' said Dexter Scott King, son of the 
slain civil rights leader. ``It's encouraging because... there was 
never a full-blown trial to get to the bottom of everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kings' instigation, the Justice Department opened a  
limited probe last year to investigate some aspects of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that a majority of respondents -- 55 percent --  
believe no further investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to stop dredging all this stuff up,'' said poll  
respondent Amy Cecil, 49, a nursing home employee from Lexington, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 35 percent of poll respondents and 50 percent of black  
respondents said they would like to see more federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many questions,'' said Beverly Niemzak, 40, a  
homemaker in Gadsden, Ala. ``I don't know that the investigation 
was ever taken far enough. ...There are too many things that just 
shout that it wasn't done the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks in particular are likely to believe people other than Ray  
were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South, 42 percent of blacks said they believed Ray was  
not involved in the slaying. Outside the South, 46 percent of 
blacks believed Ray was innocent of the crime.

<HEADLINE> Bush Family Not Keen on 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said Monday his wife and twin  
daughters are not keen on seeing him run for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who has said he will announce this spring whether he will  
seek the GOP nomination in 2000, admitted that his wife, Laura, is 
not pushing for the family to be put through ``the meat grinder of 
national politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his daughters, the governor said: ``I haven't met any  
17-year-old child that's anxious to be drug through the national 
spotlight. I would have been the same way at age 17.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush said his family will support him whatever he  
decides. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I choose to seek the presidency, they'll be for me. If I  
choose not to seek the presidency, they'll understand why,'' he 
said. ``I think they're going to love me either way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush commented after speaking at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day  
celebration. He will be inaugurated Tuesday for a second four-year 
term.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Service Marks King's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Crowds gathered at two churches where the Rev.  
Martin Luther King Jr. preached today to hear him hailed as a man 
who ``paid the ultimate price'' so that others could be free. 
</P>
<P>
	No other man in modern times has done more to lift the dignity  
of the common man, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop told a packed Ebenezer 
Baptist Church today during the Atlanta service marking the King 
Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He demonstrated that nonviolence is a way to effect change,''  
Bishop said, speaking from the same pulpit where King once 
preached. ``He lived under constant threat of harassment ... and he 
paid the ultimate price -- death -- so that we may have life and have 
it more abundantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Montgomery, Ala., Gov.-elect Don Siegelman attended a service  
in the church where King preached during the period of the 1955 bus 
boycott that was a landmark in the history of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened in this small sanctuary, what happened in these  
streets outside, changed this nation,'' Siegelman said at the 
Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church. He said that in the 
boycott, which began after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to 
give up her bus seat to a white man, ``a spark ignited that changed 
this nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national holiday honors King and his teachings of  
nonviolence and social justice. Last Friday would have been King's 
70th birthday; he was assassinated in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton was marking the day by visiting  
with senior citizens at a local retirement home as part of an 
Americorps service project. The visit was part of a national focus 
on service in the spirit of the King. 
</P>
<P>
	In Columbia, S.C., today, Gov. Jim Hodges said he wants to make  
King Day a permanent state holiday, removing the stigma as the only 
state without the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is strong support for making Martin Luther King Day a  
state holiday,'' Hodges, newly sworn in as the first Democratic 
governor in 12 years, said at a breakfast honoring the slain civil 
rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you support of my administration to try to bring  
that dream into reality,'' said Hodges, who won election in 
November with strong black support. 
</P>
<P>
	State law currently allows employees to pick any day as an  
optional holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill calling for the day as a required state holiday passed  
the Democratic-controlled Senate last year, but failed in the 
Republican-controlled House. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Atlanta service, King's widow, Coretta Scott King,  
presented the 1999 Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize 
to John Hume, who last year shared the Nobel Peace Prize for his 
efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joseph Roberts, current pastor of Ebenezer Baptist,  
told the audience that there is still a long way to go to achieve 
King's dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in the backwater of yesterday,'' he said. ``The  
jury is still out on American apartheid, even in the state of 
Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., echoed King's words that ``injustice  
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' He said every day 
needs to be dedicated to creating a just society.

<HEADLINE> Michael Wilton Finds Stolen Guitar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Michael Wilton always knew he had a hot  
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s and early 90s, Wilton played his custom-made  
$5,000 ESP Vintage Plus in the heavy-metal band Queensryche, 
recording eight albums. 
</P>
<P>
	But five years ago, Wilton's guitar was stolen -- and presumably  
lost for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last week in a Redmond recording studio, a fellow guitarist  
named Bill Brumlow discovered that he'd been plucking Wilton's 
long-lost property. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was terrified when I found out,'' said Brumlow, who bought  
the guitar two years ago from a collector. 
</P>
<P>
	The guitar was spotted by studio owner Todd Walker as Brumlow's  
band, Dream Train, prepared to play. Brumlow promptly returned the 
guitar to Wilton, asking for nothing in return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated,'' said Wilton, 36, who plans to use the guitar on  
a summer tour. ``There are so many rats in the music business that, 
when something like this happens, it just gives me hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brumlow said Sunday he doesn't know how to contact the person  
who sold him the hot guitar.

	HONOBIA, Okla. (AP) -- Searchers found the wreckage of a small  
plane Monday with the bodies of a doctor and his three young sons 
who crashed in an Oklahoma forest while flying home to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane disintegrated as it went into the ground,'' said Lt.  
Derral Punneo of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. ``There's not any 
recognizable pieces.''

Kiamichi Mountains, directing ground searchers to the site of the

<HEADLINE> New Ala. Gov. Cites Wallace, King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman paid homage at his  
inaugural Monday to leaders who shaped the state -- Jefferson Davis, 
George Wallace, Martin Luther King Jr. -- as he promised to enhance 
Alabama with an administration free of racial divisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman took the oath of office on the same Capitol steps  
where Davis became president of the Confederacy in 1861, where 
Wallace declared ``segregation forever'' in his 1963 inauguration, 
and where King ended the bloody Selma-to-Montgomery march that led 
to passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is our history. Those are our roots,'' said Siegelman, a  
Democrat. ``But today a new generation of Alabamians takes this 
stage. And in God's noonday light, we honor our heritage, unite our 
citizens, rededicate ourselves to Alabama values and stride 
confidently into a new century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman, 52, took the oath of office from former Georgia Gov.  
Zell Miller, who started an education lottery that became 
Siegelman's campaign model for Alabama. Siegelman expects a lottery 
to raise about $150 million a year for free college tuition, more 
computers in public schools and a voluntary pre-kindergarten 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``No child should fail simply because they don't have the money  
to go to college,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Again Delays Windows 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Will Windows 2000 make it out in 1999?  
</P>
<P>
	That's the question at least one analyst is raising after  
Microsoft Corp. said it had again pushed back the release of a new 
test version of its Windows 2000 operating system for business 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a posting Monday on its Web site, Microsoft said the third  
``beta'' or test version of Windows 2000 is now expected out ``in 
the April 1999 timeframe'' with the final version expected to ship 
in late 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the product's in great shape and we just want to  
take the extra few days to put the last final touches on it,'' said 
Ed Muth, Microsoft's group manager for enterprise marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000 is Microsoft's most important new product. The  
massive and sophisticated network software program, which will be 
marketed in different versions for customers ranging from 
individual users to giant corporations, will be Microsoft's primary 
operating system for business and large-scale computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials characterized the latest delay as minor,  
since the most recent date for Beta 3's release had been March. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Rob Enderle, vice president of Giga Information  
Group in Santa Clara, Calif., suggested, however, that Windows 2000 
might not be ready for sale until June 2000. If so, he said, that 
could hurt Microsoft's financial performance next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two big products they have coming out over the next year  
are Windows 2000 and Office 2000'' -- the latter an upgrade to 
Microsoft's business software suite, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporate clients might wait to adopt Windows 2000 until  
after it has a track record and the inevitable fixes are issued for 
problems found in use. And many companies likewise won't make the 
switch to Office 2000, due out later this year, until they are 
running the new operating system, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software delays are hardly rare at Microsoft. Its flagship  
product, Windows 95 and its successor, Windows 98, both were 
repeatedly postponed as testers found things needing to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000, originally known as Windows NT Version 5.0, once  
was expected in 1998. The first test version of the software was 
released in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The second beta was due out last June, but wasn't released until  
September. Microsoft originally had planned only a ``Beta 2 
refresh'' rather than a full-scale third beta, but changed its mind 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said the latest delay ``isn't really a question of  
problems'' in the software. Rather, ``it's a question of fit and 
finish work'' to make sure the beta is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our standards for the beta are very, very high,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's 1998 'Hero' Still Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elaine Kinslow plans to watch Tuesday night's  
State of the Union speech, though she knows it won't compare to 
last year's. President Clinton probably won't mention her. 
</P>
<P>
	And she'll be watching from her Indianapolis home, not from the  
gallery alongside Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	No, this year it is someone else's turn to be plucked from  
obscurity to serve as a living symbol of American achievement -- in 
Kinslow's case, escape from welfare to work. 
</P>
<P>
	The gallery always includes a handful of ``real people'' -- and  
this time Mrs. Clinton will be accompanied by a third-grade teacher 
who champions gun safety, a Boston woman who works with single 
mothers and a Vietnamese refugee who mentors teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
	But a year after her turn in the spotlight, Kinslow remains the  
sort of symbol the Clintons would happily tout. After 13 years on 
and off public assistance -- she's still working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things get hard -- just everyday life. You face struggles every  
day, if the car breaks down or you get sick,'' she said Monday in a 
telephone interview. ``But I've managed to hang in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In retrospect, Kinslow says the trip to Washington meant more to  
her than a few days of excitement.

<P>
	``I just feel a little more confident,'' she said. ``Maybe it's  
being spotlighted like that. I thought, `Gosh, I really did have to 
struggle and didn't realize it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps there's something special about the president saluting  
you in a nationally televised address before the U.S. Congress, 
Supreme Court and Cabinet.

	``Elaine Kinslow,'' Clinton told the assembled dignitaries,  
``and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare 
revolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The standing ovation lasted more than 20 seconds. The first lady  
patted her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinslow's four teen-age children remind her of that moment.  
</P>
<P>
	``My kids say, `Mom, if you managed to get off welfare and you  
went to Washington, then you can do almost anything,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, she was working as a driver for PathFinder  
Transportation Service, which helped shuttle welfare recipients to 
their jobs. She left that job after the company lost its government 
transportation grant and didn't have as much work. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kinslow found another job at an ambulance service. And this  
week, she is moving back to PathFinder, which wants her to do some 
public relations, among other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	After last year's hype, she discovered she likes public  
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping other people are going to say, `Hey, this woman was  
on welfare for a long time and she got off and the president 
recognized her,''' she said. ``If I can do it, anyone can.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Overturns Disney Judgement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A federal judge has overturned a $20  
million jury award won by Children's Broadcasting Corp. against 
Walt Disney Co., saying there was not sufficient evidence that it 
damaged the smaller broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Disney and its ABC Radio Networks division terminated a  
year-old agreement to help CBC find new advertisers and affiliates 
for its Children's AAHS World Radio network, then announced plans 
to launch a rival children's radio service, Radio Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury found last September that Disney and ABC failed to live  
up to the contract and used what they learned from CBC to launch 
the rival network. CBC ceased distributing AAHS World Radio in 
January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled that the facts  
presented in the case did not support the verdict, noting that 
Minneapolis-based CBC was in financial trouble before Disney and 
ABC even entered the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``CBC failed to distinguish between the effects of ABC Radio and  
Disney's wrongdoing and other factors that may have affected CBC's 
business,'' Alsop wrote in Friday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``CBC presented no testimony as to what revenue CBC lost as a  
result of ABC Radio's failure to use reasonable efforts to sell CBC 
advertising or the misappropriation of (trade secrets),'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Children's AAHS World Radio broadcast music, news, stories and  
games aimed at children and their parents. It was carried on a 
network of 32 stations nationally before CBC ended distribution, 
just two months after Radio Disney went on the air.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Will Allow Currency To Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil announced today that it will  
continue to allow its currency to trade freely on foreign exchange 
markets, an important step toward overcoming its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency, the real, has plunged 21 percent since last  
week, when the government said it would no longer spend foreign 
exchange reserves to prop up the overvalued currency. The real was 
trading lower at 1.55 to the dollar today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, share prices rose steeply this  
morning -- up by 8 percent on top of a stunning 33 percent gain 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials fear that if Brazil succumbs to an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest -- could drag 
down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and likely hurt the U.S. economy, which has some 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, Brazil's central bank will let financial  
institutions determine the currency exchange rate by buying and 
selling the real according to their own needs, bank official 
Demosthenes Madurerira de Pinho said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank may intervene in the market occasionally and  
in a limited form with the objective of preventing disorderly 
movements in the exchange rate,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed the market's positive response to  
action taken by the government on Friday, when Brazil announced it 
would temporarily abandon its effort to defend the real's value by 
not dipping into its hard currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the real plunged as low as 1.60 to the dollar before  
strengthening slightly to 1.43 at the close of trading. That was 
down from 1.32 at the close of trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's decline began when the Central Bank tried a  
devaluation of 8 percent on Wednesday, extending the band in which 
the currency could trade to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso spoke today on the condition  
of Brazil's economy during the inauguration of a new Audi plant by 
Germany's Volkswagen in the southern state of Parana. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exchange-policy shift, Cardoso said, ``Brazil is paving  
the way to free itself up,'' in a reference to the country's huge 
dependence on foreign capital in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also vowed to control the inflation that many have  
predicted will result from the devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of experience as a finance minister, when  
inflation was 1,000 percent per year,'' Cardoso said, referring to 
his stint as finance minister under former President Itamar Franco. 
Franco is now governor of Minas Gerais state. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven opposition governors, meanwhile, are to meet today in  
Minas Gerais to discuss renegotiating their debts with the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Franco this month declared a moratorium on his state's  
debts of $10.5 billion, triggering the latest round of financial 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan and new Central Bank chief  
Francisco Lopes met in Washington on Sunday with U.S. officials and 
the International Monetary Fund, which in November put together a 
$41.5 billion aid package for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors withdrew their money for fear that the government 
couldn't cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on 
its loans.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Floats Its Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Desperate to heal its financial wounds,  
Brazil permanently floated its beleaguered currency on Monday and 
sought to assure the rest of the world that it will drive ahead 
with further tough reforms. Global markets rallied on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan -- anxious to win  
investors' confidence and another piece of a $41 billion 
international aid package -- was in Washington to explain to the 
Clinton administration, the International Monetary Fund and 
investors how his government will meet its reform promises. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Cardoso, meanwhile, defended his government's  
move to end once and for all its expensive four-year defense of the 
currency's value, saying it was a necessary first step in efforts 
to turn around the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving into a new phase where we will need to put into  
place as rapidly as possible the fiscal austerity plan so interest 
rates could fall and Brazil can begin to grow again,'' Cardoso told 
a joint news conference with the heads of both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest 
-- could drag down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and hurt the U.S. economy, which has about 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Central Bank made permanent a temporary decision  
last week to allow the currency, the real, to trade at market rates 
in foreign exchange trading without any intervention. The move 
risks sparking a new surge of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the real -- which closed Monday at 1.59 to the  
dollar -- has plunged 24 percent from its value late Tuesday, just 
before the government made its first steps to devalue the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Before floating the currency, the government had spent $45  
billion of its foreign currency reserves to prop up the real in a 
bid to curb inflation. The Central Bank used to intervene by 
spending reserve dollars to buy reals, driving up their value. 
</P>
<P>
	With the devaluation, Cardoso said, ``we are more dependent on  
ourselves. ... We no longer have to worry about speculators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World markets applauded the news with sharp gains, especially in  
Europe. London's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index rose 3.1 
percent to close at 6123.9, while all Europe's main markets posted 
gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 2.5 percent, while 
Tokyo's Nikkei Average backed off a surge early in the day to close 
up 0.48 percent. Wall Street was closed Monday for Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Brazil's largest market, the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, share  
prices closed up 5.4 percent on top of a stunning 33 percent gain 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received around $9 billion of a $41.5 billion IMF-led  
rescue package and it is now seeking the release of $9 billion 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fund is requiring that Cardoso's government first impose  
tax increases and budget cuts to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will undertake all efforts we have submitted to the fund,''  
Finance Minister Malan told reporters at IMF headquarters in 
Washington. ``We know additional measures may be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement that  
he was ``personally very satisfied with the conversations that IMF 
staff and management have had'' with the Brazilian team. 
</P>
<P>
	He welcomed Malan's pledges on attacking the budget deficit and  
said an IMF team would go to Brazil to consider adjustments to IMF 
targets in light of the currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan also met with Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers  
on Sunday and was to hold talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moment requires that we be aware of our responsibilities  
and be austere in balancing our accounts,'' Cardoso said earlier 
Monday as he attended the inauguration of a Volkswagen/Audi plant 
in the southern state of Parana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso is seeking quick approval of austerity measures to cut  
the 1999 budget by about $23 billion. Senate President Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes pledged to pass the measures as quickly as 
possible even if it means gathering legislators for weekend 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal austerity, plus the free exchange rate, will drop  
interest rates to about 15 percent a year and stimulate economic 
growth, said Paulo Guedes, an economist in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures, which have stalled in Congress, would increase  
social security taxes and place a tax on all banking transactions, 
yielding $4.5 billion this year and $7 billion next year, said 
Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga. 
</P>
<P>
	But approval by the fractious Congress could be complicated by  
increasingly vocal opposition from state governors, who claim they 
lack the means to pay their multibillion-dollar debts to the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Monday in Minas Gerais state, seven opposition  
governors said in a statement they ``will seek a dialogue with the 
federal government for immediate renegotiation of states' debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government, in the midst of its own belt-tightening,  
has refused to renegotiate the states' debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil full force in August,  
when investors withdrew their money for fear that the government 
couldn't cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on 
its loans.

<HEADLINE> Billick Dropped From Browns' Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Brian Billick apparently said something the  
Cleveland Browns didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	In a vaguely worded and surprising statement, Cleveland  
president Carmen Policy said Monday the Browns no longer were 
considering Billick, the Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator, 
a candidate to become their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``After having the opportunity to speak further following  
yesterday's NFC championship game, we have come to the realization 
that we have significant philosophical differences related to the 
opportunities available in our expansion situation,'' Policy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our decision to move forward with our head coaching  
search without Brian Billick being part of that consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Browns spokesman said Policy would not expand on the reasons  
for his decision until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, whose Vikings lost the NFC title game at home to  
Atlanta Sunday, was considered the frontrunner for the Browns' job 
after an impressive interview with Policy last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick is one of the NFL's most coveted assistant coaches after  
his offense in Minnesota set several league records this season. He 
was scheduled for an interview with Baltimore Ravens owner Art 
Modell on Tuesday about that team's coaching vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gary Kubiak, another of the Browns' coaching  
candidates, rejected the coaching job at Colorado, and indicated he 
wouldn't be leaving the Broncos anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Policy was planning to interview Oakland defensive  
coordinator Willie Shaw on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw was not on the team's initial list of coaching candidates,  
but got a call after Policy saw him on a videotape sent out by the 
NFL in an attempt to promote minority coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put Willie Shaw's tape into the machine and I was very  
impressed,'' Policy said last week. ``When you watch the tape and 
you hear what the man says, and how he says it. And you understand 
what he's done, and how he has done it. He was very impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy, however, still had to ask the Raiders for permission to  
speak with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy hopes to make his final decision before the Super Bowl  
Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Maloney Seeks Military Abuse Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Carolyn Maloney said today she will ask  
Congress to investigate domestic violence in the military and will 
introduce a bill to ensure that service members accused of such 
abuse face the same penalties as civilians do. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dangerous culture at work, one that we need to  
review, one that we need to address,'' Maloney, a New York 
Democrat, said at a news conference in front of the Armed Forces 
Recruiting Station in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney's comments come a day after ``60 Minutes'' reported that  
the military routinely fails to punish service members convicted of 
even extreme cases of domestic violence, and the rate of spousal 
abuse in the military is significantly higher than the national 
average. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS television program reviewed Pentagon records from 1992  
through 1997 and found that 50,000 military spouses were victims of 
domestic violence, five times higher than the civilian population 
rate when compared with Department of Justice records for the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of Defense William Cohen declined to speak to ``60  
Minutes'' about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Clark, the commanding general of Fort Campbell, Ky.,  
where several particularly violent incidents have occurred, said 
the military does a good job handling domestic violence cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement given to the program, Clark said the Army has  
``taken active measures to prevent, identify and intervene at the 
earliest known occurrence of domestic violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Peter Macdonald, chief district court judge in Kentucky with  
jurisdiction over Fort Campbell, said the Army routinely ignores 
his court orders designed to protect abused spouses. ``They have no 
conception of what's going on in domestic violence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Macdonald issued an emergency protective order  
requiring Sgt. Bill Coffin to stay away from Ronnie Spence, his 
ex-fiancee. She was shot to death in her home in December 1997. 
Coffin pleaded guilty to domestic violence and other charges and 
faces sentencing next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not taking this seriously,'' Macdonald said. ``And if  
they can't take my order seriously, how can they take the issue of 
domestic violence seriously?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheri Arnold, a clinical social worker, was hired by the Marines  
at Camp Pendleton, Calif., to investigate cases of domestic 
violence and make recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	She told ``60 Minutes'' that when she requested military  
protective orders to keep servicemen away from abused spouses, 
superior officers often would say, ``No. I know what's best. This 
is my Marine, and I will take care of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At her news conference, Maloney was accompanied by Gwendolyn  
Young, a mother of three who said military officials did little to 
help her when she complained that her husband, a Marine sergeant, 
physically assaulted her. ``We just didn't know what to do if he 
got violent,'' she said. She is now raising her children alone and 
seeking a divorce.

<HEADLINE> Maloney Seeks Military Abuse Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rep. Carolyn Maloney on Monday called for  
Congressional hearings on domestic violence in the military amid 
reports that the rate of such abuse is five times greater than in 
the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney, D-N.Y., wants her colleagues to focus on the handling  
of the abuse in light of a ``60 Minutes'' report that the military 
routinely fails to punish service members convicted of domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dangerous culture at work, one that we need to  
review, one that we need to address,'' Maloney said from Times 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney's pledge came a day after the CBS television program  
aired its report. She said she intended to file legislation to 
change the way orders of protection are issued and enforced in 
military installations. The bill would also create uniform 
sentencing guidelines so that offenders in the military face the 
same penalties as civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are indications that the military is not taking this  
issue seriously,'' Maloney said. ``It is undisputed that there are 
more cases of domestic violence in the military than in civilian 
life, and that they go unpunished or with just a slap on the 
wrist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civilian law enforcement authorities have no jurisdiction on  
military bases, and military authorities have a great deal of 
discretion in how they investigate and punish offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The military equivalent of an order of protection, called a  
military protective order, can only be issued at the discretion of 
the offender's commander and does not involve a judicial hearing. 
Civilian orders of protection are not enforceable on military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of Defense William Cohen declined to speak to ``60  
Minutes'' about the issue, and the press office of the Department 
of Defense in Washington, D.C., was closed due to the Martin Luther 
King Jr. holiday. A message left on a paging system received no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense has said in the past that its Family  
Advocacy Program is supposed to identify and intervene in domestic 
violence through the use of law enforcement, counseling and care 
for the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Defense has also said that it is difficult to  
compare rates between civilian and military populations because of 
differences in the way they are counted. For example, the military 
counts only spouse abuse, not all domestic violence, and also 
includes reports of emotional and physical abuse that did not 
require medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``60 Minutes'' statistics came from a comparison of Pentagon  
records and Department of Justice crime statistics for 1992 through 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Macdonald, chief district court judge in Kentucky with  
jurisdiction over Fort Campbell, said the Army routinely ignores 
his court orders designed to protect abused spouses.

<HEADLINE> New Matt Groening Cartoon To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Get ready for some more animated  
dysfunction, courtesy of the creator of ``The Simpsons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Groening's new cartoon series, ``Futurama,'' is to make its  
debut this spring on Fox. It features a pizza delivery boy named 
Fry who gets inadvertently frozen in a cryogenics lab on New Year's 
Eve 1999 and wakes up 1,000 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening gave February's Wired magazine a description of the  
show's theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are a loser, is it possible to reinvent yourself? How  
do you deal with the desire for youth, for the return of dead loved 
ones, and what does it mean to be finite in the universe? Boy, is 
this too pretentious or what?'' Groening said. 
</P>
<P>
	The villain is ``Mom,'' a scrawny elderly woman who runs Mom  
Corp. and wears a fat suit to make her look more lovable. Another 
character, Bender, is a corrupt, shoplifting robot who gets energy 
from smoking cigars and drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
	And where will the Simpsons fit in Groening's comic vision of  
the future? 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpsons are still on the air in the year 3,000. Many of  
our favorite celebrities are still around -- they are just 
disembodied heads in jars,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Calls for Big Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American people should be given tax cuts  
to spend the bulk of a projected federal revenue surplus of up to 
$700 billion over the next decade, says the chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a surplus over and above what is needed for Social  
Security,'' Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Sunday on CBS' ``Face 
the Nation.'' ``We're going to give most of that back to the 
American people, as much as $600 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tax cut will start small and then reach full fruition in a  
few years,'' he said, adding it could start at 4 percent and go up 
to 15 percent, affecting people in all tax brackets.

<P>
	Domenici reiterated priorities he favors for Congress to protect  
Social Security, give back the non-Social Security surplus to the 
people with a ``significant tax cut,'' increase military spending 
and direct education aid to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said it might be premature to promise how  
the surplus will be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will talk about the budget in detail during the  
State of the Union speech, reiterating our pledge to save Social 
Security first,'' said White House spokesman P.J. Crowley. ``Beyond 
that, we have to start to realize the actual surplus before we 
start spending the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said his budget panel would have to recruit help from  
other panels such as the Senate Finance Committee and House budget 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici said he believes the plan will have support, adding:  
``We'll have something more precise in a week to 10 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans have been meeting to reach a  
unified front and avoid the standoff that killed their budget plans 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici met this month with Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman  
of the House Budget Committee, to come up with an agreement on 
priorities he mentioned Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unofficial estimate of a $700 billion surplus came from  
Domenici's committee and is based on expectations of official 
numbers to be released late this month by the Congressional Budget 
Office, The Washington Post reported Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Friends Gather for Ali's Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Muhammad Ali was invited into the ring by Mike  
Tyson at a birthday bash for The Greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was a cake shaped like a boxing ring that Tyson  
wheeled out at the private dinner party at the MGM Grand 
hotel-casino. Friends and family chanted Ali's name as he helped 
cut the cake. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Gladys Knight, a longtime friend, was also on hand for  
Ali's 57th birthday Sunday. She and others watched a film that 
traced Ali's life from his birth in Louisville, Ky., as Cassius 
Clay Jr., to his 1960 Olympic gold medal and a career that was 
interrupted when he was stripped of his title for refusing to 
register for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not only the greatest outside, he was the greatest  
inside,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime associate Gene Kilroy told of the time Ali gave a  
struggling senior citizens' home $300,000 during the height of his 
career. When he praised Ali for the good deed, Kilroy said the 
boxer told him: ``Kindness to others is the rent we pay for our 
time on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kilroy also recalled a time when Ali learned a 5-year-old boy  
was dying of leukemia. He visited the boy before one of his fights 
and told the youngster, ``You're going to win your fight, and I'm 
going to win my fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali visited the boy later when he took a turn for the worse, and  
the boy told him: ``I'm going to meet God and I'm going to tell him 
I know you.'' The boy died three weeks later, Kilroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Tyson nor Ali spoke to the crowd, although both posed  
for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson attended the party 24 hours after defeating Francois Botha  
at the casino. Tyson hadn't fought since he was stripped of his 
boxing license 19 months ago for biting Evander Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, who has Parkinson's syndrome, watched Tyson's comeback  
fight and had shown his support for him as he tried to get his 
license back.

<HEADLINE>  Ramadan Ends for Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Muslims in most Middle  
Eastern countries began the feast marking the end of the holy 
fasting month of Ramadan today with morning prayers and visits to 
the graves of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The somber start of the Eid al-Fitr, Arabic for ``the feast of  
breaking the fast,'' traditionally is followed by a round of family 
visits, big meals and lots of sweets. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, thousands thronged to the city's mosques as the  
prayers of clerics echoed from loudspeakers across the city. Later, 
families decked out in their new clothes headed to the Nile for 
boat trips and picnics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eid is a three-day holiday in most countries, although Iran  
feasts for just a single day. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslims in Saudi Arabia and most other Persian Gulf countries  
fasted for a last day from dawn to dusk Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	During Ramadan, Muslims are forbidden to eat, drink, smoke or  
have sexual intercourse between sunrise and sunset. Ramadan marks 
God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book, to the Prophet 
Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramadan comes to a close if the crescent moon is seen on the  
29th day of the fasting month. If the moon is not sighted, the 30th 
day is considered the last day of fasting. No crescent moon was 
spotted over Saudi Arabia or the Emirates on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's state media announced that Iraq also would begin the Eid  
al-Fitr today, as did clerics in the Palestinian territories, 
Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip went on pre-holiday  
shopping sprees Sunday, visiting sweet shops, gift boutiques and 
grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
	As a holiday gesture, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat released  
dozens of prisoners who were held without charges in Palestinian 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
	In Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, the government  
has promised to free 1,600 prisoners to mark the Eid. 
</P>
<P>
	Oman, which began Ramadan a day later than the rest of the Gulf,  
decided the feast would start Tuesday as the crescent moon was not 
spotted Sunday, the official Oman News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Qatar, a tiny emirate in the southern Gulf, candidates  
running for the country's first municipal elections planned to use 
the Eid celebrations to campaign, setting up tents and hiring 
traditional dancers to attract voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in the Emirates announced that hospitals would be  
ready around the clock to receive patients injured in accidents or 
suffering from overeating and indigestion during the feast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Malaysia, meanwhile, police said that 70 were killed on the  
country's roads in the last six days as Muslims raced to their 
hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said 19 people were killed in road accidents on Sunday  
alone and that motorcyclists constituted the majority of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of Ramadan is celebrated in Malaysia as Hari Raya on  
Tuesday and Wednesday. Many stretch the holiday into a long 
weekend.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Will Allow Currency To Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil announced today that it will  
continue to allow its currency to trade freely on foreign exchange 
markets, an important step toward overcoming its financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's currency, the real, has plunged 21 percent since last  
week, when the government said it would no longer spend foreign 
exchange reserves to prop up the overvalued currency. The real 
traded lower at 1.60 to the dollar late today. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, share prices rose 5.9 percent  
to add to a stunning 33 percent gain Friday. Markets in Asia and 
Europe also rose though stocks were mixed in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials fear that if Brazil succumbs to an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest -- could drag 
down other countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunging currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and likely hurt the U.S. economy, which has some 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan today  
sought to reassure nervous investors, the International Monetary 
Fund and the Clinton administration that his country remains 
committed to economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will undertake all efforts we have submitted to the fund,''  
he told reporters at IMF headquarters. ``We know additional 
measures may be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, Brazil's central bank will let financial  
institutions determine the currency exchange rate by buying and 
selling the real according to their own needs, bank official 
Demosthenes Madurerira de Pinho said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Central Bank may intervene in the market occasionally and  
in a limited form with the objective of preventing disorderly 
movements in the exchange rate,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed the market's positive response to  
action taken Friday, when Brazil announced it would temporarily 
abandon its effort to defend the real's value by not dipping into 
its hard currency reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the real sunk as low as 1.60 to the dollar before  
strengthening to 1.43 at the close of trading. That was down from 
1.32 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The real's decline began when the Central Bank tried a  
devaluation of 8 percent on Wednesday, extending the band in which 
the currency could trade to between 1.20 reals and 1.32 reals to 
the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's government pledged to boost taxes and slash spending to  
trim its deficit as part of an agreement in which the IMF assembled 
a $41.5 billion rescue package to keep Brazil from being pulled 
into the economic maelstrom that has already struck several Asian 
nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Fernando Henrique Cardoso spoke today on the condition  
of Brazil's economy during the inauguration of a new Audi plant by 
Germany's Volkswagen in the southern state of Parana. 
</P>
<P>
	By shifting to a floating exchange rate, Cardoso said, ``Brazil  
is paving the way to free itself up,'' in a reference to the 
country's huge dependence on foreign capital in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso also vowed to control the inflation that many say will  
result from the devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of experience as a finance minister, when  
inflation was 1,000 percent per year,'' Cardoso said, referring to 
his stint as finance minister under former President Itamar Franco. 
Franco is now governor of Minas Gerais state. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven opposition governors are to meet today in Minas Gerais to  
discuss renegotiating their debts with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Franco this month declared a moratorium on his state's  
debts of $10.5 billion, triggering the latest round of financial 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil in August, when investors  
withdrew their money for fear that the government couldn't cover a 
$65 billion budget deficit and might default on its loans.

<HEADLINE> Man Starting Christian Tattoo Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Randy Mastre is a tattoo artist of  
Christian themes. He inks Jesus into his customers. 
</P>
<P>
	His tattooed Biblical inscriptions and portraits of Christ  
provide startling contrast to more typical flaming skulls and 
``Born to Raise Hell'' markings adorning the leather-clad bikers he 
rubs elbows with at national tattoo conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at one of those convention that he met the Rev. Daniel  
Ostrowski, a born-again Christian and Word of Faith pastor who runs 
a tattoo parlor in Wausau, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the two decided to unite other Christian tattooers.  
Since then, almost 100 tattoo parlors across the nation have heard 
the call of the Christian Tattoo Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our idea is: Let's take Christianity out of cloistered halls  
and put it right in the forum where people live, and let's make it 
so real, so up-to-date, so today that it impacts peoples' lives,'' 
Ostrowski says. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Mastre, who is studying to be a Pentecostal pastor, ``I  
think the best way to put it is a few like-minded people that are 
trying their very best to share the word of God in a place where 
it's never heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At tattoo conventions, they put up a table and work the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	Some members adopt tattoos that cover their entire backs.  
Tattoos of St. Michael slaying the devil and the Last Supper are 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen hundreds of full-back Christian tattoos,'' Mastre  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastre says he's wanted to start a Christian tattoo group for  
years. He said Christians in the industry need to encourage each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want everybody in the world to think that tattooing  
is the work of the devil because it isn't,'' Mastre says. ``It's a 
beautiful art form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rand Johnson, a tattooer in Willmar, Minn., describes the group  
as a ministry focused on people in the tattoo industry -- and 
whoever else will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, the world of tattoos and tattooing and such  
is a pretty dark world, and as a Christian you want to shed a 
little light in there,'' Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the clergy aren't wild about the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Fargo Bishop Rick Foss says that if somebody has to have a  
tattoo, he'd rather it have a Christian theme. But, he adds, there 
are better ways to spread God's word. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be really surprised if anybody could make a very good case  
in the Bible or the basis of Christian tradition that this is 
somehow a really good thing,'' says Foss, who heads the Eastern 
North Dakota Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Some clergy members who are against tattooing cite a Biblical  
passage in Leviticus, which they say warns, ``Ye shall not make any 
cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon 
you...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mastre argues that the passage is part of the Old Testament, and  
that many rules were changed in the New Testament. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to live by the Old Covenant, they have to do it  
all,'' Mastre said. ``They just can't pick out one thing or the 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian tattoos have always comprised a sizable piece of the  
tattoo market, Ostrowski says. What's new is the effort to 
organize. 
</P>
<P>
	From small Biblical quotations to portraits of Jesus, Mastre  
works in his tattoo parlor in a Bismarck mall. A sign saying 
``Praise the Lord'' hangs above one of his studios, where he'll 
make a small tattoo for $40 to $100. Larger works run from $300 
into the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastre says he also removes about 40 tattoos a month.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know that several times people have come in with demonic  
type of tattoos, and they've become Christian and wanted them 
removed or covered,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Renault Considers Nissan Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- As part of an effort to expand in Asia, Renault is  
considering taking a stake in troubled Japanese automaker Nissan 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	A flurry of news reports over the weekend named Renault as one  
of several companies seriously considering a tie-up with Nissan, 
Japan's second-largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Monday, the French car and truck maker  
said it was ``talking with a number of potential partners, 
including Nissan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reports that Renault, DaimlerChrysler AG and Ford  
Motor Co. might be interested in buying part of Nissan, the 
Japanese automaker said Saturday it would welcome such offers. But 
a Nissan spokesman was quoted as saying by the Le Monde newspaper 
that the company has not yet received any proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Ford, which jointly produces a minivan with Nissan for  
the U.S. market, Renault currently has no ties with the Japanese 
company. Some reports over the weekend, denied by Nissan, said that 
Renault has formally proposed to Nissan that it take a 20 percent 
stake in the Japanese car maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault had a stellar year in 1998, setting a new company record  
for vehicle sales and unseating the VW brand of German car group 
Volkswagen AG as the best-selling brand in Western Europe. Flush 
with cash and highly dependent on the Western European car market, 
Renault is looking for ways to expand in Eastern Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	The French automaker is not alone in seeking partners, however.  
There has been no shortage of speculation about possible mergers in 
the auto industry following last year's big merger of Chrysler 
Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, DaimlerChrysler co-chairmen Jurgen Schrempp and  
Robert J. Eaton plan to visit Tokyo for a long-planned 
Mercedes-Benz event. A meeting of Schrempp and Nissan President 
Yoshikazu Hanawa is reportedly scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Daimler and Nissan officials have been in talks since before the  
DaimlerChrysler merger about a possible deal involving Nissan's 
commercial truck unit, Nissan Diesel Motor Co. Reports that 
DaimlerChrysler was considering a larger investment in Nissan 
itself surfaced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Once one of Japan's biggest success stories, Nissan today is  
struggling to survive under an estimated $22 billion in debt. 
Nissan has lost money in five of the past six years, and saw its 
U.S. sales decline 14 percent last year -- the largest drop of any 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have said the most likely deal would not be a  
merger. Rather, a company would buy a minority position that limits 
the exposure to Nissan's debt while still giving the purchaser 
control. That's the kind of deal Ford has with Mazda Motor Co. and 
General Motors Corp. has with Isuzu Motor Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Testimony Could Be Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both sides in President Clinton's impeachment  
trial could face big risks if Monica Lewinsky is called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare for everybody. We hear so many stories about  
this woman; who knows what the truth is?'' says New York lawyer 
Gregory Joseph, former chairman of the American Bar Association's 
litigation section. 
</P>
<P>
	``In trials, stuff happens. It never plays live the way it does  
on paper,'' added Denver lawyer Larry Pozner, president of the 
National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want the Senate to call witnesses to help  
decide whether Clinton should be removed from office for what he 
did in covering up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting Ms. Lewinsky on the stand could backfire for the  
prosecutors if it turns into a ``sordid sex tell-all,'' said 
Pozner. But she could hurt Clinton too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her testimony keeps alive the issue of perjury and the more  
troubling issue of obstruction of justice,'' said Edward Ohlbaum, a 
law professor and director of the trial advocacy program at Temple 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many have read her grand jury testimony and heard her  
voice in tape-recorded conversations with Linda Tripp, ``You don't 
know how she's going to come across testifying publicly,'' said 
Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers would get a chance to judge her demeanor ahead of  
time. The Senate trial agreement says witnesses will be called to 
testify only if both sides get a chance to question them in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky herself faces no risk, aside from the embarrassment  
of having to testify, as long as she tells the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for immunity from prosecution, she promised  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr last July she would testify 
truthfully in court and in ``congressional proceedings.'' Because 
of the immunity deal, she can't rely on the Constitution's Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination to avoid 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	But if she lies, the agreement can be voided and she can be  
prosecuted for perjury. Therefore, she would be expected to stick 
closely to her previous testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	New York trial lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said Clinton's lawyers can  
try to reinforce Ms. Lewinsky's statement to the grand jury that 
``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my 
silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors can ask about her statement that even though Clinton  
did not tell her to lie, he also did not urge her to tell the 
truth. ``I knew what that meant,'' she told the grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors can ask about presidential secretary Betty Currie's  
retrieval of gifts Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky. And they can try to 
use her testimony to bolster their argument that Clinton lied about 
details of their physical relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	They could do that ``in a G-rated way'' by simply asking her to  
confirm that her grand jury testimony on that question was 
truthful, said John Barrett, a New York University law professor 
and former prosecutor in the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawyers predicted attorneys on both sides will question  
Ms. Lewinsky cautiously to avoid seeming to abuse her, but Barrett 
said they must be ready to be more aggressive if her testimony 
seems to favor the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst things that could happen to the prosecution,  
Pozner said, would be if she were to ``look up and say, 'I said 
before no one pressured me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicastro said Ms. Lewinsky could harm the president by  
testifying that she got a clear impression he wanted her to 
continue covering up the affair as they had before. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Ms. Lewinsky's testimony did not change the known facts  
in a major way, ``The exercise will at least allow the Senate to 
size her up -- test her credibility, memory, motivations, attitude, 
maturity and perception,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how live testimony goes. It's always a bit of a wild  
card,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Renault May Buy Part of Nissan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Renault is considering buying a stake in Japanese  
automaker Nissan Motor Co. as part of its strategy of expanding in 
Asia, 
</P>
<P>
	Renault is ``talking with a number of potential partners,  
including Nissan,'' according to a statement Monday from the French 
car and truck maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Several news reports over the weekend said Renault was one of  
several companies seriously considering a tie-up with Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't exclude, after an in-depth study, thinking about an  
equity participation,'' Renault added. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, responding to reports that Renault, DaimlerChrysler  
AG and Ford Motor Co. might be interested in buying part of Nissan, 
the Japanese automaker said it would welcome such offers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have proposals, we're willing to consider them  
seriously,'' Nissan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Ford, which jointly produces a minivan with Nissan for

<HEADLINE> Clinton Prepares State of the Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rehearsed a State of the  
Union address brimming with ideas on education, health care and 
other initiatives likely to get a chilly reception from a Congress 
bitterly divided by the impeachment ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's lawyers reviewed the legal defense they will begin  
presenting on his behalf Tuesday, Education Secretary Richard Riley 
previewed one of the president's top education priorities: to hold 
states and school districts accountable for the achievements of 
students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	States that fail to end social promotions and set standards  
could lose some federal education aid. ``Most of our schools are 
doing very well and are involved in this standards movement in a 
very exciting way,'' Riley said. ``Yet there are places out there 
that things aren't happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another preview Monday, the administration said Clinton would  
propose a tax credit of up to $500 per child, age 1 or younger, to 
offset costs for parents who choose to stay home to care for their 
kids. The proposal is part of a larger child care package that 
seeks $18 billion over five years to aid working poor and 
middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also floated a proposal for $1 billion over  
five years to improve health care for many of the nation's 32 
million uninsured adults. The money would be used to encourage 
community clinics and hospitals to work together to keep track of 
patients and make sure they get needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a prime-time television audience, Clinton will deliver  
his State of the Union address at 9 p.m. EST Tuesday in the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in that same chamber one month ago Tuesday that the House  
voted for only the second time in history to impeach the president. 
The only other time was when Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 
and went on to survive by one vote in a Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	To build support, the White House Office of Public Liaison sent  
out faxes urging supporters to hold State of the Union watch 
parties at club and union halls -- and to tell news outlets about 
the gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll from the Pew Research Center said the Senate trial  
has not changed Americans' minds about turning Clinton out of 
office, and that two-thirds of the public wants him to stay. The 
survey indicated 53 percent of Americans are satisfied with the way 
things are going in the country, and said 63 percent of the people 
approve of his performance in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, Clinton's House accusers and Senate jurors will  
listen as the president speaks for an hour or more about his agenda 
for the country. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, after presiding 
over Clinton's Senate trial, could be among the spectators in the 
House. The president, according to aides, will not mention the 
impeachment drama. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert sent House members a ``Dear  
Colleague'' letter telling them to be on good behavior despite 
``the discomfort'' surrounding the Senate trial. ``Out of respect 
for the office of the president and for the state of our union,'' 
Hastert wrote, ``we will listen to the president's remarks soberly 
and with the dignity that befits the United States Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton would be  
addressing the American people as much as the members of the House 
and Senate. Lockhart said the president ``is always comfortable 
when he's dealing with issues, dealing with issues that impact real 
people's lives and dealing with how the government can help provide 
the tools that people need at home and at work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton challenged Congress to reserve all of the  
burgeoning budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.'' This 
year, he is expected to urge Congress to join the administration in 
a bipartisan campaign to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the fanfare and detail about Clinton's proposals, White  
House officials acknowledge that the Republican-led Congress will 
have its own ideas and won't be eager to rubber-stamp the ideas of 
a president that the GOP wants to oust from office. But both sides 
recognize that ideas for fixing Social Security and improving 
schools are popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will renew calls to increase the minimum wage, build new  
schools, impose a national settlement on the tobacco industry, 
reform the campaign finance system, increase Pentagon spending by 
$110 billion over six years and allow Americans as young as 55 
years old buy into the Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign policy, he will emphasize the importance of fighting  
terrorism and call on the Senate again to ratify the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. He will call for expanding cooperation and 
assistance to the former Soviet Union to strengthen the safety and 
security of nuclear stockpiles, proposing incentives for Russian 
weapons experts to study nonmilitary research.

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Next stop for Joe DiMaggio, Yankee  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, that's correct.  
</P>
<P>
	After 99 days in intensive care, after lung cancer surgery,  
pneumonia, and an infection that nearly killed him and left him in 
a coma, Joe DiMaggio went home Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's getting ready for a return to the Bronx, where he hopes  
to throw out the ceremonial first pitch on opening day April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	The 84-year-old Yankee Clipper received last rites after he  
lapsed into a coma last month. But each time doctors said he 
probably wouldn't survive, DiMaggio proved them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. DiMaggio wishes to express his thanks to the doctors, ICU  
nurses and staff at Memorial Regional Hospital, for helping him 
recover from infectious pneumonia, as well as to the 250 million 
people out there who are praying for him,'' his lawyer, Morris 
Engelberg, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. DiMaggio is looking forward to opening day in Yankee  
Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The notoriously private DiMaggio left the hospital with little  
fanfare at about 9:30 a.m. Some hospital workers said they didn't 
realize he had left. 
</P>
<P>
	Other details were not disclosed. A message left at Engelberg's  
office was not immediately returned, and Dr. Earl Barron's office 
said the doctor had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	WTVJ Channel 6 in Miami reported that DiMaggio would continue  
his recovery at home. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, voted baseball's greatest living player in 1969,  
entered the hospital Oct. 12 and had surgery two days later to 
remove a cancerous lung tumor. He had a series of setbacks after a 
serious infection set in. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 10-11, DiMaggio was in a coma and near death, with  
Barron calling it a ``very dire situation.'' DiMaggio's family came 
to his bedside, but the Hall of Famer awakened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's completely unexpected,'' Barron said at the time,  
attributing the turnaround to a decision to administer an 
antibiotic intravenously rather than orally. 
</P>
<P>
	After he came out of the coma, DiMaggio ordered doctors to stop  
giving public updates on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 5 1/2 weeks ago, even some of DiMaggio's closest friends had  
given up hope. His family signed a ``do not resuscitate'' order, 
which Barron said would allow DiMaggio to die with a ``measure of 
dignity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner visited DiMaggio in  
early January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe will certainly toss out the first ball,'' Steinbrenner  
said. ``It's a wonderful moment for me personally and for the 
fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio was the Yankees center fielder from 1936 to 1951,  
except for three seasons he missed while serving in World War II. 
During that time he played for 10 pennant winners and nine World 
Series champions, batted .325, hit 361 home runs and, in 1941, had 
a hitting streak that lasted a record 56 games.

<HEADLINE> Software Can Help With Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service says its mission is to ``Provide  
America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand 
and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law 
with integrity and fairness to all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which is a little like Death helping you to ``understand and  
meet your fate.'' But Death -- at least for the deceased -- requires 
much less paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter tax-preparation software, which promises to make the chore  
easy, quick and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for some taxpayers, it does. I've been using Quicken  
TurboTax by Intuit for years, and it has always delivered a 
thoughtful user interface, intelligent help screens and accurate 
calculation. As do most of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	But if there's a ``Best of Breed'' for tax-prep software, it's  
TurboTax (MacInTax for the Mac crowd). 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will let you file your return toll-free by telephone  
(called TeleFile) if your income is less than $56,950 (single) or 
$62,500 (married, filing jointly) and you meet a few other easy 
requirements. So, if you qualify, this is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	But if 1998 was a good year and you exceeded those income  
levels, consider tax-prep software. However, don't rush to buy a 
program just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	If you had income from several sources, including a couple of  
businesses and stocks, your return might be too complex for the 
software, which depends on you to make some key assumptions and 
which you might make in error. 
</P>
<P>
	And if you haven't been diligent about keeping financial  
records, whether on computer or in ledger books, tax-prep software 
can't help. For example, if you have no clue when you're asked 
about charitable contributions, don't buy a program. Tax-prep 
software helps you submit the results of your yearlong 
organization, but it doesn't supply the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	People who work in one tax jurisdiction and live in another can  
often be aided by tax software, which will automatically copy all 
information from the federal form and waltz it through various 
state and city tax returns.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Tornadoes Rip Through Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- A string of tornadoes raced across western  
Tennessee, ripping apart homes, killing at least eight people and 
critically injuring 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the deaths Sunday evening came when a tornado touched  
down in Madison County, said Kurt Pickering, spokesman for the 
state's Emergency Management Agency. At least 71 county residents 
were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the deaths came in a subdivision just south of downtown  
Jackson, a town of nearly 50,000 in west-central Tennessee 75 miles 
northeast of Memphis 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell you, I've never seen anything like it,'' sheriff's  
Capt. Dexter Bowles said. ``Mobile homes, cars and trucks have been 
overturned, and power lines are down. The whole area is totally 
demolished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In all, at least 60 homes and businesses in the Jackson area  
were damaged or destroyed. Some homes with minimal damage were near 
others that had been leveled. Debris and downed covered some side 
streets, leaving them impassable. At McKellar-Sipes Airport, a new 
Tennessee National Guard armory and two UH-60 helicopters were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials opened two shelters and extra state troopers and  
military police were dispatched to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark and Jemma Fuggent were among about 40 people who spent the  
night at the Jackson Civic Center. They were watching television 
when the storm hit their apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grabbed my wife and hid in the linen closet,'' Fuggent said.  
``When it was clear, there wasn't even a front to the apartment. 
The walls the TV and radio were plugged into were gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His wife said they lost most of their possessions, ``but we're  
alive and that's what counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gerlene Morrow said her sister called to warn her about the  
storm, and she ran to the bathroom with her sister-in-law and 
9-year-old niece ``when we heard that train sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt like this was the end,'' she said. ``As we got in  
there, it just started caving in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morrow's home was destroyed. She and her relatives suffered cuts  
and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	In Henderson County, some 25 miles east of Jackson, about 30  
homes were damaged or destroyed. A woman's body was found in the 
ruins of her home and her husband was seriously injured, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was killed in Hardeman County in southwestern  
Tennessee, authorities said, but details on how that person died 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Power outages were reported in many areas as high winds whipped  
through the state, snapping tree limbs and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes were seen or touched down in at least a dozen  
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	A tornado that hit near Jackson heavily damaged the Tennessee  
National Guard's helicopter maintenance and training facilities, a 
shopping center and apartment complex, said Dan Vaughn, deputy 
director of the Jackson-Madison County Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A housing development, fire station and funeral home were  
damaged in Bemis, just south of Jackson, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Kentucky, strong storms caused three minor  
injuries, while in Arkansas, a 78-year-old man was treated for a 
cut after his home was destroyed. The storm dissipated as it headed 
east early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore took a moment at the top of a King Day  
event to extend his thoughts and prayers to tornado victims. He 
noted that Jackson is his mother's hometown and said he planned to 
visit the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart goes out to the families affected by this disaster,''  
Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Europe, Asia Markets End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The London Stock Exchange closed sharply higher  
today, mirroring a powerful start in the Asian markets following a 
rally on Wall Street and the easing of fears about Brazil's 
economic meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, where the government announced this morning that it  
will continue to let its currency, the real, trade freely, share 
prices on the Sao Paulo stock exchange rose 7 percent. On Friday, 
Latin America's largest stock exchange soared 33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	London's shares on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share  
index closed up nearly 3 percent while German, French and Stockholm 
shares also were higher. Toronto and Mexico City stocks opened up, 
while shares in Buenos Aires were slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Market-watchers credited the gains to recovery last week in U.S.  
and other world stock exchanges following moves by the Brazilian 
government to stabilize the economy in Latin America's largest 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves in Brazil also quelled worries that instability in  
Latin America could spread to the United States, which is enjoying 
its strongest economic expansion in decades. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Prices Climb Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Stock prices in Asia climbed higher today, making  
sharp gains after Wall Street rebounded last week and fears of a 
financial meltdown in Brazil receded. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Manila surged  
within minutes of opening today, though much of the early gains in 
some markets evaporated as the session continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``As worries over Brazil's financial crisis eased in the  
overseas markets, the Tokyo market continues to rebound,'' said 
Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo 
Securities Co. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average opened strong  
but lost much of its steam, finishing up just 66.20 points, or 0.48 
percent, at 13,805.06. On Thursday, the average gained 335.26 
points, or 2.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose sharply, gaining 255.14  
points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 10,402.54. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index in Seoul also leapt  
higher, closing at 622.52 points, up by 1.27 percent from the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets gained a hefty 4.4 percent in Manila, where the  
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index ended 89.35 points 
higher at 2130.90 after losing 21.73 points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 47.29 points, or 3.1  
percent, to 1547.10. New Zealand's NZSE-40 capital index finished 
the day up 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One weak spot was China, where the two stock markets opened  
largely unchanged today. Traders said prices could fall because of 
growing numbers of Chinese companies warning of low profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The main Shanghai index, which tracks shares reserved for  
Chinese investors, opened up 0.03 points at 26.77. The Shenzhen 
index of similar stocks was down 0.08 points at 50.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Taiwan ended lower on profit-taking following two  
sessions of government-led stock fund purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In all the gains in Asia, market watchers credited the recovery  
last week in U.S. and other world stock exchanges following moves 
by the Brazilian government to stabilize its economy, Latin 
America's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves in Brazil not only eased fears about its own economy,  
but also quelled worries that instability in Latin America could 
spread to the United States, which is enjoying its strongest 
economic expansion in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.4 percent to  
9,340.55 points when it became apparent Brazil's government 
wouldn't step in to protect its faltering currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil caused a panic in world financial markets Wednesday when  
it devalued its currency by 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the country's decision not to intervene to support the real  
generated confidence that the government was taking appropriate 
measures to nurse the economy back to health.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Brave Act won his fourth straight race  
Monday, capturing the $150,000 San Marcos Handicap by 1 3/4 lengths 
over Ferrari at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Goncalino Almeida, Brave Act covered 1 1/4 miles on the  
turf in 2:04 1-5 and paid $6.60, $3.40 and $3.20. Ferrari returned 
$7.20 and $5.20, while Native Desert was another half-length back 
in third and paid $5.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my horse in a good spot the while way,'' Almeida said.  
``I just waited until the turn for home, and when I asked him, he 
made his good run as usual. This horse just has so much ability and 
is willing to do anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British-bred Brave Act hasn't finished worse than second in his  
last eight starts dating to September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $90,000, increased Brave Act's career

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The U.S. military is helping Nicaragua  
locate land mines washed out of the ground by Hurricane Mitch, a 
Nicaraguan military officer said in a report published Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers are trying to determine where overflowing rivers might  
have carried the mines, Sergio Ugarte, chief of Nicaragua's mine 
clearing brigades, told the newsweekly Confidencial. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista administration  
planted land mines to defend itself from attack by the U.S.-backed 
Contra fighters. The Contras, based in neighboring Honduras, also 
planted mines. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the war in 1990, it was estimated that 116,000  
mines lay in Nicaragua and the border regions of Honduras and Costa 
Rica. Ugarte said about 74,000 have yet to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	In late October, Hurricane Mitch dumped intense rains over  
Central America, causing mudslides that dislodged land mines. Some 
have turned up in farming fields, others are believed buried under 
trash, mud and vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, several nations have been helping Nicaragua locate  
and dismantle the land mines.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A journalist for a Chilean daily was  
arrested Monday after she refused a judge's orders to disclose her 
sources in a report on a drug trafficking case. 
</P>
<P>
	Police detectives escorted Paula Afani from the downtown offices  
of the paper, La Tercera, amid loud applause and cheer from her 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chilean Journalists Association and the newspaper condemned  
the arrest warrant issued by judge Pedro Landeta, who is 
investigating a drug trafficking case. 
</P>
<P>
	Landeta will question the journalist before deciding whether to  
formally charge her with obstruction of justice, a crime that 
carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation granting journalists the right to keep their sources  
secret has been stalled in Chile's congress for more than four 
years.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- About 45,000 public hospital nurses,  
x-ray technicians and cleaners held a one-day strike Monday, 
demanding payment of about $27 million in overdue bonuses and 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors in the country's 1,500 public hospitals were providing  
treatment only to emergency cases, said union leader Francisco 
Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials acknowledge they owe the workers the  
benefits, but say they lack the funds to pay them immediately. 
Prices for Venezuelan oil, the country's main export, have hit a 
12-year low, and the government faces a deficit that could reach $9 
billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's public hospitals already are badly underfunded, with  
many lacking x-ray machines, medicines and other basic supplies.

	About 70 percent of the child laborers work between five and 14  
hours a day, the daily La Jornada reported Monday citing the study 
by the Legislative Assembly's Employment and Social Welfare

	About 21.5 million of Mexico's 91 million people are between

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Mirror Group PLC confirmed Monday that it had been  
approached by Regional Independent Media Group PLC about a possible 
takeover offer. A merger would create Britain's biggest print media 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirror Group, whose flagship is the tabloid Daily Mirror, said  
the offer would value the company at more than 900 million pounds, 
or $1.49 billion. The group also has regional and Scottish 
newspaper interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirror Group's shares rose more than 18 percent after Monday's  
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional Independent Media, which publishes the Yorkshire Post  
and other newspapers, is owned by the finance group Candover 
Investments PLC. It is chaired by former Conservative Cabinet 
minister Sir Norman Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirror is advising shareholders to take no action at this stage.  
A formal offer would be subject to recommendation by the Mirror 
Group board and approval by antitrust regulators.

	The move followed the breakdown of talks between Mirror Group  
and Trinity, a regional newspaper group.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Again Delays Windows 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft has again pushed back the release of a  
new test version of its Windows 2000 operating system for business 
computers, raising doubts about whether the final version of the 
long-overdue product might ship this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a posting Monday on its Web site, Microsoft Corp. said the  
third ``beta'' or test version of Windows 2000 is now expected out 
``in the April 1999 timeframe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The low-key announcement came the day before Microsoft was to  
release its second-quarter earnings. Many analysts expect Microsoft 
to do well in the quarter that ended Dec. 31, since computer-chip 
maker Intel Corp. has already reported strong financial results 
from the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000 is Microsoft's most important new product. The  
massive and sophisticated network software program, which will be 
marketed in different versions for customers ranging from 
individual users to giant corporations, will be Microsoft's primary 
operating system for business and large-scale computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, its technology also will be applied to the Windows  
software that now runs most personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	To eliminate bugs, Microsoft is running an extensive software  
testing program. The testing began 16 months ago and involves about 
250,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials characterized the latest delay as minor,  
since the most recent date for Beta 3's release had been March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the product's in great shape and we just want to  
take the extra few days to put the last final touches on it,'' said 
Ed Muth, Microsoft's group manager for enterprise marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said Microsoft still expects to ship a final version of  
Windows 2000 in late 1999. But others aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Rob Enderle, vice president of Giga Information  
Group in Santa Clara, Calif., suggested Windows 2000 might not be 
ready for sale until June 2000. If so, he said, that could hurt 
Microsoft's financial performance next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two big products they have coming out over the next year  
are Windows 2000 and Office 2000'' -- the latter an upgrade to 
Microsoft's business software suite, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporate clients might wait to adopt Windows 2000 until  
after it has a track record and the inevitable fixes are issued for 
problems found in use. And many companies likewise won't make the 
switch to Office 2000, due out later this year, until they are 
running the new operating system, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software delays are hardly rare at Microsoft. Its flagship  
product, Windows 95 and its successor, Windows 98, both were 
repeatedly postponed as testers found things needing to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000, originally known as Windows NT Version 5.0, once  
was expected in 1998. The first test version of the software was 
released in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The second beta was due out last June, but wasn't released until  
September. Microsoft originally had planned only a ``Beta 2 
refresh'' rather than a full-scale third beta, but changed its mind 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said the latest delay ``isn't really a question of  
problems'' in the software. Rather, ``it's a question of fit and 
finish work'' to make sure the beta is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our standards for the beta are very, very high,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Scottie Pippen To Play for Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scottie Pippen will be traded from the Chicago  
Bulls to the Houston Rockets as soon as the lockout ends later this 
week, three NBA sources told The Associated Press on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a deal worth $67.2 million for  
five years before trading him, and get forward Roy Rogers and a 
second-round draft pick in return, said the sources, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the  
deal is allowable under NBA rules because Houston will have enough 
salary cap room to fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this 
season will be $10.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will not be finalized until the lockout ends Wednesday  
or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to confirm anything,'' Rockets spokesman Tim  
Frank said. ``The lockout is technically not over. We're still 
under lockout restrictions. No deal can officially be done until 
that cloak is lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, talked to the  
Rockets about signing with them as a free agent. It was not 
immediately clear why he agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, but other 
teams were also discussing similar deals involving Pippen with 
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston, giving the Rockets a formidable 
front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Pippen has been with Chicago since the 1987-88  
season when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. Last year, he 
averaged 19.1 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time All-star forward is considered one of the top  
three free agents up for grabs as NBA teams prepare to open 
training camps delayed by the 6 1/2-month lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen should be in uniform for the Rockets when they play an  
exhibition game against San Antonio on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also were interested in the other top two free  
agents, Antonio McDyess and Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	But McDyess has ruled out Houston as a possibility, and  
Gugliotta appears likely to sign with Minnesota or Denver.

<P>
	HONOBIA, Okla. (AP) -- Searchers found the wreckage of a small  
plane Monday with the bodies of a man and his three young sons who 
crashed in an Oklahoma forest while flying home to Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane disintegrated as it went into the ground,'' said Lt.  
Derral Punneo of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. ``There's not any 
recognizable pieces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airborne state police from Arkansas spotted the plane in the  
Kiamichi Mountains, directing ground searchers to the site of the 
aircraft missing since Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear that the wreckage was scattered through a  
heavily wooded area, very rugged terrain,'' said Bill Sadler, a 
state police spokesman in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Dr. Bruce Brown Jr., 36, of  
Springdale, Ark., and sons Hayden, Joshua and Weston, who ranged in

<HEADLINE> KO Punch Turned Around Tyson Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson winced in pain as his cut man tried  
to stop the bleeding around his right eye. The look on the face of 
trainer Tommy Brooks was one of growing concern as he implored 
Tyson between rounds to try and get something together. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's wild punches were hitting nothing but air and Francois  
Botha was making him pay for it with well placed counters. Worse 
yet, Botha was talking trash, taunting the fighter whose mere 
presence in the ring once terrorized his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no way for the baddest man on the planet to start a  
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' Tyson told Brooks. ``I've got him in my sights.  
Give me time. I'll get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The time came with 10 seconds left in the fifth round. It came  
in the form of a perfectly thrown right hand that crashed with a 
startling suddenness into Botha's face. 
</P>
<P>
	And it may have come just in time to save a career that seemed  
to be disintegrating once again in the same ring where his biting 
of Evander Holyfield got Tyson banned from boxing 19 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``You knew it was going to come. You just didn't know when,''  
Tyson said. ``I knew I would knock him out. It was just a matter of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right hand that sent Botha sprawling on the canvas Saturday  
night may arguably have been the best single punch ever thrown by a 
man whose entire career is based on throwing big punches. 
</P>
<P>
	It certainly was the most important.  
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just a million dollar punch. This punch had a career  
riding on it, a career worth tens of millions more. 
</P>
<P>
	Without it, Tyson was heading toward a third straight loss.  
Without it, he was heading away from the multimillion-dollar 
paydays so common for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just feels great to do what I love to do,'' Tyson said.  
``But I've got to improve. I've got a long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how far Tyson has to go in his latest comeback from an  
enforced absence was painfully evident through nearly five full 
rounds against a tough and surprisingly effective Botha. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson missed often with lunging punches that whizzed past  
Botha's head, and it was Botha who was doing most of the damage 
with left-right combinations to Tyson's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha had won all four rounds on two of the judge's scorecards  
and three of the four on a third. He was growing increasingly 
confident as the fight neared its scheduled midway point, taunting 
Tyson at times with his gloves dropped to his side and exchanging 
words with him during repeated clinches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I was in control of the fight,'' Botha said.  
</P>
<P>
	He was, but not for long.  
</P>
<P>
	As Botha threw a lazy right hand to the body late in the fifth  
round, Tyson threw a counter right hand with such perfect balance 
that when it smashed into Botha's face there was no doubt the fight 
was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha tried gamely to get up, but when he finally did at the  
count of seven, he went reeling backwards into the ropes as referee 
Richard Steele waved the fight to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got cocky and I paid for it,'' Botha said. ``It was a punch  
I didn't see. Mike's a great hitter and I just walked into the 
punch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden ending of the fight thrilled the crowd of 12,519, who  
for a few brief seconds at the end of the first round may have 
thought they were going to see yet another Tyson fight end in 
bizarre fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	The two fighters were in a clinch as the bell sounded to end the  
round and their arms were linked while they tried to punch with 
their remaining free arm. Steele couldn't separate them, and nearly 
a dozen officials and cornermen rushed into the ring to finally pry 
them apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was trying to break my arm,'' Botha said.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's correct,'' Tyson replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The start of the second round was delayed for about 45 seconds  
as Steele conferred in the ring with Nevada Athletic Commission 
executive director Marc Ratner warned both fighters to be on their 
best behavior. A few minutes later, he was penalizing Tyson for 
excessive holding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told (Steele) to take a deep breath and take command,''  
Ratner said. ``He did a good job under trying circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Tyson, the evening's work was worth at least $10 million and  
it gave him a chance to shake some of the ring rust collected from 
an enforced layoff of 19 months for biting Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not have been pretty, but the one right hand salvaged the  
lucrative contracts Tyson has to fight as many as four times this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In two weeks or so I'll get back into the gym and start  
working to capitalize on everything I screwed up tonight,'' Tyson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who turned out to be a credible opponent, asked for a  
rematch but Tyson will now go on to other fighters, with the hope 
that he could fight Holyfield for a third time in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's next fight is tentatively set for April 24, possible  
against Germany's Axel Schulz, who was at ringside. Other boxers in 
the mix include Lou Savarese and Shannon Briggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said he really doesn't care who is put in the ring with  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the price is right I'll fight a lion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Connery's New Film To Open Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- His latest character is rumpled, supportive,  
sensitive -- decidedly unlike James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just fine with Sean Connery, who plays a husband  
dealing with marital crisis in the romantic film, ``Playing by 
Heart,'' which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a man who wears Rockports with a tux,'' Connery told  
the Daily News in its Sunday editions. The character is also a man 
who remains very much in love with his wife of 40 years, played by 
Gena Rowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that life is a dance, as it were -- that intimacy and  
romance don't end when you reach a certain age,'' the 67-year-old 
actor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suave as ever, Connery says he loves the film's optimism and  
takes issue with one reviewer who found the movie a bit 
over-the-top in the romance department. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can a movie be too romantic -- it says something about  
where we are, I suppose,'' he lamented.

<HEADLINE> 3 Workers Killed at Ariz. Pizza Hut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Three Pizza Hut employees were shot to  
death, apparently as they prepared to close up the restaurant for 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Robert Curry, 44, and kitchen worker James Bloxham, 17,  
were found dead late Sunday, and waitress Melissa L. Monitz, 20, 
died later at a hospital, said Sgt. Brett Klein, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Moniz's boyfriend, whose name was not released, discovered  
the slayings when he came to take Ms. Moniz home from work, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had waited in the parking lot for a few minutes, becoming  
concerned when he saw no movement inside the restaurant. He looked 
through a window, saw the victims on the floor and called police 
from a nearby convenience store, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, crying and shaking, described the killings as  
``bloody'' and ``horrible,'' the Tucson Citizen reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives have numerous leads to check out, but no suspects,  
and have not focused on any one person or group yet, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't ruled out any possible motives, including  
robbery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant was not ransacked and the victims were not tied  
up, Klein said. They appeared to have been closing for the night, 
he said. Detectives had not determined whether anything was 
missing.

<HEADLINE> Patient May Have Shot Fla. Surgeon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVENTURA, Fla. (AP) -- Dr. Bradley Silverman took the impossible  
cases other surgeons turned away. It may have cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Herndon, a former patient with a violent past and a  
history of mental problems, was charged with shooting Silverman to 
death at the doctor's office last week. Herndon apparently was 
upset with the outcome of an operation, The Miami Herald reported, 
citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Herndon, a 45-year-old carpenter and handyman, suffers from  
Crohn's disease, a debilitating intestinal illness that causes 
chronic pain, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported. Silverman, 
41, operated on him last year to remove underarm polyps. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery left Herndon with restricted movement and some loss  
of feeling in the arm -- an outcome Silverman had warned might 
occur, the Herald said. Herndon filed a complaint against the 
doctor without success. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Brad blew him off, that infuriated him. He lost it,'' the  
Herald quoted a source as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman was shot several times at point-blank range Jan. 11 as  
he arrived for work at his Miami-area office. Herndon had allegedly 
waited in the stairwell and confronted the doctor as he entered. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses heard angry words, followed by the doctor's cries of  
``No! No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police acting on an anonymous tip tracked down Herndon on  
Florida's Gulf Coast at a hospital in Port Richey, where he was 
living. He was returned to Miami on Friday, charged with murder and 
jailed under a suicide watch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known whether Herndon had a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	In Miami Shores, where Herndon used to live, police were called  
to his home several times between 1988 and 1995. In 1991, police 
said, Herndon shot his waterbed. He later spent some time in mental 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was weird. He called the police on me when I first moved in  
because he didn't know we lived here,'' said Joyce Brown, who lived 
across the street. ``I know he had a gun and always threatened 
people with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman, a breast cancer specialist, was considered one of the  
best surgeons in South Florida. Silverman was chief of surgery at 
the Aventura Hospital and Medical Center and was selected to become 
chief of staff in 2001 by its 860 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman was a water polo star at the University of Florida and  
could have been on the U.S. Olympic team if not for the boycott of 
the Moscow games, said Dr. Michael Storch, a neighbor and 20-year 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 people attended the funeral Wednesday for the father  
of two. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said it was Silverman's nature to take on  
difficult cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Bradley's problem, his one true fault,'' said his  
mother, Marilyn Silverman. ``He was always trying to make things 
OK.''

<HEADLINE> Reeves Faces Old Team in Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- If he's the vindictive type, Dan Reeves might  
look at this as a chance to get even with John Elway, Mike Shanahan 
and the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five weeks removed from heart bypass surgery, Reeves heads  
to the Super Bowl for the fourth time as a head coach, his Atlanta 
Falcons having stunned Minnesota 30-27 in overtime for the NFC 
championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, Reeves will be on the opposite sideline from  
the team he took to three NFL title games, the team that dominated 
his life for a dozen years, the team that fired him in 1992 after a 
falling-out with Shanahan and Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood couldn't have scripted a more dramatic showdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to worry about ourselves,'' said Reeves, refusing --  
in the public's eye, at least -- to turn the Jan. 31 game into a 
personal vendetta. ``Whoever we play, we have to go out and play as 
well as we're capable of playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got an awful good football team, they're the defending  
world champions and they're going to be defending world champions 
until somebody knocks them off. ... We've got our work cut out for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his ouster in Denver, Reeves coached the New York Giants  
for four seasons, but he was fired again without ever playing his 
old team. Then it was off to Atlanta, where he finally got a shot 
at the Broncos for the first time since his days in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was coaching a winless team at the time, while the  
Broncos were on the way to the Super Bowl championship that eluded 
them during the Reeves' era. Denver won 29-21, and all parties 
insisted that it was time to let bygones be bygones. 
</P>
<P>
	But those stormy moments are sure to be rekindled during the two  
weeks leading up to the Super Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone will recall how Elway craved to get out from under the  
dictatorial Reeves and his run-oriented offense, a period the 
quarterback later described as ``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They'll remember how Shanahan was fired as quarterback coach in  
1991 for insubordination, supposedly for going behind Reeves' back 
to draw up plays with Elway. Reeves lasted only one more season, 
let go in part because of a falling-out with Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``At times, we were best friends,'' Shanahan said of his  
relationship with Reeves. ``He's done a great job with that 
football team, and we look forward to playing them in Miami. It's 
going to be a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Falcons were 3-13. Now, they're en route to  
the Super Bowl for the first time in their 33-year history, with 
most of the credit placed squarely on Reeves' shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	He's brought professionalism to a franchise that was an NFL  
laughingstock. He brought a sense of order to a team that was known 
for its disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got them playing great and Dan is a great football  
coach,'' Elway said after the Broncos defeated the New York Jets 
23-10 in the AFC title game. ``When you look at what he's done in 
the last two years with them, it's just unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' current quarterback, Chris Chandler, has no complaints  
about his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had read a lot about what had happened in Denver with  
John,'' said Chandler, acquired from the Oilers in a trade shortly 
after Reeves was hired by the Falcons. ``I didn't have any 
preconceived thoughts going into it. I know John and I know Dan, 
and they're both great guys. Whatever happened then, happened 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After bouncing from team to team -- five in all -- during the  
first nine years of his career, Chandler will be appearing in the 
Pro Bowl for the second year in a row under Reeves' tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had nothing but fun playing for Dan,'' Chandler said.  
``It's been the best experience of my playing football, by far. 
It's been fun, it's been rewarding, it's been challenging. I'm glad 
I got the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves was glad to get a second chance at life after feeling a  
burning sensation in his chest and throat during a Dec. 13 game in 
New Orleans. The following day, he underwent four hours of 
quadruple bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach missed the final two games of the regular season but  
returned for the playoffs, insisting his heart was fine. It must 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can stand today, my heart's got to be in great shape,''  
he said. ``It can't get much tougher than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe it can. Earlier in the season, when the Super Bowl  
still seemed like a faraway, unreachable goal, Reeves vowed to 
perform the Falcons' arm-flapping ``Dirty Bird'' dance in the 
middle of Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has a way out on a technicality -- Atlanta doesn't have  
a Main Street -- he's apparently going to be true to his word. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ain't going to be a pretty sight,'' Reeves said with a  
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	On a more serious note, he pondered the staggering turnaround  
that has occurred in Atlanta since his arrival. After losing seven 
of their first eight games under Reeves, the Falcons have won 22 of 
26. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible when you think about it,'' he said. ``Coming  
from 1-7 halfway through you first year to be in the Super Bowl in 
the second year. I can't say enough about our players. It's an 
unbelievable group of guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And their coach isn't too bad, either.

<HEADLINE> Vikes Lose and Billick Eyes Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- The Minnesota Vikings' loss could turn  
out to be the Baltimore Ravens' gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' 30-27 overtime loss to Atlanta in Sunday's NFL  
Championship game cleared the way for Minnesota offensive 
coordinator Brian Billick to interview for the Ravens' head 
coaching vacancy. Billick planned to arrive in Baltimore on Monday 
night and meet with Ravens owner Art Modell on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing could happen at any time,'' Billick said before  
leaving Minnesota. ``... I think they have all the information they 
need. I certainly have all the information I need about the 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, 44, has been the Vikings' offensive coordinator for the  
past five years. Under his direction, the Vikings scored an 
NFL-record 556 points this regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens were not allowed to meet with Billick until the  
Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention. Had Minnesota won 
Sunday, as expected, then Baltimore would have been forced to wait 
until February to speak with Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore received an additional dose of good news Monday when  
the expansion Cleveland Browns dropped Billick from consideration 
as their new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one day earlier, in the wake of the Vikings' upset loss,  
Billick said he intended to give Baltimore and Cleveland equal 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity to be a head coach is something that I've  
worked for my entire life,'' Billick said Sunday. ``If that should 
be presented to me, it will be time to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings this season established a team-record 6,264 yards on  
offense. Under Billick, Minnesota has recorded the top three 
yardage totals in team history. 
</P>
<P>
	That's attractive to the Ravens, who went 6-10 this season  
despite holding the opposition below 17 points in half their games. 
Minnesota beat Baltimore 38-28 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baltimore has some intriguing aspects,'' Billick said. ``I'm  
very impressed with Mr. Modell -- both Modells, Art and David -- in 
terms of their concept of where that organization is going. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Vice president of player personnel) Ozzie Newsome is one of  
the best personal people in the business. They've got talent, and I 
was excited by the city of Baltimore, the energy that was there 
when we (played) there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick and Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris  
Palmer are considered favorites to fill the void left by the Dec. 
28 firing of head coach Ted Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer interviewed for the job last week, but the Ravens made it  
clear that they wanted to speak with Billick before making any kind 
of job offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens have also interviewed Pittsburgh Steelers defensive  
coordinator Jim Haslett. Emmitt Thomas, who recently followed Ray 
Rhodes from Philadelphia to Green Bay as the defensive coordinator, 
also had been considered a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore originally wanted either George Seifert or Mike  
Holmgren, both of whom have already established themselves as 
outstanding NFL head coaches. But Seifert signed with Carolina and 
Holmgren canceled a planned trip to Baltimore after accepting a job 
with the Seattle Seahawks.

<HEADLINE> Power Outage Stalls Amtrak Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An electrical outage knocked out power  
Monday to Amtrak rail lines between New York and Delaware, putting 
the brakes on 20 rush hour trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage happened shortly before 5:30 p.m. as a line of  
thunderstorms made its way through the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Trains for Amtrak, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation  
Authority and New Jersey Transit were stopped in their tracks as 
far south as Wilmington, Del. Power was restored an hour later 
between Wilmington and Philadelphia, and to the rest of the system 
shortly after 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was traced to an insulator that blew out at a North  
Philadelphia power station that controls the flow of electricity 
used by Amtrak, Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It occurred roughly about the time the storm went through New  
Jersey,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms' wind speeds were up to 60 mph in some areas.  
</P>
<P>
	The trains had only emergency lighting when the outage first  
happened, but enough power was restored soon after to provide heat 
and full lighting, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on how many passengers were affected.

<HEADLINE> Ranking of NBA Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the NBA lockout settlement is finally  
signed, it will unleash a flurry of free-agent signings throughout 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 players are waiting to see where they'll be playing,  
and only a handful have reached tentative agreements on new 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some of the top free agents, ranked by position and  
listed with their former team, and the status of their 
negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
 *CENTERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Rik Smits, Pacers: A lock to remain with Indiana with a healthy  
raise from his 1997-98 salary of $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Theo Ratliff, 76ers: Also a lock to stay with his old team, with  
Philadelphia outbidding several suitors infatuated by the 
shot-blocking machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Vlade Divac, Hornets: Scheduled to arrive back in the U.S. on  
Tuesday to decide between offers from the Sacramento Kings, the Los 
Angeles Clippers and other teams. Charlotte has almost no chance of 
retaining him. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaac Austin, L.A. Clippers: Looks like he will end up in  
Orlando after being pursued by several teams, including the Suns 
and Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Arvydas Sabonis, Trail Blazers: Made about $1.7 million for  
Portland last season, and should get a decent bump when he re-signs 
with the Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Geiger, Hornets: Has reached an agreement to join the  
Philadelphia 76ers, getting a six-year, $54 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Luc Longley, Bulls: Was expected to sign with Phoenix, but a  
number of sign-and-trade scenarios have developed since then 
involving several teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Dudley, Knicks: One of the few big men still considered to  
be available. New York is in danger of losing him to a team willing 
to overpay for height. 
</P>
<P>
 *POWER FORWARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Antonio McDyess, Suns: Has narrowed his choices to staying with  
Phoenix or returning to the Denver Nuggets -- the team he played for 
during the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons. Considered signing with 
Houston or Chicago, but decided against both choices. Should make 
up his mind Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gugliotta, Timberwolves: Word last week was that he'd stay  
in Minnesota, but things changed over the weekend with Denver and 
Phoenix re-entering the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayson Williams, Nets: Will stay in New Jersey under a  
seven-year deal that will be worth in excess of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman, Bulls: His agent says the Bulls are looking to  
execute a sign-and-trade deal for the seven-time rebounding 
champion, and plenty of teams could use him despite his checkered 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Coleman, 76ers: Has reached an agreement to join  
Charlotte, where he is likely to be the starting center because 
Anthony Mason plays power forward. Will get $40 million for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Henderson, Hawks: Expected to re-sign with Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
	Loy Vaught, Clippers: Leaning toward Detroit, which would pay  
him about $23 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Barkley, Rockets: Expected to stay in Houston and sign  
for the $1.75 million salary cap exception as long as the Rockets 
are able to sign Pippen or Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarence Weatherspoon, Warriors: The subject of numerous  
sign-and-trade rumors, the strongest of which has him going to 
Miami in a Latrell Sprewell deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Laettner, Hawks: Rumored to be bringing his busted  
Achilles tendon and questionable attitude to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 *SMALL FORWARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen, Bulls: Will be dealt to Houston in a  
sign-and-trade deal after signing a five-year, $67.2 million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fox, Lakers: Expected to sign with Atlanta, taking over the  
starting job from Tyrone Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
	Corliss Williamson: A wild card, with no one sure if he'll stay  
in an unstable situation in Sacramento or be involved in a 
sign-and-trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford Robinson, Suns: Asked for too much money from Detroit,  
now might end up staying in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Smith, 76ers: The former overall No. 1 pick, who turned down  
$80 million last season, will be lucky to get one-fourth of that 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPhonso Ellis, Nuggets: For the longest time was rumored to be  
headed to Cleveland, but that talk has died down. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Ellis, SuperSonics: Will stay in Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
 *POINT GUARDS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, Wizards: Best offer figures to come from  
Washington, which can exceed the salary cap to re-sign him for an 
annual salary in excess of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Stoudamire, Trail Blazers: Wants the $9 million maximum  
from Portland, but the Blazers are a few hundred thousand south of 
that mark. Only leverage is to take much less money from Houston, 
but only if Pippen stays away from the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Johnson, Suns: Will not stay in Phoenix, and has been  
rumored headed to several teams, most notably the Los Angeles 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Ward, Knicks: Wants to re-sign with New York for an  
average salary of about $5 million, but is wary of Knicks 
immediately trading him. Orlando and Detroit are interested. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Best, Pacers: Will re-sign in Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	Sherman Douglas, Nets: A valuable backup in New Jersey, could  
leave to become a starter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Murdock, Heat: Drawing interest from the Clippers. The Nets  
also interested if Douglas leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, Magic: Looking to sign with a true contender, be  
it Houston, the Lakers or the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 *SHOOTING GUARDS: 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan, Bulls: Says he is 99.9 percent retired. Another  
comeback, if there will be one, would likely come next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Chapman, Suns: Played for $326,700 last season, likely to  
get a lucrative new deal that will keep him in Phoenix for the next 
five or six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, Pistons: A lock to re-sign in Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jackson, Warriors: The subject of numerous sign-and-trade  
scenarios, but first Golden State must figure out where to trade 
Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Curry, Hornets: Was expected to stay in Charlotte, but  
Miami might have entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Barry, Heat: Would like to go to Golden State as part of a  
Sprewell deal. If that falls through, he could be Jordan's 
replacement at shooting guard for the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Witnesses May Be Inevitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's Democratic leader conceded today  
that witnesses ``may be inevitable'' in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial and signaled that if they are allowed Democrats 
would insist that no limits be placed on either side. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who are we to tell either the House or the White House how  
they're going to run their case?'' Tom Daschle asked in an 
interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Daschle said he continues to believe witnesses are unnecessary  
but acknowledged the political momentum was moving toward having 
some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have the right to say no witnesses; the Supreme Court  
says that every day. But once we say we have to have witnesses, 
then it seems to me we've given up the ability to tell the House or 
White House how to present their case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House lawyers were busy putting the final touches on their  
opening arguments, set to begin when the trial resumes Tuesday. The 
presentation is to take three days, after which senators will have 
16 hours over two days to ask questions of both sides through Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that the White  
House remains opposed to calling witnesses but that if the Senate 
allows House prosecutors to do so the president's lawyers may 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It boggles the mind a bit to try to understand how someone  
testifying for the 10th time or the 23rd time or the ninth time can 
provide any more clarity,'' Lockhart said. ``If the House managers 
insist on witnesses and the Senate approves them, certainly we will 
look at calling witnesses. Either way we are looking at a process 
that is extended and delayed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors wrapped up their opening arguments over the  
weekend, asserting that Clinton should be removed from office for 
perjury and obstruction of justice because he had ``violated the 
public trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate officials said Majority Leader Trent Lott and Daschle  
have agreed on the format for the questioning by the senators. The 
16 hours will be equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, 
but will switch back and forth between the two sides every two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions will be gone over by each caucus to avoid at least  
some repetition. Before each question, Rehnquist is expected to 
name the senator who wanted it asked, Senate officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats continue to press for censure, insisting the 67 votes  
don't exist in the Senate to remove Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House members prosecuting the case, Rep. Asa  
Hutchinson, R-Ark., said today nothing should be considered a 
foregone conclusion. He defended the decision not to call witnesses 
before the House impeached Clinton but said the Senate has a 
different role. ``If the president wanted to call witnesses in the 
Senate, certainly he would be permitted to do so, and the House 
(prosecutors) should have that prerogative as well,'' he said on 
NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, also on NBC, said the Senate  
should have no qualms about consulting public opinion polls when 
considering Clinton's fate -- just as it would if it were passing a 
tax bill. ``That's why the founding fathers selected the 
politicians and not the Supreme Court'' to try impeachment charges 
against a president, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls show strong support for keeping Clinton in office.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers open their defense Tuesday and will insist  
that the allegations against the president aren't supported by the 
facts and don't warrant nullifying a national election, White House 
spokesman Jim Kennedy said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will also point out the significant holes in the  
presentation by the House of Representatives managers as well as 
their misleading and overreaching characterizations of the evidence 
and testimony,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, with the trial recessed, senators will proceed to  
the House chamber to hear Clinton deliver his annual State of the 
Union address. ``Quite frankly, I'd rather go to the dentist,'' 
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, ``you heard what some might call good old street  
attorneys make one very strong case,'' Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, 
said of the 13 House lawmakers who presented the case against 
Clinton. This week, ``you're going to have the best attorneys money 
can buy make another probably very strong case,'' he said on ``Fox 
News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,  
expressing an apparent consensus among Republicans, told NBC's 
``Meet the Press'' that it would be ``pretty tough under these 
circumstances not to have witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats warned that the trial could be stretched  
interminably if both sides began calling witnesses, and said they 
would contribute to that process by seeking testimony from such 
people as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and informant Linda 
Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm any reader of the tea leaves in this situation, front  
and center is going to be Kenneth Starr,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, 
D-N.J., said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' We will go through 
prosecutorial abuse, how he came by information, who he talked to 
and we're going to put the system of justice on trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., suggested on ABC that witnesses could  
not add to the volumes of existing testimony. ``Be real. This is 
not Perry Mason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CBS that ``we are not  
going to let this spin out of control. The Senate controls the 
witnesses.'' Republicans control the Senate, 55-45, and only a 
simple majority vote is required to call individual witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Texas Rangers, Helling in Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Rick Helling, who won 20 games last  
season to tie for the major league lead, agreed Monday to a $10.5 
million, three-year contract with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who went 20-7 with a 4.41 ERA in 33 starts, will make  
$2.25 million in 1999, $3.75 million in 2000, and $4.5 million in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I felt it was a good deal and we're happy with the  
confidence the Rangers showed in us for the long term,'' Helling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old right-hander made $216,500 last year and became  
one of the players with 2-3 years of major league service who 
became eligible for salary arbitration because of the 1990 lockout 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling was the first Ranger pitcher to win his first six starts  
in a season. He went 5-0 in his last eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously Rick had a breakthrough season last year,'' said  
agent Jeff Moorad. ``As a result, the Rangers felt comfortable 
extending him out into the future and have rewarded him in dramatic 
fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The signing leaves four Rangers in arbitration: pitchers Aaron  
Sele and Tim Crabtree, catcher Gregg Zaun and first 
baseman-designated hitter Lee Stevens. Barring settlements, Texas 
will exchange figures with the players Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout To Last Until Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout will last at least another day  
longer, meaning the upcoming trades of Scottie Pippen and Latrell 
Sprewell -- along with all other league business -- will be on hold 
until Wednesday at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a written agreement didn't keep teams from pulling  
off deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls agreed to a sign-and-trade deal sending Pippen  
to the Houston Rockets for Roy Rogers and a second-round draft 
pick, and the New York Knicks were the leading candidate to acquire 
Latrell Sprewell from Golden State, numerous league sources told 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, top free agent Antonio McDyess narrowed his choices to  
Denver and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of other deals were being discussed, including:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Minnesota, Toronto and Denver reaching agreement on a  
three-way trade sending Chauncey Billups to the Nuggets, Dean 
Garrett and Bobby Jackson to the Timberwolves and Micheal Williams 
and two No. 1 picks to the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Los Angeles Lakers sending forward Tony Battie to the  
Boston Celtics for center Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Bulls signing and trading Steve Kerr to the San Antonio  
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those deals cannot be finalized until lawyers  
representing the league and the union finish putting the lockout 
settlement into writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides were huddled away Monday night trying  
to resolve several differences that have popped up, and a Tuesday 
night settlement appeared to be the best-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know for sure tomorrow (Tuesday) whether we'll be  
starting Wednesday or Thursday,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disagreement between the sides concerns the new  
average salary exception, which allows teams already over the 
salary cap to sign an extra free agent. The union wants the 
exception to be used for six-year contracts; the league wants it 
limited to three-year deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a deal worth $67.2 million for  
five years before trading him, and get forward Roy Rogers and a 
second-round draft pick in return, said league sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the  
deal is allowable under NBA rules because Houston will have enough 
salary cap room to fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this 
season will be $10.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, talked to the  
Rockets about signing with them as a free agent. It was not 
immediately clear why he agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, but other 
teams also were discussing similar deals involving Pippen with 
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston for the $1 million minimum, giving 
the Rockets a formidable front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem 
Olajuwon, and allowing Barkley to keep his Larry Bird rights for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks emerged as the leading contender in the Sprewell  
sweepstakes after Golden State Warriors general manager Garry St. 
Jean told all the interested teams to make their best offers by 4 
p.m. EST Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a three-time All-Star, drew the longest non  
drug-related suspension in league history last season for choking 
his coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders, and the AP learned that a complicated four-team trade 
involving Golden State, Miami, Cleveland and Boston also was 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	In that scenario, Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along  
with Bimbo Coles and Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State 
getting Brent Barry, Dan Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have 
received Jamal Mashburn and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would 
have received Paul Pierce and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess is expected to decide Tuesday between re-signing with  
Phoenix or going to Denver. The Rockets and Bulls were among his 
earlier choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' agent James  
Bryant said. ``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's 
most at home with those two options: Pheonix is going to stay a 
winner, and Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If McDyess stays in Phoenix, the Nuggets are expected to make a  
final push for Timberwolves free agent forward Tom Gugliotta. If he 
chooses to return to Denver, where he played in the 1995-96 and 
1996-97 seasons, it is unclear what the Suns' fallback plan will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way trade involving the Timberwolves, Raptors and  
Nuggets had been rumored since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP learned of the Battie-Knight trade from two league  
sources. It will reunite Knight with the Lakers, the team he played 
for before signing with Boston as a free agent. The Lakers acquired 
Battie from the Denver Nuggets in last June's Nick Van Exel trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr will sign with the Bulls for $11 million over five years,  
then be shipped to the Spurs. San Antonio was undecided on exactly 
who it would send back to the Bulls, although Monty WIlliams was a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other previously undisclosed deals in the works:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Clippers free agent forward Loy Vaught was close to accepting  
a five-year offer from Detroit for about $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hornets center Vlade Divac was due back from Europe on Tuesday  
to decide between competing offers from Sacramento, the Clippers 
and other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Barkley and Rockets guard Matt Maloney were expected to  
re-sign with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hawks free agent guard Eldridge Recasner was close to agreeing  
to a deal with Charlotte for four yars and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Celtics center Popeye Jones was expected to re-sign with  
Boston for $8 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wizards forward Harvey Grant was headed to Philadelphia for  
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the league and union also were squabbling over  
changes to so-called circumvention rules. The league wants to 
prohibit wink-and-nod deals in which a team would sign a free agent 
for one year with the unwritten understanding that a long-term deal 
would follow using the Bird exception. The union contends changes 
to that rule were never discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a realistic chance of getting it done by the  
end of the day tomorrow (Tuesday),'' said Jeffrey Kessler, lead 
outside counsel for the union.

<HEADLINE> Critics Pressing Olympics Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Critics of the 2002 Olympics threatened  
Monday to launch a petition drive unless the governor and 
legislature act to protect taxpayers from the Winter Games' 
``financial folly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that means the Utah capital must follow Denver's lead from  
1976 and give the Olympics back, so be it, the group Utahns for 
Responsible Public Spending said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not some sense of civic shame hovering over Denver,''  
said Stephen Pace, the longtime Olympic opponent leading the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal underwriting of the games is turning out to be Salt  
Lake's biggest vulnerability in the wake of the Olympics worst 
corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City, by contract with the International Olympic  
Committee, is obligated to pay any debts left behind by the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's governor in 1991 signed a contract saying the state would  
stand behind Salt Lake in meeting any shortfall, and current Gov. 
Mike Leavitt says the state has a moral obligation. Yet he 
acknowledges Utah's Constitution prohibits the state from 
guaranteeing a city's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ability to raise the  
remaining $250 million it needs from corporate sponsors is in 
jeopardy following revelations that Olympic bidders gave IOC 
members lavish gifts, cash, scholarships and medical care as they 
sought the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has brought down two of Salt Lake's top organizers  
and a U.S. Olympic Committee official, and threatens 13 IOC members 
with expulsion or sanction. 
</P>
<P>
	In his state-of-the-state address Monday night, Gov. Leavitt  
noted Utah's ``relentless soul-searching'' over the scandal and its 
willingness to expose the mistakes and form new Olympic leadership. 
The IOC, he said, should do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must tell all, they must expel the offenders, they must  
change the bid process and return the Olympics to its place as a 
force of human ennoblement,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let history remember this as the cleansing moment when we all  
looked inward and returned the games to its roots of athleticism 
and altruism rather than money and materialism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, two of the IOC's most prominent figures denied  
any wrongdoing as their names were linked to the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's Kim Un-Yong, a powerful member of the IOC  
executive board, and former vice president Vitaly Smirnov of Russia 
confirmed they were among the IOC delegates under investigation in 
the bribery case. 
</P>
<P>
	City council members asked state Attorney General Jan Graham  
last week whether the eight-year-old state-city agreement would 
hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Monday, Utahns for Responsible Public Spending pressed  
for a public discussion of who pays if the games fail, choosing the 
Capitol Rotunda on the opening day of the Utah Legislature's 45-day 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotta figure out who's going to pay and quit pointing  
fingers at each other,'' Pace said. ``The governor says the state 
has a moral obligation. Do voters believe they do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a proposed initiative petition with the  
lieutenant governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Legislature doesn't force the IOC to share in the  
financial risks or call a public vote on state guarantees of public 
debt this spring, the group will begin circulating the petition 
with the hope of putting it on the 2000 general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The group would need around 125,000 signatures, and hopes the  
lieutenant governor will allow it to collect signatures via the 
Internet and E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Utahns for Responsible Public Spending failed to  
get enough signatures on an almost identical initiative petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace is hoping the scandal will give the effort new steam. ``The  
shock is just beginning to set in for the people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or  
reimburse the debt or obligations of any organization hosting the 
Olympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	If voters approved it, Salt Lake City alone would be on the  
hook. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace believes Utah residents would vote to stop the Olympics,  
although that's not something his group can legally propose via an 
initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the chance of dumping the games were put to the people this  
spring, I think they'd do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver voters decided in 1972 to give back the 1976 Winter  
Games, fearing environmental damage and mammoth public debt. It's 
the only time a city has given the games back for any reason other 
than war. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC Chairman Robert Garff has said he remains confident  
organizers can raise all the money they need to meet the $1.4 
billion budget. They already have commitments for 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But if there is a shortfall in revenue, the games will be scaled  
back, Garff has said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday, IOC director of marketing  
Michael Payne said sponsors he met with in the United States last 
week continue to support the games and none has pulled out. But 
they are pressing for a thorough investigation, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The concern from a few of the sponsors is that the IOC gets to  
the bottom of the matter and roots out any form of impropriety or 
unethical activity,'' he said. ``The IOC is committed to doing 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Marks King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Answering his own call for Americans to spend  
King Day doing volunteer work, President Clinton is taking time out 
from his State of the Union preparations to visit with senior 
citizens at a local retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, joined by Vice President Al Gore and Washington  
Mayor Anthony Williams, was stopping by the Regency House today to 
join volunteers from his Americorps program in a service project. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was part of a national focus on service in the spirit  
of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the nation's most 
celebrated human rights activist. Afterward, Clinton was returning 
to the White House for more rehearsals of the State of the Union 
address he will deliver Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will mark the day by announcing that the administration  
will request a 15 percent increase in federal spending on civil 
rights enforcement. Last year the administration asked for an $86 
million increase and got $64 million from Congress. The 
administration is seeking an additional $84 million this year, to 
bring the total to $663 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``These funds will help ensure that no American is denied a job,  
a home or an education because of their race, color, creed, gender 
or religion,'' Gore said. ``Instead, we will help ensure equal 
opportunity for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton actually began celebrating King Day activities on  
Sunday, joining hands with his wife, Hillary, to sing ``We Shall 
Overcome'' during services at Foundry United Methodist Church that 
were devoted to King's message of nonviolence and racial tolerance. 
They also sang the black anthem ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his sermon, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman noted that King may  
have been a flawed man in his personal life, but his firm belief in 
equality and social justice eclipsed those flaws. Because of that, 
he said, history has been kind to King, despite the persecution 
from enemies and FBI investigations he endured during his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were those who singled out his flaws and took that as a  
reason to repudiate him, but yet the guide of history is very 
different,'' Wogaman said. ``He was not a perfect person. He was a 
good man, a courageous man, a God-intoxicated man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's federal King holiday, observed on the third Monday  
in January, commemorates what would have been the civil rights 
leader's 70th birthday. King was born Jan. 15, 1929, and died April 
4, 1968 from an assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton urged Americans to  
honor King with ``a day on, not a day off.'' He suggested they take 
part in an effort by his Americorps national service program to get 
100,000 people to take part in volunteer programs. Members of 
Clinton's Cabinet also planned to perform volunteer work today.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Sign 2nd, 3rd Basemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays dipped into the free-agent  
market to shore up their infield, agreeing Monday to one-year 
contracts with second baseman Joey Cora and third baseman Willie 
Greene. 
</P>
<P>
	Cora, 33, hit .276 with six homers and 32 RBI last season,  
splitting his season between Seattle and Cleveland. He gets a 
$500,000 one-year contract, of which $150,000 is guaranteed, and 
the chance to make $450,000 in performance bonuses based on games 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had 26 home runs and drove in 91 runs with Cincinnati two  
years ago. Baltimore acquired Greene from the Reds last September 
but didn't offer him a 1999 contract, reportedly because they 
didn't want to pay him as much as he would get in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-handed hitter had a .270 average with 14 homers and 49  
RBIs with Cincinnati but only hit .154 with one homer and five RBIs 
in 24 games with Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers To Attend Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House has invited student  
volunteers, activist parents and others who ``exhibit what is best 
about America'' to view President Clinton's State of the Union 
address Tuesday night with Hillary Rodham Clinton and special guest 
Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs' slugger will be honored not only for  
surpassing the 61-home-run mark this season but also for his relief 
efforts on behalf of the victims of Hurricane Mitch, an 
administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other guests include a woman who works with single mothers  
in Boston, a Vietnamese refugee who mentors teen-age boys in 
California and a third-grade teacher from Miami who helped develop 
a gun-safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor of Denver and an Air Force captain also were to sit  
with the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is expected to focus heavily on his domestic agenda the  
address to a joint session of Congress and a national TV audience, 
and the guests will serve as embodiments of issues he hopes to 
address over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people chosen to sit with Mrs. Clinton daily exhibit what  
is best about America,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Those joining the first lady are:  
</P>
<P>
	--Ashley Dumas, who graduated in 1998 from Wellesley College,  
Mrs. Clinton's alma mater, and enlisted in the AmeriCorps domestic 
service program. She works at Project Hope, a shelter for single 
mothers in South Boston, where she tutors women studying for their 
high school diplomas and provides child care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Loc Truong, who with his parents and five siblings came from  
Vietnam as a political refugee, mentors eight high-risk teen-age 
boys with the San Luis Obispo, Calif., AmeriCorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	--A third grade teacher at Coral Way Elementary School in Miami,  
Joanna Quintana Barroso, has been involved in a curriculum-based 
gun-safety program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Under Mayor Wellington E. Webb's stewardship, Denver has been  
ranked among the nation's top cities by national news magazines. 
The White House singled out his efforts to ``launch local projects 
to save our history and prepare children for the 21st century.'' 
Denver is also one of three cities vying to host the Democratic 
convention in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Capt. Jeffrey B. Taliaferro is chief of wing weapons for a 28th  
Bomb Wing support squadron, and he served in Operation Desert Fox 
from Thumrait, Oman. He flew in combat operations and was the 
architect of the first B-1 bomber combat mission. 
</P>
<P>
	--Suzann Wilson's 11-year-old daughter Britthney Varner was shot  
and killed when two schoolmates opened fire on a crowd of children 
outside a Jonesboro, Ark., school. Now Wilson is working to pass 
Child Access Prevention laws that would require gun owners to keep 
firearms out of children's reach. The boys used firearms they stole 
after breaking into a grandfather's home. 
</P>
<P>
	--Officer Chris Lonsford received a medal of valor from the  
Fontana, Calif., police department last March for bravery he showed 
in assisting in the arrest of three heavily armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maurice Lim Miller is executive director of San Francisco's  
Asian Neighborhood Design, a community development agency serving 
low-income families that was recognized under Clinton's race 
initiative for work promoting racial reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Elam Hill, 15, won National Science Foundation recognition for  
developing a communications center for homeless families with 
school-age children, making it easier for them to transfer student 
records when they seek shelter. Hill, who lives in one of Atlanta's 
poorest neighborhoods, was inspired by the homeless he passed on 
his way to school. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dr. Rita Colwell, the NSF's first woman chief, is helping  
direct a five-year initiative in information technology that hopes 
to quicken the pace of scientific discovery.

<HEADLINE> AOL Pulls Thesaurus After Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online and Merriam-Webster Inc.  
pulled an online thesaurus after gay rights organizations 
complained about the synonyms given for ``homosexual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thesaurus listed the slurs ``fruit,'' ``homo'' and  
``faggot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thesaurus was taken offline Friday, and the slurs will  
probably be removed when the feature returns in about a week, said 
Deborah Burns, marketing director for Merriam-Webster. 
</P>
<P>
	``But first, we're making an apology about this. We were in  
error in a couple of ways and we're glad someone has brought it to 
our attention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights groups had asked not that the words be removed but  
that they be flagged as derogatory, said Cathy Renna, a spokeswoman 
for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they are words that people don't know and don't  
use, but in 1999, they are words that should be presented in some 
sort of context,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Some See Opportunity in Falcons Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The closer Game Day got, the stronger grew  
Rudolph Terry's belief that the Atlanta Falcons would win the NFC 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why, the night before Sunday's game against the Minnesota  
Vikings, he canceled his flight to Minneapolis and shipped his own 
tickets to an associate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated to give up my seats, but I said, `We got to go to  
work,''' Terry recounted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He cheered the Falcons on his home television, allowed himself a  
few minutes to savor their overtime victory, then headed to his 
Terry Manufacturing apparel business to begin rolling out 
conference championship shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager fans descended on stores Monday in search of such  
paraphernalia, as the sudden rise of the Falcons to their first 
Super Bowl gave some Atlanta-area businesses double reason to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've followed the Falcons for almost 35 years. It just feels  
good,'' said Terry, who with his 70 workers printed up to 20,000 
shirts for shipment to retailers within 12 hours of Morten 
Andersen's game-winning field goal. ``There's a general level of 
both Falcon pride and Atlanta pride, and I'm sure that adrenaline 
allowed people to work 18 or 20 hours without sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were still cranking out their NFL-licensed shirts Monday to  
meet initial orders. But Terry, like operators of other 
sports-related businesses, was in uncharted territory when trying 
to guess what total demand will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping this is going to be a big bonus,'' said Diana  
Harris, president of Glorious Events catering. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her business, which usually caters many  
business-related Super Bowl parties, could jump by a third for this 
year's game, adding another $50,000 in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all totally speculative,'' added the 27-year veteran of  
the catering business. ``I'm a native Atlantan and we've never done 
a Falcons Super Bowl before. So it's going to be interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Choice, manager at a Buffalo's Cafe suburban Marietta, said  
he was starting work on a game plan for the Jan. 31 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his restaurant sold $400 worth of takeout chicken wings  
even before it opened its doors Sunday and another seven 40-pound 
cases of wings to customers who dined in and watched the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket brokers and travel agents started getting calls  
immediately after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kaplan, owner of Tickets Plus Travel in Atlanta, said Super  
Bowl tickets were starting at $1,650 each, with a variety of hotel 
and transportation packages also available for additional charge. 
Travel agents were offering air charter deals with tickets for up 
to $4,000 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an NFL formula, each participating team will receive about  
11,000 tickets, to be distributed to staff and club associates and 
then split among season-ticket holders via a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Holman, a season-ticket holder for 20 years, said Monday  
he'd already been notified he could buy two Super Bowl tickets from 
the Falcons at $325 each. The Powder Springs businessman was 
scrambling to make hotel reservations and to decide whether to fly 
or drive to the game-- it's about a 12-hour trip by car. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, he wouldn't miss it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've endured this for so many years. All of them who were  
always saying `you're a fool' for buying those tickets every year 
are the ones who've been calling me now saying, `Hey, you got any 
playoff tickets?''' Holman said. ``It's been a lot of fun. Our day 
has come!'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Braves Clubhouse store in the CNN Center, manager Don  
Shields said ``tons of people'' had called or come by looking for 
Falcons Super Bowl shirts and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hot -- probably as big as when the Braves won  
their first championship,'' Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Tolbert, 18, of Douglasville, had already been waiting  
more than an hour at the store for the caps, which were due to 
arrive Monday afternoon. But he showed no impatience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting a long time for this,'' he said. ``I've  
been waiting all my life. Who would think the Falcons are going to 
be in the Super Bowl?''

<HEADLINE> With Loss, Parcells Talks Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- As much as Bill Parcells talked about  
being physically tired and emotionally drained the day after the 
New York Jets lost the AFC Championship game to Denver, his words 
focused elsewhere -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Make no mistake, Parcells and his players on Monday sounded very  
much like a team intent on ending the Jets' Super Bowl drought at 
31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players that I won't rest,'' Parcells told a packed  
news conference less than 24 hours after a 23-10 loss to the 
Broncos on Sunday left them a victory shy of football's biggest 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them that last year my whole idea is to try to improve  
the team each year. We'll see what we can do to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate agenda was already on the table for Parcells, who  
confirmed Monday that he will return as coach next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old man who is now the only coach to lead three  
teams to conference title games already had a full schedule on 
Tuesday. There was a season-ending meeting planned for his coaching 
staff, administrative conferences to discuss the salary cap and 
free agency and a player-expansion list due. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings had already been held with some players on Monday, the  
coaching staff had been re-signed and permission had been given to 
Chicago and Kansas City to talk to assistant head coach Bill 
Belichick about head coaching vacancies with the Bears and Chiefs. 
There also were seven free-agent signings, mostly practice squad 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	All this from a guy who claimed he was very tired, and who tried  
to reiterate that during his news conference by discussing his 
thoughts at the 2-minute warning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think the same thing,'' Parcells said. ``It's another  
offseason. It's another draft. It's another training camp. It's 
another preseason. It's another regular season and it's another 
semifinal game just to get where you are standing. I can remember 
this feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells said he felt the same way in 1985 when the Giants lost  
to NFC semifinal to Chicago 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants came back the following year and won the Super Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
	When reminded of that, Parcells said there is no similarity to  
the teams, even though he admitted the Jets, who were met at 
LaGuardia Airport by owner Leon Hess, had a lot more chances to do 
things on Sunday against Denver than the Giants had against the 
Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Jets led 10-0 and probably were one big play away  
from putting the Broncos away in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It never came though, and New York was eventually done in by six  
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you this, you don't forget,'' said backup  
quarterback and special teams star Ray Lucas. ``I'm not going to 
forget. It's going to be fresh in my mind. It's two years in a row 
we were almost, almost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what Parcells told the team on Monday, Lucas smiled  
confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said: `We'll be back,' so you know it,'' Lucas said.  
``We're all right. We'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a sentiment echoed by many players after a 12-4 regular  
season and a 1-1 record in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want a small victory and say: `Woo, we got to the AFC  
championship,''' receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. ``I don't want to 
smile and be happy about that. That's not the case. Everyone in 
this locker room is not happy about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Vinny Testaverde was one of many Jets who had a  
tough night sleeping, knowing the game was there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lose it the way we did, it's hard to accept,'' he said.  
``If you get blown out, it's easier to accept. Then they were the 
better team and you lost. The good thing is we know we can play 
with the best of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets did on Sunday, but for only 30-plus minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know that we have accomplished a lot, just thinking about  
it,'' cornerback Ray Mickens said. ``But knowing we could have been 
at the big dance, you really want another shot at that opportunity, 
and we have to wait a whole year for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That year has already started for Parcells.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to go through the division next year like we did this  
would be an accomplishment to do that,'' he said. ``But I don't 
think it's impossible.''

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Denies Part in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A powerful South Korean member of the  
IOC executive board today denied any wrongdoing in connection with 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-Yong confirmed he received a letter demanding  
explanations from IOC officials investigating allegations of 
misconduct by IOC members during Salt Lake's bid for the Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, one of 13 International Olympic Committee members linked to  
the scandal, is part of the IOC's powerful inner circle and 
considered a possible candidate to succeed Juan Antonio Samaranch 
as president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not do anything that I should be ashamed of,'' he told  
reporters. ``I don't even feel it necessary to comment on it, 
because I have absolutely nothing to do with the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I already clarified my case and this will be cleared up in the  
IOC's executive board meeting on Jan 24.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC is investigating reports of cash payments, extravagant  
gifts and other favors to some of its members in exchange for votes 
leading to the selection of Salt Lake City as the site of the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sport Intern, a German-based newsletter specializing in Olympic  
news, said Kim was implicated for a ``minor offense'' and is not 
expected to face expulsion or other punishment from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch told The Associated Press last week that 13 IOC  
members had been implicated in the Salt Lake investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said nine had been accused of ``serious'' misconduct which  
could result in expulsions, while four others were cited for minor 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said he was asked by the IOC to clarify his 1991 assistance  
in helping a Russian teen-age student enroll in a U.S. school at 
the request of Russian IOC member Vitaly Smirnov. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was simply an effort to help a friend,'' Kim said.  
``Considering a difficult situation in Russia in 1991 after the 
former Soviet Union collapsed, I introduced the student to former 
Salt Lake Olympics chief Tom Welch. I did not receive any money or 
gift in return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other details of the arrangement were not revealed.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Salt Lake was bidding for the 1998 Winter Games,  
which were awarded in 1991 to Nagano, Japan. In 1995, Salt Lake won 
the right to stage the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Smirnov confirmed today that he also had received notification  
from the IOC that he was under investigation. He said he was asked 
for explanations regarding his request for free medical treatment 
of a Russian hockey player and for receiving a hunting rifle as a 
gift during a trip to Salt Lake. He also denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Bure Gets Trade Wish, Goes to Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- For all of Pavel Bure's magic on the ice,  
it might be difficult matching the hocus-pocus performed by the 
Florida Panthers in acquiring the high-scoring, high-priced Russian 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the Panthers obtain one of the most electrifying  
players in hockey, they did so while managing to leave their 
nucleus virtually intact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fortunate. Pavel was not going to go to Vancouver,''  
Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said after the deal was 
announced on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	To pry Bure from the Canucks, Florida parted with top defenseman  
Ed Jovanovski, centers Dave Gagner and Mike Brown and holdout 
goaltender Kevin Weekes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also received defensemen Bret Hedican and Brad  
Ference, and will swap a first-round draft pick in 1999 or 2000 for 
Vancouver's third-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us a shot in the arm,'' Murray said. ``There's not  
one person on our staff that doesn't think (Bure is) a superstar -- 
one of the top five or so players in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who has spent the entire season at his home in Moscow  
after telling the Canucks he would never play for them again, is 
expected to join the Panthers in New York for games Wednesday 
against the Islanders and Thursday against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy when my agent called me and said I was  
going to the Florida Panthers,'' Bure said Monday during a 
teleconference. ``I know it's a young team. I hope we can do 
something good for the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks president Brian Burke had set a deadline of Monday to  
make a deal or pull the three-time 50-goal scorer off the market 
until the March 23 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Burke decided Florida's offer met his needs -- a  
tough young defenseman, a No. 2 center and other top young talent 
to help build for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have made it if I wasn't comfortable with it,''  
Burke said. ``We're ecstatic. Whether the public sees it that way, 
my guess is probably not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the wait was worth it, Bure said: ``Oh, yeah. It was an  
important thing in my life. You put a goal in front of yourself and 
you always try to reach that goal. Sometimes you have to make 
sacrifices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, 27, is a four-time all-star who gives Florida its most  
explosive scorer in the franchise's six-year history. No Panther 
has scored more than 32 goals in a season, by Scott Mellanby in 
1995-96 and Ray Whitney last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like shooting the puck on goal,'' said  
Panthers coach Terry Murray, who plans initially to pair Bure with 
fellow Russian Viktor Kozlov. ``He has the opportunity to be a 
threat every time he's on the ice. I hope he'll also have an effect 
on some of our other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure won the 1992 Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie, scoring  
34 goals in 60 games. He followed that with consecutive 60-goal 
seasons, leading the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup finals with 16 
postseason goals in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian star scored 51 goals last season, one off the league  
lead, but demanded a trade over the summer. Bure would not disclose 
why he had grown disenchanted with the Canucks, but disputed 
Burke's contention that he had wearied of a fish-bowl environment 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so funny. I never said that,'' Bure said. ``People were  
really nice to me there. I have a lot of friends there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure is in the last season of a five-year deal worth a reported  
$8 million. Talks on an extension have already begun, Murray said, 
and should be completed before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovski, 22, has been playing some of the best hockey of his  
four-year NHL career. The No. 1 pick of the 1994 draft has three 
goals and 13 assists this season to go with his hard-nosed 
checking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's punishing and yet he has offensive skill and a hard shot.  
We think he upgrades our defense,'' Burke said.

<HEADLINE>  Bure Gets Trade Wish, Goes to Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- For all of Pavel Bure's magic on the ice,  
it might be difficult matching the hocus-pocus performed by the 
Florida Panthers in acquiring the high-scoring, high-priced Russian 
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only did the Panthers obtain one of the most electrifying  
players in hockey, they did so while managing to leave their 
nucleus virtually intact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fortunate. Pavel was not going to go to Vancouver,''  
Panthers general manager Bryan Murray said after the deal was 
announced on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	To pry Bure from the Canucks, Florida parted with top defenseman  
Ed Jovanovski, centers Dave Gagner and Mike Brown and holdout 
goaltender Kevin Weekes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers also received defensemen Bret Hedican and Brad  
Ference, and will swap a first-round draft pick in 1999 or 2000 for 
Vancouver's third-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us a shot in the arm,'' Murray said. ``There's not  
one person on our staff that doesn't think (Bure is) a superstar -- 
one of the top five or so players in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, who has spent the entire season at his home in Moscow  
after telling the Canucks he would never play for them again, is 
expected to join the Panthers in New York for games Wednesday 
against the Islanders and Thursday against the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy when my agent called me and said I was  
going to the Florida Panthers,'' Bure said Monday during a 
teleconference. ``I know it's a young team. I hope we can do 
something good for the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canucks president Brian Burke had set a deadline of Monday to  
make a deal or pull the three-time 50-goal scorer off the market 
until the March 23 trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Burke decided Florida's offer met his needs -- a  
tough young defenseman, a No. 2 center and other top young talent 
to help build for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have made it if I wasn't comfortable with it,''  
Burke said. ``We're ecstatic. Whether the public sees it that way, 
my guess is probably not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the wait was worth it, Bure said: ``Oh, yeah. It was an  
important thing in my life. You put a goal in front of yourself and 
you always try to reach that goal. Sometimes you have to make 
sacrifices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure, 27, is a four-time all-star who gives Florida its most  
explosive scorer in the franchise's six-year history. No Panther 
has scored more than 32 goals in a season, by Scott Mellanby in 
1995-96 and Ray Whitney last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like shooting the puck on goal,'' said  
Panthers coach Terry Murray, who plans initially to pair Bure with 
fellow Russian Viktor Kozlov. ``He has the opportunity to be a 
threat every time he's on the ice. I hope he'll also have an effect 
on some of our other players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure won the 1992 Calder Trophy as the NHL's top rookie, scoring  
34 goals in 60 games. He followed that with consecutive 60-goal 
seasons, leading the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup finals with 16 
postseason goals in 24 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian star scored 51 goals last season, one off the league  
lead, but demanded a trade over the summer. Bure would not disclose 
why he had grown disenchanted with the Canucks, but disputed 
Burke's contention that he had wearied of a fish-bowl environment 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so funny. I never said that,'' Bure said. ``People were  
really nice to me there. I have a lot of friends there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure is in the last season of a five-year deal worth a reported  
$8 million. Talks on an extension have already begun, Murray said, 
and should be completed before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovski, 22, has been playing some of the best hockey of his  
four-year NHL career. The No. 1 pick of the 1994 draft has three 
goals and 13 assists this season to go with his hard-nosed 
checking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's punishing and yet he has offensive skill and a hard shot.  
We think he upgrades our defense,'' Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagner, 34, has four goals and 10 assists this season. Squeezed  
out by the Panthers' young talent, he will move in as Vancouver's 
No. 2 center behind Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>

when he refused a two-way contract that would have paid him a lower 
salary in the minors. He's been playing for Detroit of the IHL, 
compiling a 14-3-6 record with a 2.09 goals-against average.

<HEADLINE> Euro Chief Wants Labor Market Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Europe must reform rigid labor  
policies and avoid budget deficits if it wants to boost growth and 
cut chronically high unemployment, European Central Bank President 
Wim Duisenberg said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jan. 1 launch of the euro, Europe's single currency, has  
helped create the conditions needed to foster flagging growth, 
Duisenberg said in a speech delivered to the European Parliament's 
monetary affairs committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But to really dent Europe's high unemployment, currently at 10.8  
percent for the 11 euro participating countries, structural reform 
of labor and product markets is needed, Duisenberg said in a copy 
of the speech released early. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro is expected to cut the cost of doing business in Europe  
and will create a more unified, transparent market. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg's call for governments to reform labor markets was  
more strongly expressed than usual, in an apparent attempt counter 
pressure from some center-left European finance ministers for lower 
interest rates as a way to boost the economy and cut unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Duisenberg opposes that, and has said the bank's key rate of 3  
percent will stay for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth in Europe is expected to flag to 2.4 percent in the third  
quarter of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Marks King Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Answering his own call for Americans to spend  
King Day doing volunteer work, President Clinton is taking time out 
from his State of the Union preparations to visit with senior 
citizens at a local retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, joined by Vice President Al Gore and Washington  
Mayor Anthony Williams, was stopping by the Regency House today to 
join volunteers from his Americorps program in a service project. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was part of a national focus on service in the spirit  
of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the nation's most 
celebrated human rights activist. Afterward, Clinton was returning 
to the White House for more rehearsals of the State of the Union 
address he will deliver Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported in today's editions that Gore will  
mark the day -- as he did last year in Atlanta -- by announcing that 
the administration will request a 15 percent increase in federal 
spending on civil rights enforcement. Last year the administration 
asked for an $86 million increase and got $64 million from 
Congress. The administration is seeking an additional $84 million 
this year, to bring the total to $663 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton actually began celebrating King Day activities on  
Sunday, joining hands with his wife, Hillary, to sing ``We Shall 
Overcome'' during services at Foundry United Methodist Church that 
were devoted to King's message of non-violence and racial 
tolerance. They also sang the black anthem ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and 
Sing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his sermon, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman noted that King may  
have been a flawed man in his personal life, but his firm belief in 
equality and social justice eclipsed those flaws. Because of that, 
he said, history has been kind to King, despite the persecution 
from enemies and FBI investigations he endured during his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were those who singled out his flaws and took that as a  
reason to repudiate him, but yet the guide of history is very 
different,'' Wogaman said. ``He was not a perfect person. He was a 
good man, a courageous man, a God-intoxicated man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's federal King holiday, observed on the third Monday  
in January, commemorates what would have been the civil rights 
leader's 70th birthday. King was born Jan. 15, 1929, and died April 
4, 1968 from an assassin's bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton urged Americans to  
honor King with ``a day on, not a day off.'' He suggested they take 
part in an effort by his Americorps national service program to get 
100,000 people to take part in volunteer programs. Members of 
Clinton's Cabinet also planned to perform volunteer work today.

<HEADLINE> DEA Agent Charged in Va. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- An off-duty federal Drug Enforcement  
Administration agent was charged in a parking lot shooting that 
wounded two men, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Armento, 34, was charged with shooting into an occupied  
vehicle and unlawful wounding, police said. He was expected to 
surrender to police Tuesday, Sgt. Jeff Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident early Thursday morning started when three men  
leaving a bar got into an argument with Armento and two other 
off-duty DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Turk said that when he saw that Armento and his friends  
were armed, he retrieved a weapon from a friend's truck and put it 
on the hood. That's when Armento opened fire, Turk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armento was the only one to fire, police said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason Temple, 21, was struck in the chest, the bullet piercing a  
lung and passing within an inch of his heart. He was in critical 
condition Sunday at Riverside Regional Medical Center. A hospital 
spokeswoman said his family asked that no updated information on 
his condition be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk, 20, was hit in the upper left arm. He was treated and  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk said he had seen Armento and his two companions drinking in  
the bar before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	`When we walked out of the bar, we looked at them, and one of  
them said, `What are you looking at?'' Turk said. He said Temple 
answered back with the same line. 
</P>
<P>
	DEA officials said the shooting was under investigation.

<HEADLINE> If It Was Elway's Last, It Was Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- It was a scene befitting a conquering hero. There  
were cheers, tears and the spoils of victory. 
</P>
<P>
	After 16 years, it really was the only way John Elway could  
leave Mile High Stadium -- saluting the fans as they saluted back. 
Holding the AFC Championship trophy high, a wide smile on his face 
as 75,000 supplicants paid tribute to the greatest athlete Denver 
has known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a guy in the NFL who  
symbolized his town like John Elway,'' Shannon Sharpe said. ``If 
you think of Denver, you don't think of skiing. You think of John 
Elway. It's always been John, and even if he retires, it will still 
always be John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when Elway took the microphone sand shouted to the fans, ``I  
love you,'' he already knew how they felt about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the tour around the field more than 20 minutes after the  
conclusion of the victory over the New York Jets was somewhat 
unexpected. Elway usually is more reserved than, say, Brett Favre. 
Although he shows his emotions on the field more than, say, Joe 
Montana ever did, Elway's personality never seemed to fit being the 
focal point of a coronation. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's what Sunday's celebrations felt like.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel comfortable, taking that lap,'' said Elway,  
expected to announce his retirement after a little more business, 
the Super Bowl vs. Atlanta on Jan. 31 in Miami. ``But I'm glad I 
did it. I had a chance to see the fans and look into their eyes, to 
really concentrate on them. They were so happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the nicest things about playing. You win a  
football game, and the fans are that happy. I'm glad to see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Broncos fans can't be looking forward to their team  
without No. 7 at quarterback, they understand that, at 38, Elway is 
a bit old and worn for a young man's game. Sure, it's been a 
wonderful season for veteran quarterbacks, from Elway to Steve 
Young to Chris Chandler to Vinny Testaverde to Randall Cunningham 
to Doug Flutie. And Elway probably still has the drive to stick 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never lose the fact you want to play mentally,'' he said.  
``But physically, it might not be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The post-game commemoration should remain more memorable than  
Elway's performance itself, which was ragged. He was only 13-for-34 
for 173 yards, and many of his passes were far off-target. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the most dire of times, with the Broncos floundering  
early in the third quarter, down 10-0 and looking like misfits in 
the AFC Championship game, Elway provided the big play. His 47-yard 
completion to Ed McCaffrey sparked the Broncos, who scored 23 
straight points to win their fifth conference crown with Elway at 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, with blow-up Elway dolls and life-size posters and  
banners proclaiming ``Thanks For The Memories, John,'' and ``From 
Denver With Love,'' sprinkled through the stands, Elway made his 
little tour, the Lamar Hunt Trophy held high, flocks of cameramen 
following, their flashbulbs illuminating the Mile High night. 
</P>
<P>
	``That made me feel great,'' said Broncos fan Ron Dubosar. ``I  
love the guy. Everybody loves the guy. Everybody would love to have 
him back. But if he's got to go, he's got to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Broncos believe it was Elway's final home game. If  
they didn't before the post-game partying, they almost certainly do 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	And they are proud that the 16 years of heroics ended the way it  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is his last game, how do you send John Elway out a  
loser?'' asked Sharpe. '' We knew it couldn't end that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came back this season for another shot at the Super Bowl,  
and that's where he's going. That should be the ending.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Suggests Punishment for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- William Preston Summers is getting a lot of  
attention for lying, but the 8-year-old wants another William -- 
President Clinton -- to know that telling lies is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	During an appearance today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''  
William said he doesn't think Clinton should be removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still like him because of all his education -- the schools  
and stuff,'' he said. ``I don't think he should be impeached. Just 
have to write, like, an essay. Like I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago boy wrote a letter to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., as  
punishment for a fib to his parents. Hyde, who chairs the House 
Judiciary Committee, read it on the Senate floor Saturday to sum up 
the case for removing the president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is bad to lie because it just gets you in more trouble. I  
hate getting in trouble,'' William wrote in the letter. He later 
added: ``If you cannot believe the president, who can you believe? 
If you have no one to believe in, then how do you run your life?'' 
</P>
<P>
	William today cautioned the president: ``If he lied ever again,  
he should be impeached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what was the lie that prompted the boy's letter to Hyde?  
</P>
<P>
	William had twisted the arm of another boy after swim practice  
but later told his mother two boys had been ganging up on him. The 
lie was revealed when William's brother, Christopher, leaked the 
true story. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the tattletale of the family,'' William said.  
</P>
<P>
	William's father Bobby Summers, 31, a graduate student in  
political science, suggested the letter when father and son were 
watching news of the impeachment proceedings in December. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to have worked.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the cure,'' William said. ``I haven't lied since.''

<HEADLINE> Detroit Pileup Leaves 12 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Black ice, fog and high speed were being blamed  
for a chain-reaction crash just south of Detroit that injured at 
least a dozen people, one critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday morning accident along the westbound lane of  
Interstate 94 was described by one witness as a ``pinball machine'' 
of wreckage that included as many as 50 cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the pileup began as a single-car accident that  
triggered an eight-car smash-up, quickly growing into a series of 
smaller accidents that forced authorities to shut down the 
interstate for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Even an ambulance responding to the accident crashed into a  
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're patting yourself on the back for not hitting anyone,  
then someone comes in and sails into your car,'' said Ed Jankow, 
who was headed to his job at Detroit Metropolitan Airport when he 
spotted the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after pulling to the shoulder and stepping out from his  
car, several other vehicles slammed into his. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky that I was standing on the median,'' said Jankow,  
52. ``The way they were bouncing off each other was like a pinball 
machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State Police Trooper John Sosa said the fog and drivers  
moving too fast ``coupled with the black ice on the roadway caused 
cars to spin out of control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those factors spelled nothing but trouble.''  
</P>
<P>
	One critically injured victim was transferred by helicopter to  
the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, Oakwood 
Healthcare System spokeswoman Jennifer George-Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was listed in critical condition with injuries to her  
head, pelvis and legs, University of Michigan Health System 
spokesman Pete Barkey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten other victims were treated for injuries ranging from cuts to  
bruises and chest pains, Ms. George-Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 12th victim -- a woman -- was treated at a hospital in suburban  
Wyandotte and was released, spokesman John Lewandowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities reopened I-94 to eastbound traffic about noon Sunday  
and to westbound traffic about 2 p.m., Sosa said.

<HEADLINE> Islanders Acquire Center Janney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders have acquired  
center Craig Janney from the Tampa Bay Lightning for a sixth-round 
draft pick in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the deal was made Monday by Islanders general  
manager-coach Mike Milbury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Throughout his career, Craig has consistently proven that he  
can distribute the puck and produce offensively,'' Milbury said in 
a statement. ``Since that is obviously an area were we are lacking, 
I'm certain he can help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 742 career games with Boston, St. Louis, San Jose, Winnipeg,  
Phoenix and Tampa Bay, Janney has 187 goals and 559 assists for 746 
points. Janney, 31, had four goals and 18 assists in 38 games for 
the Lightning this season.

<HEADLINE> Once Unknown, Porter Leads Auburn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- At the start of the season, few knew who  
Chris Porter was -- even some of the sports information people at 
Auburn inadvertently called him ``Porter Smith'' following the 
first exhibition game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But his name recognition is changing dramatically. He's probably  
the top newcomer in the country and might be the best player in the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Porter will try to help No. 6 Auburn (17-0, 5-0)  
break a 12-game losing streak to No. 7 Kentucky (15-4, 4-1) -- only 
the third matchup in the Tigers' 90-year history between two Top-10 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect this game to be that big of deal when I first  
got here,'' Porter said. ``But all SEC games are big and this is 
just another one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Auburn games are big this year, largely because of Porter. A  
flashy, exciting transfer from Chipola (Fla.) Junior College, 
Porter quickly went to work awakening the long-slumbering program. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long. From day one, when he took the court with  
his 1970's-style afro, the fans have loved him. He wowed them with 
his thundering dunks, his spectacular leaping ability and 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
	And before he could get his hair trimmed, as he did, the word on  
Porter was out. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson called the 6-foot-7 forward ``a  
definite first-rounder'' after Porter scored 20 points against the 
Razorbacks. Kentucky coach Tubby Smith called Porter ``one of the 
best players in the country, not just this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter currently leads Auburn with 16.8 points and 8.7 rebounds  
per game, and his 37 steals and 3.9 offensive rebounding average 
rank second in the SEC. He's a dominant inside force at both ends 
of the court and thrives when the game is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	After going scoreless in the first half against Florida last  
Saturday, he had 15 second-half points to break open a close game 
and move the Tigers to 5-0 in SEC play for the first time since 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the game so I go out and give it my all,'' Porter said.  
``That's all I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's gained an awful lot of attention doing so, something that's  
completely new to him. Although he hams it up on the court and with 
the fans, he's reserved with the media and hesitant to put too much 
of the focus on himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a team player, there's 13 of us,'' he said. ``I'm  
just a regular kid, like anybody else, trying to get an education. 
I didn't come here for recognition, I came here to play basketball 
and I'm loving every minute of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of his reluctance to be the star is because he's never been  
one before. Only Auburn recruited him out of Abbeville High School, 
where he was the MVP of the Class 4A state championship game. He 
failed to qualify academically and went to Chipola, where he played 
for former Auburn assistant Carl Nash. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though he was a junior college All-American, averaging  
24.8 points and 11.8 rebounds last season, Auburn was again the 
only school to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``People not knowing who I was made me the stronger and better  
person that I am now and a better player,'' Porter said. ``That's 
why I'm finally here at Auburn, doing what I've always dreamed of 
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Shock of Loss Sticks with Vikings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Devastated. Stunned. Unbelieving.  
</P>
<P>
	The Minnesota Vikings were all of that and more Monday as they  
tried to come to terms with a reality almost no one except the 
Atlanta Falcons expected: that the Vikings won't be going to the 
Super Bowl for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm walking like in I'm in the twilight zone,'' nose tackle  
Jerry Ball said. ``I can't believe we lost that game. Honestly. I 
am truly in the twilight zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ball spent much of Sunday night staring out the window of his  
downtown Minneapolis hotel room, wondering what went wrong in 
Sunday's 30-27 overtime loss to the Falcons in the NFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Gary Anderson barely slept after missing a 38-yard field goal --  
his first miss in more than a year -- that would have clinched the 
victory. Randall Cunningham was up until 4 a.m. after leading the 
highest-scoring offense in NFL history to just seven points after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it's just such an abrupt stoppage, you  
can't think clearly,'' said tight end Andrew Glover. ``It was hard 
to sleep, it's hard to really believe it was happening. It all 
seemed like a dream, a bad dream at that. But it's reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And a painfully familiar one in Minnesota.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings haven't been to the Super Bowl since the 1976  
season, losing conference title games following the 1977 and 1987 
seasons. Even when they got to the Super Bowl in their 1970s 
heyday, they lost all four times. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was supposed to be the year all that frustration got  
wiped away. 
</P>
<P>
	No defense was supposed to be able to stop Minnesota's explosive  
offense. Atlanta did after falling behind 20-7 late in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	No offense was supposed to be able to function properly in the  
din of a Metrodome filled with 64,060 wild fans, the largest crowd 
ever to see a playoff game in Minnesota. The Falcons did. 
</P>
<P>
	No team was supposed to keep the Vikings from a Jan. 31 date in  
Miami with the AFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to keep replaying plays that you could have made  
and situations. And it's gone,'' said safety Robert Griffith, who 
dropped a diving interception attempt on the play before Atlanta's 
tying touchdown with 49 seconds left in regulation. ``That's just 
the way we're built. There's nothing we can do about it now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just got to be grown-ups and, for lack of better words,  
just suck it up and learn from what happened and try to rebuild 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was perhaps the most frustrating feeling Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings felt they had assembled a team capable of winning  
the first Super Bowl in their 38-year history. Their 15-1 
regular-season record and NFL-record 556 points seemed to prove 
they were right. 
</P>
<P>
	They routed Arizona -- just business as usual -- in the divisional  
playoffs and then built a 20-7 lead on Atlanta with 2:45 left in 
the first half Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami seemed just a plane ride away.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get to the championship game and you really feel you're on  
your way to the Super Bowl and it ends the way it did, so abruptly, 
it's the most devastating emotional thing you have to deal with as 
a coach,'' said offensive coordinator Brian Billick, who flew to 
Baltimore on Monday afternoon to interview for a head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	The day perhaps was hardest for Anderson, the 17-year veteran  
who never has been to a Super Bowl despite four trips to the 
conference final (two with Pittsburgh and last season with San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had made a mind-boggling 46 consecutive field goals  
when he lined up for a 38-yarder late in the fourth quarter. He had 
made all 106 of his kicks this season, including extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	But he pushed this one barely wide of the left upright with 2:07  
left, keeping the Vikings' lead at 27-20 and allowing Atlanta a 
chance it grasped. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson barely could contain his emotions after the game, but  
he answered every question about the miss. He did the same Monday. 
Tears welled in his eyes as he recalled meeting his 9-year-old son, 
Austin, after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I saw him he came over and gave me a big hug and  
reminded me of one of the lessons that I try to teach him all the 
time,'' Anderson said. ``He said, `Well, Dad. You tell me all the 
time you can't make 'em all.' It was a hard way to learn that 
lesson myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly hit home.''

	NATO Generals To Warn Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two top NATO officials plan to warn Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic that NATO is prepared to act 
militarily unless he abides by commitments to Kosovo Albanians that 
he agreed to three months ago, a senior official said today. 
Meanwhile, Serb forces pounded villages in Kosovo with artillery. 
The government also barred the U.N. war crimes prosecutor from 
entering the province and ordered the chief U.S. peace verifier to 
leave. The defiant moves came after last week's massacre of 45 
ethnic Albanian civilians

	Clinton Defense Hones Strategy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers today honed the defense  
presentation for President Clinton's impeachment trial that they 
will begin tomorrow. It will focus on conflicts in testimony, a 
strategy that aims at undercutting House charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice but that also could open the way to 
Republican demands for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The 
White House has been fighting that demand, but now expects 
witnesses, officials said.

	Clinton Honors King, Volunteers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After knocking down a wall with AmeriCorps  
volunteers, President Clinton used today's holiday honoring Martin 
Luther King Jr. to announce a $6.5 billion fair housing settlement 
reached by enforcing a law passed days after King's death. The 
president cited King's philosophy as he joined Vice President Al 
Gore and the team volunteers in tearing down a wall to make way for 
a health clinic at a retirement home. Clinton announced that the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development and Columbia National 
Mortgage Co. had settled a housing discrimination case worth $6.5 
billion in loans and homeownership programs.

across the country celebrated Martin Luther King Day with speeches, 
sermons and volunteerism. Last Friday would have been King's 70th

The decision endorsed the document by Protestant politician David

the damage. Eight people were killed statewide by twisters and at 
least 100 were hurt. The fast-moving storm system that swept across 
western and central Tennessee packed high winds, hail and heavy 
rain. Tornadoes were seen or touched down in 12 counties and damage

touched off a global rally in stock markets today as the country's 
central bank announced it would continue to float Brazil's 
currency. However, other world markets were still volatile. Brazil 
had caused a panic in world financial markets Wednesday when it 
devalued its currency by 8 percent, sparking fears that the country 
could succumb to an Asian-style currency crisis. U.S. financial 
markets were closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day

	Super Bowl May Be Bust for Miami

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Super Bowl may prove to be a super bust for  
South Florida, a new study suggests, contradicting the notion that 
the NFL's premier event generates hundreds of millions of dollars 
for the host city. A look at six Super Bowls dating to 1979 found 
no increase in sales revenue over previous years without the big 
game, said Philip Porter, author of the study. The NFL contends the 
economic benefits will be huge -- as much as $365 million -- when the 
Super Bowl makes its eighth trip to South Florida next week.

<HEADLINE> Schools To Get Civil Rights Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A handbook that seeks to educate students and  
teachers on civil rights and how they can be protected by school 
policies will be distributed this month to schools across the 
country, officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In honor of Martin Luther King Day, the U.S. Department of  
Education announced the creation of the new 60-plus page book 
called ``Protecting Students from Harassment and Hate Crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book was the brainchild of the Massachusetts Attorney  
General's Office of Civil Rights, which came up with the idea after 
visiting dozens of schools across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some schools only had policies because there had already been  
a lawsuit or a crisis,'' said Richard Cole, chief of civil rights 
office for the Massachusetts Attorney General. ``We want schools to 
look at this handbook, look at the examples and set up policies 
before problems arise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book defines potential violations such as name-calling,  
graffiti, harassment, unwanted touching and physical threats, and 
offers ways to address the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, if two students get into a racially motivated  
brawl, the first thing that should be done is report the incident 
to school administrators, the handbook suggests. From there, the 
book suggests sitting students down with a team of mediators to get 
to the root of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most students have never been taught it's possible for things  
to be talked out first without fighting,'' Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
	And many also know little about the civil rights movement, which  
the book also discusses. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasina Disola, 17, said she hoped her school would pass out  
the guidebook so students can learn about their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We basically know about all the racial stuff but a lot of kids  
at school don't know what harassment is or what types of touching 
is cool, or when enough is enough,'' said Disola, a senior at John 
D. O'Bryant High School in Boston. ``I think this guidebook will 
help a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Committed to Economy Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan today  
sought to reassure nervous investors, the International Monetary 
Fund and the Clinton administration that his country remains 
committed to economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said he spent the weekend explaining to the IMF and the  
administration how the government of President Fernando Hernique 
Cardoso will implement the decision to stop defending the nation's 
currency and continue meeting its economic commitments to the IMF, 
including a key pledge to reduce a soaring government budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will undertake all efforts we have submitted to the fund,''  
he told reporters at IMF headquarters. ``We know additional 
measures may be required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said in a statement that  
he was ``personally very satisfied with the conversations that IMF 
staff and management have had'' with the Brazilian team. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said he welcomed pledges Malan had made about  
attacking the budget deficit and controlling inflation and said he 
would be sending an IMF team to Brasilia promptly to see what 
adjustments should be made in the IMF targets in light of the 
currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardoso government pledged to boost taxes and slash spending  
to trim the deficit as part of an agreement in which the IMF 
assembled a $41.5 billion rescue package intended to keep Brazil 
from being pulled into the economic maelstrom that has already hit 
a number of Asian nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	However, investors began a renewed rush for the exits last week  
amid mounting signs that Cardoso was having trouble meeting his 
budget goals. 
</P>
<P>
	After a temporary decision last week to stop wasting dwindling  
reserves to defend the currency, the real, the government announced 
today that this decision would be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil had held out hope that the IMF would decide to  
accelerate its loans to the country, no such announcement was made 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan told reporters he would be in intensive discussions with  
IMF officials in order to renegotiate whatever targets must be 
changed in light of the devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why we will not be able to quickly  
re-establish the parameters of the program,'' Malan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan spent several hours discussing Brazil's situation Sunday  
with Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the 
administration's point man on the global currency crisis. Malan was 
to meet today with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at both the IMF and the administration expressed  
unhappiness last week that Brazil had decided suddenly to devalue 
its currency without having a new, stronger economic reform program 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan said he had reassured officials during his talks of  
Brazil's commitments to achieving the necessary economic reforms. 
Asked specifically about last week's criticism, he said, ``I can 
assure you that what happened last week is water under the bridge. 
... We are looking ahead instead of looking back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to meeting with Greenspan, Malan said he intended to  
travel to New York either Tuesday or Wednesday to explain Brazil's 
devaluation to investors on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> A Glossary of Currency Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From the debut of the euro to the devaluation of  
the Brazilian real, foreign currencies are at center stage of 
business developments. Here is an explanation of some foreign 
exchange terms: 

</P>
<P>
	Exchange rate -- The price of one currency in terms of another.  
Monday, one French franc was worth 17.69 cents. Expressed another 
way, one dollar was worth 5.6529 French francs. 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange rates fluctuate as currency traders and investors  
change their perceptions of world events and the stability of each 
nation's economy and government. Most countries try to maintain 
somewhat stable rates because this makes investors feel more 
secure. One way to ensure that stability is to link the currency to 
a specific amount of a commodity, like silver or gold, and keep a 
reserve of that commodity equal to the total value of the currency 
in circulation. Some nations link their currency to the dollar 
because it is perceived as stable. 
</P>
<P>
	A linked system is considered ``fixed,'' while a system that  
relies on market forces is considered ``floating.'' Many strong 
economies, including the United States, float their currency. Many 
weaker economies fix their currency, hoping to lock in some 
security. 

</P>
<P>
	Peg -- A tie to a currency or a fixed exchange rate, usually  
established by government intervention. For more than a decade, 
Hong Kong has pegged its currency at the rate of 7.8 Hong Kong 
dollars to one U.S. dollar. 

</P>
<P>
	Band -- A range within which a currency can trade. Some  
governments fix an exchange rate but allow their currency to trade 
perhaps 5 percent above or below that rate before intervening by 
buying or selling currency. 

</P>
<P>
	Devaluation -- A decline in the value of a currency as a direct  
result of government policy. A currency that falls due to market 
forces has depreciated; a currency that falls because the 
government has removed controls on it has been devalued. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past few years, Thailand's baht, Vietnam's dong and  
Russia's ruble have all been devalued. Last week, Brazil joined the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil had been defending the real's value by keeping interest  
rates high and by buying the real on currency markets. But that 
became too costly, and Brazil eventually bet that by letting its 
currency devalue, it will be able to bring interest rates lower and 
will spend less money propping up the real. That may stimulate 
business and help Brazil out of a recession.

<P>
	One means of devaluing a currency is to expand its trading band.  

</P>
<P>
	Float -- Removing currency controls like pegs or bands and  
allowing market forces to determine a currency's value. Market 
forces could include inflation, stock market rallies or tumbles, 
political changes, trade conflicts. 

</P>
<P>
	Central bank -- In most nations, the central bank is a government  
body that issues currency and sets interest rates in an effort to 
control the level of economic activity. In the United States, the 
Federal Reserve System fulfills this role. 

</P>
<P>
	Currency board -- An alternative to a central bank, often  
established in response to economic turmoil. A currency board, 
which generally includes some foreigners, replaces the central bank 
and sets a fixed exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina instituted a currency board in April 1991, creating a  
new peso worth $1 and requiring the government to hold enough 
dollars in reserves so that every peso could be exchanged for a 
dollar. The move drastically cut inflation and also restored 
Argentina's ability to borrow money at reasonable interest rates. 
Some economists have begun suggesting that Brazil follow a similar 
model. 
</P>
<P>
	However, currency boards effectively strip a nation of the power  
to control its own economy. Economic factors such as wages, 
interest rates, the balance of payments, even rents, adjust to the 
fixed exchange rate.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons To Take Shot at Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Denver opened as an 8 1/2-point Super Bowl favorite against  
Atlanta, which means the Falcons probably have the Broncos right 
where they want them. Remember, they opened as 10-point underdogs 
against Minnesota in the NFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody paid much attention to Atlanta all season, probably from  
force of habit. That's because the Falcons live in the NFC West, 
dominated for years by San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta was a perpetual also-ran, with just seven playoff games  
and two postseason victories in franchise history. And everybody 
knows a domed stadium team has never reached the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves pieced together a talented team built around  
the running of Jamal Anderson, who ran for 1,846 yards, and 
journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who has played for six teams 
in 11 seasons. After losing seven of their first eight games under 
Reeves, the Falcons finished last season on a 7-2 roll. This 
season, they picked up where they left off. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Falcons' key parts are castoffs. Chandler's  
receivers are Tony Martin, who came over from San Diego, and 
Terence Mathis, an ex-New York Jet. The defense is anchored by 
linebacker Cornelius Bennett and safety Eugene Robinson, both with 
Super Bowl experience elsewhere. Bennett played for Buffalo, 
Robinson for Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons sneak up on people. That's how they beat the 49ers  
in the playoff opener, and that's how they beat Minnesota in the 
NFC Championship game. They play opportunistic football, leading 
the NFL with 44 takeaways, 25 fumble recoveries and a plus-20 
turnover differential. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson led the NFC in rushing and all-purpose yards (2,165).  
He had 12 games with 100 yards or more, and another in the playoff 
opener against the 49ers. That helped Atlanta lead the NFL in time 
of possession (33:10). And that will be the Falcons' strategy 
against Denver -- keep John Elway off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos bring a formidable attack to the Super Bowl. MVP  
Terrell Davis led the league with 2,008 rushing yards, the fourth 
2,000-yard rushing season in NFL history. Denver likes to spread 
its offense to open running lanes for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Falcons, however, he will face a defense that has  
permitted just one 100-yard rusher in the past 26 games and has an 
NFL-best record of 22-4 over that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Falcons, the Broncos are resilient. Shut out by the New  
York Jets through the first half, they found a way to take over the 
game and won comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they both bring heavy duty running backs to the Super  
Bowl in Anderson and Davis, and capable receivers and defenses, the 
quarterback matchup is vastly uneven. Elway is on his way to the 
Hall of Fame. Chandler is the favorite quarterback of travel agents 
with previous stops with Indianapolis, Tampa Bay, Phoenix, the Los 
Angeles Rams and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The head coaches have an intriguing history.  
</P>
<P>
	When Reeves was at Denver -- his teams lost three Super Bowls in  
four years from 1987-1990 -- current Broncos coach Mike Shanahan was 
his offensive coordinator. They were best friends until 1992, when 
Reeves fired Shanahan, believing he was exercising too much 
influence with Elway. The quarterback also was in the middle, 
complaining bitterly about Reeves' style when the Broncos fired the 
coach the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're all back together again in the NFL's ultimate  
showcase, Denver trying to defend its championship and Atlanta 
trying to convince people that it is as good as a 16-2 season 
suggests.

<HEADLINE> Cops Arrest Triple Slaying Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Detectives arrested two teen-agers late  
Monday in the fatal shooting of three Pizza Hut employees in what 
police say was a robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Huerstel, 17, and Kajornsak Prasertphong, 19, were  
arrested without incident by police acting on a tip, Sgt. Brett 
Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Restaurant manager Robert Curry, 44; James Bloxham, a kitchen  
worker who would have turned 18 on Tuesday; and waitress Melissa 
Moniz, 20, were shot to death Sunday night, apparently as they were 
about to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Huerstel and Prasertphong were booked into Pima County Jail on  
suspicion of first-degree murder and armed robbery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moniz's fiance found the victims lying on the floor of the  
restaurant when he looked through a window, then called police from 
a nearby convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also were looking into the holdup of a grocery store  
about four miles away shortly before the bodies were found at the 
Pizza Hut. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men with pistols forced everyone to lie on the floor, then  
fled with an undisclosed amount of cash from a safe.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Accounts Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposals to replace Social Security's  
guaranteed benefits with new private retirement accounts are 
unacceptable, a group of congressional Democrats warned President 
Clinton in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers left an opening for an alternative: using the  
budget surplus to subsidize new 401(k)-style accounts that 
consumers could manage themselves as an addition to, but not a 
replacement for, Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That is something being considered by administration officials  
advising Clinton on what to say in his State of the Union address 
Tuesday. Clinton wants to use the address to jump-start action in 
Congress to reform the nation's retirement program, but aides 
wouldn't say Monday just how explicit he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Many congressional Democrats say they would prefer that Clinton  
avoid any explicit policy endorsements in his speech Tuesday, and 
pursue bipartisan talks instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a recent letter to Clinton, 44 House Democrats and  
independent Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont took one stand: ``We 
are firmly united on one principle -- any Social Security 
privatization plan must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was silent, however, on the possibility of  
supplemental accounts using government surpluses, rather than 
Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I would certainly consider,'' said Sanders,  
who composed the missive to Clinton along with Reps. Jerrold 
Nadler, D-N.Y., and Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts wouldn't directly address the cash  
shortfall expected to face Social Security as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. But they could help Americans better prepare 
for retirement and soften the blow of any changes in Social 
Security that might be necessary, such as raising the eligibility 
age for benefits or limiting retirees' yearly cost-of-living 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials consider it one option that Clinton could broach  
without upsetting lawmakers of either political party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have long advocated diverting some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks into individual 
accounts Americans could invest in the stock market. Private 
investments would give most people a better return than Social 
Security does, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats, however, strongly oppose moving money out of  
Social Security into such accounts, warning of increasing financial 
risks to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement benefits should be guaranteed, not subjected to the  
whims of the stock market,'' the House Democrats said in their 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri has said he  
could support supplemental accounts, however, as long as taxes 
earmarked for Social Security's guaranteed benefits aren't touched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, meanwhile, have already introduced  
legislation to use surpluses to start new retirement accounts, 
holding open the possibility that some Social Security taxes could 
be transferred into them later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that this idea can be the basis for a bipartisan  
consensus solution to building a secure retirement for all 
Americans,'' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, 
R-Del., in a separate letter to colleagues last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's proposal would use budget surpluses to guarantee every  
worker a minimum of $250 a year for his account, with additional 
government payments to parallel what each person contributes in 
taxes to Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Alternatively, some Democrats suggest Americans with the lowest  
incomes could get the largest government subsidies for their 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	In either case, the accounts would be similar to the 401(k)  
retirement savings plans many companies offer. Workers would 
probably be able to add their own money and choose from several 
government-supervised investment plans, such as stock and bond 
mutual funds.

<HEADLINE>  Part of Expos Stadium Collapses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- A part of the Olympic Stadium's problem-plagued  
roof caved in Monday as some 200 workers were setting up for an 
auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	An avalanche of snow tumbled down and five people were injured.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had been at my booth, I would be dead.'' said 28-year-old  
Todd Joel, who was working inside at the stadium at the time. ``It 
was bloody scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel, who is from Toronto and works for a company that sets up  
display booths for Subaru, said the ``the roof has been raining on 
us'' for days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest chapter in the difficult history of the  
stadium, built for the 1976 Summer Olympics and home to the 
Montreal Expos baseball team. The Expos insist they must have a new 
baseball-only stadium to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people were inside the stadium when one of the 63  
panels on the latest edition of the roof -- made of fiberglass with 
Teflon coating -- gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were preparing the stadium for an auto show when the  
mid-afternoon collapse occurred, sparked apparently by recent heavy 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Gilbert, a spokesman for the Montreal fire department,  
said two people were taken to a hospital and three others were 
treated on the scene for slight injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous incidents, chunks of outer wall of the stadium  
crashed to the ground but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The original roof was built to be retractable but didn't work.  
It had to replaced by synthetic material at a cost of about $37 
million Canadian ($24 million U.S. at current rates). 
</P>
<P>
	An American firm, Birdair, has been installing the new roof,  
which is largely complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers setting up for the auto show said they had been told  
repeatedly by the agency that runs the Olympic Stadium not to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the Regie des Installations Olympiques (RIO) told them  
there was a bit of a problem with leaks but everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, water was falling on the Subaru booth. Other booths,  
including the Jaguar and Land Rover displays, also were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can say we are embarrassed by this,'' said Andre  
Huberdeau, vice president of marketing for the RIO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to condemn them (Birdair) but we have to wait  
to have their explanation,'' RIO president Andre Tetrault. 
</P>
<P>
	The RIO recently asked Birdair whether it needed to clear the  
roof because of all the heavy snow and rain. Tetrault said the 
company answered no.

<HEADLINE> Canada Floats Anti-Tobaaco Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- The government Monday proposed new regulations  
that would more than double the size of health warnings on 
cigarette packs and require the inclusion of additional 
anti-smoking information. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, expected to take effect later this year, 60  
percent of the front and back of a cigarette pack would be devoted 
to warnings, compared to the current requirement of 25 percent on 
the front panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A list of the toxic ingredients in cigarette smoke would be  
printed on each pack, as would a toll-free number for advice on 
quitting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Health Minister Allan Rock said several new warnings would be  
among those used on the package, possibly including ``Smoking can 
cause a slow and painful death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His department also is considering a warning that smoking could  
impair male sexual performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers'  
Council, said the industry could do little to influence the content 
of health warnings but might object if the size of the warnings 
limited their ability to portray their trademark on cigarette 
packs. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker also said the new regulations were inspired more by  
politics than practicality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there's one chance in 1,000 they will change  
the smoking rate in Canada,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to changing warning-label rules, Rock said the  
government plans to tighten restrictions on cigarette displays in 
stores and to conduct more frequent studies into tobacco use and 
the chemical composition of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada already has a comprehensive ban on cigarette advertising.

<HEADLINE> PBS Kids Channel To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS plans to boost spending on  
children's television, with some money devoted to a 24-hour PBS 
Kids Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel scheduled to begin broadcasting in September will  
include such shows as ``Barney &AMP; Friends'' and ``Teletubbies,'' PBS 
President Ervin Duggan told the Television Critics Association on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 1999, about a third of the country will be able to  
receive the channel through PBS stations with digital capability, 
Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	How many viewers see it will depend on how many invest in costly  
digital TV sets. Duggan acknowledged that the initial audience will 
be small. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel is part of a children's initiative that will include  
new preschool programs, an expansion of the PBS Kids Web site and 
an increase in PBS's free book distribution program, Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS expects to spend substantially more on children's  
programming and services next year. The budget for 1999 is $27 
million; the proposed budget for 2000 is $40 million, PBS spokesman 
Tom Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over three years, the planned investment is about $125 million,  
said Kathy Quattrone, executive vice president of PBS Programming 
Services.

	About 200 people were inside the stadium when one of the 63  
panels on the latest edition of the roof -- made of fiberglass with 
Teflon coating -- gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were preparing the stadium for an auto show when the  
mid-afternoon collapse occurred, sparked apparently by recent heavy 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Gilbert, a spokesman for the Montreal fire department,  
said two people were taken to a hospital and three others were 
treated on the scene for slight injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous incidents, chunks of outer wall of the stadium  
crashed to the ground but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The original roof was built to be retractable but didn't work.  
It had to replaced by synthetic material at a cost of about $37 
million Canadian ($24 million U.S. at current rates). 
</P>
<P>
	An American firm, Birdair, has been installing the new roof,  
which is largely complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers setting up for the auto show said they had been told  
repeatedly by the agency that runs the Olympic Stadium not to 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the Regie des Installations Olympiques (RIO) told them  
there was a bit of a problem with leaks but everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, water was falling on the Subaru booth. Other booths,  
including the Jaguar and Land Rover displays, also were affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can say we are embarrassed by this,'' said Andre  
Huberdeau, vice president of marketing for the RIO. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be easy to condemn them (Birdair) but we have to wait  
to have their explanation,'' RIO president Andre Tetrault. 
</P>
<P>
	The RIO recently asked Birdair whether it needed to clear the  
roof because of all the heavy snow and rain. Tetrault said the 
company answered no.
