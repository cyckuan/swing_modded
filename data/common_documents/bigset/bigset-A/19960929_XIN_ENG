<HEADLINE> China Wins Three Opening Matches at World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Hot-favored Chinese players
won three out of the four matches set for them on the opening day
of the three-day FILA World Cup Women's Table Tennis Tournament
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World champion and Olympic gold medalist Deng Yaping
spearheaded the Chinese victories as she scored consecutive and
easy wins over Nigeria's Bose Kaffo and Hong Kong's Chan Tan Lui.
</P>
<P>
Deng's winning scores were 21-7, 21-12 and 21-4, 21-9 apiece.
</P>
<P>
Deng is tipped to win her last preliminary match Sunday
afternoon, against Germany's Schopp Jie, a former Chinese national
team member. That would bring Deng into Sunday night's
quarter-finals, with an all-triumphant record to her credit.
</P>
<P>
China's up-and-coming Wang Chen, 21, scored an easy 21-13, 21-8
 victory over Cuba's Latin American champion Yolanda Rodriguez
today. But her confrontation Sunday with South Korea's 17th-ranked
Park Hae Jung and Singapore's Jing Jun Hong, a 15th-ranked former
 Chinese national, are expected to be tougher than Saturday's
match.
</P>
<P>
China's 18-year-old Yang Ying, who impressed the table tennis
world with her victory in this year's All-England Open, was
unexpected down by Sweden's Marie Svensson, ranked 47th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Losing the first set and used to Yang's play, Svensson blocked
the Chinese attacks with her own forehand and backhand loop
drives to take two sets in a row to win the match.
</P>
<P>
"Yang is not in good shape these days," admitted Zhang Xielin,
a former world champion players and current team manager here.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has pinned its hope on the eighth-ranked Chai Po
Wa. Chai won the first preliminary match over Australia's Shirley
Zhou, a former Chinese player, 21-17, 21-9. But the Hong Kong ace
was in trouble as she took on Ni Xia Lian from Luxembourg, who is
ranked 23rd in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ni, who lost her first match earlier Saturday night to Canada's
Geng Lijuan, also a former Chinese national team member, came back
strongly against Chai with swift forehand smashes. Ni won the
match 21-10, 21-17, to the disappointment of the home crowd over
the local heroine.
</P>
<P>
In other actions, Geng Lijuan won over NI Xia Lian 11-21,
22-20, 21-17 and over Shirley Zhou 21-9, 21-15, Park Hae Jung of
South Korea beat Jing Jun Hong of Singapore 17-21, 21-18, 21-17,
School Jie of Germany lost to Hong Kong's Chan Tan Lui 22-24,
19-21, but trounced Bose Kaffo of Nigeria 21-6, 21-2, Romania's
Otilia Badescu beat Germany's Nicole Struse 21-18, 21-9.
</P>
<P>
The remaining preliminary matches and quarter-finals are slated
for Sunday. The semi-finals and final are set for Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Assad: No Land-for-Peace No Syrian-Israel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad has blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
his backtracking from the former Labour government's position on
the issue of the Golan Heights and demanded the return of the
strategic plateau of the Syrian territory before reopening the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN's program "Evans and Rowland", aired
on Saturday, Assad said that during the Madrid talks in 1991 which
launched the peace process, a framework and requirements for
negotiations based on the principle of land-for-peace and on U.N.
resolutions 242 and 338 had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
"Within the framework of those commitments, agreement was
reached between Syria and Israel on Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan up to June 4, 1967 lines," he said. "After that, we moved to
complete discussion of the other elements of peace."
</P>
<P>
He said that following his election last May Netanyahu had
"canceled the peace process entirely" by rejecting territorial
compromise as the basic principle for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It is natural that the present Israeli government honors the
agreements reached by the previous Cabinet which was a legal
government and represented Israel in al respects," he told CNN.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Syrian president asked why should Syria want to
make peace if Israel refused to return the Golan Heights and to
give back the Palestinians their rights and land?
</P>
<P>
"If this is how he thinks, then why should Syria want peace?
That is why I say that if Netanyahu maintains his present
position, I do not think that there was an outlet to achieve just
and comprehensive peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
However, Assad said the collapse of peace talks would "not
necessarily" lead to war in the region, but he expected that the
regional stability would be greatly affected as a result of
Netanyahu's receding from the previous Israeli position and
"changes in this stability could lead to what we may call war or
wars".
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recent Syrian troops movements in Lebanon,
Assad said there were "security requirements" which "coincided
with Netanyahu's threats to launch attacks" in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the redeployments posed a threat to
Israeli's security and said he had told U.S. officials who
contacted him on the matter that Syria is not planning an
offensive.

<HEADLINE> France, Lebanon Make Appeal for De-escalation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and visiting Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri today launched a
joint appeal for de-escalation of violences in the Palestinian
territories, in which 76 people have been killed and hundreds
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said during a meeting with Hariri that both Israel and
Palestinians should "return to reason" and the leaders of the
two sides should meet to "immediately defuse the tension,"
according to French presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Chirac today again called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak discussing with them the efforts
made by Western countries to appease the situation and to arrange
a possible meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that there exists a lot of difficulties for
arranging such a meeting and there is no sign of success in the
efforts to arrange such a meeting so far.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened lately signals nothing good. Israel has
done nothing to appease the situation... and it should change its
attitude," said Hariri.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Israel of "pre-meditatedly attempting to
harm" the Middle East peace process through the present crisis,
while criticizing the United States for having refused to condemn
Israel during a meeting of U.N. Security Council which was held
Friday on the situation in Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The security council meeting ended Friday evening without
making any statement on an Arab resolution project which calls for
the condemnation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hariri will fly to New York Sunday to attend the U.N. General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Tougher Measures on Deadbeat Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Saturday announced that he has signed an executive order
to take necessary and legal steps to deny government sponsored
loans to so-called deadbeat parents who evade child support.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement in his weekly radio address,
which was taped on his campaign trail in Texas Friday.
</P>
<P>
The order also calls for the creation of a streamlined computer
system that can find which persons who receive federal payments
still owe child support.
</P>
<P>
Under the directive, the government will deduct child support
debts from fees paid to government consultants and vendors, and
the benefits paid to retired federal employees.
</P>
<P>
The order would deny small business, farm and home loans to
parents who default on child support.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the Treasury Department estimates that some 800
million dollars in payments go to these deadbeat parents. "These
funds can be paid to the mother and the children," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said no one should be able to escape the responsibility that
results from bringing a child into the world.
</P>
<P>
Under a database system, he said 60,000 delinquent fathers have
been identified and over half of them owed money to mothers on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that last month he signed tough legislation
ordering deadbeat parents to "pay up, or we'll track you down,
garnish your wages and make you pay what you owe."
</P>
<P>
At his direction, he said, the Internal Revenue Service will
collect 1 billion dollars in child support by withholding part of
the tax refunds.
</P>
<P>
He said in four years, child support collections have risen
from 8 billion to 11.8 billion dollars -- a nearly 50 percent
increase in child support collections. And nearly 800,000
paternities have been identified.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is confident more progress can be made in
requiring parents to pay up. But, he said, "ultimately, we can
only meet this challenge if we recognize governments don't raise
children, parents do."

<HEADLINE> 100,000 People Waiting for Telephones in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 100,000 Zimbabweans are
waiting for telepones despite the efforts by the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) to provide additional lines.
</P>
<P>
Post-Master General Raymond Mutambirwa is quoted in the latest
issue of the business magazine Negabuck as saying the high number
of people on the corporation's waiting list showed a gross
mismatch between supply and demand, hence the need to accelerate
projects aimed at alleviating the shortage.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the delay to implement projects on bureaucracy in
the government, saying the high level of direct influence and
state control over decisions on such issues as investment and
funding had been major obstacles to the rate of development.
</P>
<P>
He said the PTC had, however, managed to expand the telephone
network from 126,000 lines in June 1990 to 173,000 lines in June
this year, representing an increase in tele-density from 1.2 to
1.5 mainlines per 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
''Efforts to ease network congestion have been and are still
underway. This has seen an improvement of the average national
call completion rate, from 30 percent as at june 1995 to 40
percent as at june 1996,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Number of Children Out of School Rises in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Number of children of
school going age out of school in developing nations has risen
during the past six years, while the working conditions of
teachers have worsened, a professor said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day international conference on strategies
for development in Harare, Professor Obert Maravanyika said there
are now about 110 million children of school going age not
attending classes, mainly due to economic hardships facing their
parents.
</P>
<P>
He said the working conditions for teachers had also continued
to decline and the gender disparities in net enrolments between
boys and girls had grown worse.
</P>
<P>
''In many other aspects of the framework for action there has
been little or no progress over the last six years. For example,
110 million school age children are out of school as opposed to
about 100 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
''In the areas of achievement significant numbers drop out of
primary schools. In the area of adult illiteracy, the situation
is slightlyts worse with four million more illiterate people than in
1990 and the backdrop of child labor has risen to about 83
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said economic structural adjustment programs, intended to
improve the performance of some of the economies, have instead
worsened the suffering of most people through retrenchments of
workers, causing more pupils to leave schools due to lack of
fees.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being attended by educationists and
academics from Botswana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria, South
Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Greek Birth Rate Hits All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek birth rates last year
reached the lowest level in 47 years, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the national statistic service
of Greece, pregnancies reached an all-time low during the last
decade. In 1984, there were 125,724 births, whereas by 1994 the
figure had dropped to 103,763. only 101,495 babies were delivered
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Doctors expect the phenomenon to continue, since the number of
pregnancies is decreasing every year, as more and more couples
wait longer before starting a family. When they do decide to have
children, couples tend to have only one or two. This phenomenon is
taking on alarming dimensions: The number of births each year is
only marginally higher than the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
The reasons why women are reluctant to become mother are
complex. Panagiotis Konstandakos, an associate professor of
gynecology said the various factors that contributed to such low
birth rates were interrelated. "In recent decades, women have
become increasingly independent. They are active professionals.
Nowadays, women can choose their own partners, when to marry and
when to have children", Konstandakos said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the socio-economic factors that discourage
motherhood, Konstandakos held that among the lower classes, the
problem was chiefly financial while in high society, women were
hesitant to have children because they were worried about losing
their figure and having to change their lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
In addition, stress can prevent conception, the gynaecologist
added.

<HEADLINE> Rominger Wins time-trial in Tour of Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Tony Rominger of Switzerland
won the 21st stage of the Tour of Spain, a 44 km time-trial on
Saturday in Segovia, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
His countryman Alex Zuelle retained the overall leader's
yellow jersey and looks set to celebrate his first Tour of Spain
win by heading an all-Swiss trio on to the winner's podium on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rominger's win moved him ahead of Italy's Roberto Pistore into
third place in the overall standings, two minutes behind fellow
Swiss Laurent Dufaux, who retained second place behind Zuelle.
</P>
<P>
Rominger won the stage from Zuelle by 13 seconds, with Dufaux
finishing fifth, over two minutes back in provisional timings.
</P>
<P>
It was Rominger's second time-trial win of the Vuelta and a
splendid achievement for a man who seemed to have dropped out of
contention after a poor third stage.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Jalabert came in third, one minute 47 seconds behind
Rominger in provisional timings.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's final stage over 165 kms, starting and ending in
Madrid, is over mainly flat terrain and expected to finish in a
sprint.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
prepared for attending an envisaged meeting between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
French foreign ministry officials said that France "is working
on the hypothesis" of helping arrange such a meeting and French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will be present for such a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local media quoted diplomatic sources in New York as
saying that the United States could also join such a meeting, and
that intensive contacts are being made today in New York among all
parties concerned to fix a date.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department refused to confirm the news report
today.
</P>
<P>
At least 76 people -- most of them Palestinians -- have been
killed since Wednesday in the Palestinian territories of West Bank
and Jerusalem in violent clashes between Israeli troops and
Palestinian demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The violences were triggered by an Israeli decision to open a
tunnel near the Esplanade of Mosque Al Aqsa in east Jerusalem
early this week, which was condemned by Palestinians as an
desecrating insult to Islam.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, the Palestinian authorities have insisted that such a
meeting must take place in Cairo and in the presence of President
Hosni Mubarak. They also have indicated the possible participation
by France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt continued to make preparations for such a
meeting which Cairo has primarily fixed for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> UK Cancer Victims Sue Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Forty British lung cancer
victims are to sue the cigarette manufacturers, Imperial Tobacco
and Gallahers, for millions of pounds, in the first collective
action by smokers in Britain, according to an announcement.
</P>
<P>
Imperial and Gallahers together account for 80 percent of the
UK market. The forty victims have been warned that the
manufacturers could pursue them for their legal costs if the case
is unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the tobacco companies failed to comply with a
duty to minimize risk to consumers by reducing tar levels in
cigarettes when the link between tar and cancer became clear in
the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Martin Day, the group's lawyer said "It is the victims' case
that the failure to reduce tar levels caused or materially
contributed to the onset of their caner."
</P>
<P>
In a moral move, the victims' lawyers have agreed to take the
case on a "no win, no fee" basis, with the risk that 4.5 million
U.S dollars worth of work will go unpaid if they lose.
</P>
<P>
But the London solicitors Leigh, Day and Co have agreed to take
it on under a conditional fee agreement, together with Daniel
Brennan QC, president of the Personal Injury Bar Association, and
Mark Mildred, a professor at Nottingham Law School and an unnamed
expert on group actions.
</P>
<P>
The case is the first group action to be run on such a basis
which are seen by many solicitors as too risky for big cases, and
are mainly used for one-off accident claims.
</P>
<P>
Martin Day, a senior partner of Leigh, Day and Co, said:"It was
clear that the only way for the tobacco victims to gain access to
justice in the British courts was for lawyers to take on the cases
through the no win, no fee scheme."
</P>
<P>
Directors of Imperial Tobacco Group, whose shares are due to
start trading on the London Stock Exchange next week, reacted
calmly to the announcement of the action by the cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
Gareth Davis, the chief executive, said:"Imperial has a strong
defense against these cases and we are confident that we will win
them."

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Criticizes Israeli Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Lower House of
Parliament criticized here today Israel's moves to open a tunnel
near the third Islamic holy sites in the world -- the Al Aqsa
Mosque compound in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the house said the moves, which
sparked unprecedented Palestinian protests since the Palestinians
and Israel signed their self-rule accord in 1994, implied
aggressive intentions and flagrant provocation of the feelings of
Arabs and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The house added that the Israeli measures are abound to
endanger the holy shrines in the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Israelis' shootings of the Palestinians during the recent
Palestinian protests, which resulted in the death of nearly 70
people including Palestinians and Israelis in the past four days,
are an outright disregard of international conventions, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that there will be no peace in the
region unless Arab Jerusalem is restored to the Arab fold.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti said
during his talks with a visiting delegation of British Defence
College that the Israeli government must respect all the
agreements it has signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Palestinian Embassy here Friday, Kabariti
said that the only way to end the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli
crisis was implementing all agreements signed between Israel and
the Palestinians as well as resuming and making progress in the
peace negotiations on other tracks.
</P>
<P>
He described the Israeli actions at the Al Aqsa Mosque as
"provocative to the Arabs and Moslems."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Jordanian King Hussein and the
government have not expressed their condemnation of the Israeli
decision to reopen the controversial tunnel, although the king
called on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization to set up an international observatory body to
study the issue of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and diplomatic sources here said that Jordan is not
willing to denounce the decision of the Israeli government at the
expense of its relations with Israel which it cherished most.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Four Irish Republican
Army (IRA) suspects have been charged with terrorist
offenses after police raids on September 23, Scotland Yard
said here today.
</P>
<P>
They are also charged with conspiring to cause an
explosion likely to endanger life and possession of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The four men were arrested last Monday. During the raids
about 10 tons of explosives were recovered, together with
weapons and bomb-making equipments, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Police said the four men would appear before a
magistrates court next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The haul of explosives and weapons ended speculation that
the IRA was preparing to call a new ceasefire in its
campaign against British rule of Northern Ireland.
</P>

The IRA has planted a number of bombs in the United
Kingdom since calling off a cease-fire seven months ago.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opens Another Pyramid to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Culture
Farouk Hosni today opened to public a pyramid built more than
4,500 years ago in a move that is expected to help boost the
country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
The pyramid, believed to be the burial site of King Sneferu, is
called Red Pyramid, colored by the iron in its stones.
</P>
<P>
The 99-meter-high pyramid is located in midst of a desert in
Dahshour, some 35 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
It had been scheduled to open to visitors in July this year,
but its opening was delayed until today largely because of the
restoration work.
</P>
<P>
Sneferu was the founder of Old Kingdom's 4th dynasty (2613-2494
B.C.) and father of King Cheops, for whom Egypt's largest pyramid
was built.
</P>
<P>
Cheops' pyramid, built a few decades later, is 140 meters
high. It is located at Giza, some 10 kilometers southwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that Red Pyramid is the oldest
straight-sided pyramid. Step pyramids were built in Egypt earlier.
</P>
<P>
There is another pyramid built for Sneferu in Dahshour. It is
called Bent Pyramid because its sides start out at a relatively
steep 54-degree angle, than change halfway up to a gentler 43
degrees. It is to be opened next year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 97 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said today that Ethiopia has no other choice than
strictly adhering to the basic market principles in its fight
against poverty and backwardness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official Ethiopian News Agency, Meles said
adjusting the price of petroleum and fixing the prices of
government owned houses are just and correct measures taken by
the government to promote the free market order in ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meles said, development can never imagined out of the context
of the principles the international market is guided by, adding
that Ethiopia could ensure its survival only when it succeded in
creating economic institutions capable of competing in the world
market because competitiveness is one of the few most important
dictates of current international order.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent increase of price of petroleum, Meles
said the annual government subsidy to fuel equals to the amount
of money needed to construct thousands of schools across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
The government must not subsidize the price of fuel, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Ethiopian farmers, he said they can export their products
to the world market.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopians' readiness to provide the international market very
soon with sorghum and maize shows the correctness of the
government policy, he added. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A parliament member of the
opposition Democratic Party of Kenya (DP) today criticized those
calling for an overhaul of the Kenyan constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party in honour of new Central Provincial
Commissioner Zakary Ogongo at Nyeri Town, the opposition MP said
the constitution should be in harmony with Kenyans' aspirations.
</P>
<P>
With the purpose to remove President Daniel arap Moi from power,
Kenyan opposition parties have been calling for the Kenyan
government to amend the constitution before next general
elections due for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The MP said that if each political party is allowed to draft a
constitution to suit its manifesto, that would bring disunity
among Kenyans. He also described those calling for the total
review as daydreamers.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned Kenyans against being caught in the 1992 pre
election euphoria and emotions while discussing the constitution
as that might destroy the country by bringing disunity.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli-Palestinian Tension Eases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Tension between Israel
and the Palestinians eased significantly today with only reports
of sporadic clashes as Palestinian police made greater efforts to
calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of any death on either side, only one
Israeli soldier and eight Palestinians were reportedly injuried
in stone-throwing incidents against Israeli checkpoints in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, Israel beefed up security forces in
anticipation of more violence after Friday's bloodshed on the
Temple Mount. Palestinians under the age of 40 were barred
entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque, while Israeli police increased
identity checks.
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of Jerusalem, several incidents of
stone-throwing were reported. One Israeli soldier was injuried
by stone in Bir Nabalah village as Palestinians held funerals
for a victim killed in Ramallah Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a rare sign of good will, several Palestinians rushed to
rescue four Israeli soldiers who were injuried as their jeep
overturned in a rocky road near the Mukaber village.
</P>
<P>
In The Gaza Strip, Palestinian police erected checkpoints to
prevent Palestinians from marching toward Israeli military
outposts. Fierce clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and
Israeli soldiers took place in Goush Katif, during which eight
Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Lawyers' Union held a march of lawyers to the
building of the Palestinian Legislative Council, with
demonstrators carrying a coffin symbolizing the death of the
peace process. They called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as "the killer."
</P>
<P>
Union head Abu Baker urged Arab states to halt normalization
with Israel and bring Israeli officials responsible for the
bloodshed to international trial.
</P>
<P>
Across the West Bank, the situation was also significantly
quieter as Palestinian authorities and police tried to cool the
tension after three days of violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Hebron where Israel imposed a curfew, Israeli
soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse thousands
of Palestinian protesters who threw stones after attending the
funeral of a teenager killed in Tulkarm a day ago.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, the scene of the first bloody clash, Palestinian
police held back hundreds of Palestinians who tried to march
toward Israeli border checkpoints. Israeli soldiers reportedly
raided a refugee camp and arrested several Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian youths threw stones at Israeli outposts in
Tulkarm after holding marches to mourn the death of Palestinian
protesters killed a day earlier. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas
to the stone-throwers who were later dispersed by Palestinian
police. Schools remained closed today because of the imposed
siege.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, Israeli tanks were stationed at the entrances to
the city. The Palestinian authority issued orders to the police
to bar demonstrators from approaching Israeli checkpoints. Only
isolated incidents of stone-throwing were reported near the
villages of Burqa and Beita.
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks were erected by Israeli soldiers at main entrances
to villages in Qalqilya area to bar the passage of
Palestinians. There were several incidents of stone-throwing by
Palestinian youths without major clashes.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat chaired a cabinet meeting in Gaza today to discuss
the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded that Israel bore the full responsibility
of "the massacre" that had killed 65 Palestinians and wounded
1100 others. The PA stated that diplomatic efforts should
continue in the Arab and international arenas to find ways to
defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the expected meeting between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the cabinet meeting said that
it preferred the presence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, regarded to be crucial to restore the calm and
save the endangered peace process, is being arranged by the
U.S. through intense mediation. Reports said it was expected to
take place soon either in Cairo, or possibly Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to
create a conducive working environment for the Zanzibar security
units to enable them to cope with reforms taking place in the
Isles.
</P>
<P>
The Principal Secretary in the Ministry of State, Regional
Administration and Isles Security Units, Bwanakheri Hassan, made
the remarks in the Town of Zanzibar today when talking to
commanders of defence and security forces in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Zanzibar, Hassan said
the units were important for Zanzibar's security and defence
especially during this era of multi-party democracy. He added
that efforts would be made to ensure a conducive working
environment for the forces.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was aware of problems facing the units
saying appropriate measures were being taken to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
However, the principal secretary requested commanders to
maintain patriotism and observe tolerance.
</P>
<P>
He told the commanders that the government was encouraged by
their loyalty to the state, perseverance and diligence.
</P>
<P>
"I promise you that the government will tackle your problems
soon," Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the report said, the commanders complained about the
poor working conditions which hindered smooth operations.
</P>
<P>
They said the anti-smuggling unit lacked boats to maintain
vigilance on Zanzibar waters.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar has three security units, namely the economic
construction army, the anti-smuggling unit and the reformatory
schools. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Tanzania
has commended the goverment for collecting a revenue of 81.8
billion Tanzanian Shillings (about 136.3 million U.S. Dollars) in
the first two months of the 1996/97 fiscal year, exceeding the
target by about 12 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly economic review issued today, the central bank
said that the amount collected represented 2.3 percent of the
country's Gross Domestic Product estimated at 3.62 trillion
Tanzanain Shillings.
</P>
<P>
It said that total expenditure in July and August, amounted to
80.8 billion Tanzanaian Shillings, a level reflecting adherence
to cash budget system which restricts spending to revenue
collected.
</P>
<P>
Such a performance, the bank noted, implies a surplus budget
of 996 million Tanzanian Shillings before taking into account 9.3
billion Tanzanian Shillings that were pumped in as external
grants in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's annual rate of inflation eased
slightly from 18.2 percent in July to 18 percent in August. Food
prices marginally moved down by 0.5 percent and there was
considerable decline in prices of recreation and entertainment
(2.2 percent), transportation (3.1 percent) and education (2.6
percent).
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, the bank said, the national consumers
price index registered higher increases in prices of clothing and
footwear in the two months.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the rate of inflation began in the first
quarter of 1996, a trend which can be attributed to tight
monetary and fiscal policies and the satisfactory food supply
situation, the bank said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The families of some of the
dead in the TWA Boeing 747 explosion on July 17 today expressed
their disappointment that the U.S. government has failed to find
the cause of the explosion more than two months after the disaster
took place.
</P>
<P>
About 100 relatives of 60 dead in the explosion said after
meeting a U.S. official delegation here today that they would
continue their fight for the unveiling of the true cause of the
explosion by setting an association to exert more pressures on the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Robert Francis, vice president of the U.S. National Transport
Safety Bureau, told the families that only one thing was clear:
The passenger plane was not shot down by a U.S. military missile.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say. They gave us nothing new. But I
will continue to look for the truth," said Jeff Bohlin from
Pennsylvania, whose 16-year-old daughter was killed in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
All 230 people on board were killed when the jumbo jet blew up
above Long Island in New York soon after taking off from the
Kennedy International Airport on a flight to Paris.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of 45 French nationals who died in the explosion
have urged French judicial departments to start their own
investigations to find the cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The families were only given a list of the properties of the
victims found, some medical reports and death certificates for
those whose bodies have not been found from the water off Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
Michael Beistroff, father of an American ice-hockey player who
died in the disaster, said that the relatives are sure that truth
will see the day light some day.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to host peace talks
between Sudan and Uganda next week, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening daily Kayhan said that a five-member
Iranian delegation arrived in Kampala to examine agenda of the
Sudan-Uganda negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the Iranian delegation will also examine
the claim by Uganda regarding Sudanese Air Forces' attack against
targets in its country last week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian delegation is also scheduled to visit Uganda's
border city of Moyo, which was reportedly attacked on September 22
because of the existing military installations there.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda signed an agreement early this month to
normalize relations between the countries following mediation by
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during his trip to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has reportedly taken effect and involved the
pullout of rebel forces from a 100-km-wide zone on either side of
the Sudanese-Ugandan border.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24, 1995
after accusing Khartoum of supporting rebels in northern Uganda.

TEHRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran today denied any talk
between Iranians and Israelis during an international meeting of
parliamentarians held in China's capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of the Iranian Inter-parliamentary group
dismissed an Israeli report that two Iranian parliament members
had visited Israeli parliament members during the 96th Conference

The Israeli radio said Wednesday night that the Israeli
parliament speaker had run across two Iranian parliament members
and held talks with them.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian secretariat noted that none of the Iranian
parliamentary delegation had any talks with the Israeli
delegation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chirac Raises Tone over NATO South Command with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has raised his tone with the United States over his request for
the Europeanization of the Naples-based NATO South Command, said a
report in the German weekly Der Spiegel to be published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent lately to U.S. President Bill Clinton, Chirac
said that France will not participate in the decision-makings of
the NATO integrated military structure in 1997 if the South
Command continues to be in the hand of Americans, said the report
without citing any source.
</P>
<P>
France, which plans to fully return to the NATO integrated
military structure at the NATO summit in 1997, has asked U.S. to
hand over the commanding seat of South Command to a European
country, only to have met opposition from the U.S..
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said at the meeting of
NATO defense ministers held on Thursday in Bergen, Norway, that it
is "essential" for the U.S. to hold the commanding post of the
southern wing of the trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Perry also criticized German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe for
suggesting that NATO offer a red carpet to welcome France back by
providing Paris with the commanding seat of its south command,
said Der Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
France withdrew from the NATO integrated military structure in
1966 to protest U.S. domination of the Western military alliance.

AMMAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
reiterated here today that Jordan will continue it special role
in protecting the holy shrines in Jerusalem before the
Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations are concluded.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the Royal Commission on Jerusalem Affairs,
the king warned that the dangerous vacuum will be created if
Jordan relinquish its role in protecting the holy shrines in
Jerusalem before the final status negotiations are held.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan's role in protecting the holy sites in
Jerusalem stems from its religious and historical obligations,
adding that this role does not mean that Jordan is competing
with any one.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed Jordan's commitment to support the Palestinians
in their pursuit to attain their rights on their national soil.
</P>
<P>
Also today, King Hussein said that peace cannot be imposed by
force but rather through mutual agreements between the two
parties, adding that peace based on mutual understanding is a
lasting one.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a cabinet meeting which is aimed at discussing the
situation in the Holy City of Jerusalem, the king said peace can
not be from one side alone.
</P>
<P>
He stressed Jordan will continue to coordinate with the
Palestinians on Jerusalem and all other issues.
</P>
<P>
The king called for the implementation of all agreements
Israel and the Palestinians have signed, especially the
redeployment in West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the peace process is in danger and should be
restored in a sincere and serious manner.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the talks should start from where they
have ended with the previous Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He noted peace and security are for all and peace has to be
comprehensive, lasting and just.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Stone "Sphinx" Sculpture Found in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
unearthed a 1,000-year-old stone sculpture featuring a creature
with a human face, dragon's body and eagle's wings.
</P>
<P>
Experts have recognized the creature, exhumed from a famous
temple in east China's Shandong Province, as a Buddhist music
bird, and noted that it looks similar to the image of Sphinx on
the base of an ancient Greek wine cup, which is now in a
collection at the British Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
The Sphinx has a woman's face, lion's body and eagle's wings.
</P>
<P>
Yet no evidence has been found to establish any relationship
between the sculptures of the music bird and the Greek Sphinx
which is 1,000 years older.
</P>
<P>
The music bird was a decoration at the base of a Buddhist
scripture stone, which stood in front of the site of the Banzhou
Hall. The hall, ruined during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), used
to be the most frequently visited hall in the Lingyan temple.
</P>
<P>
In the basement of a pagoda in the temple, which has just been
brought to light, are some 30 reliefs telling the story of
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the reliefs are among the best Buddhist
reliefs ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The temple, initiated in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420 A.D.)
and is famous for beautiful sceneries and some 40 painted Buddhist
sculptures enshrined in Qianfo (A Thousand Buddhas) Hall.
</P>
<P>
It has been listed under state protection.

<HEADLINE> Painting on Emperor's Concubine Expected to Hit Auction Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A painting of the family of a
Tang dynasty (618-907) emperor's favorite concubine, which has
been valued at six to eight million yuan, is to go under the
hammer at the 1996 China Guardian Autumn Auction in mid October.
</P>
<P>
If it goes for at least its valued price the painting will
become the most expensive modern Chinese painting to be sold at a
domestic auction.
</P>
<P>
"Ode of the Beauties", painted by Fu Baoshi, a famous Chinese
painter, was painted according to a poem of the same title written
by Du Fu, a celebrated poetic giant in the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The poem describes the wanton ostentation displayed by the Yang
family during their outing in Chang'an, present-day Xi'an in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province, which was then capital of Tang
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
A beautiful lady of the family, Yang Yuhuan, was the favorite
concubine of Emperor Xuanzong.
</P>
<P>
Xu Beihong, a great contemporary painter of China, wrote his
comment on Fu's painting, calling it "a symphony of sensual and
spiritual pleasure."
</P>
<P>
The painting has been cited as one of the most important
contemporary Chinese artworks.
</P>
<P>
The painting is one of 2,000 pieces of art to be auctioned at
the Guardian autumn session, which have been valued at a total of
80 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
They fall in eight categories: Chinese painting and calligraphic
works, important art of new China 1949-79, stamps and covers,
Chinese oil paintings and sculptures, rare books, jewellery and
jadeite, Chinese porcelainware, jade carving and works of art, and
snuff bottles.

<HEADLINE> Africa Launches Partnership for Capacity Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- African governments
pledged to beef up their economic reconstruction capacity and also
urged the World Bank and the international community to join them
in a new Partnership for capacity building in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The commitment and appeal were contained in a report presented
to World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn on Saturday by African
governors of the central banks who came to attend the joint annual
meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The African governors also committed themselves to creating the
conditions that will nurture the building and rational utilization
of capacity in their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
In the governors' report, entitled "Partnership for Capacity
Building in Africa: Strategy and Program of Action", capacity
building refers to the strengthening or improving of people,
institutions and practices that enable countries to achieve their
development goals.
</P>
<P>
The report said that most weakness in capacity stems from
governance issues. It stresses that African leaders must show
their clear commitment to capacity building and to related issues
such as good governance and political and social pluralism.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, each African country wishing to
participate in the initiative will establish a high-level national
capacity building secretariat whose function will be to develop a
vision, principles and set of priorities for capacity building, to
mobilize funds for capacity building activities, to maintain an
information base on capacity building as well as monitoring and
evaluating system.
</P>
<P>
A multi-country and multi-donor "Consultative Group on Capacity
Building in Africa" would be set up and the governors requested
that the President of the World Bank initially chair it.
</P>
<P>
They also insisted on the participation of private sponsors and
prominent Africans. Besides, a Capacity Building Trust Fund will
be established to provide grant resources for capacity building
activities in Africa.

of Russian gas to Ukraine. They made big progress in resolving all
the problems existing in bilateral relations," he said.

value added tax on imported Ukrainian products." "We have no
differences," he added.
</P>

"The governmental commissions have to complete their work so
that Chernomyrdin can pay an official visit to Kiev in October,"

On the question of Taiwan, Qian said that it is the common
aspiration of the people of all the nationalities across the
country, including Taiwan compatriots, to settle the Taiwan issue
and realize the reunification.
</P>
<P>
No force can prevent China's reunification process, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since June last year, he said, the struggle against activities
aimed to split the country and against "Taiwan independence" has
fully shown the determination and capabilities of the Chinese
people and the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government
to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It has also dealt a severe blow to the forces that attempt to
engage in "Taiwan Independence" within the Taiwan Island, and
exerted an important and far-reaching impact on promoting the
relations across the Taiwan Straits and the process of peaceful
reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to abide by Deng Xiaoping's basic principles
of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems' to solve
the Taiwan question, earnestly implement the eight-point proposal
set forth by President Jiang Zemin, creating still more favorable
conditions for the country's peaceful reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan Authorities are sincere to improve cross-straits
relations, and hold meetings and consultations, Qian said, they
should clarify on adherence to one-China principle and stop their
activities to create "two Chinas" internationally and take
concrete actions without delay to realize the direct exchange of
mail services, trade, air and shipping links.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We shall continue to promote direct contacts between
compatriots across the Taiwan Straits, earnestly protect Taiwan
compatriots' just and reasonable rights, and interests of
investment on Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Taiwan personalities from all walks of life to
exchange views and suggestions on the peaceful reunification with
us, and aspire for increased unity of the compariots across the
Taiwan Straits, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and overseas
Chinese and continue their efforts to realize the goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the overseas Chinese have long contributed for
promotion of social progress and economic prosperity in the
countries that they are residing and played important roles in
China's modernization, as well as cooperation between China and
their residing countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government has always cared for their
lives and existence, and will continue its efforts to protect
their just and reasonable rights and interests, and provide
various services to them.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that old and new generations of overseas
Chinese will often return to China for a look, and play a
positive role in expanding exchanges and cooperation between
China and other countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China is a peace-loving country and its
development will benefit the peace, stability and prosperity of
the world, instead of posing a treat to any countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese government and people are willing to
promote peace, stability and prosperity of the world and advance
the progress of the mankind, along with all other peace-loving
countries and peoples in the world, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Pak Official Delegation Talking with Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has sent an
official delegation to Afghanistan to meet with the Taliban
leadership to exchange views on the latest situation and to
strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Pakistani Foreign Minister Aseff Ahmed Ali
here today while talking to local correspondents.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation headed by a director general from the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently talking to the Taliban
leadership in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention when the delegation went to
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan has been closely watching the developments in
Afghanistan, specially after the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, had been doing business with every
government in Kabul, therefore, saw no reasons to depart from this
practice.
</P>
<P>
"In any case, the question of legitimacy in Afghanistan is not
for Pakistan to decide. It is for the Afghan leadership and Afghan
people to decide what sort of government they need to have and how
to run their own systems."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recognition of the newly-formed government in
Kabul, the foreign minister said, historically, Pakistan has
always recognized the Kabul regime as de-facto government of
Afghanistan and have extended friendship and cooperation to the
Government in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan was encouraged by the statement from the Taliban that
they had nothing against General Dostum and would like to have
good relations with him. This was a positive development for peace
and stability in Afghanistan," the Foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
General Rashid Dostum controls the northern part of
Afghanistan, while the Taliban religious student militia, which
emerged 22 months ago, rules two thirds of the country.
</P>
<P>
Aseff said during his last visit to Afghanistan held detailed
discussions with the Taliban leadership in the southern city of
Kandahar, which served as the headquarters of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban leadership were men of piety and had great love
for Islam. They remembered with gratitude the sacrifices made by
the people of Pakistan during the Afghan Jehad," referring to the
anti-Soviet war from 1979 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
Aseff expressed the hope that peace would now return to
Afghanistan and the Taliban would be able to provide honest and
clean administration as they had done elsewhere in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has long been accused of supporting the Taliban by
former President Burhanuddin Rabbani.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets up New Special Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
declared the Caspian Sea port city of Anzali as special economic
zone in a bid to attract foreign investment, the Persian daily
Salam reported today.
</P>
<P>
The special economic zone consists of two parts with different
functions, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
One part will be in the port facilities, which will deal with
loading and unloading as well as warehousing service, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The other part is a piece of land covering 140 hectares and 15
kilometers outside the city of Anzali. It is designated for
industrial and manufacturing purposes as well as processing
activities.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the latest decision was made by the High
Council of Free Zones and President Hashemi Rafsanjani himself.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, President Rafsanjani announced Anzali port as the
country's fifth free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The port city is expected to serve as a key link in Iran's
trade with Caspian Sea littoral states such as Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has declared four other free trade zones in the Qeshm
and Kish islands in the Persian Gulf, Chahbahar port city on the
Oman Sea and Sirjan in the mineral-rich province of
Kerman.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat Agree to Meet in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat have
accepted Washington's invitation to meet here on Tuesday to
salvage the Mideast peace process jeopardized by recent bloody
clashes between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, U.S. President Bill Clinton told reporters
today that he also expected King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to be present at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the United States has done a lot to help put
an end to the deadly violence in the Middle East. However, it was
not enough. It was the responsibility of his country to try to
protect the peace process and put it forward and it was the time
for them to do so.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other countries which denounced Israel's opening of a
tunnel near Islam's third holiest shrine in Jerusalem and called
for Israel to close it, Clinton made no mention of the cause of
the recent confrontation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
When asked about U.S. stance on Israel's opening of the tunnel,
the president refused to make any comment except saying that they
would make a serious choice and try to put the peace process back
on track.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 people have died and hundreds were wounded in the
clashes.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Killing Pak PM's Brother May Be Murdered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The policeman involved in
the murder case of Murtaza Bhutto, brother of Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, may have died of murder instead of suicide.
</P>
<P>
A press handout from the police in Pakistan's southern city of
Karachi issued on Saturday said Inspector Haq Nawaz Siyal
committed suicide in his bedroom in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
However, the Karachi Police issued another press release today
about the possible causes of death of Siyal, clarifying certain
points in relation to its Saturday's press release.
</P>
<P>
It said the spot evidence regarding the death of late Inspector
Siyal had initially suggested that the officer had committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
Yet the wife of the deceased seems to believe that two shadow
figures had run from the room when she heard the first shot.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover the medico-legal evidence tends to suggest that
though the single bullet fired was aimed at the right temporal
region of the deceased inspector but it may have been fired from a
distance of a couple of feet.
</P>
<P>
"Considering this, the police investigation is currently
directed at determining whether it was a case of suicide or
homicide."
</P>
<P>
The press release said the weapon used in the firing was lying
under the pillow of the deceased which no outside intruder would
have ordinarily known.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it said, the weapon was reportedly seen in the hand of
the deceased immediately after the shot was fired and the casing
of the bullet was recovered from the weapon of offence which also
gave the unmistakable smell of gun powder.
</P>
<P>
It said that all these factors tend to suggest it was a suicide
rather than a murder.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation is continuing to take all aspects into
account in order to reach a conclusion as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
Siyal, 55, was the principle accused in the murder case of
Murtaza Bhutto, who was killed near his Karachi residence in an
encounter between his bodyguards and the police on September 20.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the murder was a
well-planned conspiracy and vowed to unearth the culprits involved
in the case.

<HEADLINE> 500 Ancient Stone Sculptures Found in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A batch of more than 500
stone sculptures dating back 1,400 years have been found in
Nangong city in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to "China Archaeological News", most of the stone
sculptures, featuring Buddhist figures and figurines, are
seriously damaged. Some of them are without heads.
</P>
<P>
But the sculptures are still precious because they bear
inscriptions of dates, which will act as a standard for dating
similar relics, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that the site might be the place where the
Wanfo (ten thousand Buddhas) Temple of the Eastern Wei Dynasty
(534-550) had been located, experts say.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Party Raps Japanese Party's Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) today criticized Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for intending to indicate Tokto Island as Japanese territory
in its election program, warning that this move will lead Japan
into a further isolated position.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Tokyo said the LDP expressed that it would
describe the disputed Tokto Island -- called Takeshima in Japanese
-- as the Japanese territory in its election program in order to
win the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's move has exposed its intention to sabotage the East
Asian order and only pandered to the action of Japan's rightists,
said a NKP spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said that
Tokto was historically part of Korean territory, adding that Seoul
would take countermeasures in accordance with the Japanese party's
move.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea-Japan territorial dispute erupted on February 9
this year when Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that
Tokto was part of Japan's territory, triggering angry response
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement two days
earlier that it planned to build a wharf on the island, an 0.186
square-kilometer outcroping rock in the East Sea (Sea of Japan)
about midway between South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Goal of Universal Iodized Salt Basically Achieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved the goal
of universal iodized salt, according to a report released by the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The study, "Report on China's Child Development in the Mid
Decade of the 1990s", said that over 80 percent of salt in China
had been iodized by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
That means the goal of universal iodized of salt has been
basically achieved.
</P>
<P>
Residents in some areas of China suffer severely from iodine
deficiency disorders. According to statistics by the World Health
Organization about one billion people worldwide are living in
areas without enough iodine. Nearly half of them, or 425 million
people, are in China.
</P>
<P>
Iodine deficiency, which can seriously affect the growth of
infants, can also cause intellectual damage. Among China's 10
million-plus intellectually-disabled people, over 80 percent
suffered iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The National Program of Action for Child Development in China
in the 1990s, drawn up and implemented in 1992, set a goal to
eliminate iodine deficiency disorders by the year 2000. The
Chinese government spent 117.8 million yuan (about 14 million
U.S. dollars) on iodizing salt from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
A 980-million-yuan project for iodizing salt was also launched
with support from the World Bank during the period.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued several documents or regulations
to ensure the work of iodizing salt was achieved smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Among the regulations and documents were, "Program of
Elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder by the Year 2000",
"Program of Action for Eliminating Iodine Deficiency Disorder by
the Year 2000", and "Regulations on Iodized of Salt against Iodine
Deficiency Disorder."
</P>
<P>
In addition to popularizing iodized salt and oil, Chinese
researchers also developed various iodized foods to meet the need
for iodine.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians, Israelis Increase Joint Ventures to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade and joint
venture projects between Jordan and Israel are on the increase,
and Israel is making efforts to boost the trade agreement
implemented last April, an Israeli diplomat here said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Jordan Shalom Tourgeman
said that the main objective of the Israeli-Jordanian trade
agreement is to promote peace between the two countries, the
English-language daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The primary goal of the trade agreement is the political
side of it," he said, "It is rather seen as a tool to promote
peace than to guarantee profits to the Israeli business
community."
</P>
<P>
On recent complaints by Jordanian businessmen that progress on
bilateral trade between the two countries was too slow,
Tourgeman contributed it to two factors, saying the business
relations only started last April after the transport agreement
was implemented and the rectification of the trade agreement only
took place on June 26.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that joint ventures, especially in textile
industry, were the best way to promote mutual trade, noting that
more than 10 textile factories in the Jordanian capital Amman
are already working on joint venture basis with Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries can benefit from each other, adding
that Jordan can provide lower-cost labor while Israel supplies
the know-how.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli diplomat noted that both sides can get access to
each other's market through the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides can profit from this agreement as it will open
the kingdom's market to Europe and the U.S. and also the Israeli
market to the Arab world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, cloth is tailored in Israel, then brought to
Jordan for stitching and sewing, then sent back to Israel for
export to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Tourgeman also disclosed that Israel was interested in
Jordan's food and metal industry.
</P>
<P>
Amjad Fakhoury, assistant commercial attache of the Israeli
embassy, said that up to 30 Jordanian companies inquire daily
about potential business partners in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tourgeman indicated that good relations exist in the field of
agriculture, and that about 15,000 tonnes of cucumbers have been
exported to Israel since last April.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government last week announced that Israel will
import 50,000 tonnes of Jordanian agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
"For the time bing," he said, "ten trucks with goods, five
from each side, are crossing the borders every day."
</P>
<P>
Tourgeman said there were a lot of "underground activity"
between companies from the two countries which are unknown to
the Israeli embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the problem of getting a visa for business
purposes, which currently takes five days for a first
application and one day for any further one, he said that his
country encourages every Jordanian businessman to apply for a
multiple entry visa to ease the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, businessmen here fear such visa might jeopardize
trade relations with other Arab countries because it has to be
stamped on the passport.
</P>
<P>
Another point is the absence of customs office on the border
crossing, the Sheikh Hussein Bridge, which compels business
people from other parts of the kingdom to declare their goods in
Amman which is costly and time-consuming, Tourgeman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- AIDS virus has affected 330
Iranians and 130 of them have begun the active stage of the
disease, according to the National Anti-AIDS Council here today.
</P>
<P>
The council said in a report carried in the Persian-language
daily Salam that 80 percent of the cases were caused by blood
transfusion and its products. The rest cases were caused by
sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the council has imposed strict policy to
ensure the purity of blood and related products, thus the chance
of contracting AIDS is completely eliminated.
</P>
<P>
However, an Iranian female doctor challenged the government
statistics about the number of HIV positive carriers in the
country, saying that the figure could be as high as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shiravani said that because most doctors do not know the
symptoms of AIDS, it is highly possible that there are cases
that are seen by doctors but not detected and hence not
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the official report, the dreadful disease has
already claimed 100 lives in the Islamic Republic of
Iran.

BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An important picture
depicting a sea battle during the Sino-French War (1883-85), and

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil won the 1996 world
women's volleyball Grand Prix for the second time after ousting
Russia 3-2 here on Sunday, finishing their finals with their
winning records intacted.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, who beat China 3-1 in Sunday's other match to repeat
their feat in the Olympic final, snatched the second place with
two wins and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which collected one victory and two losses, was third
while winless China felled to the bottom in the four-team event.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set 13-15, Brazil was close to pulling
one back when they led 12-1 in the set.
</P>
<P>
But ace spiker Elena Godina scored four consecutive points to
lead a dramatic comeback for Russia, which took the set 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, winner of the event in 1994, rallied to level it 2-2 by
taking the third and fourth sets 15-6 and 15-2, dragging Russia
into the fast-firing tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
Leila Barros scored six of her 12 points to help Brazil win the
tie-breaker 16-14. Her teammate Fernanda Doval had 14 points in
the match, while Virna Dias added 12.
</P>
<P>
Godina led the Russians with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
"Today we played a tough match and tried everything to
win. With players injured and suspended, we had only very few
substitues. It was not easy." said Brazilian coach Bernardo
Rezende, whose team carried home the 250,000 U.S. dollars top
prize money.
</P>
<P>
Russia coach Nikolai Karpol said his young team lost due to the
lack of stamina and inability to perform well on the critical
moments.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese-Cuban Game, Idalmis Gato scored nine points and
Ana Fernandez added eight to inspire Cuba to the 15-5, 15-8, 6-15,
15-13 victory amid the deafening cheering of the 13,000 home
crowed at the Shanghai Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
China's captain Lai Yanwen had 12 points as the ace spikers Sun
Yue ad Li Yan scored only four and two points respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I was satisfied the overall performance throughout the Grand
Prix. After all, my players are exhausted after the Olympics,"
said Chinese coach Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez was named Best Spiker of the finals, while China's Li
Yan became the Best Blocker.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Tatiana Gracheva was the Best Receiver and the Best
Server prize went to Ana Sanglard of Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Calls for Attention to Education in Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Scholars around the world
have been urged to pay special attention to the important role of
education in poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization and the China-UNESCO National Committee,
more than 50 scholars from seven countries in the world, including
China, India, Germany and New Zealand, attended a symposium on the
links between education and economic growth of poor areas in
Lanzhou, the capital city of Northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Delegates held that the only way to shake off poverty is by
eliminating illiteracy, invigorating education, promoting
scientific progress and improving the quality of laborers.
</P>
<P>
They said that the degree of attention the countries pay to
education has been found to be directly proportional to the level
of their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Developed regions usually pay greater attention to education
while the less-developed regions attach little importance to it,
they said.
</P>
<P>
They called for efforts to increase investment in education
and reforms of education systems in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of education on ideology and
morality to regional economic development, saying that sound
legislation in relation to education helps put regional economies
onto a right, healthy track.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they fear, backward ideology, fake and forged
products, embezzlement and crimes may destroy economic development.
</P>
<P>
Currently, as scientific progress has a great impact on
economic growth, education is no longer an isolated issue, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The development of education exerts great influence on people's
income, attitude, living standards, quality of life and knowledge
of the environment for future generations, they said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the five billion people around the globe, more than one
billion are still living in poverty, and they do not have, or have
very limited, access to education, scholars said.

<P>
Therefore, the disparity between the rich and the poor is the
gap of education they receive, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the average per-capita investment in education
in developed countries rose up to 700 US dollars from 300 US
dollars, while in developing countries it is less than 2.2 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most feasible way to narrow the gap between regions and
countries is to develop education and reinvigorate science and
technology, they said.

<HEADLINE> Shenfu-Dongsheng Coal Mine to Become Largest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An 88.9 billion yuan project
has been announced to create China's biggest coal mine, with a
yearly output of 60 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Shenfu-Dongsheng Coal Mine is to be built into the country's
largest mine, with its annual raw coal production, now being 10
million tons, to go up to 25 million tons by 2000 and 60 million
tons by 2010, according to official plans.
</P>
<P>
The coal mine will focus on building infrastructure from this
year, especially railway facilities to raise its coal transport
capacity, which will be increased with coal production
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
A number of transport projects, including railways, bridges and
ports have been completed or are under way. As a result, by 2010,
the transport capacity will also amount to 60 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Shenfu-Dongsheng Coal Mine, which is located at the junction of
Shaanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, now has a
proven reserve of 223.6 billion tons, making up one third of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua Group Company, which was set up last October based on
the former Huaneng Fine Coal Company, has been made responsible
for the huge comprehensive project, composed of coal-mining,
power, roads, ports and navigation.
</P>
<P>
The company has been granted the rights of overseas financing,
foreign trade and coal exporting, and will be engaged in
trans-regional and trans-national businesses.
</P>
<P>
Over 11 billion yuan has been invested in the project since
1986. Eight pits have been set up including one that produces
three million tons of coal a year. Two pits are expected to be
completed by next year, one to turn out five million tons a year
and the other, three million tons.
</P>
<P>
Baotou-Shenmu Railway, specially designed for coal
transportation, has handled 30 million tons of coal since it was
put into operation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of a coalmine-based power plant has been
completed, while the second phase is under way.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Willing to Meet Netanyahu One-on-One If </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat said today he is ready to have a
one-on-one meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
if the controversial tunnel in Jerusalem is closed, reported
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The United States is busy brokering a summit between Netanyahu
and Arafat in a desperate attempt to help put an end to the
recent fierce clashes between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu would like to have a one-on-one meeting with Arafat
while the PA seeks a tripartite summit under the auspices of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's Hebrew-language newspaper
Yedioth Ahronoth, Arafat said that if Israel closes the tunnel
it will show a prudent judgement and calm Palestinian anger.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel lies beside the Islamic holy site of the Al Aqsa
Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem. Its opening Tuesday
gave rise to a wide-spread Palestinian protest, which escalated
to five days of bloody clashes, which killed 70 people and
wounded 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are signs indicating that Israel is
toughening its position regarding an international mediation
drive.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, Netanyahu's media adviser, said today that
Netanyahu would demand an end of violence before he agrees to
meet Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan told Israel Radio that Netanyahu wants to change the
Oslo agreement on troop withdrawal from Hebron because of the
recent clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
He also hinted that Israel might disarm the 30,000-strong
Palestinian police if violence is escalated.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Party Raps Japanese Party's Move Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) today criticized Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for intending to indicate Tokto Island as Japanese territory
in its election program, warning that this move will lead Japan
into a further isolated position.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Tokyo said the LDP expressed that it would
describe the disputed Tokto Island -- called Takeshima in Japanese
-- as the Japanese territory in its election program in order to
win the forthcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's move has exposed its intention to sabotage the East
Asian order and only pandered to the action of Japan's rightists,
said a NKP spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a South Korean Foreign Ministry official said that
Tokto was historically part of Korean territory, adding that Seoul
would take countermeasures in accordance with the Japanese party's
move.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea-Japan territorial dispute erupted on February 9
this year when Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda said that
Tokto was part of Japan's territory, triggering angry response
from South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda's remarks followed South Korea's announcement two days
earlier that it planned to build a wharf on the island, an 0.186
square-kilometer outcroping rock in the East Sea (Sea of Japan)
about midway between South Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Gives New Light on Palme Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Two former secret agents of the
South African apartheid regime have given new light on the murder 10
years ago of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, according to a
report by Agence France Presse (AFP) today.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with AFP Saturday evening in
Johannesburg, Dirk Coetzee, former chief of the ``death squadron''
of the apartheid regime, said Palme was killed by a man called
Anthony White, who may be living on a Greek island or in Cyprus
today. But he could provide neither the nationality nor the real
name of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
A South African newspaper report said that White was a soldier
of the former Rhodesian white troops, who fought black militants
in the Rhodesian War in 1970s which ended in the independence of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Another chief of the secret service, Colonel Eugene de Kock,
said that the former South African white government had staged an
operation to assassinate Palme.
</P>
<P>
Palme, who had long been hated by Pretoria for supporting the
African National Congress (ANC) headed by Nelson Mandela, was
killed on February 28, 1986, in central Stockholm when he and his
wife were walking out of a theater.
</P>
<P>
"The exact process of the operation is not clear... the South
African intelligence services worked on a confidential basis in
order to keep the details secret," said Coetzee.
</P>
<P>
Coetzee also confirmed an earlier accusation by de Kock that
Craig Williamson, the ``super-spy'' of South Africa, also was
involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Williamson, now owner of a diamond mine in Angola, has
rejected the accusation but admitted that he masterminded the
bombing attack on the ANC headquarters in London in 1982.
</P>
<P>
De Kock is now being tried by a South African court for
participating in killing missions against ANC during the apartheid
era.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen City in east China's
Fujian Province, is ready to supply fresh water to Quemoy island
at any time, according to an official.
</P>
<P>
According to the water supply department in Taiwan, Quemoy
requires 17,000 tons of water daily, but can only obtain some
16,000 tons a daily. It relies on Taiwan 150 nautical miles away
for water supplies.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage forced authorities in Quemoy to re-implement
measures to restrict the use of water from July 25.
</P>
<P>
Ye Yinghui, general manager of the Xiamen City Tap Water
Company, said Xiamen has a daily water supply of 480,000 tons and
is building a waterworks capable of supplying 420,000 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
"I think water can be supplied from Xiamen to Quemoy by ship
or through a pipeline," he said, adding that the Xiamen Island is
just 5,000 meters away from Quemoy.
</P>
<P>
A pipeline between Xiamen and Quemoy will be laid within two
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"On our side, there no problem in supplying up to 1,000 tons of
water to Quemoy every day," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Business people from Quemoy, who are visiting Xiamen, expressed
the hope that Taiwan authorities should approve the project to
supply water from Xiamen to Quemoy in the interests of Quemoy
residents.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Reform Water-Supply Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province in East
China is to spearhead reforms in the water-supply sector by
building new water-supply reservoirs funded and managed through
market methods.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water Resources Niu Maosheng made the remarks in an
interview with Xinhua in Hangzhou, provincial capital of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
China has built over 80,000 reservoirs since 1949 and they have
become a heavy economic burden. Until now they have been treated
as a welfare sector, and by no means as an economic entity, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Niu stressed that reservoirs, especially those built for
generating electricity and supplying water, must be industrialized.
</P>
<P>
While Zhejiang becomes the first province in China to
experiment with the new mechanism throughout the province, other
parts of the country will also have to follow suit, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently-held provincial conference, in the
coming five-years, 26 new reservoirs will be constructed in the
province, with a yearly water-supply capacity of two billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
As for the new policies, localities will be completely
responsible for financing, constructing, fee-collection,
management and pay-back of loans.

LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is facing a serious
shortage of more than 15,000 trained teachers, the "Sunday Times

It quoted Permanent Secretary of the Education Ministry
Sichalwe Kasanda as saying that there are about 38,500 trained
primary school teachers and only about 7,600 trained secondary
school teachers in the country.

at 9,000 for primary schools and 6,000 for secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The official said the ministry has awarded a hardship allowance
to encourage urban teachers to serve in rural areas.

<P>
DALIAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An auction has been held in
Dalian City in Northeast China's Liaoning Province to sell
materials, including cables, paper boards, cars and cement,
belonging to four companies that declined to pay tax.
</P>
<P>
The 217,000 yuan raised by the auction will be used to pay part
of the due taxes, while the Municipal State Taxation
Administration Jinzhou Branch will continue to seize and auction
more belongings from the firms.
</P>
<P>
The four companies owed 870,000 yuan in taxes to the taxation
office.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at strengthening taxation, as many
enterprises and individuals are reluctant to pay tax. Such
auctions would be held on the principle of "being open, reasonable
and fair".
</P>
<P>
Some enterprise managers attending the auction said they would
never refuse to pay due taxes.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Trade Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Growth will remain the main
focus in Sino-US economic adn trade relations, today's China Daily
quoted an executive researcher at the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) think tank as saying.
</P>
<P>
He cited Chinese customs figures, which show a notable increase
in Sino-US trade volume. Trade volume rose to 40.8 billion US
dollars in 1995 from 2.5 billion US dollar in 1979, at an average
annual growth rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to American customs data, China was the United
States' fifth largest trade partner in 1995, while China was 10th
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
By late June, US investments in China totalled 12.3 billion,
with more than 20,000 US-funded projects and ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
However, disparities exist between the two nations, as shown in
the US practice of counting value added by middle exporters for
commodities shipped via Hong Kong, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China exported goods worth
10.819 billion US dollars to the United States, down 3.4 percent
the same period of last year. At the same time, it reported a 3.1
percent increase in imports from America worth 7.366 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Lures Investors to Inland Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The recent deregulation move
by the State Council should attract more foreign investments to
inland areas, especially in infrastructure and agriculture,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Council granted inland and some large state firms
permission to approve autonomously overseas-funded manufacturing
projects with investments up to 30 million US dollars each --
three times more than the previous investment ceiling of 10
million US dollars, which had to be approved by regional
governments and major state companies.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, actual foreign
investments rose 20 percent compared to the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Low labour costs, mineral and tourism resources in as many as
18 inland provinces and autonomous regions have contributed to
favorable conditions for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, there still exist enormous opportunities for foreign
investors to inject their capital and up-to-date technology into
infrastructure facilities and renovation of old enterprises in
central and western China.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Elected Group of 77 Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The 20th annual
ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 held in New York on
Saturday unanimously elected Tanzania the group's chairman for
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by a "Sunday News" correspontent
reaching here from New York today, Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete told the meeting the election was a gesture of the
trust and confidence which the group had in his country and the
new government of President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
The 132-member group was formed 32 years ago to bring together
countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America in their quest for
development and a just and equitable economic order.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said Tanzania's major preoccupation would be to forge
the unity of the group by striving to maintain a common platform.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the group about challenges ahead such as the
reform of the United Nations, the problem of external
indebtedness, growing unfair world trade relations and continuing
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the United Nations, Kikwete said the group
should make sure the reforms did not in any way affect its
priorities on social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The burden of debt servicing by poor countries had led to a
contraction in imports, investment and consumption, which had in
turn imposed severe constraints on their ability to generate
growth and combat poverty, the Tanzanian minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, nominated by the African Group, takes over
chairmanship from Costa Rica.

<HEADLINE> Car Rentals Accelerate in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- With rapid development of car
rental, people with drivers' licenses but no cars have a chance to
drive, Beijing-based English paper China Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official from the Ministry of Internal
Trade as saying that there are now more than 50 companies in China
that lease cars for private use.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, at least 170 companies provide rental services,
said Gu Xiangdong, director of the Department of Mechanical and
Electrical Equipment Distribution, a division of the Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
China Leasing Company, a car leasing front-runner, offers car
rentals in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang property Leasing Company in east China has car leasing
affiliates in 23 cities and counties. Since last October, its
rentals of 360 cars have brought in 36 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, automobile leasing has become an important
part in meeting market demand. It provides a wide market for
various cars and vans while allowing many clients to drive,
despite a lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China's annual car output is expected to hit 1.5
million, which requires a private-car market.
</P>
<P>
The annual turnover for leasing industry including rental
vehicles is about one billion US dollars, less than one percent of
the United States and two percent of Japan.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand the leasing industry, the Ministry of
Internal Trade plans to select more than ten profitable and
credible automobile leasing companies to develop and standardize
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will accelerate efforts to draft leasing laws
and set up a trade association.

<HEADLINE> Nation Drive to Narrow Regional Disparities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A national drive to narrow
the east-west wealth gap is going full steam ahead.
</P>
<P>
The drive involves all social sectors with the central
government acting as the promoter and coordinator, and is daily
reinforced by the national consensus that modernization of China,
and common prosperity, cannot be achieved without interior China
getting onto the bandwagon of modernization.
</P>
<P>
Reform has brought new wealth to the country's coastal areas,
and it also has improved people's life in central and western
parts of the country, but at a pace far slower than in east
China. In recent years, as the east has surged ahead economically
at an annual growth rate of more than 16 percent, the rest of the
country has managed only nine percent. As a result, the wealth gap
between China's east and west is widening. Today, 65 million
people, most of them found in west China, still live below the
official poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, realizing the grave situation, has
vowed to narrow the gap by boosting economic development in the
central and western regions of the country. In fact, it has listed
gap narrowing as a major goal for the country's 9th Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000). And concrete measures have been taken or are
being taken to attain the goal.
</P>
<P>
One measure has been to launch industrial and infrastructure
projects in underdeveloped regions. Super projects that have got
underway in recent years include the Three Gorges Hydroelectric
Project on the middle section of the Yangtze River, the Ertan
Hydroelectric Project in western Sichuan province, southwest
China, and the construction of railways in remote, poor areas.
</P>
<P>
This year, the State Development Bank has provided 55 billion
yuan (US$6.6 billion) in low-interest loans for underdeveloped
regions, 71.6 percent of its total. They will be used as seed
money to start industries that make use of local resources, launch
infrastructure projects and improve farming.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Seeks Red Cross Aid for Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun is seeking the aid of
the red cross to trace about 128 ofits nationals allegedly
missing during last April's armed clash with Nigeria in the
disputed Bakassi peninsula, the "Sunday Champion" newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Camerounian authorities have transmitted a list of the 128
people to the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), the
newspaper said, quoting Walter Stocker, ICRC regional delegate
and head of mission in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"They (Cameroun) gave us (ICRC) the list of the missing
soldiers with their names and ranks, who have not reported back
to their bases in Cameroun, asking us to find out from the
Nigerian authorities their whereabouts," the ICRC official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ICRC is still waiting for the Nigerian
authorities to get back to the ICRC with the information.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian defence authorities last Tuesday declared 100
Nigerian soldiers and civilians missing following the April
attack on Nigerian positions by Camerounian troops around the
Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the ICRC has confirmed that Cameroun is
holding "90 Nigerian soldiers and 18 civilians" as prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
According to Nigeria's acting director of defence information,
Col. Godwin Ugbo, there is no information so far about the
whereabouts of the Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ruling out the possibility that they are held
captive or that some may have been killed," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Cameroun of altering the original map of the
disputed area with a view of misleading the United Nations
goodwill mission into believing that Bakassi belongs to Cameroun.

<HEADLINE> North China Province's Poverty-Relief Efforts Paid Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in North China
has made strenuous efforts in its poverty-eradication drive over
the last few years and has made notable achievements in this
regard, People's Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has made it a top priority to relieve
the 46 poorest counties and 2,748 poverty-stricken villages where
people have an annual income of less than 200 yuan, below the
poverty line, according to the official criterion.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility system has been adopted in the campaign as the
main leaders of the counties and villages have been made directly
responsible for the work, while 43 cadres at deputy provincial
governor-level and above have been assigned each to help and
supervise one county.
</P>
<P>
Officials whose localities have failed in poverty-eradication
work in set time will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, special funds, totalling 336 million yuan, have been
allocated by the provincial and local governments as well as units
assigned to help the poor areas to carry out the work.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government will
abolish its Ministry of Ownership Transformations on October 1
while establishing a ministry of national treasury, starting a
series of major government structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party of
the ruling coalition have reached an agreement to appoint Miroslaw
Pietrewicz head of the proposed ministry of national treasury,
according to sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Pietrewicz is now deputy prime minister and chief of the
Central Planning Office.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ministry of national treasury will take care of
state properties, monitor the operation of companies with
state-held stocks and oversee the process of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Also starting from October 1, Poland will set up a commission
for European integration. The structural reforms are aimed at
making Polish government institutions comparable with those of
other European nations.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Polish parliament passed seven laws on
government reform, requiring the disbanding of the ministries of
Interior, Industry and Trade, Foreign Economic Cooperation, Land
Planning and Construction and the Office of Central Planning,
while forming seven new ministerial level institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government is expected to establish the Ministry of
Interior and Administrative Affairs and the Ministry of Economy,
the Strategic Research Center of the government and the Office of
the Prime Minister on January 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns US Not to Launch Military Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran warned the United States
here today that if the Americans launch an attack against Iran,
only the start of such a war will be in their hands, but the end
of it will not be decided by them.
</P>
<P>
The chief of Staff of the Iranian Army, Major-General Ali
Shahbazi, said that the Iranian armed forces are fully prepared
for any eventuality regarding the potential military
confrontation between the American forces and Iranian forces.
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out the possibility of military
confrontation between the two armed forces, adding "I don't think
America will make such a blunder as to attack us. They have no
reason to attack."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iranian fear for potential
U.S. military attack is growing as Washington is massing
military forces in the Gulf under the pretext of the latest
development of the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the chief of staff of the army was published
in today's English daily Kayhan International.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi noted that the recent heightened tension between
Iraq and America was related to the U.S. presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved maximum readiness to confront any foreign
threat to our borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "we have never posed and will never pose a
threat to any country. But if we are attacked, we will deal our
enemy a crushing defeat."
</P>
<P>
As to modernization program to beef up military power, he
said, like other modern armies in the world, the Iranian army has
short, medium and long-term plans and strategies to improve its
might in coordination with the country's economic development
plans.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Based on our experiences during the eight-year
Iraqi-imposed war, we have taken great strides toward improving
our defensive power and modernizing our armed forces."
</P>
<P>
"Today, we are equipped with the most modern weapons such as
tanks, cannons, planes, missiles, gunboats and submarines," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have also done a lot to maintain weapons such as
F-4 and F-14 fighters and we have procured Mig-29 fighters and
submarines. We have also made our own missiles, cannons, tanks
and training planes."

<HEADLINE> APEC Business Advisory Council Meets in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Business Advisory
Council of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum
today reached consensus on the promotion of free trade and
investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
After a two-day closed door meeting ended here this afternoon,
the council will present its inaugural report to the APEC economic
leaders who will meet at the end of October 25.
</P>
<P>
The report, commissioned by APEC economic ministers last
November, takes for its title: "APEC means business: building
prosperity for our community."
</P>
<P>
The report recommendations, formulated by five committees of
the council members, focus on five key areas: finance and
investment, infrastructure, cross-border flows, small and medium
enterprises, and regional economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Roberto Romulo,
chairman of the APEC Business Council (ABAC), said that the two
themes of free trade and investment aim at promoting the expansion
of intra-regional business activities through trade and investment
liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
Victor Fung, chairman of Hong Kong Development Council and
co-chair of ABAC's Finance and Investment Committee, said that the
work of ABAC marks an important step forward in enhancing the
environment for foreign direct investment, adding that it should
translate into increased cross-border trade within the region as
current trends show trade directly follows investment.
</P>
<P>
The ABAC meeting in Hong Kong at the weekend was its third and
final gathering before its report will be discussed by the APEC
economic leaders at their planned Subic Bay meeting on November
25.

<HEADLINE> Nation Drive to Narrow Regional Disparities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another measure, the central government has been urging
east-west cooperation for "mutual benefit." In particular, the
east has been encouraged to transfer their capital, technology and
talent to the west.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of enterprises in east China have realized the
benefit of going west. In east China, as competition gets tough,
raw materials grow short and local markets become saturated, many
enterprises have seen their future in having a stake in interior
China, where raw materials are abundant, labor cheaper and the
market hungry for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The central and western regions cover 88.7 percent of China's
total area and is populated by 800 million people. It is home to
70 percent of the country's total mineral deposits. Qinghai
province alone has 17.5 trillion yuan (US$2.1 trillion) worth of
mineral resources. Inner Mongolia boasts half of the world's total
reserves of 17 rare-earth minerals.
</P>
<P>
For years, poor areas in the west faced a depletion of talent,
who sought high pay in east China. Nowadays, many of them who have
made a fortune in east China and a growing number of its migrant
workers have gone back to their native towns and villages, taking
with them capital, technology and information.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign investment in interior China is increasing
as a result of improved investment environment and the growing
attraction of its rich natural resources and vast market.
</P>
<P>
"Regional disparity is a product of history, and it will take
time to narrow it," Chinese Premier Li Peng said at the National
People's Congress last March. China will not be able to basically
eliminate poverty throughout the country until 2000, as is
indicated by the government's latest long-term development plan
adopted by the latest National People's Congress
session. Nonetheless, for the world's largest developing country,
it will be an unparalleled feat if indeed poverty become history
by that time.

MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today appealed to Israelis and Palestinians to cease all
provocative acts and return to the road charted by the agreements
they earlier concluded to attain a durable peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the clashes between the Israelis and
Palestinians in the last few days, which resulted in the death of
at least 80 people, Ramos said that the Filipino people view the
current situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with deep
concern.
</P>
<P>
He urged the countries with influence in the Middle East to
assist Palestinians and Israelis in returning to the negotiation
table as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Israeli and Palestinian leaders to approach the issue
in the spirit of dialogue and negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent events demonstrate the need for the international
community and the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process to
redouble efforts to save it, and to catalyze action from all
concerned parties toward reaching tangible achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippines is prepared to work with the international
community toward the continuation of all tracks of the peace
process, and the improvement of the living conditions and general
welfare of all peoples in the area, particularly the
Palestinians," Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Ministry Making Efforts to Increase Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Ministry of
Trade is taking measures to increase profit of its businesses and
continue the market-oriented economic reform.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of leading officials of the ministry's businesses
in northern provinces and cities, held in the port city of
Haiphong early this month, the ministry expressed the
determination to continue the reform, which was initiated in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has paid attention to boosting trade activities in
rural highland areas apart from focusing on developing urban
markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is cooperating with localities to set
up joint ventures to turn out more products and generate more jobs
for local people.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also conducted activities to improve its
management and accelerate the campaign against corruption and
extravagance.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises under the ministry are applying advanced trade
mechanisms to achieve higher profit.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's annual profit has been rising to 682 billion
Vietnamese dong (62 million U.S. dollars) in 1995 from 433 billion
Vietnamese dong (39 million dollars) in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, only 30 percent of ministry businesses are operating
effectively, with the rest either being beset by insufficient
capital or operating at a loss.

<HEADLINE> 30,000 IPF Members to Join MIC in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 Indian
Progressive Front (IPF) members are expected to join the Malaysian
Indian Congress (MIC) this November, according to the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
Some senior IPF party leaders are among them to indicate their
desire to join the MIC at its mass recruitment drive aimed at
boosting its 340,000-strong membership by 150,000, Bernama quoted
MIC President S. Samy Vella as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The IPF members have realized that only the MIC can provide
them with leadership," Samy Vella who is Works Minister in the
federal cabinet was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
IPF was formed by expelled MIC vice-president M.G. Pandithan
just before the general election in 1990. It was part of a loose
coalition of opposition parties until 1995 when it pulled out.
</P>
<P>
It applied to join the Barisan Nasional (BN), the ruling
national front but was rejected following objections by the MIC.
</P>
<P>
There would be a lot of changes in the party once it sets up
1,350 new MIC branches all over the country with at least 100
members in each branch after the completion of the recruitment
drive, Samy Vella said.
</P>
<P>
The MIC currently has 2,520 branches. It represents the
interests of the Malaysian Indians.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 700,000 Indian voters in the country and it is
our intention to have 500,000 people with us," he said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Head of the United Nations
special mission on Afghanistan Norbert Holl flew into Kabul today
for talks with the Taliban religious student militia who took
control of the Afghan capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul said two members of a six-person Taliban
interim government received the UN special envoy at Kabul airport.
</P>
<P>
Holl is scheduled to have a meeting at the presidential palace
with the head of the interim government, Mohammad Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Holl and his delegation, which included a representative from
the British embassy in Islamabad, were to return to Pakistan after
the talks with the Taliban leaders.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying to find a way to settle
differences between the warring Afghan factions, who began
battling since 1992 after the former President, Mohammad
Najibullah, was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new ruling faction today reopened the Kabul
airport, which was closed for about a year due to the Taliban's
continuous rocket attacks on Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The crew of the UN aircraft, the first flight that landed at
the airport, said there had been no problem in landing at the
newly reopened airport.
</P>
<P>
They said there was radio contact with the tower and that the
Taliban had repaired holes in the runway caused by recent
artillery fire.

disrupted after the militia seized the main Naghloo hydro-electric
plant east of the Afghan capital last week, Afghan sources were

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Israelis Protest against Netanyahu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 Israelis
gathered at Tel Aviv's Hamedina Square Saturday night to protest
against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies, which they
said had caused the recent confrontations between the
Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Those speaking at the rally directly blamed Netanyahu for the
confrontations in the last three days, which left more than 70
people dead, including 14 Israeli soldiers, and about 1,000
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed clashes were triggered by Israel's opening of a
tunnel beneath Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque compound, the third
holiest site of Islam in the world.
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers were former Tel Aviv Mayor Shlomo Lahat,
Kibbutz Artzi Secretary-General Avshalom Vilan, Gadi Taub, an
Israeli writer, and Tel Aviv University philosophy professor Asa
Kasher.
</P>
<P>
Amid a sea of posters, some read "Bibi (Netanyahu's
nickname), the nation's undertaker" and "Rabin (late Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin), your testament to us was peace." One
speaker after another called for the resumption of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Kasher said that the peace process "has been derailed,"
adding that "it is not enough for Bibi to pose with our
children, he has to guard their lives."
</P>
<P>
Taub called on those in the Likud, Shas, the National
Religious Party and other coalition parties "who now feel they
are stuck with charlatan" to cross over and work with the peace
camp.
</P>
<P>
An activist of the organization Peace Now, Moshe Halberstal,
said, "Netanyahu has no mandate to destroy Rabin's work."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eshkar Eldan-Cohen from Rishon Lezion, a town near
Tel Aviv, said that he did not think "Bibi has a policy," adding
"he is handsome, he knows how to talk and his program is to be
in power."
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the speakers at the rally was that Netanyahu
does not know what he is doing, that he is arrogant and that he
has no intention of making peace.
</P>
<P>
A Tel Aviv man who declined to give his name commented, "We
are on the edge of an abyss," warning "if we go on like this, we
will have war for sure."
</P>
<P>
"Bibi is destroying all chances for peace," said Tel Aviv
resident Sara Nisselboim. "When people lose hope they fight, and
we did the same when we were fighting for the state."
</P>
<P>
Vilan got a roar of applause when he said Netanyahu should
remember "Israel is a place in which there is a favor to life
and not just a fight for existence."

JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Intensive activities of
international mediation appear to be prevailing over days of
violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has tried desperately to bring about a summit between

However, the PA insisted that there should be a tripartite
meeting under the auspices of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
while Israel would like to have direct bilateral meeting. Then
the U.S. offered to hold the summit in Washington in the
presence of President Bill Clinton.

Arafat is reportedly holding out for a clear understanding on
the outcome of any meeting with Netanyahu before agreeing to meet
him, while Israel is still placing blames squarely at the door
of the PA and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear late Saturday night whether Netanyahu and
Arafat would meet in Washington during the next few days or
whether, if the stalemate continued, U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher would come to the region to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza, U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem Edward Abington
held talks with Arafat, and U.N. Special Coordinator Terje
Larsen met with Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas in a bid to break
the deadlock. U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk was in touch with top
Israeli officials Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
While all agree that the talks on Hebron redeployment should
be restarted, the central question Saturday night remained
whether Arafat would insist on a gesture -- such as speeding up
the redeployment -- that Netanyahu might accept, or whether he
would ask for more expensive concessions, which could prompt the
more rightwing elements in the cabinet to scotch any
move. Science Minister Ze'ev Begin said the cabinet had
instructed Netanyahu not to yield to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In the U.N. The U.S. Saturday night did not block a
watered-down security Council resolution on the
situation. President Clinton is apparently anxious about the
affair, but keeps a low profile himself. At a time of five weeks
before the U.S. election, and with his lead over Republican
challenger Bob Dole shrinking, it seems that Clinton does not
want to exert much visible pressure on Israel so as to avoid
infuriating the 6 million American Jews.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. is persuading Israel to make a
gesture, one way or another, to the Palestinians during a
meeting with Arafat. But an official in the Prime Minister's
Office said Saturday night, "If anybody tries to deliver a
political reward for Arafat's decision to incite his people to
violence, this will destroy the peace process. If Arafat
succeeds in obtaining such a reward now, he will do it every 10
days."
</P>
<P>
Arafat is opposed to a one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu
because he presumably believes such an arrangement would
degenerate into mutual recriminations. But Israeli officials
reject a meeting under Mubarak's auspices, as they fear that
Mubarak should point an accusing finger at Netanyahu alone, in
view of a recent spate of Egyptian attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said Saturday that the
Palestinian demands are clear. "We want them to close the
tunnel, put the peace process back on track, and immediately
implement the Oslo accords," he said. A meeting of the PLO
Executive Committee and the PA cabinet Saturday also demanded
the closure of the tunnel and an Egypt-Palestine-Israel summit
in Cairo, or a multilateral international conference with EU and
U.S. participation.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that a bilateral meeting at this time is the
best venue ... We want a meeting that clearly measures the
provocation which led to this popular explosion ... We want to
see the Israeli government respect agreements it has signed, and
to see action on withdrawal from Hebron," said Nabil Shaath,
Palestinian minister of international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Saturday night in Jerusalem to 6,000 participants at
a conference of the International Christian Embassy, Netanyahu
declared that the tunnel "is open. It will stay open. It will
always stay open."
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, appearing on Israel
Television Saturday night, urged Arafat to calm down his own
people. Both Mordechai and head of the army Central Command Uzi
Dayan threatened that Israeli troops would intrude into the
Palestinian self-rule territories if the violence escalated.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have something to lose," Mordechai
declared. He was one of the several top aides who participated in
consultations at Netanyahu's home over Shabat.

<HEADLINE> Algerians Sue Former Paris Police Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An Algerian civil group is
suing former Paris police commissioner, Maurice Papon, for the
massacre of hundreds of Algerian demonstrators on October 17,
1961, by French police in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Algiers-based "Foundation of May 8, 1945" told Agence
France Presse that it is launching a lawsuit against Papon, 86, in
a court in the Prefecture of Seine, accusing him of collective
crime which resulted in the deaths of several hundred Algerians.
</P>
<P>
French police brutally suppressed thousands of Algerians who
demonstrated in October 1961 to support the National Liberation
Front (NLF), which was fighting for the independence of Algeria at
that time.
</P>
<P>
While the French authorities said that only three people were
killed and 64 wounded, some 60 corpses of Algerians were found
floating in the Seine River and hanged on trees in the forests of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The NLF said that 200 people were massacred by French police in
Paris and 400 disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Constantin Melnik, an advisor of the government of late prime
minister Michel Debre at that time, said in a book published in
1988 that some 100 Algerians were tortured to death by French
police.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian fighters won the independence of their country in
1962 after five years of guerrilla war and Charles de Gaulle's
decision to withdraw from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Papon was also put on trial by a court in Bordeaux, southern
France, earlier this month for his collaboration with Nazi
occupiers in the deportation of thousands of Jews to death camps
during World War II, when he was a senior official of the Vichy
puppet regime.
</P>
<P>
Papon served in various key posts of Gaullist governments after
the war, and was protected by the authorities from being put under
legal inquiry for 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reopens Controversial Tunnel in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel reopened the
controversial archeological tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem
this morning, in spite of pressure of international community and
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel runs beneath the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, the third
holiest site of Islam in the world.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel was closed during Jewish Shabbat (Saturday). It's
first opening Tuesday touched off a widely-spread Palestinian
protest throughout Palestinian territories including east
Jerusalem in five consecutive days, which caused unprecedented
bloody clashes in many years between Palestinian demonstrators
and Israeli soldiers and between Palestinian police and Israeli
army units.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a
strongly-worded speech here Saturday night that the tunnel "will
stay open" and "it will always stay open."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in New York
Saturday night calling Israel and the Palestinians to end clashes
and restore peace process. During the debate Israel was under
stern condemnation for causing the clashes. Four members voted
for the resolution and the U.S. abstained.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Korean Contractors Eye Southeast Asian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Anticipating another big
takeoff in the nation's overseas construction industry, a growing
number of South Korean construction firms are focusing on the
booming Southeast Asian market.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Southeast Asia represented a mere 10 percent of South
Korea's total overseas construction contracts as against the 85.8
percent in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
However, since 1991, Southeast Asia has overtaken the Middle
East to become South Korea's largest overseas construction market.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim were the major markets for
Koreans from 1965, when South Korea started its overseas
construction industry, to 1973, when South Korean construction
companies first entered the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Most experts echoed the view that the new Southeast Asian
market will continue its boom over the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
South Korean overseas construction contracts in the
January-August period rose 35.1 percent from 4.36 billion dollars
last year to 5.89 billion dollars this year, with 4.37 billion
dollars in Southeast Asia, the biggest market, followed by 550
million dollars in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Construction and Transportation Ministry has said that
overseas construction orders won by South Korean firms this year
will surpass the projected goal of 10 billion dollars. Of the
total, Southeast Asia is expected to account for about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the South Korean government eased restrictions on
foreign real estate investment to help domestic construction firms
effectively win overseas contracts for development and financing
projects.
</P>
<P>
Under their long-term national development plans, most
Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and
Indonesia, are competitively investing a huge amount of money in
their social infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Among South Korean builders, Hyungdai Engineering and
Construction Company, Ssangyong Engineering and Construction
Company and Daewoo Engineering and Construction Company are the
most active in the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
They are going all-out to grab a greater share of the lucrative
Southeast Asian market with their newly-developed construction
technology.
</P>
<P>
South Korean contractors are now increasingly looking for high
value-added property development and financing projects in
Southeast Asia, instead of simple civil engineering and building
projects.
</P>
<P>
Among the new development and financing projects are those made
in the form of the build, operate and transfer (BOT) and the
build, operate and ownership (BOO) contracts. The turn-key
contracts require contractors to do the whole process of work from
the concept drawing to the commissioning or dedicating of the
completed work.
</P>
<P>
"More and more Korean construction firms are now switching
their eyes from the conventional open tender to the new property
development and financing projects to some success in the
Southeast Asian market," said an official of the International
Contractors Association of Korea (ICAK).
</P>
<P>
South Korea became the world's second largest overseas
contractor following the United States in 1981, when it earned
13.68 billion dollars worth of contracts from abroad. During the
peak years of 1981-1983, Korean contractors won 37.2 billion
dollars. Of the total, the Middle East alone accounted for 33.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following several years of sluggish business, South Korea's
overseas construction contracts soared from 2.78 billion dollars
in 1992 to 5.12 billion dollars in 1993, 7.47 billion dollars in
1994 and 8.51 billion dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Products Facing EU Anti-Dumping Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of South
Korean products are either being hit by anti-dumping tariffs or
facing related investigations by the European Union (EU), raising
fears that export to western Europe will become more difficult,
business sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently accepted anti-dumping complaints against South
Korean-made facsimile systems, and a probe is to begin soon,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, the EU slapped anti-dumping tariffs of 3.3-24.4
percent on South Korean microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
The latest ruling brought to 13 the number of South Korean
products for which anti-dumping duties have had to be paid, making
it necessary for both the government and the private sector to
develop strategies to avoid such tariffs, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Items facing anti-dumping duties as of the end of last month
included video tapes, color television sets with screens of
smaller than 16 inches, disposable lighters, car audio systems and
synthetic polyester fabric and dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips.
</P>
<P>
Video tapes, color TV sets and DRAM chips are under
investigations, but they could face renewed tariffs at the
beginning of next year, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
"As of late, the EU has been increasing surveillance on South
Korean-made products, and indications are that it will continue to
carry out investigations upon dumping complaints by European
companies," a source said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-dumping duties have not had a strong impact on exports to
European countries thus far, but moves against South Korean cars
and other major products are making it necessary to come up with
countermeasures, the source added.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Move to Spacious New Home in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A new home with a cozy
environment, landscaped features and a private swimming pool,
which is the dream of most city dwellers, has become a reality for
Blackie and Spottie, two jaguars in the Hong Kong Zoological and
Botanical Garden (HKZBG).
</P>
<P>
The pair now comfortably settle in their new enclosure, which
has an area of 600 square meters, three times larger than their
old home.
</P>
<P>
Constructed at a cost of 5.2 million HK dollars (671,000 US
dollars), the new enclosure's facilities include a landscaped
exhibition area, pool, sleeping shelter, breeding unit, food
preparation room and store room.
</P>
<P>
Noting that jaguars are excellent swimmers and climb well, an
Urban Council spokesman said that the greatly expanded new
enclosure was designed to resemble their natural habitat and
provide them with more activity areas.
</P>
<P>
He said jaguars were internationally classified as a vulnerable
species due to commercial hunting and habitat loss.
</P>
<P>
Spottie, female, was born in Berlin Zoo and was imported in
1990 for pairing with Blackie, male, which was born in HKZBG.
</P>
<P>
HKZBG attracted an average of 850,000 visitors each year and
most of them enjoy seeing some larger animals such as jaguars in
real life.

<HEADLINE> Britain Reportedly Plays Secret Role in Raids Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- British military forces have
secretly played a central role in recent U.S. missile attacks
against Iraqi targets, Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a far greater level of cooperation than London and
Washington have admitted, the Royal Air Force (RAF) and British
Army officers analyzed reconnaissance pictures to identify targets
for the United States cruise missile attacks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
British Army officers at Britain's Joint Air Reconnaissance
Intelligence Center (JARIC), based at RAF Brampton, in
Cambridgeshire, used sophisticated computer software to evaluate
the "take" from U.S. and British aircraft and spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper claimed that working closely with their U.S.
counterparts, British JARIC operators "were at the heart of
Operation Desert Strike."
</P>
<P>
The disclosure appears to contradict British government's
earlier announcement that Britain's only involvement had been in
allowing the island of Diego Garcia to be used for refueling the
U.S. bombers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One source was quoted by the Sunday Telegraph as saying,
"British analytical capacity in this area is strong and no doubt
also the Americans were pleased at the private symbolism of the
gesture."
</P>
<P>
"We did not select the targets, we just identify them from the
reconnaissance images. We and the American analysts presented the
Pentagon with a menu of targets from which they alone chose," the
source added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Woman Gets 6 Years' Jail For Child Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A mother, who abused her
five-year-old daughter so badly that the girl became mentally
retarded, was given six years' jail here Saturday, the Straits
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in passing the sentence, District Judge
Syed Alwee deplored the mother Cindy Chandra's acts of violence
and said that her repeated abuse of the child aggravated her case
and outweighed any mitigating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Winny Ho, the five-year-old daughter who was described as
"normal" before the abuse, is now mentally retarded and is
studying in a special school. She is being looked after by foster
parents.
</P>
<P>
The judge told the 29-year-old mother, who is now eight weeks
pregnant with her third child, "Offenders who assault defenseless
children will not get any sympathy from the courts".
</P>
<P>
Cindy Chandra got four years' jail for throwing Winny Ho onto
the floor on February 7 this year. She could have been jailed up
to seven years and fined. She was also given a two years' jail for
burning Winny Ho with a hair dryer on July 2, 1995. She could have
been jailed up to five years or fined for this.
</P>
<P>
The facts of this case disclosed a serious case of child abuse,
the judge said, noting that the assaults were not only repeated
but grew in intensity.
</P>
<P>
"When these assaults are violent assaults committed on a young
child and are repeated over a period of time causing serious
injury to the child, the offender can expect the full brunt of the
law," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
However, the judge also told Chandra that he would direct
prison authorities to take note of her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyer filed an appeal and she is now out on 50,000
Singapore dollars (about 35,700 US dollars) bail.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Ugandan rebels of
the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) were killed during the latest
clashes with government troops in Koboko and Aringa, northwestern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, about 80 rebels on

</P>
<P>
The report said they later fled into west neighbour Zaire.
</P>
<P>
After the battle, the army recovered some weapons and
ammunitions such as rifles, grenade and magazines from the
rebels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
About 150 WNBF rebels entered Uganda from north neighbouring

<HEADLINE> China Faces Dilemma in Housing Sector: China Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China is in dilemma in the
real estate sector: medium or low-income families could not afford
to the soaring prices of houses, a large number of newly-built
apartments are vacant, China Daily says today.
</P>
<P>
According to the English daily, 4000,000 households merely have
a per-capita living space of four sqm, while there are 50.3
million sqm of vacant houses, 77 percent of which are residential.
</P>
<P>
The prices of houses, ranging from 5,000-10,000 yuan per sqm in
big cities, are too expensive to afford for ordinaries in a
country with an average annual per-capita income of about 500 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In general, a two-room residence downtown costs about 300,000
yuan, which is equivalent of a middle-income worker's salary for
30 years, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The rocketing prices have been caused by high construction and
land-renting costs. Meanwhile, both banks and customers are
hesitant and slow to adopt house-purchasing mortgage loans due to
lack of funds, short credit terms, high interest rate and complex
procedures, according to the daily.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Construction, the country will
build 1.2 billion sqm of residential houses in urban areas before
2000, and by then, the real estate sector will account for 3.5
percent of China's general domestic production.

<HEADLINE> Car Tax Reform to Help Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China's central government is
considering reforming the existing automobile tax system, under
which regional administrations are collecting too much from car
owners, to create a better environment for development of the
motor industry, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are right for accelerating the reform as a new tax
system in line with international conventions was recently adopted
in the southern province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
In other provinces, however, at least 20 taxes and fees are
levied on car owners, restricting market demand, in spite of the
state policy that promotes the motor industry as an economic
pillar. Many of the charges may be illegal.
</P>
<P>
Through the reform, proposed by several ministries and
commissions, major taxes and fees levied on motor vehicles,
especially sedans, are expected to become a single tax, the
so-called fuel consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of taxes and fees on automobiles that cannot merge
into the new tax will be e-examined. Many of them might be
rescinded in accordance with laws and state policies, officials
withe the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance
said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's new system has drawn attention of auto makers,
dealers, owners and would-be buyers. Appealing to the central
government for a tax reform on motor vehicles in a nationwide
scale is expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
New tax will encourage automobile buyers and owners to mount
pressure on auto makers to force them to develop and manufacture
efficient, energy-saving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
No timetable has been set for the reform but the State Planning
Commission will accelerate preliminary work. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has expressed grave
concern and outrage at the "violence, killing and bloodshed being
perpetrated by Israeli forces in Jerusalem and other parts of the
occupied territories."
</P>
<P>
Local press here today quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying that the government and the people of Bangladesh stand by
President Yasser Arafat and "our Palestinian brothers" at this
tragic hour and express deep condolences and heart-felt sympathy
at the unfortunate loss of so many valuable lives.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that more than 50 Palestinians have died in
recent days during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian
protesters in Jerusalem and other "occupied territories" including
Gaza and the West Bank, where Israeli troops fired gunshots at
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate situation has been brought about by the
occupation authorities' unprovoked actions designed to harm the
holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, which has hurt the sentiments of the Muslims
all over the world, the spokesman said, demanding an immediate
close of the tunnel under the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third
holiest shrine of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"We also call upon all concerned that in keeping with the
demands of the Arabs and the Palestinians, the peace process must
be started immediately with a view to fully implementing the
accords already signed and finding just, comprehensive and durable
solution of all the Mideast issues, including the final status of
Jerusalem as the capital of the sovereign and independent state of
Palestine," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Development Blueprint for Next 15 Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991-95), China scored
an average annual growth of 12 percent in economy, with the
highest yearly growth at 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the country's total value of foreign
trade exceeded one trillion U.S. dollars, double that of the
previous five-year plan period.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 billion U.S. dollars of foreign capital poured
into the country in the last five years, of which direct foreign
investment accounted for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the country had foreign exchange reserves
of 73 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite obvious achievements, China is still a developing
country. Because of its huge population now standing at 1.2
billion, the country's GNP in per capita terms is below 600
U.S. dollars, according to most estimates. About 65 million people
continue to live below the official poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Chinese planners realize that, to attain the
ambitious goals, a sustainable growth rate is an absolute
necessity.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint calls for establishing a well-developed market
economy and "making a shift in economic growth mode," from relying
on building more production facilities to relying mainly on
improved management and advances in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
As Premier Li Peng explained in his address to the NPC session,
such a shift is aimed at improving the "quality of economic
growth". This means making high value-added products with greater
efficiency by using new and high technologies, with lower
consumption of materials and energy.
</P>
<P>
The government realizes that it is not easy to achieve all the
goals. However, favorable conditions outweigh impeding factors.
</P>
<P>
The premier cited advantages that he said would ensure the
success of government plans. These include a relatively solid
material and technological foundation built over the years, a vast
domestic market, large savings deposits of the people, and a
national consensus on continued reforms and implementation of the
open policy.
</P>
<P>
Even more important, according to Li, is popular support for
Deng Xiaoping's theory of "building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," which, the premier said, "clearly points the way
for continued progress."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Against Transit Facility to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has strongly warned against the
government's conspiracy to provide transit facility to India,
allowing it to use Bangladesh's largest Chittagong port and import
power from India.
</P>
<P>
A reliable source disclosed today that the BNP made the warning
at an emergency meeting of the party's National Executive
Committee Saturday, which cautioned that it would not tolerate any
plot threatening the country's independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the country's latest political situation, the
opposition party alleged that the activities of the present
government indicate that "they are going to implement a secret
plan" to woo India as per previous arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also condemned the government for what it called
undermining the country's dignity in the name of "bringing Ganges
water" and pursuing a subservient foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka and New Delhi are seeking a permanent solution to the
outstanding issue of water sharing of the common Ganges river.
India has expressed its willingness to sign an agreement on the
issue with Dhaka before the next dry season beginning next
January.
</P>
<P>
The BNP also accused the government of doing vindictive
politics through arrest of and filing of false cases against
hundreds of BNP leaders and workers and demanded release of all
BNP men and withdrawal of false cases against them.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong called on Singapore people here today to be more active in
participating in sports in order to enhance the quality of life in
an aging society.
</P>
<P>
Launching the country's "Sports for Life" program at a local
sports park, Goh said, "To enhance the quality of life in an aging
society, we are re-focusing our effort from 'Sports for All' to
'Sports for Life'", which is about creating life-long habits,
adopting a new lifestyle and living a healthier, better life.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Singapore has one of Asia's fastest aging
population: Singapore's elderly population aged 65 and above will
double from the current seven percent to 14 percent in just 24
years, a pace faster than Japan's.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "I urge all Singaporeans to play some sports to get
the most out of their lives," the prime minister said, noting that
currently, only 24 percent of the Singaporeans play a sport at
least once a week.
</P>
<P>
Sports for Life aims to increase this to 40 percent by the turn
of the century, then 50 percent by the year 2005. It also aims to
increase the percentage of people who exercise at least three
times a week from eight percent to 15 percent by the year 2000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that it is a long-term national program to
make available a wider range of sports activities and schemes to
the individual, the family and the community.
</P>
<P>
"My idea of an all-rounded Singaporean is one who is
well-educated, cultivated, sporty, caring and gracious," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a Singaporean reads widely, enjoys music and the arts,
sings or plays at least one musical instrument, is active in
sports, and cares for his fellow citizens. Then he or she will be
able to enjoy a rich, active and healthy lifestyle," Goh added.

NEW DELHI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- As a co-accused in the
Pathak cheating case of 100,000 US dollars, India's former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao may be sent to the Tihar Jail in case
he is arrested after his appearance in the court of special judge
Ajit Bharihoke on September 30, local press reports said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rao is expected to present himself in court at the Tis Hazari
Complex around 10 am (local time), half-an-hour before the hearing
begins at 10.30 am.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi high court dismissed Rao's anticipatory bail plea
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony earlier in the trial court, UK-based
non-Indian resident businessman L. Pathak said he gave 100,000 US
dollars to Godman Chandraswami and his associate on the basis of
assurance given by Rao, the then external affairs minister, to
secure contracts to supply newsprint and paper pulp to India in
1983, but he was duped.
</P>
<P>
Police are busy making unprecedented security arrangement for
Rao's appearance before the court next Monday. Security agencies
have made drill to make the Tis Hazari court complex perfect safe.
Sniffer dogs and metal detectors were pressed into service. Three
security rings will guard Rao when he comes to court and hundreds
of police personnel will keep vigil on the thousands of people,
both regular visitors and curious onlookers.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been persuaded to wear bullet-proof jacket on the
occasion.

<HEADLINE> Banharn Under Pressure to Step Down as Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Pressure is mounting in
Care-taker Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's Chart Thai Party
for him to stand down as party leader.
</P>
<P>
Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party Secretary-General and Wang Nam
Yen Faction leader Sanoh Thienthong and Party Advisory Chairman
Pramarn Adireksarn, backed by other key figures, are putting
pressure on Banharn to step down as party chief.
</P>
<P>
Embittered by Banharn's surprise decision Friday to dissolve
the House of Representatives, Sanoh accused Banharn of betraying
all MPs of the party by not holding a prior consultation among the
party's MPs.
</P>
<P>
Coalition parties had wanted to maintain the government and did
not want the house dissolved.
</P>
<P>
"All 91 souls (Chart Thai MPs) were murdered in cold blood in
the interests of one person," Sanoh said in a fume.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We felt as if we had been struck by lightning. We
did not expect that our leader, who had told the people he would
resign in seven days, would do something else (dissolving the
house)."
</P>
<P>
He accused Banharn of doing everything himself while other
party MPs were just following party line.
</P>
<P>
He also threatened to "bare all" concerning misdeeds or corrupt
practices likely to have been committed by Banharn as head of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Before Banharn dissolved the house, Sanoh joined other five
coalition government parties in supporting New Aspiration Party
leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as Banharn's successor.
</P>
<P>
Sanoh, public health minister in the Banharn government, had
been displeased as Banharn refused to let him take the powerful
interior minister's post, which Banharn held concurrently.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Banharn would either be forced to step down
as party chairman, or his party face disintegration.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Countries Agree on Debt-Relief Plan for Poorest Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The world's seven wealthy
industrialized nations today endorsed a debt relief plan for the
poorest nations on earth.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after over five hours of closed-door
consultations among finance ministers and central bank governors
of Group of Seven (G-7) nations, including United States, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The debt-reduction plan for some debt-ridden countries of
Africa, Latin America and Asia was jointly initiated by the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) one year ago. It is
designed to relieve up to 7.7 billion U.S. dollars in debts of as
many as 20 of the world's most heavily indebted countries.
</P>
<P>
As their contribution to the package, the seven wealthy
industrial nations pledged to provide debt relief covering up to
80 percent of the debt they hold individually.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Uganda is most likely to be the first
country to qualify for the debt-relief program. The British relief
organization Oxfam International calculated it could mean 80
million dollars in annual savings in interest payments for Uganda,
an amount equal to six times what Uganda spends on primary health
care for its people.
</P>
<P>
The 7.7 billion dollars in resources would come from 2 billion
dollars in contributions from the World Bank, 1.2 billion dollars
from the IMF, 2.1 billion dollars from other regional development
banks and 2.5 billion dollars in debt relief from the industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers look forward to the implementation without delay
of all components of these decisions on a case-by-case basis,"
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the debt issue, the finance officials expressed

<HEADLINE> All Fuel Prices Up In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua)-- The Sri Lankan government has
announced that prices of all fuel hike from midnight Friday, a
news release said today.
</P>
<P>
The cost of local food and bus travel are affected by the fuel
price hikes, but the release said the price of bread and flour
would be kept down with government subsides.
</P>
<P>
The release explaining the reasons for the increase said the
current prices of petroleum products were fixed in January 1995
when the exchange rate was about 49 rupees to the US dollar and
the average crude oil price was 16.5 US dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the exchange rate as well as the international
crude oil price have increased considerably. At present, the
exchange rate is 56 rupees to the dollar while international crude
oil price is around 20 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation spokesman, any
upward revision of fuel prices will affect the cost of living of
the people. However, this restructuring of price is being done
because it is inevitable due to a rise in the cost of crude oil
in the international market and a rise in the US dollar exchange
rate.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Gov't to Change General Election Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong will introduce two bills in Parliament Tuesday,
which are likely to make constitutional changes to laws governing
general elections, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times report said that the Constitution of the
Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill and the Parliamentary
Elections (Amendment) bill will be tabled by the prime minister,
though no details were available on the nature of the changes
being sought.
</P>
<P>
However, there was speculation that the bills have to do with
provisions governing group representation constituencies (GRCs),
it said, quoting a local constitutional lawyer as saying that the
hottest rumor around now was that the number of Members of
Parliament (MPs) per GRC will be increased from four to five.
</P>
<P>
Legislation to create GRCs was approved by Parliament in May
1988. The law then provided for a GRC with three MPs, of whom at
least one must be from a minority community.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the Constitution were introduced in August 1990
so the number of MPs representing a GRC must be "not less than
three but not more than four". In January 1991, following the
changes to the Constitution, consequential amendments were made to
the Parliamentary Elections Act. Elections were held in August
1991.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 58 of the 79 MPs, or 73 percent, are representing 15
GRCs. In addition, there are 21 single-seat constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees to Stage Sit-in in New Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Bhutanese
refugees living in the refugee camps in eastern Nepal left
Saturday for New Delhi to stage a sit-in demonstration in the
Indian capital city, a newspaper here said today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees delegation, including the peace marchers who were
deported into India last month by Bhutanese police shortly after
entering Bhutan, is to draw the attention of India to the problem
of nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, the Kathmandu Post
daily reported, without mentioning the delegation's size.
</P>
<P>
A Bhutanese refugees group in Nepal, the Appeal Movement
Coordination Council (AMCC), early this year launched a peach
march movement from Nepal to Bhutan via India, appealing to the
Bhutanese authorities for the free repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 50 refugee marchers managed to enter Bhutan in mid-August
after a number of similar marches failed because of Indian
police's interception. But they were soon dropped off along the
India-Bhutan border by the Bhutanese police.
</P>
<P>
The AMCC has appealed to the government of India, which handles
 Bhutan's foreign affairs under a bilateral treaty, for the
resolution of the lingering refugees problem.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the international community including United
Nations Secretary-General Butros-Butros Ghali to take steps and
help bring an end to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of Nepal-Bhutan bilateral talks earlier had made
no progress in the solution of the refugees problem, which was
triggered six years ago when Bhutanese refugees, mostly of
Nepalese origin, began to flood into Nepal via India due to
Bhutan's "one nation, one people" policy.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia called on the U.N.
Security Council (UNSC) to convene immediately to discuss recent
Israeli-Palestinian clashes and take measures to halt Israel's
brutal actions against Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here last night, the Foreign Ministry
said that Indonesia was calling for an UNSC meeting in its
capacity as a non-permanent council member.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia cannot tolerate the brutal actions taken by Israel
against Palestinians residing in territories occupied by Zionist
Israel such as Jerusalem, Ramalah, Nablus and Gazaga, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 44 Palestinians have been killed and over 500 others
injured in armed confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli
troops since September 25.
</P>
<P>
"The brutal actions by Israel are against the agreements Israel
and the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) have concluded,
and against international humanitarian law. The actions threaten
peace," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia also urged the Israeli government to cease its
unlawful behavior forthwith and withdraw its troops from
territories which under its peace accord with the PLO were to be
handed over to Palestine.

<HEADLINE> FSNL Candidate Ortega Takes Lead in Pre-Electoral Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan voters for the
first time gave their favor to Daniel Ortega, candidate of
Nicaraguan National Liberation Sandinista Front (FSNL), in a
recent pre-electoral opinion poll, the local "Barricada" daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said 42 percent of the voters questioned intended
to vote for Ortega, who led six percentage points over his
opponent, Arnoldo Aleman of the Liberal Alliance.
</P>
<P>
With the October 20 general election drawing near, Ortega's
popularity increased immensely. During the last three months,
Ortega lured nine more percent supporters, while Aleman lost 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to an opinion poll conducted in August 1995, Ortega
held only 30 percent of the votes, while Aleman took 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
FSNL campaign analyst-in-chief Bayardo Arce said recently that
the FSNL had broken the "technical tie" with the Liberal Alliance
in the polls and has the possibility of winning the election in
the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's electoral law, a party must get 45 percent
of ballots to win the election in the first round.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Ireland is to make a bid to

</P>
<P>
"We have the support of the players and we think the next venue

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Import Quotas Harm Costa Rican Textile Industry: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- United States import quotas
have undermined the Costa Rican textile industry, especially the
underwear sector, causing a loss of 6,000 jobs, said Foreign Trade
Ministry authorities.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed on Costa Rica in June 1995 an annual
quota of 14.4 million dozens of underwear pieces with a yearly 6
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
"Quotas have prevented the growth of the textile industry and
affected investment in Costa Rica last year," said Anabelle
Gonzalez, international negotiations director of the Foreign Trade
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A Textile Industry Chamber study shows 45 textile factories
closed during the first half of this year, 36 of them apparel
manufacturing ones.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprises affected by the U.S. measure had to reduce
their payroll and cut short working hours to four days a week, or
two weeks a month.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Chacon, deputy minister of the ministry, said the
U.S. measure has left at least 6,000 people unemployed in the
textile sector.
</P>
<P>
Textiles are the main exporting industry of Costa Rica,
generating 650 million U.S. dollars a year and direct employment
for some 50,000 people, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican government appealed against the U.S. measure
before a special committee of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
in Geneva, and is expecting a WTO resolution to be issued in
November.

<HEADLINE> China Maps Out Development Blueprint for Next 15 Years (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29
 (Xinhua) --China will see its economy grow at an annual rate of
eight percent in the coming five years, according to the
government's blueprint for development in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and Long-Term Goals for 2010 was adopted in
March by the National People's Congress, China's parliament, at
its fourth session.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint also sets out a major target for the year 2000
which is to quadruple the per capita gross national product (GNP)
of 1980, more difficult than a quadrupling of the GNP of the same
year, which was accomplished last year, since the country's
population in 2000 will have increased by 300 million over 1980.
</P>
<P>
The government's long-term plan is to double the country's GNP
in the first decade of the next century. GNP last year stood at
5.76 trillion yuan. With a planned growth rate of eight percent a
year in the five remaining years of the century, GNP by year 2000
should amount to 8.5 trillion yuan at 1995 prices, or about 1.02
trillion U.S. dollars according to the current exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, China's GNP will reach 17 trillion yuan at
1995 prices. Taking into account purchase power parity, China will
have become one of the world's biggest economies by then, with
Most Chinese being able to lead a fairly comfortable life.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Two aides of former Afghan
president Mohammad Najibullah were hanged today by the Taliban
religious student militia while fighting between the Taliban and
the retreating government forces were reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Afghan capital of Kabul said today that the two
aides, identified only as general Jafzar and Tukhi, were killed in
Kabul one day after Najibullah was executed and hanged within
hours of Kabul's capture by Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, "Tukhi," was Najibullah's right-hand
man and personal secretary and the second victim was Najibullah's
longtime bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
Radio Kabul, which the Taliban took over Friday, called the two
men "accomplices" of Najibullah, who led a Moscow-backed regime
from 1986 to 1992 when he was overthrown by an alliance of Islamic
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Details of their executions were not available. They had been
living with Najibullah for the past four years in a United Nations
compound a few blocks from the presidential palace in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some reports said the Taliban forces and retreating
troops loyal to the ousted President, Burhanuddin Rabbani, traded
artillery and rocket fire south of Charikar, about 60 kilometers
north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Otrs of the ousted Kabul
government were reportedly killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Charikar, capital of northern Parwan province, is just 14
kilometers south of Jabal us-Seraj, a stronghold of Rabbani's top
commander Shah Masood in Parwan. To tall costs".
</P>
<P>
"Hekmatyar told me we have decided to resist and defend Afghan
land at all costs," said Farid.

<P>
"Our government will remain. We are determined to stay in
Afghanistan. The Taliban will now face a tough time," he quoted
the Hezb-i-Islami chief as saying.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Urges Afghans to Cease Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today called for the immediate cessation of all
armed hostilities in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement read by Ambassador Alfredo Lopes
Cabral of Guinea Bissau, the Security Council urgently called upon
leaders of the Afghan parties to renounce the use of force, to put
aside their differences and to engage in a political dialogue
aimed at achieving national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The council also called upon all states to refrain from
interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterates its grave concern about the military
confrontation in Afghanistan. It was also concerned at the
violation of the United Nations premises in Kabul and expressed
its dismay at the brutal execution by the Taliban of the former
President of Afghanistan, Najibullah, and others who had taken
refugue in these premises.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council demanded that all parties fulfill their
obligations and commitments regarding the safety of the United
Nations personnel and other international personnel in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>

promote peace in Afghanistan and to work together with the United

UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council met here Saturday in response to the emergency of the
clashes between the Palestinian and Israeli police, calling for an
earlier end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, Palestinian and Israeli army and police

<HEADLINE> G-24 Ministers Meeting Sees Global Prospect Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- G-24 ministers said that
global prospects were encouraging, with growth and price stability
in the industrial countries outside Europe, robust growth in many
of the developing countries in Asia and recovering in Latin
America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
A communique which was issued here today after the financial
ministers of the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Affairs held their 55th meeting
also noted that there were substantial downside risks to the
global expansion and that the external environment for developing
countries appeared less favorable than had been anticipated at
their previous meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called upon the industrial nations to take into
consideration their responsibility to provide growing markets for
developing countries' exports. Long-term interest rates remained
high in real terms in international capital markets, pointing to
the need for further progress in fiscal consolidation and more
flexible monetary policies in major industrial countries, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
G-24 ministers stressed that growth rates were still low in
many developing countries in view of the long periods of low or
negative per capita income growth rates in many African nations.
They called for a more supportive response by the international
community to the bold and far-reaching adjustment program being
carried out in Africa and other parts of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed the launching of the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and regarded it as a positive step
in enhancing global economic transparency. But they stressed that
the SDDS should focus on those countries that have the greatest
impact on the international economic environment, namely the
industrial countries and some large emerging market economies.
Many developing countries would need time and considerable
technical assistance from the IMF to be in a position to subscribe
to the SDDS.
</P>
<P>
About the assistance to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC), the G-24 ministers welcomed the leading role of the World
Bank in funding the HIPC Initiative and its initial contribution
of 500 million U.S. dollars, urging all other creditors to take
the necessary steps to finalize their funding arrangements by the
end of the year. They also called on the Paris Club to provide up
to 90 percent reduction of dbt stock on a net present value basis.
</P>
<P>
About the World Trade Organization (WTO), the ministers voiced
their support for the WTO to pursue cooperation agreements with
the World Bank and IMF to help developing countries take part in a
fast-globalizing economy, but also cautioned that coordination
between the WTO and other multilateral organizations should not
result in commercial considerations assuming primacy over
developmental objectives. Ministers underlined that "application
of unilateral trade restrictions on political grounds ran counter
to the spirit underlying the WTO framework."
</P>
<P>
The Group of 24 was formed at the 1972 Lima meeting of the
Group of 77 to represent the interests of the developing countries
in negotiations on international monetary matters. The group
comprises eight members from Africa, Asia and Latin America. China
is not a member of the Group, but attends G-24 meetings as an
invitee.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering Creation of African Standby Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to create a standby force of African troops to deal
with what it called humanitarian crises in Africa such as the
ongoing tribal warfare in Burundi and the civil war in Liberia,
U.S. officials have said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. senior officials have been consulting extensively with
European and African nations this week on the possible formation
of an "African Crisis Response Force", the officials said on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The issue is expected to be a main topic on the agenda of
Secretary of State Warren Christopher when he made a five-nation
visit to Africa early next month.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Angola and
South Africa, Christopher will discuss ways in which African
countries can respond more effectively the crisis situations on
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that planning for the force has been
accelerated by the ongoing crisis in Burundi, where tribal
warfare has led to the deaths of more than 150,000 people since
1993.
</P>
<P>
A civil war in Liberia has led to heavy loss of life since
1989 despite the presence of a West African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said a well-trained, well-equipped
force would have been far more effective in bringing about an
early solution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the manpower of the force would be
provided by African nations while donor nations would contribute
training, equipment and logistical help.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State George Moose and Susan Rice, the
National Security Council official in charge of Africa, are
discussing the Africa response force concept on an African trip
that including stops in Egypt, Tanzania, Gabon, Kenya, Uganda,
Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Ghana and Male, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Another team of U.S. officials has been discussing the same
issue with Britain, France, Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium
and Germany during their travel to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ethics Committee Deals with Gingrich, Gephardt Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The ethics committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives Saturday agreed to keep alive a
complaint that Speaker Newt Gingrich broke federal gift and
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee dismissed allegations of
financial irregularities by Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee dismissed allegations that Gingrich
improperly intervened with federal agencies on behalf of financial
supporters.
</P>
<P>
The committee action was seen as a compromise between
Democrats, who sought dismissal of the action against Gephardt,
and Republicans, who favored discharge of the complaint against
Gingrich. The panel has five members from each party.
</P>
<P>
The committee scolded Gephardt for waiting until last Friday to
amend his financial disclosure statements for 1991 and 1992, to
include a loan and rental income from a vacation home in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision means Gingrich will face ethics
inquiries on several fronts well into next year.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the committee broadened an outside counsel's
investigation of whether a college course taught by Gingrich was a
political activity that violated tax laws. Among the new subjects
in that inquiry: the accuracy of the speaker's statements to the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's decision involved a complaint filed by some
Democrats, that accused the speaker of improperly accepting
money from GOPAC, the political action committee he led from 1986
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, said, "As the ethics
process moves forward on the remaining baseless, politically
motivated charges, I am confident those allegations will be deemed
groundless by the committee."
</P>
<P>
While, Gephardt said the complaint filed against him was for
"transparently partisan and retaliatory purposes."
