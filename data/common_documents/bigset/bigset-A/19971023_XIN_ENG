<HEADLINE> Philippine Stocks Slide Sharply on Weak Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market fell
today on the third consecutive day due to concerns for poor
corporate earnings and the weakening local currency, with its main
index piercing through the resistance level of 1,950 points.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index (Phisix) shed
64.92 points or 3.26 percent to close at 1,928.97. The Phisix has
dropped a total of 121.91 points or 5.94 percent this week.

commercial and industrial sector posting the biggest decline of
65.76 points to end at 2,824. The property sector registered the
second biggest drop of 57.58 points to 855.07.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

concerns over poor corporate earnings for the third quarter and
the uncertainty over the Philippine peso.

The peso, which had managed to appreciate to less than 34 pesos
to one U.S. dollar last week, has again been weakening against the
U.S. dollar this week.

<HEADLINE> W. Bank Confident About Pakistan Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting World Bank President
James D. Wolfensohn today expressed his confidence in the economic
revival policies of the Pakistani government, saying the bank will
continue to support the country's structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The economic programs launched by the Pakistan government led
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif "are quite forward-looking" and the
bank is looking forward to long-term cooperation with it,
Wolfensohn told a news conference here before concluding a
five-day visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong feeling on our part (about the economic
policies) and now is the moment to give support the government who
appears to be trying to make a difference," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the economic measures as "dramatic and necessary
taken by the government to strengthen the banking sector" and
commended trade reforms and fiscal and monetary programs "for
regaining rapid economic growth."
</P>
<P>
This week's approval by the International Monetary Fund of a
soft loan of about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for Pakistan "is a
vote of confidence in Pakistan's economic management," Wolfensohn
said. "The challenge in future months and years is to sustain this
effort."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is planning to commit upwards of 800 million
U.S. dollars, 10 times more than last year, between now and June
1998, to support Pakistan's National Drainage Program, the second
Social Action Program Projects, and the banking sector reforms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank president also said he had discussed strategies
to reduce poverty and promote economic development with Prime
Minister Sharif and Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
At these discussions, Wolfensohn said, they agreed on the
outlines of an approach to future World Bank lending.
</P>
<P>
If the Pakistan government wishes, the bank would help Pakistan
develop long term programs in education, nutrition and rural
infrastructure, particularly rural roads, he added.

MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today
hinted that the standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party in
the 1998 presidential polls will be chosen among the party's seven
presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly news conference, Ramos said that "outsiders" have
a slim chance to get nominated because the ruling party will
"concentrate on insiders."
</P>
<P>
Among the ruling party, there are seven presidential contenders
trying to get the blessing of the president, who is ineligible to
run for re-election under the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven, top runners are Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia, Finance Secretary Roberto de
Ocampo, former defense secretary Renato de Villa and Ramos' sister
Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos suggested that it is likely for him to anoint an
"outsider" if none of the seven ruling party's presidential
hopefuls is believed to be able to beat opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the ruling party's presidential aspirants have
fared well in all kinds of opinion polls, which have always been
topped by proclaimed presidential contenders from the opposition
camp.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party earlier extended the deadline for outsiders to
join the group to November 9, when a nationwide consultation of
Lakas leaders and members will start on the nomination of the
presidential bet.
</P>
<P>
The consultation will guide Ramos, chairman of the governing
party, in choosing the party's presidential flag bearer for the
May 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is expected to announce his successor before November 27
when the united opposition, the Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses, is scheduled to declare their candidate. The president's
endorsement is estimated to be equal to at least 4 million votes.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the ruling party from breaking up, the seven
presidential contenders have been required to sign a covenant
committing their support to whoever is nominated by Ramos.

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Revenues to Reach 75 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The six countries of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) are expected to earn more than 75
billion U.S. dollars in oil revenues this year, experts said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil this year stands at 18-19 dollars per
barrel, and the GCC countries with a daily export of about 11.5
million barrels of oil can make more than 75 billion dollars in
the year, said Mohammed Hamdan, a prominent expert of the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company.
</P>
<P>
This implies that the GCC countries will be hit by a loss of
about 8 billion dollars in this year's oil revenues compared with
that in 1996, when the oil price was at 20 dollars per barrel,
Hamdan said.
</P>
<P>
However, this year's oil price has exceeded the commonly
expected 16.5 dollars per barrel by the GCC nations, leaving them
comfortable room to further cut their budget deficits, according
to an official of the Oil Ministry of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC countries, grouping Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, have nearly 45 percent of the
world's proven oil reserves and a daily output of about 13.5
million barrels.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unveils Incentives for Exploring Offshore Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
today unveiled a new incentive package to activate the petroleum
exploration in the country's offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
The package includes a low tax rate of 40 percent compared to
the existing tax capped at 50 percent under the concession system
and accelerated depreciation for capital facilities, a senior
official with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, the government will not share any rise in
the exploration or development but it will capture the revenues
through profit oil/profit gas on a slicing scale after recovery of
cost which has an upper limit of 85 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The package, which also includes payment or rentals, production
bonus, marine research fee as well as training obligations, would
be applicable for five years and would come into force immediately
after necessary changes are made in the relevant laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the new package will attract private
investment in the petroleum exploration in the offshore areas,
where no drilling activity has been undertaken for the last seven
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's indigenous supply of oil of around 60,000 barrels
per day meets only about one-sixth of the country's current oil
needs and the balance is met through imports at a high cost of 2.5
billion U.S. dollars, according to official statistics.

</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office said that
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah held talks with Hariri on a number of issues of
common interest, but it did not elaborate.
</P>

However, they are believed to have discussed bilateral
relations and the lastest situations in the Gulf and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Hariri extended congratulations to Sheikh Saad on his full
recovery from a colon operation, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad, who spent seven months abroad to recuperate from
the operation and just returned home last week, said Hariri's
visit "embodies the strong bonds of fraternity between the two
countries and their peoples."
</P>
<P>
During his short visit, Hariri was also greeted by Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.

<HEADLINE> Aid From Developed Countries to Africa Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Multi-lateral aid from
developed countries to Africa fell 22 percent between 1994 and
1995 and bilateral aid fell 14 percent, according to the latest
British magazine Economist.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the aid of the developed countries to poor countries
between 1994 and 1995 dropped nine percent in real term, a report
in the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
All big donors including Japan, the United States, Germany and
France have confirmed that the slide will continue.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of aid going to the poorest countries fell from
62 percent in 1990 to 51 percent in 1995. A smaller share of a
smaller cake, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The report says while it is true that there is a lot of
private capital going to the developing countries, only five
percent is going to Africa, mainly to mineral extraction which
bring little immediate benefit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank's statistics also shows the
declining trend. In 1996-97 the bank lent 1.74 billion U.S.
Dollars to sub-Saharan Africa, representing a 37 percent fall
from its previous year's loans and credits.
</P>
<P>
The bank's loans for education and health are down 43 percent
and 65 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report says rich countries are certainly giving less to
the poor countries, and least of all to the poorest.
</P>
<P>
In the sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 40 percent of the population
are poor, according to a U.N. report on human development issued
last June.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks aimed at putting
an end to the political crisis in Sierra Leone started in
Conakry, Guinea today between the ECOWAS committee of five and a
delegation of the military government of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is
represented by Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia
while the Sierra Leone junta has sent a 21-man delegation to the
meeting which arrived in the Guinean capital today.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS wants to use the talks to compel the junta to step
down and reinstate the legitimate government of President T.
Kabbah who was ousted by the junta in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
Initial talks broke down in July after junta leader Major
Johnny Paul Koroma declared that he would return democratic rule
to Sierra in four year's time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military officials in Kenema in eastern Sierra
Leone claimed today that a truck driver, Borbor James was shot
dead and two civilians seriously wounded in an ambush by Nigerian
troops in the ECOWAS at Bandama village on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said the commercial vehicle with 30 people
on board was passing through the village when it ran into the
ambush and the driver was shot in the head and died instantly.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists said the two seriously wounded victims,
Ibrahim Koroma, a diamond miner and businessman Fuad Bah are now
admitted at Bo Government Hospital and doctors said their
conditions remain serious.
</P>
<P>
West African Peace-keeping troops led by Nigerian soldiers are
in Freetown to implement ECOWAS' sanctions against the military
regime in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tension remains high in Kenema after Tuesday's
bombing by a Nigerian Alfa jet on two targets in Kenema which the
authorities said killed 20 civilians and a military captain.
</P>
<P>
Residents told Xinhua in a telephone interview, that
throughout last night, both Sierra Leone and Nigerian troops
traded heavy artillery fire from their positions. There were no
report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
According to a retired military officer in Kenema, "the
atmosphere is so tense that renewed fighting can break out at any
time."

BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's trade union
organizations have forged ties with counterparts in more than 140
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
According to information from an ongoing symposium on Chinese
and Africa trade union activities in the increasingly globalized
economy, some 150 foreign trade union delegations visit China each
year, with over 100 Chinese delegations travelling to more than 50

</P>
<P>
The symposium, jointly sponsored by the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (CFTU) and the Organization of African Trade Union
Unity (OATUU), opened in Beijing on October 17.
</P>
<P>
One CFTU official said that the international activities are an

union organization has been more active in the international arena
since the deepening of China's reform and opening effort.
</P>
<P>
The CFTU is striving to develop friendly relations with

<HEADLINE> Egypt Tight-lipped on Participation of Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will remain tight-lipped
on its participation in the November Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference (MENA) until three to four days before its
opening, President Hosni Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
"I will not disclose Egypt's final decision because if we
announce that we will not take part, Egypt will be accused of
making its decision too early and prodding others not to attend,"
today's London-based Arabic daily Al-Hayat quoted Mubarak as
saying in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"We will remain silent while watching the developments of the
Middle East peace process until the last moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Who knows we might witness a miracle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has hinged its participation in the controversial
conference, which is to be held in Doha, Qatar, on November 16-18,
on progress in the problematic Palestinian-Israeli peace track.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries like Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates as well as the Palestinian National Authority
have threatened to boycott the Israeli-attending conference in
protest against Israel's hardline policy towards the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, however, Cairo has voiced pessimism over the
prospects for any breakthrough in the ongoing U.S.-brokered
committee talks in the region -- the first Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations after seven months of deadlock -- and higher level
talks in Washington at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"What is the use of holding such a conference if every party is
turning its back against the other," Mubarak questioned.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disrespects the
signed agreements. How can we trust a man who does not honor his
word?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Washington should capitalize on its relationship with Israel to
give impetus to the peace process, Mubarak told Al-Hayat.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent bid to create a suitable atmosphere to convene
the MENA conference in time, the U.S. has sent its Mideast peace
envoy Dennis Ross to the region to speed up the work of the nine
committees haggling about outstanding issues from a 1995 interim
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president said that he fully agrees with King
Hussein of Jordan, who said recently that he has lost confidence
in Netanyahu but that the Israelis have to be won over to promote
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We have to deal with the Israeli people if it is peace we
see," he said, adding that peace is for both the Arabs and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Jordan announced its decision Monday to go to the conference
for regional economic cooperation that was initiated in 1994 as a
direct spinoff of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has invited 92 countries and organizations and expects
some 2,500 foreign participants to the annual gathering, the
fourth after the previous ones held in Casablanca, Amman and
Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for Special Programs for Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged other
ASEAN member countries to identify clear and specific programs for
rural development and poverty eradication in the region.
</P>
<P>
The rural development and poverty eradication committee under
the ASEAN Secretariat will have its functions streamlined so that
it has clear and specific programs to implement, Malaysian Rural
Development Minister Annuar Musa said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Rural development in ASEAN must be given the new push. We must
identify the right programs to facilitate such environments which
are conducive to faster development," he told reporters after
meeting officials from Brunei and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The officials are here to attend the inaugural meeting of ASEAN
Ministers on Rural Development and Eradication of Poverty which
begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to produce an agreement on forming a
permanent forum within the framework of ASEAN to discuss matters
on rural development and poverty eradication and a related action
plan, according to Malaysian officials of the rural development
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The minister said there was a common stand that the region must
be more aggressive in rural development and poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia and other member countries hoped for greater
cooperation at the officials' level and for exchange of ideas and
information among experts on rural development and poverty
eradication issues.
</P>
<P>
Meetings at the senior officials' level are progressing well,
he said, adding that it has been agreed that a meeting among rural
development experts would be held in December in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, he said no deadline should be imposed for poverty
eradication in the region as member countries should be allowed to
set a timeframe well-suited to their own countries' development.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets Higher Inflation Target for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
raised its inflation rate target for 1998 to 6.5 to 7 percent from
the original estimate of 5 to 5.5 percent, local television
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA), the country's planning agency, were quoted as explaining
that the adjustment was made due to several factors, including the
El Nino weather phenomenon and the current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the price of basic food items, which account for
58 percent of the consumer price index (CPI), is expected to be
brought about by a projected serious drought accompanying El Nino,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the El Nino phenomenon which is now being felt in
the country in the third quarter of this year is expected to
result in a shortage in the supply of food items, particularly
rice and corn, starting next year.
</P>
<P>
To avert the scarcity in the supply of rice, the government has
drawn up plans to import some 300,000 to 400,000 tons of rice by
the first half this year.
</P>
<P>
Wage adjustments and higher production cost, both a result of
the weakening peso, will likewise exert great pressure on prices.
Another inflationary factor is the country's presidential and
parliamentary elections scheduled for May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, a victim of the current Southeast Asian
currency turmoil, has tumbled more than 31 percent against the
U.S. dollar since its effective devaluation by the central bank in
July.
</P>
<P>
The peso was trading at an average rate of 34.66 pesos against
the dollar at today's Philippine Dealing System, the country's
official currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sliding peso and skyrocketing interest rates, the
government earlier scaled down its gross national product (GNP)
target for 1998 to 6.5 to 7.5 percent from the original projection
of 7.5 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) estimate for next year was
also revised down to 6 to 7 percent from the previous expectation
of 6.5 to 7.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders to Craft "2020 Vision" in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries will forge a new
"ASEAN 2020 vision" when they meet in December this year, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon was quoted
as saying that the updated ASEAN 2020 vision will guide the
regional grouping in the first decades of the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to that vision as the new embodiment of the
Southeast Asian community spirit for the new age," Siazon told
members of the ASEAN Standing Committee (ASC) who are attending
the on-going ASC meeting here.
</P>
<P>
ASC is the central coordinating organ of ASEAN. As the current
ASEAN chair, Siazon also chairs ASC whose members include the
director generals of all ASEAN national secretariats.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino is slated to
take over at the end of the year from Dato Ajit Singh of Malaysia
as new ASEAN Secretary General, a ministerial position he will
hold for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said ASEAN leaders expect ASEAN 2020 "to enunciate our
hope for a new Southeast Asian community whose political,
economic, cultural and moral influences are a positive and
constructive presence in the global scene in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, he added, hopes to see ASEAN grow into a
concert of Southeast Asian nations at peace within themselves,
with one another, and with the world; an economic commonwealth of
states that act together to secure prosperity for themselves at
the expense of no one.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, he said, has become what it is today, "model of regional
cooperation and consensus in the promotion of peace, stability and
prosperity" through three principles -- national and regional
resilience, unity in diversity and open regionalism.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Al-Itihad Proposes Peace Talk With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Fundamentalist
group of Al-Itihad today proposed to hold peace talks with
Ethiopia in a bid to settle the crisis in Somalia's southwestern
border region of Gedo.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, the most hard-line Islamist organization in
Somalia has offered a peaceful settlement between it and the
allied forces of Ethiopia along with the armed group from the
Marehan Somali National Front faction (SNF) led by former defense
minister General Omar Hagi Masalle.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by five top Al-Itihad men including
Chairman Sheikh Mohamed Hagi Yussuf and it proposed that the
conflict be solved through a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Itihad is ready to meet, talk and negotiate with anyone
representing our rival sides," said the three-page statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Al-Itihad has condemned Ethiopia's alleged continuing
military occupation of parts of Somalia and called on the
Ethiopian government to pull its troops out of Bulo Hawo, Dolow
and Luq towns of Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
The organization has not set any time or venue for the
proposed talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Al-Itihad said they will morally and materially support a
lasting solution to ending the hostility in the region, but added
that a total withdrawal of Ethiopian forces could be a major step
toward a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
This peace appeal was unexpected in consideration of the stiff
and extreme position of Al-Itihad regarding the conflict in Gedo
region.
</P>
<P>
The region has been quiet since the forces of Al-Itihad were
forcefully driven out of the area in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has denied any military presence in the region, but
independent sources and international aid workers and the
chairman of SNF himself have clarified the involvement of
Ethiopian forces in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
In an early interview, Chairman of SNF Masalle admitted that
he had invited the Ethiopian forces to help him in eradicating
the Moslem fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad which had controlled
the area.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia itself has accused Al-Itihad of carrying out
terrorist activities inside Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Males Zenawi, the Ethiopian Prime Minister warned that his
forces will strike wherever the Al-Itihad forces might go to.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the only faction that Al-Itihad had got some
sympathy from became the faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid who
in turn accused Ethiopia of backing his political rivals.
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Council formed in Sodare of Ethiopia
has firmly stood against Al-Itihad and Hussein Aidid's position
toward Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Instead it called on them to attend what they called the
upcoming national reconciliation conference anticipated to take
place in the northwestern town of Bossaso in early November.

<HEADLINE> 4 Kilo of Cocaine Seized in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African narcotics
bureau detectives today netted four kilogram of cocaine with an
estimated street value of 1.2 million Rand (255,000 U.S. Dollars)
at an airport here, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
A member of the bureau, Jaco Koen, said it was the largest
amount of cocaine captured in more than three months.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was found in four tins of baby food in the baggage
of a woman passenger who had arrived from Sao Paulo, Brazil at
around noon at Johannesburg International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Police acted on a profile drawn up about a possible smuggler
and pounced after the woman went through customs, Koen said.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine coming into the country was usually about 90 percent
pure before it would be cut with other chemicals and distributed,
Koen said.
</P>
<P>
The drug could be multiplied by seven times before
distribution, which means that today's haul could have been sold
for 8.4 million Rand (1.8 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The largest amount of cocaine seized so far by police at the
airport came last year, when police netted 21 kilograms with an
estimated value of 6.3 million Rand (1.3 million Dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela arrived in Tripoli today for a visit to Libya during which
he will hold talks with Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi mainly on
bilateral political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Libya is the second leg of Mandela's north Africa tour, which
has taken him to Egypt and will also cover Tunisia and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's tour is aimed at promoting trade and military
cooperation and the exchange of views on other humanitarian
issues, including the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's visit to Libya has aroused criticism from the United
States, but the South African leader considered it beyond
anyone's right to define which countries to visit or not to visit.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, who was accompanying
Mandela during his visit to Egypt, called Tuesday in Cairo for the
immediate lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an air ban on Libya in 1992
to force the surrender of two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.

<HEADLINE> US Oil Companies Fare Well in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil Companies in the United
States reported profits increases this summer because of a roughly
3.5 percent growth in demand compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Big companies like Exxon, Texaco and Amoco saw robust
third-quarter earnings as reflected in their reports released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their net income rose 16.7 percent, 12.9 percent and 18 percent
respectively over the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of other major oil companies are also expected to show
higher earnings for the quarter, having run their refineries at
full capacity to meet the surge in demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the business boom to the decline in crude
oil prices, heavy vacation driving and growing tendency of
customers to buy sport vehicles consuming more gas instead of
conventional cars.
</P>
<P>
However, they warn that it may be difficult for the rest of the
year to see such a surge to sustain as a recent rise in crude oil
prices has a negative impact on refining profit in the first weeks
of the new quarter.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Concept Yields Wondrous  Prospects: Cazalet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The operation of "one country,
two systems" between China and Hong Kong has yielded some wondrous
prospects after China's resumption of Hong Kong's sovereignty on
July 1, said Sir Peter Cazalet, president of China Britain Trade
Group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here today, Cazalet said, "I do not wish
to dwell on the past but to look at the future. As the title of
this seminar suggests, it is the future that interests us all the
most."
</P>
<P>
The seminar dealt in detail with issues relating to the
historic event, including Hong Kong's financial autonomy after the
handover, its role as a springboard into China and the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Cazalet stressed the enormous combined economic potential of a
China reintegrated with Hong Kong by quoting a research by Boeing
as saying that "over the next decade, China and Hong Kong between
them will buy 1,900 commercial aircraft at a cost of about 124
billion US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Not only will this make China the world's largest market for
commercial aircraft, but "I am right in saying that orders on this
scale are unprecedented anywhere, any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Cazalet said it is the most significant event to have happened in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the pronouncements by Chinese leaders "have
put beyond any doubt whatsoever China's intended path to become an
increasingly open, market-driven economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British relations in future, Cazalet said, "The prime
minister, the foreign secretary and the president of the Board of
Trade are all due to visit China in 1998."
</P>
<P>
"This sends exactly the right signal to China about the
importance the UK attaches to its relationship with China," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged Not to Send Delegation to Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON October 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaok has urged Nigeria, whose Commonwealth
membership has been suspended, not to send a delegation to the
Edinburgh Commonwealth Summit to be held later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief made the appeal a day after the Nigerian
government demanded a hearing when Commonwealth leaders discuss
Nigeria's suspended membership.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth spokesman Michael Fathers was quoted by the
Reuters as saying today, "He (Anyaok) sent a letter today to
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi strongly urging that no
Nigerian delegation should travel to Edinburgh."
</P>
<P>
"The letter points out that as Nigeria is suspended it cannot
participate in Commonwealth meetings. Nigeria's attendance would
require the agreement of all participants of the meeting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister said in a letter to Anyaoku that
"Nigeria should not be tried in absentia. We have therefore
concluded arrangements in Nigeria for our delegation to fly direct
from Abuja straight to Edinburgh" when the Commonwealth discusses

<HEADLINE> Yabloko May Drop No-Confidence to Government:  Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Yabloko faction
would drop its no-confidence motion against the government if it
went through the problem of the taxation code to the end, leader
of the Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky told reporters that the document which his faction
considered to be "senseless and harmful" should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile voiced the strong doubt that Sergei Baburin
representing the People's Power bloc in parliament would collect
the necessary number of signatures to initiate a no-confidence
motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko leader noted that once the head of the government
had recalled the taxation code from the Duma, "the issue of no
confidence would have died without any concessions to communists."
</P>
<P>
If the premier of the government did not withdraw the tax code,
he added, the code's handling under the Duma's procedure would
only result in "protracting this issue."
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Igor Shabdurasulov, a government
senior spokesman, today criticized the manner of Yavlinsky as
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He told Itar-Tass in an interview that only an investigator had
the right to demand only a concrete `yes' or `no' answer to a
question, and not the leader of the Duma faction who was trying to
teach the chairman of the government how to fulfill orders of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday sent a message to Duma
faction leaders, which contained an instruction to the government
to withdraw a draft tax code from the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Communist faction, the largest in the lower house
of parliament, today withdrew its motion of no-confidence in the
government.

<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today expressed satisfaction over the statements
made by U.S. special presidential emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke on the Turkish harassment of Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos' plane last week.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Tuesday that the harassment of a plane carrying
Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus last week was a fact, blaming
the U.S. State Department for not recognizing it outright.
</P>
<P>
Greece had kept the positive positions expressed and recorded
the negative ones, Reppas said. "What now remains to be seen is
how Washington will proceed concerning issues which are in

practical consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos today welcomed Holbrooke's
statements, saying that Holbrooke was near to the reality and
"this confirms his credibility as a mediator."
</P>

Greece strongly condemned the statements by U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin as "unprecedented and

Late Monday, Rubin said that Tsohatzopoulos' flight to Cyprus

<HEADLINE> US Oil Companies Fare Well in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil Companies in the United
States reported profits increases this summer because of a roughly
3.5 percent growth in demand compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Big companies like Exxon, Texaco and Amoco saw robust
third-quarter earnings as reflected in their reports released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their net income rose 16.7 percent, 12.9 percent and 18 percent
respectively over the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of other major oil companies are also expected to show
higher earnings for the quarter, having run their refineries at
full capacity to meet the surge in demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the business boom to the decline in crude
oil prices, heavy vacation driving and growing tendency of
customers to buy sport vehicles consuming more gas instead of
conventional cars.
</P>
<P>
However, they warn that it may be difficult for the rest of the
year to see such a surge to sustain as a recent rise in crude oil
prices has a negative impact on refining profit in the first weeks
of the new quarter.

<HEADLINE> US Stresses Need for Political Process in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. diplomat
underlined here today the need to concentrate on the political
process for a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill was commenting on the
statements made by U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke, who criticized Tuesday the U.S. State Department for
not accepting that Turkish aircraft harassed the plane of the
Greek defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
Brill told reporters that Holbrooke expressed his views very
clearly, but "I think that we all want to move on from this and
start engaging in constructive activity."
</P>
<P>
The U.S., he said, wants to promote a negotiating process and
get people to focus on the core political issues and not on
military activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for very serious work and time to take advantage
of some of the opportunities that are out there, particularly
next year," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is determined on finding a way to move the Cyprus
issue forward for a settlement in a constructive political sense,
Brill noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.S. considered there was a moratorium of
flights over Cyprus, which ended with the overflights during the
annual military exercise Cyprus conducted on October 10-14, with
the participation of the Greek armed forces.
</P>
<P>
But Cyprus Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday,
clarifying that "there has never been an agreement for a
moratorium of overflights in Cyprus' sovereign airspace."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
over this eastern Mediterranean island.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police succeeded in
averting a bus bombing attack in southeastern Turkey today, the
Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
A militant of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) was
captured when he tried to implant a bomb in a police vehicle in
Elazig city, some 540 kilometers southeast of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The bomb is very powerful, Elazig Governor Luffullah Bilgin was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PKK member, a post worker, admitted that he has provided
clothes, communication equipments and other necessities to the PKK
rebels in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which is reportedly trying to build new bases in
the Black Sea region, carried out a series of actions over
the past weeks, including abduction of civilians, sudden attacks
on military posts and police vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Governors, police chiefs and gendarmerie commanders of 10
Black Sea cities will meet Saturday in Giresun town to discuss
effective ways of combating the PKK activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government since 1984
for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Liberalize Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official here
today urged members of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) to pursue liberalization of insurance industry
cautiously to avoid proliferation of under-capitalized insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey
Simasiku while opening the one-day 11th meeting of the Council of
Bureaux on regional third party motor vehicle insurance scheme.
</P>
<P>
Simasiku told participants that governments must ensure that
sound insurance legislation and supervision are in place and that
regulatory and supervisory authorities are equipped with
technical capacity to ensure that emerging insurance companies
have adequate capital and that they are solvent.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Simasiku also urged insurance companies in the
region to engage in cross-border investments as a means of
increasing their service capacity.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which originated from a preferential trade area for
the region in 1993 and now groups 20 countries, aims to achieve a
full free trade area by 2000, a customs union with a zero tariff
on products produced within the common market and freedom of
movement of people.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Air Force T-38 Talon jet
trainer crashed today after an in-flight collision with an F-16
Fighting Falcon fighter jet at Edwards Air Base in southern
California, the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 crashed shortly after the midair collision at Edwards
Air Force Base at 10 a.m. local time (1700 GMT) and the F-16 has
reportedly landed, but there is no immediately report on the
status of the crews, said an Air Force statement released at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 is a two-seater training jet, and the F-16 is a
single-seat jet.
</P>
<P>
The incident came just weeks after Secretary of Defense William
Cohen ordered all the services to perform safety "stand-downs" and
review their training procedures after a rash of air crashes.
</P>
<P>
On September 13, an Air Force C-141 transport crashed off the
coast of Africa. The next day, an F-117A Stealth fighter broke up
in flight at an air show in Maryland. The day after that a Navy
F-18 went down in Oman, and a Marine Corps F-18 crashed off North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, two planes from the New Jersey Air National Guard
collided off the New Jersey coast.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has always
maintained that there is only one China in the world, Tanzanian
Prime Minister F. Sumaye said today.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong and
the Taiwan problem will be surely solved.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye made the remarks when he met Chinese ambassador to
Tanzania, Zhang Hongxi, in his office in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the friendship between Tanzania and China has a
long history and the relations between the two peoples are close.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Tanzania earlier this year
has further strengthened the relations of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said that in the new situation, economic cooperation
between the two countries has further widened and Tanzania has
confidence in Chinese friends.
</P>
<P>
While implementing a policy of openness and liberalization in
the economic field, Tanzania welcomes Chinese companies to come
to invest in agriculture, tourism, industry, mining and
infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
This kind of cooperation benefits both countries, the
Tanzanian prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, representatives of the two countries signed a
handover certificate for donation of the Chinese government to
the Tanzanian government to express the sympathy of the Chinese
government and people to the Tanzanian people for the food
shortage caused by serious drought Tanzania has experienced in
the past months.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has blamed Germany for the failure of the return to
Tehran of the European Union members' ambassadors, Iran's official
news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Kharrazi as saying that Germany is responsible for
the existing problems and for failure of the efforts to solve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran has done its utmost and has no new proposals in this
regard at the moment, Kharrazi said in response to a recent
statement by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said Germany will not accept discriminatory conditions
and that talks will be held with Iran only when disputes are
resolved.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists that EU members' ambassadors can return to Tehran,
but the German envoy must be the last to be back.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was quoted as saying that "Kinkel has lost valuable
opportunities and I do not think that time would work in Germany's
favor."
</P>
<P>
Iran is an independent country, whose foreign policies are made
in accordance with its national interest, he added.
</P>
<P>
EU's 15 members, except Greece, called back their ambassadors
in Tehran after a German court ruled last April that Iranian
leaders ordered the 1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents in
Berlin.

<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The operation of "one country,
two systems" between China and Hong Kong has yielded some wondrous
prospects after China's resumption of Hong Kong's sovereignty on
July 1, said Sir Peter Cazalet, president of China Britain Trade
Group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here today, Cazalet said, "I do not wish
to dwell on the past but to look at the future. As the title of
this seminar suggests, it is the future that interests us all the
most."
</P>
<P>
The seminar dealt in detail with issues relating to the
historic event, including Hong Kong's financial autonomy after the
handover, its role as a springboard into China and the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Cazalet stressed the enormous combined economic potential of a
China reintegrated with Hong Kong by quoting a research by Boeing
as saying that "over the next decade, China and Hong Kong between
them will buy 1,900 commercial aircraft at a cost of about 124
billion US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Not only will this make China the world's largest market for
commercial aircraft, but "I am right in saying that orders on this
scale are unprecedented anywhere, any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Cazalet said it is the most significant event to have happened in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the pronouncements by Chinese leaders "have
put beyond any doubt whatsoever China's intended path to become an
increasingly open, market-driven economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British relations in future, Cazalet said, "The prime
minister, the foreign secretary and the president of the Board of
Trade are all due to visit China in 1998."
</P>
<P>
"This sends exactly the right signal to China about the
importance the UK attaches to its relationship with China," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Satisfied With Holbrooke's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today expressed satisfaction over the statements
made by U.S. special presidential emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke on the Turkish harassment of Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos' plane last week.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Tuesday that the harassment of a plane carrying
Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus last week was a fact, blaming
the U.S. State Department for not recognizing it outright.
</P>
<P>
Greece had kept the positive positions expressed and recorded
the negative ones, Reppas said. "What now remains to be seen is
how Washington will proceed concerning issues which are in
progress and whether Mr. Holbrooke's observations will have
practical consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos today welcomed Holbrooke's
statements, saying that Holbrooke was near to the reality and
"this confirms his credibility as a mediator."
</P>
<P>
Greece strongly condemned the statements by U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin as "unprecedented and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, Rubin said that Tsohatzopoulos' flight to Cyprus
for military exercises was "an overflight that violated an agreed
up moratorium."

<HEADLINE> Yabloko May Drop No-Confidence to Government:  Faction Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Yabloko faction
would drop its no-confidence motion against the government if it
went through the problem of the taxation code to the end, leader
of the Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky told reporters that the document which his faction
considered to be "senseless and harmful" should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile voiced the strong doubt that Sergei Baburin
representing the People's Power bloc in parliament would collect
the necessary number of signatures to initiate a no-confidence
motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko leader noted that once the head of the government
had recalled the taxation code from the Duma, "the issue of no
confidence would have died without any concessions to communists."
</P>
<P>
If the premier of the government did not withdraw the tax code,
he added, the code's handling under the Duma's procedure would
only result in "protracting this issue."
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Igor Shabdurasulov, a government
senior spokesman, today criticized the manner of Yavlinsky as
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He told Itar-Tass in an interview that only an investigator had
the right to demand only a concrete `yes' or `no' answer to a
question, and not the leader of the Duma faction who was trying to
teach the chairman of the government how to fulfill orders of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday sent a message to Duma
faction leaders, which contained an instruction to the government
to withdraw a draft tax code from the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Communist faction, the largest in the lower house
of parliament, today withdrew its motion of no-confidence in the
government.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged Not to Send Delegation to Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON October 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaok has urged Nigeria, whose Commonwealth
membership has been suspended, not to send a delegation to the
Edinburgh Commonwealth Summit to be held later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief made the appeal a day after the Nigerian
government demanded a hearing when Commonwealth leaders discuss
Nigeria's suspended membership.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth spokesman Michael Fathers was quoted by the
Reuters as saying today, "He (Anyaok) sent a letter today to
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi strongly urging that no
Nigerian delegation should travel to Edinburgh."
</P>
<P>
"The letter points out that as Nigeria is suspended it cannot
participate in Commonwealth meetings. Nigeria's attendance would
require the agreement of all participants of the meeting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister said in a letter to Anyaoku that
"Nigeria should not be tried in absentia. We have therefore
concluded arrangements in Nigeria for our delegation to fly direct
from Abuja straight to Edinburgh" when the Commonwealth discusses
the Nigeria issue.

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Air Force T-38 Talon jet
trainer crashed today after an in-flight collision with an F-16
Fighting Falcon fighter jet at Edwards Air Base in southern
California, the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 crashed shortly after the midair collision at Edwards
Air Force Base at 10 a.m. local time (1700 GMT) and the F-16 has
reportedly landed, but there is no immediately report on the
status of the crews, said an Air Force statement released at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 is a two-seater training jet, and the F-16 is a
single-seat jet.
</P>
<P>
The incident came just weeks after Secretary of Defense William
Cohen ordered all the services to perform safety "stand-downs" and
review their training procedures after a rash of air crashes.
</P>
<P>
On September 13, an Air Force C-141 transport crashed off the
coast of Africa. The next day, an F-117A Stealth fighter broke up
in flight at an air show in Maryland. The day after that a Navy
F-18 went down in Oman, and a Marine Corps F-18 crashed off North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, two planes from the New Jersey Air National Guard
collided off the New Jersey coast.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton are hoping a White House
conference will raise awareness of the need for higher quality
child care.
</P>
<P>
In previewing the first-ever White House Conference on Child
Care to be held Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said today the meeting
would examine the full range of available options.
</P>
<P>
While promising the president would announce some policy moves,
including the possibility of federal subsidies in the future, she
said that much of the job, including licensing and training, falls
to the states and private industry.
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said it
wasn't really a question of needing a lot more cash and often
small amounts of training or harsher licensing requirements showed
marked improvements.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton was "very
keen on stimulating a national discussion," and that the first
couple hoped the meeting "will call national attention to an issue
policymakers historically have ignored."
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of American families with young children use
some form of child care and most are not pleased with it,
according to a Parents Magazine poll released today.
</P>

The random poll of some 2,000 parents generated 450 responses

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Begins Talks With S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Sierra Leone's
military junta and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) on resolving the crisis in the country started this
evening in Conakry, capital of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting are the delegation of soldiers and
civilians sent by the junta, foreign ministers from Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, Cote d'ivoire and Liberia, as well as
representatives from the Organization of African Unity and the
United Nations, according to the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the two sides over the restoration of
Sierra Leone's legitimate government led by president Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah broke down in July this year when the junta announced to
stay in power until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the talks followed a UN sanctions against
the junta announced a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the junta was reported to have expressed
willingness to resume talks for several times.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional organization ECOWAS answered the call ten
days ago on conditions that the junta must negotiate in good
faith and the talks should strictly be within the mandate of
ECOWAS and the UN Security Council, which focuses on the junta's
immediate quit and return of power to the ousted government of
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The progress at the on-going negotiation is not yet available
at the movement but it is widely expected that the resumption of
the talks will help break the political impasse over the crisis
in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> SAP Profits Soar by 86 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading software company
SAP AG today reported its pre-tax profits soared by 86 percent to
251 million marks (140 million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The German company is expecting continued good performance in
the fourth quarter and the pre-tax profits for the year to hit a
record of about 1.5 billion marks (837 million dollars), up 50
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The good news today sent SAP shares up 4.3 percent to close at
526 marks (293 dollars).
</P>
<P>
SAP attributed the explosive growth to the current strong
demand for standard software products R/2 and R/3 and the
continuing strength of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, data showed that the company gained
833 million marks (465 million dollars) in pre-tax profits, up
almost one-third over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The result was achieved on turnover of 3.8 billion marks (2.12
billion dollars), up 61 percent from the same period last year.
The figure was compared with a total of 3.7 billion marks 2.06
billion dollars) for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The German information technology firm said it expected that it
could get a listing on the United States stock market in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
SAP, specializing in software used for running businesses, has
registered remarkable growth over recent years. It is Europe's
biggest and most profitable software makers and the only
non-American player among the world's top five software companies.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in rural Walldorf, will have 12,800
employees at the end of this year, compared with 9,200 at the end
of 1996.

JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The influence of external

Southern African Development Community (SADC) Executive

<P>
He said there had been for too long the involvement of
external forces in the affairs of that country.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that at an appropriate time, once the political
situation has been stabilized, we can take stock of what
transpired, as we are now doing in South Africa," Mbuende said in
Botswana.
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Kaire Mbuende, the
executive secretary of the South African Development Community
(SADC) said today it is still possible that a government of
national unity might be formed in the Republic of Congo.
</P>

Last week, forces of Congo's rebel leader Dennis Sassou
Nguesso, backed by Angolan troops, took control of the country's

<P>
"It is a deplorable situation that we had a change of
government in this way," Mbuende told a press briefing, quoted by
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
"I like to believe that the time has come for Africa to change
its governments only through elections."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there is still hope for a government of
national unity in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are informed that all is not lost. there are ongoing
negotiations... there is the possibility of creating a government
of national unity and paving the way for elections."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Violation of Cypriot Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today rebuffed the
Cypriot accusation that Turkish military jets violated the
airspace of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing here, Turkish Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Omer Akbel said that Turkish aircraft have been flying
over the area without breaking any international rules.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, it is the Greek side that violated an
agreement banning flights of warplanes in military exercises, "
Akbel said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's remarks followed the Cypriot government's
Tuesday protest against the alleged Turkish military jets'
violation of Cypriot airspace
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the United Nations Security Council,
Cyprus said that Turkey's provocative military flights "cause
serious concern and heighten tensions in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Turkish relations have been worsening since the
Cypriot government affirmed that it would not give up the plan to
deploy S-300 missiles purchased from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus held a military exercise codenamed "Victory '97" from
October 10 to 14, with the participation of Greek air and
naval forces.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Turkish forces and Turkish Cypriot militia have
announced that they will stage joint war games early next month.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish military jets had met in the air but nothing
serious took place.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
 landed and took over the northern third of it in the wake of an
aborted coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community efforts to solve the
problem have failed due to the differences between the rival
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Decline on Wall Street, Hong Kong Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all fell heavily Wednesday, undermined by UK's uncertain position
on the European single currency, profit- taking on Wall Street and
continued big fall in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index on the London market suffered the steepest
decline in two months and ended 77.1 points lower at 5,148.8 amid
a sharp downturn in index futures.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that weakness on Wall Street, heavy selling in
Singapore and further jitters in Hong Kong also weighed on market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The index was dragged down by a sharp fall of shares of Hong
Kong-linked firms such as HSBC Holdings, Cable &AMP; wireless and
Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
Subdued retail sales figures in September failed to cheer the
market as the figures were clouded by several factors, including
the impact of shops closing for the funeral of Diana, Princess of
Wales.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt failed to sustain its early gains
and ended well below their best levels as traders reported
disappointment at low volumes and a weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index closed up 31.95 points at 4,171.45. However,
in later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,124.86,
47.61 points lower.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris dropped back below the 3,000 level to
end 31.83 points down at 2,958.06. Concerns about the near-term
outlook for European interest rates and weak bonds weighed on the
market.

UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- As the world was
developing towards globalization and integration, the varieties of
cultures should be respected, Chinese delegate Cui Ying said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Cui said culture had been playing a more and more important role
in the international relations and the international society had
attached greater importance to the relationship between culture
and development.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the world was so colorful because all countries and
nationalities had their own cultures. Exchanges of cultures
between different countries had reached an unprecedented level in
depth and width.
</P>
<P>
Cui said culture and development were interdependent. Culture
reflected a country's fundamental characteristics of economy and
politics and it helped to promote the development of economy and
politics.
</P>
<P>
Cui said UNESCO would hold its 29th session soon. China hoped
that the session would recommend measures for the further
development of culture in the future.

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of

The House approved the legislation by voice vote to keep the

Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the U.S. Senate probably

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Charlene Barshefsky, the

the application for Aetna to operate a joint venture insurance
operation in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Office of U.S. Trade Representative said
confirmation of the action on Aetna's application came at a

Delegation, a group of high level officials visiting this country
to seek commercial contracts with U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many U.S. firms have already established
representative offices in China, but they have not been permitted
to open business operations there. Aetna, the third largest
insurance company for life and health in the United States in
1996, becomes the second U.S. insurer to operate in China.
</P>
<P>
"Aetna is one of a number of U.S. insurance companies which
have been seeking a license to enter the large China market for

an economy as large and competitive as China's must undertake
further substantial market-opening actions, including in the
insurance and financial services sectors."

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States was
concerned on Wednesday that Turkish fighter jets had buzzed the
plane of the Greek defense minister on his way back from military
exercises over Cyprus.

"We have made clear to our Turkish allies the seriousness with

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
intended to use a de facto cease-fire among warring factions in
Afghanistan to step up efforts for a negotiated peace, a senior
U.S. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian
Affairs, told a Senate foreign relations subcommittee that U.S.
officials had talked with Russia, China and four other nations
bordering Afghanistan to determine ways to progress toward an
accord. And Britain and Japan will also be involved, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that any side can win a military victory,"
Inderfurth said. "In our view all sides must recognize the
futility of fighting."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is neutral in the Afghanistan
conflict but wants a multiparty government to emerge from any
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While Inderfurth mentioned a "faint hope" for peace, another
witness, Zalmay Khalilzad, an analyst with the Rand Corp., said
prospects are not good. Part of the problem, he said, is the
Taliban, bent on a military victory, will not make a realistic
assessment of its recent setbacks and the resulting stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Taliban, which controls three-quarters of
Afghanistan, lost a key northern town to an opposition coalition.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: SAR Government Determined to Defend HK Dollar  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has said it is determined
to maintain the stable status of the Hong Kong dollar, despite the
continuing fall of the local share market in the past four days.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong's stock market plunged today for the fourth day
this week, shedding 1,211 points to close at 10,426. On Wednesday,
the Hang Seng Index, the key indicator of the Hong Kong stock
market, closed at 11,637, down 765 points, the lowest finish since
April this year.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters in London today, Chief Executive of the SAR
Tung Chee Hwa said his government was "tremendously" determined to
defend the stable status of the Hong Kong dollar and maintain its
peg to the U.S. dollar, or the linked exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"We have every confidence this can be done and will be done.
The fundamentals in Hong Kong are very good," Tung said. "We have
very conservative management of our fiscal policy, we are running
a huge budget surplus, we have a fiscal reserve of over 50 billion
U.S. dollars, foreign exchange reserves over 85 billion U.S.
dollars, one of the largest anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized: "We are determined to maintain the exchange rate
mechanism and to do this we have signalled to the market our
determination, the interest rate has gone up and as a result of
that there is a short-term repercussion on the stock market, and
this is to be expected."
</P>
<P>
Before attending a meeting of the Provisional Legislative
Council here today, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan told
reporters: "I advise everybody to stay calm." "I would only stress
that the market is operating normally," she said.
</P>
<P>
"You want to buy, you want to sell and that's the way it should
be," Chan pointed out. "Of course, Hong Kong cannot escape being
affected in the short-term by what's happening in the region. But
the important thing is that our economic fundamentals remain very
strong and we have absolute determination to defend the Hong Kong
dollar."
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the determination of the SAR government to defend
the Hong Kong dollar, Financial Secretary of the SAR government
Donald Tsang today described it as the top priority now to defend
the linked exchange rate.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Draws up Action Plan for Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The seven member countries of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have
drawn up an action plan for the transition to a South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) by 2001, the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat
said today.
</P>
<P>
The action plan will serve as a blueprint for successive rounds
of trade negotiations by the SAARC's Inter-Governmental Group on
Trade Liberalization, the secretariat said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The second meeting of the SAARC's Inter-Governmental Expert
Group (IGEG) on Transition to SAFTA also finalized the terms of
reference of an in-depth Regional Study on the implications to the
member states of progression from the South Asian Preferential
Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) to SAFTA, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Study will identify all non-tariff barriers in
this process, discriminatory practices and implications of revenue
losses and trade imbalances among the SAARC member countries, said
the press release.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 representatives from the SAARC member countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka -- attended the three-day meeting which concluded today at
the SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The IGEG will meet again in January 1998, the press release
said.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: SAR Government Determined to Defend HK Dollar  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Together with several other senior SAR financial officials, he
told a news conference that the stock market could return to
normal only after the stabilization of the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
In general, Hong Kong's economy remains stable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Today's stock market drop followed three days of steep falls,
with investors gripped by panic selling on fears of higher
interest rates and currency instability.
</P>
<P>
The market has been further weakened mainly by selling
pressures from overseas and domestic funds managers and by renewed
currency volatility in the Asia-Pacific region, analysts here
said.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the main reason for today's fall
appeared to be a huge rise in short-term interbank rates here.
Banks here announced earlier today that their prime rate would
rise by 0.75 of a percentage point to 9.5 percent from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hike appeared designed to head off borrowing for
speculative attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) triggered
panic selling earlier today when it stopped normal rate finance
for banks which it suspected were using the money for attacks on
the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speculators have been blamed for slumps in the value of several
Southeast Asian currencies following the float of the Thai baht in
July, but Hong Kong had largely been spared the turbulence until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the SAR government was hoping to starve
speculators of funds to ease pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar is the only Asian currency still pegged to
the U.S. dollar. Several other Asian currencies have plunged since
July in a wave of turmoil sweeping markets from Indonesia and
Malaysia to Singapore and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Questioned by reporters about the tumbling stock market, Tsang
said today: "I am not worried at all, because it is a market. A
market, of course, depends on the sentiments," he said. "I don't
think it is a matter for people to panic about, but I believe very
strongly in defending our dollar."
</P>
<P>
He is of the view that Hong Kong's companies are still making
good profits and they are turning in good dividends for the
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who is in London for a visit, added that he believed the
stock market was sound and would eventually correct itself.
</P>
<P>
"All our major companies have very good performance, the growth
in profits is all double-digit, and the fundamentals again are
very good, basically because the Hong Kong economy is good," he
said. "And there is some short-term impact on the stock but we are
quite sure the market will find the right level and we are very
confident of our future."
</P>
<P>
As another step in fighting the speculators, the HKMA announced
tonight that the official foreign exchange reserves of the SAR,
including those held in the Land Fund, stood at 88.1 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now the world's third largest holder of foreign
reserves after Japan and the interior areas of China, the HKMA
noted.

<HEADLINE> White House Holds Conference on Child Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he intends to work out a plan by January that would
improve day care for children with the help of businesses and
schools.
</P>
<P>
"I want to have a proposal laid out in the State of the Union
to expand the quality and portability of child care," Clinton said
on ABC's "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
The Clintons are holding a conference today focusing on the
issues of cost and quality of child care without offering any
sweeping federal initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to boost quality without increasing the price
tag.
</P>
<P>
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton called day care a "silent
crisis" and urged states and local communities to find solutions.
</P>
<P>
"Every national survey demonstrates what we have to recognize:
Too much of our child care is not adequate. There are too many
situations that don't even meet basic standards," said Mrs.
Clinton on "Good Morning America."
</P>
<P>
The president added that he wants businesses to help employees
secure child care and schools to keep their buildings open after
classes.
</P>
<P>
During a preview of the conference for reporters Wednesday, the
first lady said any program for improving child care should
include help for stay-at-home moms.

<HEADLINE> Syria: Primakov's Visit Aims to Save Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeni Primakov's forthcoming visit to Syria, due to start next
Saturday, is intended to save the stumbling Middle East peace
process, Syria's official SANA news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's Mideast tour which will also take him to Lebanon,
Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the Gaza Strip, the agency quoted Syrian
official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the sources said, is a fresh effort by Russia -- a
co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process along with the U.S. --
to save and stimulate the peace process which has been in a crisis
blamed on Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Damascus Victor Goguitidze announced
Wednesday evening that Primakov's forthcoming visit to Syria is
designed to contribute to the efforts to revive the Middle East
peace process, to promote Russian-Syrian bilateral ties and to
examine some international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador called for resuming the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks from the point at which they came to a halt on the
basis of the 1991 Madrid conference principles, the principle of
land-for-peace, and the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242,
338 and 425, which demand Israel's withdrawal from the occupied
Arab territories.

<HEADLINE> American Team Arrives in Guilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A team of US experts is
preparing to reexamine the wreckage of a US B-24 bomber that
crashed during the Second World War in south China.
</P>
<P>
The team organized by the US Defense Department, arrived this
afternoon in Guilin, a picturesque city in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the team will visit the crash site in a forest in
Xing'an County, located some 100 km from Guilin.
</P>
<P>
In January, members of the first team identified the wreckage
of the B-24 bomber and verified the remains of some crewmen. A
short time later, China held ceremonies to officially hand over
the recovered remains of crewmen to the team.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two Xing'an farmers discovered the wreckage while
searching for medical herbs in a thick forest.
</P>
<P>
The current team sent a seven-member advance group to Guangxi
on October 16 to locate and pinpoint the exact location of the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources say the second search will require 15-20 days
and will most likely be concluded by the middle of November. China
will fully cooperate with the U.S. team.

<HEADLINE> Study: One 10th TB Cases Resists Common Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- About one in 10 new cases of
tuberculosis worldwide is resistant to at least one of the common
drugs used to treat the disease, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by four health agencies from 1994 to
1997. Tuberculosis bacteria were sampled in 35 countries, or
regions of countries.
</P>
<P>
TB may soon become difficult or impossible to treat, The
Washington Post said today, quoting Sally A. Shelton-Colby, an
official of the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID).
</P>
<P>
"If tuberculosis were a new disease, the world would spare no
expense to fight it," said Arata Kochi, director of TB programs
for the World Health Organization (WHO), which helped organize
the study. "Now, while we have been looking the other way..., the
germ has mutated into drug-resistant strains, making itself a more
difficult and deadly enemy to combat."
</P>
<P>
Tuberculosis is the most common serious infectious disease in
the world. About 7 million new cases, and slightly more than 2
million deaths, occur each year, the Post report said.
</P>
<P>
The study found that in Latvia, 34 percent of new cases are
resistant to at least one drug, and 14 percent are resistant to
the drugs isoniazid and rifampin. In Thailand, the resistance is
37 percent and 4 percent, respectively. And in the Dominican
Republic, it is 41 percent and 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Drug-resistant strains of the bacterium almost always arise
from strains that were survived incomplete or inadequate courses
of therapy. The survey found that among TB patients who had
undergone some treatment, the prevalence of drug-resistant
bacteria was 36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Norwegian Foreign Ministers Confer in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks today with Norwegian
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers praised the bilateral relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that bilateral ties have witnessed constant
development since the two nations established diplomatic relations
some 43 years ago. He also pointed to highly-beneficial economic,
trade, scientific and technological, and cultural cooperation in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
Norway last year and the current visit by Norwegian King Harald V
have played an important role in promoting friendly bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He told Vollebaek that China places great importance on its
relations with Norway, and pointed to the absence of conflicts in
basic interests between the two countries. Qian said the two
countries share identical or similar viewpoints on many
international issues. "No major obstacles prevent the two sides
from engaging in mutually beneficial cooperation," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently maintained that all countries, large or
small, poor or rich, or strong or weak, are equal in the
international community, and each can make its own efforts to
promote world peace and development, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Different points of views on some issues are understandable due
to the differing national characteristics of China and Norway,
Qian noted. This is the very reason that the two countries should
further increase contacts, enhance mutual understanding and deepen
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that joint efforts will ensure that bilateral
relations continue to grow in a sound manner," said Qian.

Vollebaek underlined the fact that Norway was in the first
group of Western nations to recognize the People's Republic of
China, and that Norwegian people admire China's development over
the past 20 years. He particularly praised China for solving
problems related to feeding and clothing its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said Norway hopes to promote Sino-Norwegian
relations, and noted that China is playing an increasingly
important role in the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government is fully prepared to expand friendly
and cooperative ties with China, said Vollebaek, noting that the
Norwegian government's policy is to adhere to its "one China"
stance and refrain from forging official links with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the two countries have engaged in active exchanges on
the human rights issue, and that China proposes to deal with
differences concerning the human rights issue on the basis of
equality and mutual respect, and to practice a policy of
cooperation rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Dialog and cooperation between China and Norway, and other
countries, will help to enhance mutual understanding on the human
rights issue, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Vollebaek agreed that the two foreign ministries will
hold consultations concerning the affairs of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also conferred on the international
situation, as well as the current situation in the Asia-Pacific
Region and Europe.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks today with visiting
Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Jose Ayala Lasso.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese government has paid close attention
to the growth of bilateral relations, and that the further
development of friendly cooperation is in the fundamental

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Stays Firm on Climate Change Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia today remained firm
on its climate change stance and rejected a United States proposal
to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, despite it being the most
lenient suggestion put forward by its most important political and
economic allies so far.
</P>
<P>
Australia is now isolated from three major trading partners,
the United States, Japan and the European Union, over the
greenhouse gas emission reduction issue.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the United States called for industrial nations to
fight global warming by stabilizing their emissions of greenhouse
gases at 1990 levels by between 2008 and 2012, and reducing
emissions after that.
</P>
<P>
While the position is far more lenient than the EU's call for a
15 percent reduction in emissions from the 1990 levels by 2010, it
has already been rejected by Australian Prime Minister John
Howard.
</P>
<P>
Japan put forward a proposal earlier this month for a five
percent cut in emission from the 1990 levels by about 2010.
</P>
<P>
Howard told a business dinner earlier this month that
stabilizing emissions at the 1990 levels by 2010 would put at risk
about 48 billion US dollars worth of investment in the energy and
mining sector over the next five years and cost tens of thousands
of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
And Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said today the
US position would be too costly for Australia.
</P>
<P>
"That figure couldn't be achieved by Australia without
significant economic sacrifice and job losses," Hill told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there was a lot in (U.S. President Bill Clinton's)
speech that seems remarkably similar to the sort of things that
we've been saying."
</P>
<P>
Australia is arguing that any reduction targets agreed to at a
major summit in Kyoto, Japan, in December should take into account
different countries' economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the three different
climate change plans put forward by Europe, Japan and now the U.S.
proved Australia's model was the only workable solution.
</P>
<P>
Kinza Clodumar, president of Nauru, today denounced Australia's
stand on greenhouse gas emissions and called for Japan and France
to fill the leadership vacuum left by Australia in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Clodumar said the issue of climate change, which virtually
split this year's South Pacific Forum, was the single most
important issue facing the region's mostly low-lying island
states.
</P>
<P>
"The Forum communique which emerged at the end of the meeting
was extremely bland and was painted by Australia, certainly by its
officials and Howard himself, as something of a victory," Clodumar
was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Windsurfer Faces Challenge at HK Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Olympic champion
windsurfer Lee Lai Shan faces a tough challenge from other
entrants at the 1997 Hong Kong Open Windsurfing Championships
which opened here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Competing in the three-day event are windsurfers from China's
national and Guangdong teams and from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), Germany, Poland, Japan, Thailand and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Amelie Lux from Germany, 20, a two-time world youth
championship winner, said it is very hot and humid here, compared
with the cool and rainy days back in her hometown in Kiel, in
north Germany.
</P>
<P>
"I had some trouble with the weather, too," she said. There
had been no strong wind in recent days over the race course off
the Cheung Chau Island, site of the competition. Local weather
forecast predicts strong wind around the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait and pray for good weather," she joked.
</P>
<P>
Joining her here was 23-year-old Pole Anna Galecka, winner at
the national championships last September and seventh placer at
this year's European championships.
</P>
<P>
A veteran windsurfer for the last nine years, Galecka said: "I
like the windsurfing as it is a very good sport. In the sport, I
could travel many places in the world and make friends as well,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Amid the field for the event are China's Asia-Pacific
championships bronze-medalist Liu Youcai and his teammate and
national champion from this year's national games Chen Zhanying.
</P>
<P>
Also in the field are Thailand's Homrdrusn Arun, winner at the
Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994 and Hong Kong's Asian champion Wong
Tak Sum.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Hong Kong athletes had training for the past week. But
the lack of strong wind had forced them to abandon training for at
least three days.
</P>
<P>
Set on the program are International Raceboard Class and
International Mistral One Design Class, for heavy weight and light
weight events for both men and women.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang's poor form continued in the World Cup table tennis
tournament in Nemes as he lost the opening game to Greece's
Kalinikos Kreanga on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Liu, who swept the men's singles and doubles
gold medals in the Atlanta Olympics last year, failed to reach his
dizzying height in the Chinese National Games last week where his
singles run was ended by a less known player.
</P>
<P>
Kreanga, who jumped out of oblivion after a string of
impressive performances in the Manchester world championships in
May, clinched a lopsided 21-11, 20-22, 21-8 win over the
fast-attacking Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who plays in penhold style, still has a chance of reaching

<HEADLINE> Manila, Labor Groups Fail to Resolve Wage Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the country's labor leaders failed today to reach an agreement on
the matter of wage increases after a seven-hour closed-door
meeting at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The Tripartite Consultation on Wage and Productivity, attended
by representatives from various labor groups, employers'
associations and key government officials led by President Fidel
Ramos, ended with a decision to leave the matter to the Regional
Wage Boards.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Ramos ordered the National Wages and
Productivity Commission to undertake a complete review of existing
wages granted by the Regional Wage Boards and to act expeditiously
on all pending petitions for minimum wage adjustments.
</P>
<P>
He also directed Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing to review
and report any developments on the action taken along the wage
hike issue till November 21.
</P>
<P>
However, labor leaders felt disappointed over the results of
the meeting as it failed to secure its desired across-the-board
wage hike.
</P>
<P>
"We were dissatisfied because all of our requests were not
addressed," said Democrito Mondozo, president of the moderate
Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, after emerging from the
meeting which labor leaders expected to grant workers a legislated
wage increase.
</P>
<P>
Quisumbing said there were some form of a "consensus" among the
participants to the consultation "that the wage boards' action
must go on to determine the wage increases."
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was precipitated by the recent peso devaluation
and the series of oil price adjustments which triggered increases
in the prices of prime commodities.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders have been pressing the government for another
round of wage increases.
</P>
<P>
However, Miguel Varela, president of the Employers
Confederation of the Philippines, said that according to the law,
the Regional Wage Boards is the one that will fix any pay hike.
</P>
<P>
He said the minimum increase will be determined by the boards
and several factors will be considered.

<HEADLINE> EU Reacts Strongly to Clinton's Emission Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
commissioner for environment today expressed disappointment on the
greenhouse gas emissions plan announced by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed with the very weak level of ambition of the
United States," an EU press release quoted Commissioner Ritt
Bjerregaard as saying, as his first reaction to the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an adequate response to the global problems of
climate change," said Bjerregaard.
</P>
<P>
At a speech on Wednesday in Washington, U.S. President Bill
Clinton called on gradual and mandatory reduction in so-called
greenhouse gases to curb the threat of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's plan, the U.S. industries are to reduce carbon
emissions to the 1990 levels over the next 12 years.
</P>
<P>
But the convention on climate change, adopted at the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, has already urged
emission stabilization by the year 2000 at the 1990 levels for
industrialized countries, said the EU commissioner.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said four years ago that through voluntary
efforts the United States could cut carbon emissions to the 1990
levels by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
However, emissions have been growing and are now expected to
exceed the 1990 levels by 13 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. position to reach this goal by sometime around 2010
is therefore a significant step in the wrong direction," said
Bjerregaard.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which has called for a 15 percent cut in greenhouse gas
emissions from their 1990 levels, also attacked a Japanese plan
calling for a 5 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
The union's negotiating position on a 15 percent reduction is
technically feasible and economically manageable, the commissioner
reaffirmed.

XIAOLANGDI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has since
October 1994 provided loans of 553.4 million US dollars for
construction of the Xiaolangdi multi-purpose water conservancy
project, the largest of its kind on the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The project, second only to the Three Gorges Dam Project,

</P>
<P>
World Bank officials have expressed satisfaction with the rate
of progress, quality and resettlement efforts, and rate the
project as an exemplary example in the use of loans.
</P>
<P>
The project has tendered construction bids from across the
world, with three prestigious foreign hydraulic engineering
companies which have won bids forming three joint operations with
Chinese engineering companies.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Situation Stable, Says Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's financial situation was
stable in the first three quarters of this year marked mainly by
appropriate growth in the money supply, the People's Bank of China
said today.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics of the central bank show that the
outstanding value of broad money, known as M2, which is the
combination of cash in circulation plus all sorts of deposits,
stood at 8,589.24 billion yuan by the end of September, up 17.1
percent from a year ago and down 8.2 percentage points from the
end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money, or M1, which is the
combination of cash in circulation plus the demand deposits of
enterprises, was valued at 3,224.46 billion yuan by the end of
last month, an increase of 17.3 percent from the comparable figure
of last year and a drop of 1.6 percentage points from the amount
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of cash in circulation, or M0, rose 12.1 percent from
a year ago to 942.61 billion yuan by the end of September. Cash
supply in the first nine months reached 62.41 billion yuan, 10.05
billion yuan more than that for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that outstanding deposits at the banking
system were valued at 7,831.3 billion yuan by the end of last
month, 18 percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The central bank noted that due to the increase in direct
financing, larger treasury bond issuance and diversification of
personal financial assets, the expansion of individual savings has
slowed down since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, personal savings were valued at
4,413.95 billion yuan, up 18.1 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The value of outstanding loans totaled 7,056.45 billion yuan by
last month, a rise of 17.1 percent over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that China's foreign exchange
reserves grew by 29 billion US dollars in the first three quarters
of this year to more than 134 billion US dollars by the end of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that, considering the present situation,
it will continue to follow a moderately tight monetary policy and
conduct proper economic macro-control so as to ensure steady
growth of the national economy.

HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced today that the official foreign
exchange reserves of Hong Kong were 88.1 billion US dollars at the

</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now the world's third largest holder of foreign
reserves after Japan and China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign reserves represents mainly a rise in
the foreign currency component of the Exchange Fund and the Land
Fund, said the HKMA, the de facto central bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of September, the foreign reserves held in the
Exchange Fund were 71.4 billion and those in the Land Fund were
16.7 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Trade Control System Works Well in HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government is doing all it can to
ensure that its effective trade control system works and that the
interests of its legitimate traders are protected, a local
official said today.
</P>
<P>
"As enshrined in the Basic Law, the HKSAR remains a separate
customs territory after the transition," Hong Kong
Director-General of Trade Alan Lai told the general session on
customs and trade at the New York State Bar Association Conference
being held here.
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of our trade control system is the cornerstone
of our separate customs territory status," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR takes its international obligations under the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing
seriously and maintains the utmost vigilance over attempts to
abuse origin rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lai said that the HKSAR has an effective system to deal with
the problem of illegal transshipment, particularly with a series
of new initiatives introduced in the past two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Such initiatives include factory audit checks introduced in
November 1996 and the integrated consignment and factory
inspection introduced in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
On control over strategic commodities, a minute was signed in
Hong Kong earlier this month by US Secretary of Commerce William
Daley and Hong Kong Secretary for Trade and Industry Miss Denise
Yue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is in HKSAR's interest to maintain effective controls over
strategic commodities trade because only by doing so can the HKSAR
 have free access to sophisticated goods and technologies
essential for Hong Kong's economic development, Lai quoted Miss
Yue as saying.

<HEADLINE> Tension Still High in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Tension remained high today in
the southern Philippine island of Mindanao as government troops
failed to withdraw from areas near a stronghold of a major rebel
group as promised earlier, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Muhamad al-Haj Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), told the local ABS-CBN television that
the government troops had failed to pull back from those towns
surrounding its bastion, Camp Abubakar, in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
He said tension was still high around the camp as a result of
the military's failure to reposition its forces as promised at an
emergency meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The positions being occupied by the rebels and the government
troops in the area are only two to four kilometers away from each
other.
</P>
<P>
At the emergency meeting Tuesday, peace panels from the
government and the MILF agreed to respect an earlier preliminary
truce and reposition their respective forces in order to defuse
rising tension in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the withdrawal of the government troops, the
rebels agreed to stop public execution of people they themselves
find guilty.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a senior military officer said there is no need for
the government troops to move away from the outskirts of three
towns surrounding the rebels' bastion since they have not moved
"even an inch" closer to it.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Philippine News Agency, Maj. Gen. Raul Urgello,
commander of the Army's Sixth Infantry Division, said his troops
have not "encroached" MILF tolerated areas so there is no reason
for them to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
But Urgello said if ordered by the higher command for them to
pull out or reduce government forces in the area, they will do so
to appease MILF's apprehension that the military will attack Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has accused the military of preparing to seize
Abubakar, the rebels' biggest camp in Mindanao, by building up
troops in its nearby areas. But the military denied the charge,
saying the troop movement was a routine redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But the troops' build-up was widely believed to be in
retaliation for the rebels' public execution of two alleged
criminals early this month, who were convicted by a rebel court.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a membership of more than 20,000, the MILF now has the
largest number of anti-government troops in the country. It has
fought for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao since the late
1970s.

<HEADLINE> Mealie-meal Price Hike Condemned in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The recent hike on the price of
mealie meal will severely erode the buying power of the already
poverty-stricken consumers battling with high prices, the
Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ) said today.
</P>
<P>
''The 36 percent hike on maize is just excessive and is not
sustainable to consumers considering that most consumers are
poverty-stricken,'' the CCZ said.
</P>
<P>
The council said consumers were already burdened with high
prices of other goods such as bread and cooking oil and high
rates for social services.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the increases, the CCZ said consumers should
take their maize to hammer-millers.
</P>
<P>
''Not only is maize-meal ground at hammer mills cheaper but it
is even nutritious,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
''The government should have in place a mechanism for
cushioning vulnerable consumers form increases in the price of
basic goods and services,'' the CCZ said.
</P>
<P>
Mealie-meal prices went up by 36 percent with effect from
Monday. The price of bread will go up by between 7.5 percent and
10 percent as from October 27.
</P>
<P>
Millers said the latest increase was caused by the need to pay
farmers and traders who are demanding a higher price for their
maize.
</P>
<P>
The Grain Marketing Board increased its buying price in order
to attract sellers to beef up its maize reserve in the face of a
looming drought in the 1997/98 season.
</P>
<P>
Price of maize at the Zimbabwe Agricultural Commodity Exchange
has also increased in the past week.

JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland National
Association of Teachers has written a strong-worded letter to the
government to reject recent salary increases.
</P>
<P>
The organization said today the government imposed 1.9 percent
and eight percent pay rises on its own, without consulting the

A statement issued by the association's Secretary-General,

undemocratic". It said the teachers will accept a negotiated
salary increment.
</P>
<P>
Swazi teachers, who are on strike, have threatened to register
their dispute with the labor commissioner. The move aims to lead
to industrial action, if the government goes ahead with its
increments.
</P>
<P>
Teachers throughout Swaziland returned home empty-handed
yesterday, which was pay-day, after the government stopped their
salaries until they end their week-long strike.

BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- News media should work towards

on-going reform, said Li Tieying, member of the politburo of the

He urged the news media to help the masses understand the
reform from an overall perspective so that they can support and
participate in the reform.
</P>
<P>
"Only when a correct theory is mastered by the broad masses,
can it be turned into a tremendous force driving the reform
ahead," he said, referring to the decisions and guidelines set
down by the recent 15th national congress of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>

billion US dollars worth of equipment from the United States for
the Three Gorges Project, according to a project official.
</P>
<P>
Imports will mainly include equipment for concrete mixing and
pouring, and high-voltage transmission lines and transformers, said
Wang Jiazhu, vice-president of the China Yangtze River Project
Three Gorges Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the Chinese government fully supports the Three
Gorges Project will provide US businesspeople with a golden
opportunity, and we sincerely hope US ventures will actively enter
the international bidding process," according to the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that at least two to three billion US Dollars worth
of equipment imports will be required for the massive earth and
stone work and pouring of concrete once the mainstream of the
Yangtze River is dammed in early November.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that imports will account for at least half
of the equipment for the Three Gorges Project, with 70 percent of
same coming from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang said that his corporation will actively seek
overseas financial backing to overcome fund shortages of 39
billion yuan prior to the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome export credits, commercial loans and loans from
overseas financial institutions," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water control
project, will involve construction of the world's largest power
plant, lock system and 2,300 m x 185 m dam. The massive project
will be constructed at an estimated cost of 25 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 25 percent of total funds will be used to
purchase more than 30,000 types of construction materials and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
A large majority of the equipment will be imported from the
United States, with other machinery coming from Japan, Sweden,
Germany and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The bid process considers competitively priced high technology,
with preferential export credits considered to be an important
aspect for those winning contracts, said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Refugee Foundation Moves to Clothe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- African Refugees Foundation
(AREF), a Nigeria-based humanitarian organization has launched an
operation to help clothe African refugees, its President and
founder, Chief Segun Olusola, announced in Lagos today.
</P>
<P>
The program, dubbed "African Garments for African Refugees",
is designed to establish a process of continuous production and
stocking of culturally appropriate garments for African refugees,
Olusola said at a forum organized by the Pan African News Agency
and the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Such clothes, he said, would make it easier for refugees to
re-integrate into the society, because they use textiles and
designs made for Africa's weather conditions and are more
culturally sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Olusola said the idea of the program was first conceived in
1994, when AREF airlifted culturally appropriate garments to
Rwandan refugees and received great admiration of the Rwandans as
well as other international relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to him, AREF has established a production base at
the headquarters of the Nigerian Red Cross Society and has got
the first designs from the Society of Nigerian Artists.
</P>
<P>
Some of the designs were shown at the forum.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the receipt of a donation of two million Naira
(about 24,000 U.S. Dollars) for the execution of the program from
the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Olusola had served as Nigeria's Ambassador to Ethiopia and its
resident representative to the Organization of African Unity
(OAU). He was the chairman of the refugees commission of fifteen
on refugees from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
He set up the AREF upon his retirement in 1993. Since then, he
explained, AREF has been involved in relief programs in Rwanda,
Somalia and Nigeria. It has also been sponsoring studies of the
refugee issue in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Olusola expressed concern at the unending conflicts and
refugees issues in Africa. He estimated that there are about six
to seven million refugees and three times of that of displaced
persons across the continent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of Africa's conflicts arise from power
struggle between ethnic groups, he advocated the culture of power
sharing and ethnic tolerance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for both governmental and
non-governmental organizations to evolve more effective conflict
management and prevention mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, our efforts now, particularly at the governmental
level, must shift from conflict management and resolution to
conflict prevention through the use of timely dialogue," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Businesses Have High Expectations for Jiang Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Major US companies with offices
in China have expressed hope that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
forthcoming state visit to the United States will be successful
and fuel expanded economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview with Xinhua, representatives of
Chinese subsidiaries of Boeing, IBM, Microsoft, Motorola, Ford,
Coca-Cola, Visa, United Technologies and DuPont said that stable
political ties between China and the US will ensure the success of
economic and trade cooperation and will encourage US firms to
invest more in China.
</P>
<P>
They said that their companies will work to help improve and
develop Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zimmerman, president of Boeing China Inc., commented
that Sino-US relations are improving in the wake of period of
uncertainty. He said President Jiang's visit will be extremely
important for the further development of Sino-US political and
economic ties, and will increase Boeing's confidence in its future
development prospects in the country.
</P>
<P>
IBM (China) Chairman Henry Chow said that improved Sino-US
relations will encourage American businesspeople with investment
in China to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that strengthened relations will ensure the smooth
business development of large companies like IBM.
</P>
<P>
P.Y. Lai, president of Motorola (China) Electronics Ltd., said
that sound commercial links are indispensable for the steady
development of Sino-US relations despite certain unfavorable
factors. He said his company has always placed priority on
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Visa International Vice-President and Chief Representative to
China Lee Leehun said that China's steady economic development
serves as a true indicator that the country has been transformed
from a potential to an actual huge market.
</P>
<P>
The change offers tremendous opportunities for cooperation
between China and other countries, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
Paul Wong, general manager of DuPont China company, said time
is ripe for DuPont to expand its business in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese government support has enabled DuPont to
enjoy vigorous development, gain a large market share, and join
trade partners with common goals.
</P>
<P>
Richard Latham, president of international operations for China
United Technologies Corp., praised his Chinese staff as being
diligent and highly educated.
</P>
<P>
Latham noted that 20 investment analysts visited China in
September along with UTC Chairman George David. He said Latham
attributed UTC's subsequent three-point gain on the New York Stock
Exchange to the analysts "favorable assessment" of the work
discipline, education level of Chinese employees, and quality of
both Chinese products and management.
</P>
<P>
Steve Chan, general manager of Coca-Cola China, said the
Chinese government's policies regarding the reform of China's
state-owned enterprises, and the encouraging rise in investments
in central and western China, have offered good opportunities for
foreign businesses to develop in the Chinese market.

<HEADLINE> Rival Clans Sign Cease-fire Pact in C. Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The elders of the rival
clans of Majerten and Habar Gidir in Mudug region have sealed a
cease-fire peace accord at Gaalkacyo in central Somalia, 600 km
north of the capital here.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the town said over 10,000 people, clan elders,
intellectuals and various social groups, have marched to and fro
the only tarmac road -- the green line -- in the town in
celebration of the peace pact signed by the two sides yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The central town of Gaalkacyo is one of the most sensitive
areas of the country where the most power ambitious clans of
Somalia live together. It has all the time been the center of all
conflicts between the Habar Gidirs of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and
the Majortens of Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf.
</P>
<P>
This has been the largest peace deal ever reached by the rival
clans of Habar Gidir and Majerten, observers here say.
</P>
<P>
The peace march was sponsored by two delegates from Mogadishu
and the northeastern town of Bossaso and people gathered at the
center of the town where the green line and clan-manned
checkpoints were dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Mr Hassan Abshir Farah who spoke on behalf of the joint
committee told the journalists that the contents of the agreement
included an immediate cease-fire, the separation of the opposing
militiamen and the relocation of all clan militia bases from the
town.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, the eight-point pact also called
for the formation of a 21-member joint administration committee
that will run the security forces and jail of the town.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mohamed Hassan Shikhad, a member from the five-member
delegation that left Mogadishu for the peace deal, said they will
also send elders to the nearby villages and countryside to inform
the nomads that an agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
And whoever commits further killings or animal looting will be
caught by his clans men and handed over to those whom he grieved,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also contains an item that says the clans men of
the culprits will compensate for the loss and damage values he
inflicts.
</P>
<P>
This accord was prompted by earlier clan-based killings four
days ago in the town of Gaalkacyo where six people were killed
and others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Ends Visit to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela left Tripoli this morning after a two-day visit to Libya,
the Libyan official news agency JANA reported.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before his departure, Mandela declared
that he came to Libya to thank Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and
the Libyan people for their support to South Africa and also to extend
help to the Libyans in regards to the U.N. sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
This was Mandela's first visit to Libya since he became
president of South Africa in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said that he had talks Wednesday night with Gaddafi on
ways of developing bilateral ties and a number of issues of
mutual concern, particularly African ones.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the South African president called for an
end to the U.N. sanctions on Libya, which were imposed in
1992 after Libya failed to hand over two men suspected of bombing
a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270
people on board.
</P>
<P>
Mandela drove into Libya Wednesday from neighboring Tunisia to
avoid violating the U.N. sanctions which banned arms sales and
flights in and out of the north African country.
</P>
<P>
His tour to Egypt, Tunisia and Libya was aimed at exchanging
views with leaders of these countries on regional and
international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Libya had supported Mandela-led African National Congress
morally, financially and militarily during its 25 years of
struggle against the white-minority rule in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Employment in Steel Production Falls Sharply Over 1975-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Employment by the steel industry
of industrialized Western nations dropped sharply over 1975-1996,
the International Labor Organization (ILO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of job positions in steel production in the European
Union (EU) countries fell by 67 percent from 991,000 in 1975 to
326,000 in 1995, said a report released here by the ILO.
</P>
<P>
From 1975 to 1996, France registered a loss of 75 percent from
157,000 to 38,500 jobs while the United Kingdom's employment in
the industry slid by 80 percent from 190,700 to 37,000, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, noted the report entitled the Iron and Steel
Workforce of the 21st Century, steel production in the two
countries fell by 16 and 14 percent respectively over the period.
</P>
<P>
The workforce in the U.S. and Japanese steel industries shrank
by about half from 470,400 to 237,500 and from 324,400 to 155,000
respectively, while their output fell by 10 percent and 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, labor will continue to play an important role in steel
production despite improvement in technology.
</P>
<P>
"The human dimension is the key to the future," said the ILO
report, adding that "technical advances are short-lived."
</P>
<P>
"Successful steelmaking in the 21st century will depend more
than ever on an enduring but responsive and flexible partnership
between the enterprise and its workforce," it asserted.

Forty-three years of bilateral diplomatic ties have led to the

<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that joint efforts will further strengthen
Sino-Norwegian relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the mark during his meeting with visiting Norwegian
King Harald V and Queen Sonja earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Harald V is the first Norwegian Head of State in history to pay
a state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended warm welcome to the Norwegian King and Queen. He
recounted his visit to Norway last year and noted the warm
reception he received from the King.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was impressed with the beautiful natural scenery
in Norway, and the pioneering spirit of the country's diligent and
wise people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the new century is rapidly approaching and the
maintenance of direct contacts between leaders of different
countries will facilitate exchanges of opinion concerning the
future of the world and friendship between people. He said related
efforts will be conducive to increasing mutual understanding and
enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang cited the ancient Chinese proverb: "Distance does not
hinder mutual understanding, and people living thousands of miles
apart can still be neighbors." Jiang said that China and Norway,
which sit at opposite ends of the Eurasian Continent and have
different domestic conditions, nonetheless have no fundamental
conflicts of interests and share identical historical experiences.
</P>
<P>
The two countries treasure their sovereignty, national
independence and freedom which were gained through struggle, said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Norway face the common task of
safeguarding world peace and developing their respective causes,
and noted that the two countries have more common points than
differences, a fact which constitutes the basis for furthering
bilateral friendship and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today after a "wild and whippy" session, suffering from a
crisis of confidence in the wake of the Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
After plummeting to a three-and-a-half year low, the local
currency drew little comfort from new data which damped down the
prospect of a rate cut here in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market is nervous and players fear the
Australian dollar has further to fall.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 70.68 US cents, from a close
yesterday of 71.21.
</P>
<P>
Worries that Australia will be drawn into the economic turmoil
of Southeast Asia dragged the Australian dollar down to 70.45 US
cents, a level not seen since May 1994, in early morning dealings.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local currency was reacting to reports, mainly
from US investment banks, that the Australian economy was at risk
from the economic woes of its neighbors. Some of those reports
have advised investors to "get out of" Australian and New Zealand
currencies.
</P>
<P>
ANZ head of foreign exchange sales John Reedyk said the market
was nervous and jittery.
</P>
<P>
At close tonight, the Australian dollar was at 85.89 yen from
85.51 yesterday, and against the Deutsche mark it was at 1.2639,
from 1.2739.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat left Gaza today for a
European tour, which will take him to France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit, Arafat is scheduled to hold talks
with French and German leaders on issues concerning the Middle
East peace talks and ask them to render assistance in pushing the
peace process forward, according to the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian news service said Arafat will also visit the
Hague, where he will address a European Union conference on recent
developments of the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, both the United States peace envoy Dennis
Ross and the European Union (EU) peace mediator Miguel Moratinos
intensified their shuttle mediation between Israel and the PNA in
a bid to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a meeting between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ross also organized a meeting on
Monday between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and PNA deputy
head Abu Mazen in an attempt to bridge the gap between the two
sides over the PNA demand for a halt to Israeli settlement
expansion and the Israeli request for a tougher PNA fight against
terror.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met Moratinos at the West Bank city of Ramallah on
Monday, agreeing to accept the EU proposal that Israel and PNA
adopt a code of conduct to restore mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and PNA negotiating teams are to meet in Washington by
the end of this month to discuss Israeli troop redeployments,
Israel's halt of settlement activities, the security concepts and
ways of starting the final-status negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Calm to Interest Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Beijing have
reacted calmly to central bank's interest rates cut, saying the
move is "something within expectation".
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China announced last night that it would
reduce the interest rates for both savings and loans by an average
1.1 and 1.5 percentage points effective today.
</P>
<P>
A woman clerk at a savings bank in Wangfujing in downtown
Beijing said customers are fewer than yesterday, but "it's quite
normal". She said they did not have the interest rates changed on
the screen until 8:30 this morning after the bank opened,"for fear
of any possible leak (of the news)".
</P>
<P>
However more people came to deposit their money over the past
couple of days, "perhaps they had sensed something," said the
woman clerk.
</P>
<P>
An old lady seemed rather upset by the interest rate cuts and
regretted she had not put her money into the bank earlier. She
said she was surprised by the news and for a moment had no idea
what to do with the money at hand.
</P>
<P>
"But it seems safer to keep the money at the bank," she said.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates cut did not trigger a stock buying spree as
they did in previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
At a security exchange run by an investment company under the
Agricultural Bank of China, about 50 people were looking at the
flashing screen quitely and there were no lines formed in front of
the counters.
</P>
<P>
"People are more concerned with the government policies on the
stock market than the adjustment of bank interest rates," said a
middle-aged man."I have put part of my money at the bank and
invested some in the stocks. Maybe someday I can earn a lot. Who
knows?"
</P>
<P>
People in banking business see the interest rates cut as part
of the effort the government takes to help state enterprises out
of difficulties, most of whom have been burdened by high-rate
loans.
</P>
<P>
They predict an increase in their loan business.

<HEADLINE> SAHRF Raises $50m to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Human
Rights Foundation (SAHRF) has set aside a funding of 50
million U.S. dollars for the eradication of poverty in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, Times of
Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by SAHRF Executive Director Achibald Ngcobo
in a paper he presented at a three-day national micro-credit
summit which opened in Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ngecobo told the meeting that the fund will be distributed at
a ratio of about 3 million to 5.2 million per country, depending
on various factors such as population, size, and income levels.
</P>
<P>
The initial funding is for a period of three years starting
from July 1998 up to 2001, Ngecobo noted.
</P>
<P>
He drew the meeting's attention to the deprivation of poverty
and destitution that has reached unprecedented levels in the SADC
region after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank introduced the structural adjustment programs (SAP) in early
1990s in the continent.
</P>
<P>
SAHRF will ensure that issues of empowering the vulnerable
groups in the region become center-stage, Ngecobo added.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that empowerment of the poor will only
succeed if it has its strength in the rural areas and does not
create a dependency syndrome among the people.
</P>
<P>
The executive director emphasised the need for micro-credit
institutions in the region to work in harmony and not in
isolation or in competition so as to realise the dream of a
poverty free region.

<HEADLINE> Australian Share Market Plunges 2.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
plunged as much as 2.7 percent before recovering slightly to end
2.5 percent lower as massive Hong Kong-inspired selling swept
across Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Today's falls pushed up the Australian market's losses to more
than 4 percent in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed 68 points down at 2614.9.
</P>
<P>
"The weakness in the Asian markets and of course the big
markdown in Hong Kong just flowed through here significantly this
afternoon," Shaw Stockbrokings' Jamie Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
Stronger-than-expected local wages data, which reduced hopes
for another interest rate cut in the short term, also contributed
to the Australian market's fall but it was largely overshadowed by
the situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong bourse sank 14 percent in morning trading, its
largest percentage fall in 10 years, before closing 1,211 points,
or 10.4 percent, lower at 10,426.3.
</P>
<P>
The local market's next move is too tough to call and it is now
a case of waiting to see how U.S. and European markets would fare
overnight, Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index shed 91 points, or 2.05 percent, to
4353.5 while the All Resources lost 52.3 points, or 4.04 percent,
to 1240.9.
</P>
<P>
Sliding Asian currencies would hamper economic growth, delaying
demand for commodities, sapping commodity prices and weighing on
domestic resources shares for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP tumbled 88 cents, or 5.9 percent, to 14
Australian dollars, its lowest level in about four years. Global
mining company Rio Tinto shed 1.066 Australian dollars, or 5.3
percent, to 19.15 Australian dollars and WMC fell 45 cents, or
7.68 percent, to 5.41 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industrials performed better on the whole, with News Corp's
ordinary shares slipping 5.8 cents to 6.9 Australian dollars and
its preferred shares easing 1 to 6.19 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
But interest rate-sensitive banks did poorly, with NAB falling
62 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 20.75 Australian dollars; ANZ 44.5
cents, or 4.1 percent, to 10.41 Australian dollars; CBA 39.4 cents
to 16.436 Australian dollars and Westpac 3.3 cents to 8.783
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index lost 12.6 points to 1276.4, with gold bullion
closing at 323.65 U.S. dollars an ounce compared to 322.65 U.S.
dollars yesterday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 432.45 million shares valued at 1.289

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Refutes EP Censure on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain has strongly
denounced the European Parliament's (EP) criticism of the human
rights status in the Gulf country, the Bahraini news agency
monitored here reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that during a weekly meeting, Bahrain's Consultative
Council members refuted an EP statement issued on September 18 as
a blatant interference in Bahrain's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The EP statement accused Bahrain of imposing high pressure on
opposition groups, saying such measures violated human rights.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Mubarak
al-Khalifa said the EP statement was based on false claims made by
a political opposition group that works to distort Bahrain's
reputation and achievements in the field of protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed al-Muttawa, Bahrain's Cabinet Affairs minister, said
the EP had no rights to interfere in the internal affairs of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EP statement coincided with a similar one dealing with
human rights status in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the UAE blasted the statement which
attacked the Gulf country's failure of giving two murderers rights
to defense before executing them.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Andrew Li, chief justice of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Court of Final
Appeal, was appointed as an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple
in London earlier today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the court told reporters: "Apart from being a
personal honor for the chief justice, the appointment was a
recognition given to the status of the Hong Kong judiciary and its
standing in the common law jurisdictions."
</P>
<P>
Li has thus become the third person of Chinese ancestry given
such honor. The other two were the late Futting Tien-hsi Cheng,
former Judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice, who
was appointed Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1946, and
Singapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who was similarly
honored in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The Middle Temple is one of the four Inns of Court in London.
There are currently 47 Honorary Benchers, among them are
distinguished judges and academics. The number of Honorary
Benchers is strictly limited and only a maximum of two are named
annually.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Algeria to Discuss Attack Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- A South African-manufactured
Rooivalk attack helicopter is to undergo evaluation trials by the
Algerian defense force.
</P>
<P>
Local daily The Star today quoted defense sources as saying
one of the helicopters is to be airlifted to Algeria this week
aboard an Antonov transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The trials could result in sales as well as a new marketing
initiative in north Africa, following attempts being made to sell
the helicopter to Middle East countries, the defense officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, evaluations of the helicopter were undertaken in the
United Arab Emirates and Oman, but no decision has been made on
sales.
</P>
<P>
Rooivalk has been regarded as one of the most revolutionary
helicopters on the world market. The attack helicopters are to go
into service with the South African airforce later this year. It
has already been demonstrated in the British army and the Dutch
army.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's defense industry has previously supplied
Algeria with unspecified military equipment. It has also done
business with countries such as Egypt and Morocco for several
years.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Currency Crisis Harms Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian currency
crisis could slash Australia's exports by up to 3 billion
Australian dollars (2.19 billion U.S. dollars) a year, the
National Farmers' Federation (NFF) said today.
</P>
<P>
NFF economic policy adviser Todd Ritchie said rough
calculations resulted in a 3 billion Australian dollar worst case
scenario.
</P>
<P>
"I've looked at how growth has been revised down and the impact
on Australian exports and growth," Ritchie said. "The result was
total exports down 1 billion to 3 billion Australian dollars
annually."
</P>
<P>
The currency crunch has hit just as farmers are hoping for
continued price increases in several key commodities.
</P>
<P>
Overseas agencies reported today that the currency crisis has
driven some feed and flour mill companies to the brink of collapse
while others are shying away from any buying until they have to.
</P>
<P>
But an Australian Wheat Board spokesman said customers from the
countries affected by the currency crisis indicated that they do
not expect the downturn to have a big impact on their wheat
purchases.
</P>
<P>
"Our customers have indicated at this stage they don't expect
to see significant changes in the level of their wheat
purchasers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
analyst Terry Sheales said Australia's live cattle trade is
suffering under the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The trade, worth about 366 million Australian dollars (267
million U.S. dollars) last year, relies heavily on Southeast Asian
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Sheales said Indonesian importers are finding it difficult to
gain letters of credit due to the fluctuating value of the rupiah,
the country's currency.

JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South African investors
have pumped 150 million U.S. Dollars into new ventures in Uganda
during the past six years, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
But Ugandan officials said the investment, which generated
about 20,000 jobs, was below expectations.
</P>
<P>
"South Africans have not participated as we had expected,"
William Muhairwe, the acting executive director of the Ugandan
investment authority, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The South African investment in Uganda represents a small
fraction of the 800 new investments valued at four billion U.S.
Dollars received since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Most of the capital inflow to the East African country went to
the manufacturing sector although interest has also been shown in
farming.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stand on Nigeria Remains, says Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- There will be no significant
change in all existing measures and sanctions imposed against
Nigeria by the U.S. until improvements are noticed to justify a
change, said William Twaddell, U.S. ambassador-designate to
Nigeria, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been frosty since the
annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections in Nigeria,
culminating in the imposition of limited sanctions on the
Nigerian military administration by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions that the Bill Clinton
administration should go further by imposing an oil embargo on
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering ways to deploy more effectively the
panoply of normal diplomatic and other tools at our disposal to
influence developments in Nigeria," Twaddell told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee which considered his nomination.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria is too important to ignore. With more
than 100 million people and vast natural resources and economic
potential, Nigeria's capacity to influence regional developments,
for good or ill, is large, he added.
</P>
<P>
Instability in Nigeria would have profound humanitarian,
political and economic consequences for West Africa and other
regions, including the United States, he noted, adding that U.S.
interest in Nigeria are diverse.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Fundamentally, we seek a stable civilian democratic
government in Nigeria which respects human rights and the rule of
law."
</P>
<P>
"A priority U.S. government interest is combating Nigerian
criminal enterprises, narcotics trafficking and other activities
affecting the United States, and obtaining effective Nigerian
government cooperation to combat those menaces," Twaddell said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also stated that as a practical matter, the United
States needed to continue to try to work with Nigerians on issues
of mutual concern to advance both short- and long-term
objectives.
</P>
<P>
Twaddell is said to have extensive experience in african
affairs, having served in Liberia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau and
Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Steel Producing Countries to Meet Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 18 major
steel producing countries will meet here next week over the recent
and future changes in steel industry and their impact on the iron
and steel workforce.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from governments, trade unions and employer
organizations will meet from October 27 to 31 to discuss these
changes and their impact on the seven million workers currently
employed in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Countries to attend the meeting are Brazil, Canada, China, the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Mexico, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, the United
Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Their steel
production combined accounts for three quarters of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
The International Labor Organization (ILO), sponsor of the
meeting, said in a report that globalized markets and rapid
technological change will dictate further adjustments in the size
and skills of the workforce in the industry -- an engine and
indicator of economic growth in nearly all parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of steel, mainly in the form of
construction and of durable goods, is closely linked to the level
and rate of a country's economic development, said the ILO
report. The annual per capita consumption ranges from an average
of 17 kilograms in Africa to 625 kilograms in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumption in industrialized countries is expected
to remain static or even decrease slightly in the coming decade,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Strong growth is, however, expected in Asia (40 percent over
the period), notably in China (150 percent) and, to a lesser
extent, in Latin America (18 percent)", the report added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Poverty Held in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The inaugural meeting of
ASEAN Ministers on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication ended
in Malaysia today with a firm commitment to eradicating poverty in
the region.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the one-day meeting held in Subang Jaya near here
today, the ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) member countries signed a "Ministerial
Understanding" on ASEAN cooperation in rural development and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are "firmly committed toward realizing the vision
of eradicating poverty, with particular emphasis on promoting the
development of progressive, prosperous, and self-reliant rural
communities, and thus contributing toward creating a caring
society in the ASEAN member countries," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "unanimously approved" the framework for the
ASEAN Plan of Action on rural development and poverty eradication,
which will address the challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The challenges include socio-economic disparity, unemployment
and underemployment, low productivity, illiteracy, backwardness,
inadequate economic opportunities, social problems, lack of basic
infrastructure and social amenities, environmental degradation and
the impact of globalization and information technology in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the objectives of the action plan, the ministers
outlined a number of strategic thrusts including developing human
resources and capacity for policy formulation, promoting
experience sharing, encouraging participation of the private
sector, promoting collaboration with ASEAN governmental
organizations and building common positions on matters related to
rural development and poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen and coordinate ASEAN collaboration, the ministers
agreed to meet at least once in two years with informal meetings
in between, but ASEAN senior officials will meet on the subject at
least once a year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers decided that their next informal meeting will be
held in late 1998 in Indonesia and their formal meeting will take
place in 1999 in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
All nine ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- were
represented at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Membership Optional, Says Abacha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha has described the Commonwealth as a voluntary association of
independent.
</P>
<P>
He said sovereign nations with member states free to exercise
their right to join or leave if so desired, the daily Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Abacha made the remarks in the capital Abuja on Wednesday as the
Commonwealth turned down Nigeria's request to be represented at the
group's heads of government meeting to be open tomorrow in Edinburgh,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
On his return to Abuja after a state visit to Ghana and the Gambia,
Abacha said no nation could be compelled to join or leave the
organization.
</P>
<P>
"There is no compulsion. it is free and any member can be there and
any member can opt out," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the main aspect of the Commonwealth is to focus on the
socio-economic relevance of member states. I doubt if the Commonwealth
is there to massage or satisfy the ego or sentiment or the historical
perspective of some powers that used to be in the past. We have passed
that stage," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, refused on
Wednesday the appeal of Nigeria to be at the Edinburgh summit to defend
itself, which is expected to decide on the country's membership.
</P>
<P>
The refusal came on the heels of the British government's resolve
to prevent Nigeria's representatives from participating in
the deliberations in which a final decision on Nigeria, which was
suspended from the body in 1995, is expected to be taken.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi in a letter to
Anyaoku sought permission to attend the summit so as to state the
country's case for re-entry.
</P>
<P>
But the British Foreign Office argued on Wednesday that Nigeria
should not take part in any Commonwealth meeting while the suspension
subsisted.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's stock market fell
today for the fourth day this week, dropping by 1,211.47 points to
close at 10,426.30.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, the key indicator of Hong Kong's blue
chips, broke through the 10,000-point level in morning trading to
9,998.07, down 1,639.7 points, before recovering a little in
afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
The morning plunge was the biggest drop in points in the
market's history and the largest percentage fall since October 26,
1987, when the market plummeted 1,120.7 points to close at
2,241.69, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 11,637,
down 765 points, the lowest finish since April this year. The
index had already lost 630 and 567 points respectively Monday and
Tuesday following sharp falls on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
However, today's market turnover amounted to 34,031 million HK
dollars (about 4,374 million U.S. dollars), up from Wednesday's
23,561 million HK dollars (about 3,028 million U.S. dollars),
Tuesday's 19,260 million HK dollars (2,470 million U.S. dollars)
and Monday's 17,260 million HK dollars (2,210 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Today's stock market drop followed three days of steep falls,
with investors gripped by panic selling on fears of higher
interest rates and currency instability.
</P>
<P>
The market has been further weakened mainly by selling
pressures from overseas and domestic funds managers and by renewed
 currency volatility in the Asia-Pacific region, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the main reason for today's fall
appeared to be a huge rise in short-term interbank rates here.
Banks here announced earlier today that their prime rate would
rise by 0.75 percentage points to 9.5 percent from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong banking authorities made no statement, but the
hike appeared designed to head off borrowing for speculative
attacks on the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar is the only Asian currency still pegged to
the U.S. dollar. Several other Asian currencies have plunged since
July in a wave of turmoil sweeping markets from Indonesia and
Malaysia to Singapore and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the tumbling stock market, Financial Secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Donald Tsang
reiterated his determination this morning to defend the Hong Kong
dollar, noting that the SAR's economy remains stable.
</P>
<P>
"I am not worried at all, because it is a market. A market, of
course, depends on the sentiments," he said. The SAR has 80-odd
billion U.S. dollars of foreign exchange reserves, without any
debt.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is a matter for people to panic about, but I
believe very strongly in defending our dollars," Tsang said. "Our
dollars reflect the fundamentals of Hong Kong and the fundamentals
are exceedingly robust."
</P>
<P>
He is of the view that Hong Kong's companies are still making
good profits and they are turning in good dividends for the
shareholders. "It is very sound investment generally," he pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> 6,750 People Killed in Road Accidents in Seven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 6,750 people have
been killed in 34,837 road accidents in Mozambique since 1990,
and 37,481 people wounded, local newspaper Noticias reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a recent report from the National Institute
of Vehicles as saying that the actual death tolls far exceeds the
number given, for some injured people died later without the
Knowledge of the police.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the capital city of Maputo has the
highest accident rate of the whole country, which stands at 49.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, due to low speed driving, quick rescue and better
medical condition, the death rate in Maputo is relatively low.
The city witnessed the death of 1,176 people in 12,695 road
accidents since 1991, in which 10,600 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the traffic accidents to out-of-date
road condition and signal system which in turn leads to rapid
damage to vehicles, as well as speeding, drunk driver and
violation of traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
About 23 percent of accidents in Mozambique were caused by
drunk drivers.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires in Indonesia Cause Huge Economic Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The total loss caused by forest
fires in Indonesia from April to September this year has reached
11,751 trillion rupiah (about 3.15 billion U.S. dollars), the
Indonesian Forum for Environment (WALHI) estimated.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation results issued by the forum
Wednesday, 1,714 million hectares of forests have been damaged by
the fires in the period.
</P>
<P>
The smog and haze caused by the fires also affected the health
of many people in the country as well as in neighboring countries
like Malaysia and Singapore. By October 20, it said, as many as 23
people had died because of the haze and approximately 30,000
people had been suffering from respiratory illnesses and eye
irritations.
</P>
<P>
The haze also caused the cancellation of many flights and
collision of boats in the country. The Garuda Airbus a-300 crash
near Medan, capital of North Sumatra, on September 26, which
killed all 234 people on board, was possibly caused by the thick
haze, WALHI added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local press reported today that just when people
thought it was safe to return to the streets unmasked, thick haze
from brush and forest fires made a return to several towns in
Sumatra and Kalimantan islands, forcing the closure of at least
eight airports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the Environmental Impact Management Agency
as saying the number of hot spots, or fire locations, had
increased from 36 to 54 on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Intensive international assistance has helped reduce the impact
of the fires in Indonesia in the past two months and as of last
week the situation was believed to be under control.
</P>
<P>
But intermittent rain has worsened the situation as it produced
more smoke instead of extinguishing the fires.

MAPUTO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Three ships belonging to the
Mozambican Navy were submerged around Sunday in Doca dock in
Maputo Port, local newspaper Noticias reported today.
</P>
<P>
Another ship was still floating and swaying on the sea waves,
with a possibility to submerge at any time, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributes the submerge to negligence and lack of
maintenance for a long time.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the ships had been dumped in the port
since February this year, and no one has made any efforts in
salvaging them.
</P>
<P>
The submerged ships would affect the repair work on the dock
and the route to a nearby fishing harbor, the paper noted.

<HEADLINE> ILO Calls Consensus on Core Labor Norms a Must </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has underlined the need for a broad consensus
on core labor standards in the international multilateral system
and called India a key player in realizing it.
</P>
<P>
in a interview with the Press Trust of India here today, ILO
Deputy Director-General Kari Tapiola said, "India is one of the
countries without which we cannot have a broad consensus on core
labor standards."
</P>
<P>
Tapiola held talks with Indian Labor Ministry officials and
representatives of workers' organizations in the past two days and
is to discuss today with employers organizations the question of
core labor standards and what ILO can do to improve the observance
of these standards and review the ILO program on the abolition of
child labor in India.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian government and social partners have a
positive view and are supporting ILO actions on key labor
standards and all of them reject a link between labor standards
and trade.
</P>
<P>
The ILO is expected to meet in November this year and discuss
ways to intensify implementation and improve the follow-up
mechanism for the promotion of the core labor principles in member
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Kia Group to Be Disbanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean government has decided
to place the financially ailing Kia Group's two auto-making flagships
- Kia Motors Co. and Asia Motors Co. - under court receivership to
solve the dragging Kia Group crisis.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kia Group, the eighth largest conglomerate and the
second largest car-maker in South Korea, with 28 subsidiaries, will be
inevitably disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Creditor banks said Thursday that they will file an application
within this week at the earliest for court receivership of the two
units.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by government is to end the prolonged Kia crisis
aimed to calm the escalating financial unrest under the market
economic frame, said economic observers.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision announced by Deputy Prime Minister for
Finance and Economy Kang Kyong-shik Wednesday, Kia Motors will be
operated as a state-run public company until its management is
normalized and its future will be decided by the next administration.
</P>
<P>
The loans by Korea Development Bank (KDB) to Kia Motors will be
converted into the state-run bank's investment capital, making KDB the
motor company's biggest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government has decided to hand over Asia
Motors to a third party in the near future, on the condition that its
commercial vehicle production lines in Kwangju are not relocated.
</P>
<P>
The government also calls for the resignation of most of the
current management and will appoint asset trustees within the
companies under negotiations with the court.
</P>
<P>
Both commercial banks and merchant banks reacted positively to
the government action, saying it would help stabilize the domestic
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Kia owed domestic financial institutions 9.43 trillion won
(about 14 billion U.S. dollars) as of the end of May this year,
including 5.38 trillion won (6 billion dollars) to commercial
banks and 4.5 trillion won (5 billion dollars) to merchant banks
and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the long-awaited government decision, the local bourse
sharply rebounded to mark a daily jump. Meanwhile, the South Korean
currency also showed signs of recovery. Domestic stock prices and the
South Korean won have both experienced sharp declines in recent days,
mainly because of the prolonged Kia issue.
</P>
<P>
While financial circles responded positively to the government's
decision, it prompted an immediate strike by 20,000 Kia workers.
</P>
<P>
The Kia Group opposed the government's decision, saying that it
will mobilize all legal measures available to deter the court
receivership, stead seeking for court protection to grasp their
current management right.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Welcomes Overseas Investment in Farming, Husbandry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
enormous agricultural development potential and resources, said
Tibet's representative to an exposition here, but foreign
investment is badly needed.
</P>
<P>
Ma Guanghui, an official from the Regional Department of
Agriculture and Animal Husbandry who leads Tibet's delegation,
made the remarks today at the Third China Agricultural Exposition
under way in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said so far there is no overseas investment in agricultural
development except for a few international donors to carry out
several integrated development projects.
</P>
<P>
Tibet covers more than 1.2 million square kilometers, Ma
said. The region's location on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its
unique geological environment and climate has resulted in large
areas of grasslands, farmlands and forests, he said.
</P>
<P>
These resources are yet to be developed due to lack of funds,
Ma said, but in recent years many private investors from inland
provinces have invested in farming and husbandry projects in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investors, he said, the regional government
has formulated a series of preferential policies and listed a
number of projects.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in 1996 Tibet produced 810,000
tons of grain, 116,000 tons of meat, 166,400 tons of dairy
products, 9,300 tons of wool and 1,500 tons of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Tibet mainly exports wool to neighboring Nepal and
India, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Ningbo Sees Rapid Growth in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Ningbo, a major port city in
east China's Zhejiang Province, has increased its import and
export volume 600 times over the past 10 years, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The city has achieved 4.35 billion U.S. dollars in imports and
exports by the end of last year with its annual increase rate in
foreign trade reaching 50 percent at least.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials attribute this rapid increase to the
foreign trade rights granted to the city by the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation in 1988.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 50 export companies have been set up in the
city, while 114 local enterprises have been granted the right to
export their own products. Local goods have been exported to 146
foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The city's export volume now makes up 26 percent of its gross
domestic product, according to the officials.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks With Rebels to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) will go on despite the recent tension in the southern
Mindanao Island, Defense Secretary Fortunato Abat said today.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Abat confirmed that he and
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, had
agreed to push through the peace talks during a meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abat said he had gained a pledge from the MILF leader that the
rebels would not hold any public executions of people they
themselves find guilty.
</P>
<P>
At present, negotiators from the government and the MILF are
holding another urgent meeting in Mindanao to discuss last week's
terrorist attack on a military camp in Mindanao and the execution
of two alleged criminals by the MILF early this month.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been high in central Mindanao after the military
built up its troops in areas surrounding a major rebels' camp in
retaliation for the terrorist attack and the MILF's execution of
the alleged criminals.
</P>
<P>
The MILF had threatened to scrap their peace talks with the
government if the military continued to increase troops near the
rebel stronghold.
</P>
<P>
But after an emergency meeting Tuesday, the two sides agreed to
respect a cease-fire signed in July and pull back their forces to
their previous positions. Tension has been easing up in central
Mindanao following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Abat also confirmed that the Army's Sixth Infantry Division has
begun to reposition its troops posted near the MILF camp.
</P>
<P>
With an estimated membership of 12,000, the MILF is currently
the largest anti-government force in the country. It began peace
negotiations with Manila early this year, but the talks have been
on-and-off due to sporadic fighting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The larger Moro National Liberation Front signed a peace deal
with Manila last year.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Bo Wins Women's 5,000m With World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Bo, a new protege of
famous track coach Ma Junren, broke the world record in the
women's 5,000 meters to take the gold medal on the last day
competition of the Eighth National Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, winner of the 1,500m event, clocked 14 minutes and 28.09
seconds for the title, slicing 3.18 seconds off the previous mark
of 14:31.27, which was set by teammate Dong Yanmei in the heat on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dong took the silver in 14:29.82, which also surpassed her own
world record. The third place went to Shandong's Liu Shixiang
with 14:38.14.
</P>
<P>
With eight entries of Liaoning province in the 15-member
finals, Wang Xiaoxia rushed ahead to lead the pack right after the
competition.
</P>
<P>
Then Ma's disciples exchanged leads in turns in the next few
laps before Jiang dashed ahead after 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
After six laps, only four were left in the leading group
including Jiang, Dong, teammate Yin Lili and Shandong's Liu
Shixiang, third finisher in the 1,500m.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Dong broke away with two laps left to finish
one-two in the day's most exciting moment, and most importantly,
to break the newly-established world record.
</P>
<P>
Liu and Dong then jogged for a victory lap with a flag of
Liaoning team in front of the boisterous crowd in the
80,000-capacity Shanghai Barrel Complex.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited to win the gold and break the world record. I
dedicated the victory to coach Ma. I could never achieved such a
honor without him," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Champion Jiang revealed that coach Ma had set the tactic before
the finals, with some of his disciples leading at first and the
others to break the record.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoxia, who paced the pack first, faded eventually for
the last spot while another teammate Wang Yanfang tailed in the
field, only ahead of Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Coach Ma told us to break the ryhthm of all the others," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who went to Ma's training camp two years ago, said she
hoped to achieve good result in the 2,000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's my dream to take part in the Olympic Games," she said. "I
will train harder after the National Games and I'm confident I can
improve a lot as long as I follow coach Ma."
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, who expressed his confidence to break the world mark
right after the heat on Tuesday, said it's the right time for him
to make a comeback after two-years' slump.
</P>
<P>
"My athletes ran one and a half marathon daily during the
training and I asked them to take recovery nutrition 12 times a
day," he said.
</P>
<P>
The coach revealed that what the athletes feed themselves were
mostly old chicken soup and the Chinese traditional herbals.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the national titles were just the beginning of his new
team.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I am not highly interested in home competitions. My
goal is to win world and Olympic titles," he said.

SHANGHAI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market saw sharp
growth in the first half of the year, attracting 200 billion yuan
(24 billion US dollar) from Chinese and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors spent 13 billion US dollar on B and H
shares, accounting for half of the total collected funds in the

<P>
The number of newly-listed companies has continued to increase
this year, with 149 large enterprises, mostly state-owned, being

in the first half of the year was rare.
</P>
<P>
Total trading on the two exchanges increased to nearly two
trillion yuan in the first half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Bill Gates Defends Microsoft Against Monopoly Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Microsoft
Corporation Bill Gates today rejected the charges of monopoly
against his company by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft did not violate a consent decree it signed in 1995
which barred it from imposing anticompetitive licensing terms on
personal computer makers, Gates told an audience of top technology
executives in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department on Monday accused Microsoft of forcing
computer makers to include the Microsoft Internet browser in
pre-loaded software by using the monopoly on its Windows computer
operating system in violation of the 1995 decree.
</P>
<P>
The department asked a federal court in Washington to fine
Microsoft 1 million U.S. dollars a day if the alleged violations
continue.
</P>
<P>
The charges partly originated from complaints by small
companies about Microsoft's aggressive efforts to incorporate new
functions into its Windows operating system, whose '95 version are
installed on more than 80 percent of the PCs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Microsoft prohibited Compaq Computer Corp. and two
other major U.S computer makers from eliminating or limiting the
presence of its Internet Explorer Web browser on their products.
</P>
<P>
Ed Black, chairman of the Computer and Communications Industry

BANGKOK -- The falling value of the baht will increase
pressure for price rises of consumer goods in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The declining value of the baht, which has plunged by 48.3
percent against the U.S. dollar since July 2, has further added to
the cost of production and made it very difficult for the Commerce
Ministry to control consumer goods prices, Commerce Minister
Narongchai Akrasanee was quoted as saying on

<HEADLINE> Intra-COMESA Trade to Be Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The annual trade volume among
COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) countries
will be increased to six billion U.S. dollars from the current
2.4 billion dollars with the establishment of its Free Trade Area
(FTA)in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted COMESA Acting Director General
Erastus Mwencha as predicting that FTA will create immense
business opportunities for entrepreneurs within and from outside
the region.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha told a COMESA "yellow card" meeting last Thursday in a
written speech that free movement of goods and services within
the region will require banking, insurance and other financial
support services.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that cross-border investment in the
insurance industry is gathering pace as most member countries
through the COMESA monetary harmonization program have
liberalized the capital account, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said globalization of world economic activities
presents opportunities and challenges to the insurance industry
in the region which will see many insurance companies from
advanced countries set up business in COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
He called for closer cooperation including joint ventures
among insurance companies in COMESA for the industry to be able
to meet the challenge of stiff competition to be posed by
entrants from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"The liberalization of financial services will enhance
competition and improve sectoral efficiency, leading to lower
costs, better quality and more choice of financial services,"
Mwencha noted.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization will induce governments to improve
micro-economic management, domestic policy interventions, in
credit markets and financial sector regulations and supervision,
he added.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Efforts to Improve Ownership Structure (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- China is making new efforts to
readjust and improve the ownership structure in a bid to adapt the
productive forces to the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is China's basic economic system for the primary stage of
socialism to keep public ownership in a dominant position and to
have diverse forms of ownership developed side by side," said
General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the recent 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
And this serves as the guiding principles for the country to
readjust and improve the ownership structure.
</P>
<P>
It is key to the economic restructuring to improve and develop
the basic economic system, while top priority should be given to
the economy of public ownership in the process, especially of the
state sector, economists said, noting that this reform is fatal to
the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, China had stepped over development
stages time and again due to radical ideas and policies, which
brought great damage to the productive forces and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and central government began to introduce the multiform
economic development policy in the late 1970s, and dramatically
emancipated the productive forces with diverse forms of ownership
developing side by side as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
So, the non-public ownership economies began to have an
increasing proportions in the whole economic activities, while
that of the public ownership economy has been declining. However,
the latter's absolute output value has been growing by big
margins.

PARIS, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The suburb of Algiers was subjected to unprecedented
massacres of civilians last month, during which the army failed to
intervene. Today, the accusation of an army deserter and the
terrifying recount by a witness of the massacre in Bentalah, in
which 400 people were killed on September 22, reinforced the
suspicion on the exact role of the military in the killings.
</P>
<P>
-- France has wasted no time to help the victor of Congo
Republic, General Denis Sassou Nguesso. An Uzbek Ilyushin rented
by Paris landed on the airport of Brazzaville on Tuesday, from
which disembarked a campaign hospital, 15 French firemen and 25
French agents for intervention in rescuing civilians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly 16 million Algerians are called today to vote for
their local representatives in a last step of a government bid to
revamp the electoral system. The process began in November 1995
with the presidential vote, followed by a constitutional
referendum in November 1996 and then legislative elections in
June. The voting takes place as the army launched a major attack
against the dens of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the most
militant Islamic group of the country.

<HEADLINE> Legal Abortions Increase in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africans are having
abortions at the rate of about three women an hour, according to
a survey by the Reproductive Rights Alliance (RRA).
</P>
<P>
In the first six months since South Africa adopted Abortion
Law in February, nearly 13,000 legal terminations were performed,
said RRA.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in many hospitals are struggling to keep up with the
growing demand for abortion since the procedure was legalized in
February, medical department sources said.
</P>
<P>
The choice of the termination of pregnancy allows pregnancy
terminations for all women over 16 in the first 12 weeks in
certain cases.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng Province where Pretoria, the administrative capital
and Johannesburg, a biggest trading center in south africa are
situated, 6,332 abortions performed from February to August
represent half of all requests, said RRA Administrator Judi
Merckel.
</P>
<P>
Those who are not able to get legal abortions continue to
support the illegal backstreet abortion industry which flurished
during apartheid era, she said.
</P>
<P>
Before abortions are legalized, up to 300,000 back
street abortions were performed each year. Of these, an estimated
43,000 of these women were hospitalized from medical
complications, RRA said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that women from neighboring Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Zambia and countries where abortion is either not
easily available or illegal have made the long journey to
have the procedure in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Merckel predicted that the legal abortion rate is expected to
increase further in the short term with improved medical access,
but will eventually subside as a result of greater awareness
through education programs provided at clinics and hospitals.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Efforts to Improve Ownership Structure (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China's state assets amounted to 6.58
trillion yuan, up 15.4 percent over the previous year, maintaining
a higher increase than the gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) was 6.8 trillion
last year, to which the sector of the public ownership contributed
76 percent, accounting for 2.8 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector had a trillion yuan in taxes and profits
last year, 877.6 billion yuan of which was generated by
enterprises of the public ownership, accounting for 88 percent of
the total with the state-owned businesses contributing more than
600 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Economies of public or state ownership have been growing
steadily in the process of the ownership structure
readjustment. So there is no worry about the possibility of
"privatization", economists said.
</P>
<P>
A consensus has been reached that the proportion of the public
ownership in the national economy is no longer the final
target. Instead, the state sector should withdraw from the fields
in which it works less efficiently than other economies, and turns
to the life-blood areas for national economy such as energy,
power, transport and other infrastructure fields.
</P>
<P>
China is effectuating a strategic reorganization of state
enterprises by good management of large enterprise groups while
relaxing the control over small ones and invigorating them.

Accordingly, the state enterprises are encouraged to invest in
national defense industry, minting industry, aerospace, large
infrastructure projects, large resource-tapping programs, and the
high-tech projects that bear strategic importance on the country's
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the state will no longer spend on non-strategic
areas while readjusting the layouts of national economy, and will
relax control over the areas in which collective or non-public
ownership economies can do better.
</P>
<P>
"The non-public sector is an important part of our socialist
market economy. We should continue to encourage and guide the
non-public sector comprising self-employed and private businesses
to facilitate its sound development," Jiang Zemin reiterated in
his report to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Historical experience and practices by world market economies
have shown that the strategic reorganization of state economy
should rely on existing superior state-owned enterprises,
industrial policies and market systems, economists said.
</P>
<P>
An effort must be made to overcome the factors that greatly
hinder a sound operation of the capital market, with top priority
placed on clarifying the complicated relationships between state
enterprises and administration, and ownership of property, and
eliminating regional and sectional boundaries, economists urged.

<HEADLINE> Grain Pests Invade Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Larger grain borers (LGB),
a deadly grain pest, have invaded into eastern Uganda, a local
scientist warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Salim Nahdy, Director of Kawanda Agricultural Research
Institute, told The New Vision that the pest was found recently
in eastern Busia district.
</P>
<P>
The pest was detected first in February this year from a
consignment of maize, transported by the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to Rwanda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Constant Bazirake, Acting Commissioner for plant protection in
the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries,
blamed the recent pest invasion on the violation by ICRC on the
related regulation of Uganda, under which the food should be
opened only at its destination.
</P>
<P>
The pest poses a threat to stored maize, dry maize in the
field, sweet potatoes, rice, sorghum and wheat.
</P>
<P>
The pest had invaded Tanzania through food aid in late 1970s. It
spread to Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo
since then.
</P>
<P>
Illegal border grain trade can bring the pest into Uganda at
any time, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan scientists would introduce soon predator beetles of
teretriosoma nigrescens into the border districts of Busia and
Tororo as a preventive measure against the weevil, he added.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales in Thailand Down in January-September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's total vehicle sales
during the first nine months of this year dropped by 25.9 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Only 322,000 vehicles were sold in the period, of which 117,000
were cars, 167,000 pickup trucks and 38,000 buses and heavy
trucks, according to a Toyota Motor (Thailand) report issued
today.
</P>
<P>
During the same period of last year, about 405,000 vehicles
were sold.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales of buses and trucks have suffered the
sharpest decrease, falling by 41 percent, followed by pickups with
a drop of 31.9 percent and cars 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the top 10 car sellers, only Toyota and Honda registered
increased sales, rising by 4.3 percent and 5.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The market for imported cars shrank considerably as a result of
the depreciating baht and higher luxury goods tax.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Volvo were down 34 percent, Volkswagen 26 percent, BMW
 18.5 percent and Mercedes-Benz 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, total sales of vehicles of all categories
decreased by as much as 73 percent as a result of the weakening
purchasing power of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Last week the government lifted import duties on
completely-built-up cars to 80 percent from 42 percent and 68.5
percent to discourage luxury spending and increase government
revenue.

<HEADLINE> New Step Toward Blocking of Yangtze Mainstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The planned blocking of the
Yangtze mainstream has achieved new breakthrough last night, with
the opening in the coffer dams narrowed down to 130 meters ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The further narrowing paved the way for the final damming of
the Yangtze mainstream, since it increased the water speed in the
diversion canal and the movement of silt, according to a water
conservation expert with the Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
For the first time the water flow in the diversion channel
bypassed the main river channel on October 22. Water surged
through the diversion channel at a rate of 5,710 cu.m. per second,
or 820 cu.m. per second more than in the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President with the corporation Wang Jiazhu said the
opening in the coffer dams will be further narrowed down to 40 to
50 meters on November 5, as a final preparation for the daming of
the Yangtze river on November 8.

JINAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The industrial and commercial
sectors of China's Shandong province held a month-long sales
promotion for a hundred name-brand products recently.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Economic and Trade Commission and Finance
Office, sponsors of the drive, say the products have a good

market share. They represent the level of quality in the province
and include some brands known outside China, like Haier, Qingqi,
and Qingdao Beer.
</P>
<P>
The drive involved 32 large stores with yearly sales each
exceeding 100 million yuan. The provincial government says it will
bring the sales-to-output ratio up to 97 percent by the turn of
the century, and have sales in the province account for 40
percent, sales in other parts of the country, 30 percent, and
overseas, 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province is now a buyer's market. The local economic and
trade commission says that for 94 percent of the goods, output
exceeds demand. So, sales in large retail stores have slowed
down.

</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to its relationship with Cape

</P>
<P>
As the 21st century approaches, the healthy, solid and

</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1976, he

considerable results, while the two countries sympathized with and
supported each other in world issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his thanks and appreciation over Veiga and

Veiga congratulated China on the successful convening of the
15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, Hong Kong's

the important principles governing the development of Sino-African
relations expounded by President Jiang during his African tour in
May 1996.
</P>

partnership with China, and is full of confidence about the
further strengthening of their long-term, stable cooperation, he

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Harare's official centenary
celebrations kicked off last night with the switching on of
lights in the city's first street Mall by Mayor Solomon Tawengwa.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was witnessed by scores of residents who gathered
at the intersection of the Mall and George Silundika Avenue.
</P>
<P>
A band played "Happy Birthday To You," marking Harare's first
100 years as a municipality as the mayor switched on the lights
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said there is nothing political about the occasion,
except that the residents are marking history for the sake of
their children. They are also marking the beginning of the next
100 years for the city as a municipality.
</P>
<P>
The full celebration program is expected to start from
November 6 and will run through November 10, when a lot of
activities including cultural exhibitions are lined up.
</P>
<P>
Harare graduated from being a sanitary board on October 22,
1897.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of municipal status meant that the council
could now set bylaws, levy rates, raise loans and enter into
contracts.
</P>
<P>
It could also own land as opposed to the lower local
authorities who had to acquire land for developmental purposes
through the government.
</P>
<P>
Tawengwa said, "Harare is now the proud multi-racial
metropolis that all the residents have a reason to celebrate,
reminiscing on both our past glorious moments, and frustrating
moments, with the view to using this vital information to chart
the way forward."
</P>
<P>
He called on the people of Harare to make a decision on what
kind of city they look forward to in the next 100 years and
what form of legacy they want to leave behind for
posterity.

<HEADLINE> Zhang Yimou's New Film Big Hit in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- "Keep Cool," a new film by
well-known Chinese film director Zhang Yimou, was a big hit in
Beijing cinema. Within a few days, the box-office revenue topped three
million yuan (about 361,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total box-office earnings of "Keep Cool" is expected to
exceed five million yuan, about half the average gross for foreign
films. The success of "Keep Cool" represents a trend for Chinese
movies to appeal to a mass market, said Gao Jun, an executive of
the Beijing Xingyinlian Movie Studios.
</P>
<P>
"Keep Cool" is the first movie about modern urban life by
Zhang, the director of "Red Sorghum" and "Qiuju Goes to
Court". Most of Zhang's previous films were set in the
countryside, Gao said, which is a change for audiences.
</P>
<P>
The participation of well-known Chinese actors such as Jiang
Wen, who also directed "In the Heat of the Sun," and Li Baotian,
who co-starred with Gong Li in "Ju Dou," ensured the movie's
popular appeal. Actress Qu Ying, a former model, succeeded Gong Li
as Zhang's female lead.
</P>
<P>
Audience members surveyed said that they liked the film because
of its relaxed pace and artistic taste.
</P>
<P>
Xingyinlian studios, producer of the movie, has heavily
promoted and advertised the film.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has experienced a booming movie market in recent
years. Box-office earnings for 76 of Beijing's cinemas exceeded
100 million yuan last year, with estimates of 110 million yuan for
1997.

COLOMBO, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Justice Minister G.
L. Peiris said today that he was authorized by the Parliamentary
Select Committee to submit the new draft constitution to the
parliament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told a weekly news conference that the move marked the end
of the first phase of work on the charter, which had taken two and
a half years for political parties and the public to discuss.
</P>
<P>
The draft contains proposals for the establishment of a Union
of Regions with more autonomy given to local authorities in view
of ending the country's ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is also in charge of constitutional affairs,
ethnic affairs and national integration, said, "The government is
firmly committed to implementing the constitutional reforms."
</P>
<P>
War is not the final solution to the conflict going on in Sri
Lanka between the majority Sinhalese people and the minority Tamil
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new draft constitution is a major peace initiative of the
current government, which stresses the need for reconciliation,
good governance, peace and ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-long conflict in Sri Lanka has claimed 55,000 lives
and rendered many people homeless.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- 300,000 Ugandans have epilepsy
but are not treated, the local newspaper The Crusader reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Helne Meinld, an epilepsy researcher from Danish Epilepsy
Association was quoted as saying that the association is ready to
treat Ugandan epileptics and to give material support to their
families.
</P>
<P>
Epilepsy is common in developing countries because of the lack
of treatment and parental care during child-giving and
child-rearing, Meinld said.
</P>
<P>
She urged parents and teachers not to fear epileptics (people
with epilepsy) and instead advised them to nurse and give proper
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The researcher criticised Ugandans who prefer traditional
herbs which is not a proper treatment for epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
She told the paper that her association counsels epileptics
and seeks help for them from the government.
</P>
<P>
Epilepsy is a medical condition in the brain that can suddenly
make one become unconscious or unable to control his/her
movements.

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Urea Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Because chemical fertilizer
imports are out of control, China has decided to suspend imports
of urea, People's Daily (Overseas Edition) has reported.
</P>
<P>
China imported 9.3 million tons of urea in 1996, 1.6 million
tons more than needed. In addition, the country imported another
2.6 million tons of urea in the January-June period this year.
</P>
<P>
The excessive imports are affecting the country's domestic
market. Recently, 11 large nitrogenous fertilizer producers
appealed for protection of the state's large chemical fertilizer
producers.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest urea importer in the world, and the world
price for urea has dropped a lot because of China's reduction in
the amount of imported urea this year.

<HEADLINE> China Helps 3 million Handicapped out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Liu Desheng, a handicapped
peasant in northeastern China's Liaoning Province, expects to make
9,000 yuan (about 1,084 U.S dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Just last year Liu, who was unable to work, lived in poverty
with his family of three on less than 1,000 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Liu's life changed after the government of Dengta City, where
he lives, loaned him 350 ducklings from a poverty-relief center
for the handicapped and gave him one ton of corn.
</P>
<P>
In recent years China has helped 3 million handicapped people
escape poverty by setting up a special "recovery and relief" loan
fund and poverty-relief centers for the handicapped, according to
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Federation for the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen million handicapped people live in poverty in
China. Adding family members of the disabled, the number accounts
for half of the nation's impoverished, including 2.7 million
living in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
To help the handicapped out of poverty, the State Council set
up the "Recovery and Relief" Fund in 1992. The fund has granted
loans of 500 million yuan in the past two years alone and has
brought prosperity to 800,000 disabled persons in the first half
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many poverty-relief centers, which receive loans with favorable
terms from the government, have been set up to help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
One of the bases in Dengta, a poultry center, hatches 400,000
chickens and ducklings a year. The center has loaned thousands of
chickens and ducklings to 48 poor families with disabilities and
helped them gain an average annual income of 8,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local cadres in Dengta have volunteered to help disabled
persons individually, donating 1.18 million yuan to 509 families
and helping them solve specific practical problems.
</P>
<P>
China plans to meet the disabled persons' needs in food and
clothing by the end of this century, Deng said.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Mounts for Price Rises: Thai Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The falling value of the baht
will increase pressure for price rises of consumer goods in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The declining value of the baht, which has plunged by 48.3
percent against the U.S. dollar since July 2, has further added to
the cost of production and made it very difficult for the Commerce
Ministry to control consumer goods prices, Commerce Minister
Narongchai Akrasanee was quoted as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry maintains that only those consumer goods which are
seriously affected will be permitted to increase their prices
while those which are only slightly affected are requested to
maintain their prices for the benefit of the public, said Internal
Trade Department Director-General Suchai Jaovisidth, according to
a Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier this month that the ministry had
approved price rises for more than 4,000 kinds of consumer goods,
with an increase range varying from a few percent to over 20
percent.

<P>
CHONGQING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a newly designated
municipality in southwestern China, will forbid the production,
sale and use of food containers made of plastic foam effective
July 1, 1998, according to a government meeting held here recently.
</P>
<P>
Food containers made of plastic foam are condemned as "White
Pollution" because they do not decompose naturally and are
difficult to retrieve and dispose.
</P>
<P>
Local bureau of environmental protection statistics show that
200,000 fast-food containers were thrown away daily in Chongqing
in 1996. This white garbage, scattered along the railways or
floating along the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, has long irked
local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, enterprises producing food
containers made of plastic foam should shift to recyclable
plastics, plant fiber or biologically soluble materials.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the 200,000 fast-food containers needed daily in
Chongqing will be fulfilled by enterprises already producing food
containers and cases that meet environmental standards.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An American private
aerospace company is taking reservations for trips on a
rocket-powered cruiser that would send civilian passengers 62
miles (99.8 kilometers) above the earth.
</P>
<P>
The voyages would start in 2001 and each cruiser would send 6
passengers per trip above the ozonosphere, where the sky turns
black and passengers would experience weightlessness for about two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based company -- Zegrahm Space Voyages -- said at
least 15 people have made such reservations and each has put down
5,000 U.S. dollars on the 98,000 dollar trip.
</P>
<P>
Testing of the rocket engine is underway and manufacturing of
two cruisers is to start next year, said Scott Fitzsimmons, vice
president of the company, adding that the cruisers would look like
small jets but powered by rockets.
</P>
<P>
He said the flight itself will take no more than three hours
and passengers are required to spend five days at a space
institute, learning some basic knowledge about space voyage before
boarding on a cruiser.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Resets Dates for Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda electoral
commission decided to postpone the country's local government
elections which had been scheduled for November 1, local daily
The New Vision reported today.
</P>
<P>
Elections of village executive committees have been
rescheduled for November 6 and parish committee polls are now
slated for November 13.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement made on October 16 by the
electoral commission, elections of village and parish executive
committees are to be held on first of November and 8th of
November respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the postponement is complaints from the Seventh
Day Adventist Church. The adventists, whose Sabbath is Saturday
(November 1,), petitioned the electoral commission to have the
polling days changed.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Resistance Movement system in
Uganda, the country has five levels of local governments under
the central government, namely from district councils down to
county councils, sub-county councils, parish councils and
village councils.
</P>
<P>
Uganda held its first direct presidential election in May 1996
while parliamentary elections were held in June of the year.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, the Ugandan central government announced
that local government elections are to be held between March and
April 1997, but were postponed several times due to the lack of
election funds.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" Causes Heavy Rains in Kenya's Coastal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The torrential rains pounding
coastal area in Kenya during the past five days are due to the El
Nino phenomenon, the Daily Nation today quoted a weatherman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Kenya's Meteorological Department (MD) show
that the port city of Mombasa has in the past 20 days received
761 mm of rainfall while its usual October average is 97 mm.
</P>
<P>
The amount received in the past 20 days is about 75 percent of
the total annual rainfall for the coastal town, according to MD
of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Njoroge, MD Deputy Director, said the El Nino episode
is expected to worsen next month, predicting that the coastal
area of the country would receive heavier rains in the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
A similar rainfall trend is picking up in Western and Nyanza
provinces, west Kenya, the weatherman added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the El Nino which started in March/April
would reach maturity in December with most rains falling in
November in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon is the result of abnormal rises in sea
surface temperatures in the Pacific region, leading to extreme
worldwide climatic conditions such as cyclones, floods and
droughts.
</P>
<P>
Its effects were last registered in Kenya in the 1984
drought.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Yan-Huang-Ding Yellow
River Water Diversion Project, which started in China in 1988, has
begun to benefit local poor people.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to improve the life and production of farmers in
Yanchi and Tongxing counties in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
Huanxian county in Gansu Province, and Dingbian county in Shaanxi
Province, all in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The project was also designed to provide drinking water for
360,000 people and 1.27 million head of livestock, and to develop
more than 20,000 ha of irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
Twenty thousand people have been resettled in the project area,
and 5,460 ha of land improved.
</P>
<P>
The major part of the project was completed last year in
Ningxia, where 11 pumping stations, a 100-km canal, and related
infrastructure are doing well.
</P>
<P>
Yanchi county has developed 4,000 ha of farmland and 600 ha of
shelterbelts and economic forests. And nearly 10,000 farmers have
settled in the project area and are provided with clean
water. They produced more than 10 million kg of grain in the past
few years and earn 1,000 yuan per capita.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Farmers Take Lead in Using Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The better educated of the
young Chinese farmers are using science and and technology to make
more money.
</P>
<P>
Yu Changjun, of Shuangjingzi village in northwest China's
Liaoning province, is one example of this new breed and has come
to be known as the "king of shrimps" in the province because he
earned a million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Yu began raising shrimps in the early 1980s, but suffered a
loss because he didn't understand the business, and by 1990, his
losses had risen to 260,000 yuan on a 70-ha water plot.
</P>
<P>
So he turned to universities and research institutes for help,
and even went down to visit a shrimp farm in Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
His first results came in 1995, when his shrimp harvest brought
him 800,000 yuan in profits. This year he expects a better yield.
</P>
<P>
The province has three million young people in rural areas, and
many of them have made a name in different forms of agriculture,
and recently, 100 were selected as role models.
</P>
<P>
The shift has come in relying more on science and technology in
their farm work, instead of past experience as their fathers did.

LHASA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The literacy rate has improved
dramatically in the Tibet Autonomous Region, rising from 5 percent
in the 1950s to 60 percent in 1997. The literacy gains have been

said. "This can be a chance to resolve unsettled humanitarian
questions existing between Korea and Japan and boost the close and
friendly relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said they are aware of the preparations
undertaken in Japan thanks to the concern of the Japanese
government and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Last July, an APPC spokesman stated that the committee will do
everything necessary to see that the senior Japanese women visit
their Homeland.
</P>
<P>
Government and Red Cross officials from the two countries also
held talks in Beijing and reached an agreement on the visit
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese women living in Korea are from two separate
groups: some came to Korea and married Korean men during World War
II while the country was occupied by Japan; the others married
Korean husbands in Japan and later moved to Korea. They are all
senior citizens now and very anxious to visit their homeland.

<HEADLINE> Cement Demand Drops in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's demand for cement in
the first nine months this year was less than two million tons
while the whole year's output was projected at 10 million tons,
local media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the total cement supply for this year
might reach 11 million tons as the production is growing at a
speed beyond anticipation.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the fall of the cement demand to the
country's slower economic growth and high cement prices.
</P>
<P>
This will put domestic producers in a difficult position while
joint ventures can make use of more advanced technology, it
added.

was tested positive for banned drugs, a spokeswoman said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who lifted a total of 282.5 kgs for the bronze, will be
stripped of her medal and be punished under the rules of the
International Weightlifting Federation, said the Chinese Olympic
Committee spokeswoman He Huixian.
</P>
<P>
But she failed to disclose the banned drugs that Zhang has
taken.
</P>

Two strongwomen were disqualified from the National Games last
week as they were caught of submitting prepared tubes of urine in
the doping tests. The Game's Competition Department then ruled
the two cases as positive against the two women lifters.
</P>
<P>
During the Games, a total of 480 urine samples were tested,
including those of all the gold medalists and record breakers, the
spokeswoman said. The other samples were from random tests.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urged to Pay More Attention to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic that is
sweeping Asia is especially worrying for Bangladesh because of its
location and other health factors, the independent United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has 83 reported cases of HIV, the virus that causes
the fatal AIDS, and ten of them developed full-blown AIDS and six
have died, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
"These figures in Bangladesh are a gross underestimation," Dr.
Lisa Messersmith, Country Program Adviser of the UNAIDS told a
meeting in Dhaka recently.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, she said, is at risk because of many poor health
factors such as sexually transmitted diseases, especially among
urban poor, low use of condoms, minimum screening of blood and
increase in injectable drug.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has remained out of limelight (in cases of AIDS) not
because the number of infected persons is few, but because the
number of victims is not known, UNB quoted David Lockwood, UN
Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh, as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the rapid spread of the disease in neighboring India
and Myanmar should be especially worrying for Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
According to Messersmith, at least 8,500 people get infected
with HIV -- 1,000 of them children -- worldwide every day.
</P>
<P>
She warned that at least four million cases will be detected
every year in Asia alone in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Both the UN officials called for greater awareness about the
danger of AIDS in Bangladesh, the UNB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has
increased in foreign-funded agricultural enterprises in
Lianyungang, a port city in eastern China's Jiangsu Province, in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the city government has approved a contracted
overseas investment of over 100 million US dollars for enterprises
developing agricultural resources and processing farm produce. Of
the investment, more than 50 million have been used.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 100 overseas-funded agricultural enterprises,
of which, 45 have an annual export valume of more than five
million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of export-oriented farming is due to the
city's rich natural resources and favorable investment
environment, said Mayor Xia Geng.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural industrialization is the key to developing the
city's rural economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
To compete in the international market, the city has formulated
preferential policies to attract more overseas investors, Xia
said.
</P>
<P>
The city's exports topped 1.6 billion yuan (200 million
U.S. dollars) in 1996, accounting for 70 percent of its total
export volume. And, its exports of vegetables, edible seaweed and
feed ranked first in the country.
</P>
<P>
The city has brought 40,000 hectares of land for vegetable
production, 13,000 hectares for fruit growing, 8,000 hectares for
prawns breeding, and 2,700 hectares for seaweed
cultivation.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Economic Ties Should Be Elevated: Zeng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Both the United States and
China must make common efforts to overcome difficulties and bring
to a higher level their economic ties based on reciprocity and
mutual benefit, visiting Chinese State Planning Commission Vice
Chairman Zeng Peiyan said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to New York and U.S. business community leaders,
Zeng said despite encouraging achievements in Sino-U.S. trade and
economic cooperation, cooperation was not always smooth.
</P>
<P>
"An annual review of the Most Favored Nation status of China
has brought great difficulties to the enterprises of both
countries," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
"The restriction on high-tech exports from the United States to
China exactly reduces the advantage of American companies.
</P>
<P>
"And the conservative attitude adopted by some American
financial institutions has resulted in the loss of large power
equipment contracts, which should have been won by American
companies."
</P>
<P>
Zeng said China's door was opened to all the countries around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, who is heading the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation
on a purchase mission to the United States, said his delegation
will reach agreements with the U.S. side on purchasing commodities
including aircraft, crude oil and automobiles and on cooperation
in aerospace and energy industries.
</P>
<P>
"All these agreements reflect our sincerity to expand economic
and trade cooperation with the United States and the strong desire
of both sides to further strengthen the economic and trade ties,"
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said China, the largest economy in the developing world,
and the United States, the largest economy in the developed world,
shared common responsibilities for addressing many significant
issues such as promoting world economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"With the coming of the 21st century, China and the United
States should further strengthen economic and trade cooperation,"
he concluded.

<HEADLINE> India's Infrastructure Crisis Looming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has warned India of a grave infrastructure crisis, local
newspaper Business Standard said here today.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also pointed out that the Indian government's
public sector disinvestment policy is flawed and lacks clarity.
</P>
<P>
In its forthcoming report on India, a draft copy of which has
been sent to the Indian Finance Ministry, the ADB said, "India's
infrastructural problems have been made significantly worse by the
continued decline in public sector expenditure, both for operation
and maintenance, new investment and the limited progress in
attracting private sector funding into key infrastructure
sectors."
</P>
<P>
The report has noted the fiscal correction package announced by
the government in September this year. But the bank believes that
increasing fiscal pressure could force a reduction in capital
expenditure in a bid to rein in the deficit. This would aggravate
the infrastructural crisis, since capital expenditure has already
been cut from a level of 6 percent of gross domestic product at
the beginning of the decade to 3.4 percent at present, the ADB
said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB report has emphasized the need for the public sector to
play a key role in the development of the country's
infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Transport
Minister Jenny Shipley announced today a series of new tough
traffic rules in an effort to cut the country's road toll.
</P>
<P>
Among the new measures, police will have the power to
immediately suspend the license of a serious traffic offender and
can impound a vehicle driven by an unlicensed or disqualified
driver for 28 days.
</P>
<P>
They also include raising the minimum driving age from 15 to 16
and introducing a new style license with a photograph.
</P>
<P>
The new rules are designed to reduce the road toll and
particularly target drivers who speed or drink and drive.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said raising the licensing age balanced safety with the
needs of young people to drive for jobs, school or social
activities.
</P>
<P>
The measures came in line with the coalition agreement signed
last year, which promised to get tough with unsafe drivers, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Convern over Hurdles to Foreign Investment in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of External
Affairs (MEA) has expressed serious concern about the hurdles
being faced by foreign investors due to the "slow pace of
decision-making and procedures", a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
This is being construed as "bureaucratic dilly-dallying". As a
result, some foreign investors are shying away from India.
</P>
<P>
In a strong worded note to the Foreign Investment Promotion
Board (FIPB), prepared by the Investment Publicity Division of the
MEA, the ministry has pinpointed four areas of concern. These are
the adverse effect on foreign investors of the government's
decision to bar foreign airlines from picking up equity in
domestic airlines, the poor perception about the Indian
bureaucracy, the growing gap between projects approved and actual
foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, and the numerous
procedural delays and hurdles faced by foreign companies while
putting up projects in India.
</P>
<P>
The note added that the situation "calls for a serious
examination of what is holding back foreign investors".
</P>
<P>
Responding to the MEA's concerns, the core group of secretaries
of the FIPB has decided to discuss these issues at its next
meeting to be held soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
approved 569 foreign investment projects from January to September
this year worth 24.09 billion U.S. dollars, lower than that in the
same period last year, according to data revealed by the
Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) today.
</P>
<P>
The number of approved foreign investment projects in the
January- September period of 1996 was 758 valued at 24.61 billion
dollars, the board said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the board also approved 546 domestic
investment projects with a total value of 91.36 trillion rupiah
(3,500 rupiah equal one U.S. dollar). In the same period last
year, domestic investment projects totaled 646 worth 82.53
trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The BKPM data also showed that most of the approved foreign
investment projects in 1996 were from Japan, which totaled 145
with a value of 7.56 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In second and third places respectively were Singapore, with
projects worth 3.1 billion dollars, and Thailand, with projects
worth 1.61 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Investment and BNPM Chairman Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo
said earlier he remained optimistic that the target of approved
foreign and domestic investment projects this year will match
that of last year, despite the ongoing monetary turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is hardly hit by the current monetary crisis in
Southeast Asian region. The Indonesian rupiah has dropped about 50
percent against the U.S. dollar this year. The government has cut
off many state budgeted projects worth 35 billion dollars in bid
to overcome the crisis.

announcement by leaders of the six coalition government parties
the same day.
</P>
<P>
However, the country will still have to wait for some time
before it sees the expected changes in the cabinet, in particular
the portfolios involving ministers in charge of economic affairs,
including a new finance minister.
</P>
<P>
While mass demonstrations have been held over the past three
days to demand Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's resignation
for economic failure, some labor leaders are staging a hunger
strike outside the home of Chatichai Choonhavan to urge his Chart
Pattana Party to quit the government.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Chatichai told labor leaders that their
call carried enough weight and he would call an urgent meeting of
senior party executives today to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
Chayawat Wibulswasdi, governor of the Bank of Thailand,
admitted Wednesday that the Thai currency's recovery depended on
positive political signs, adding "we hope to see a clearer
political picture and a speedy political solution."
</P>
<P>
"Politics is the only factor bringing the baht down. The
country has waited for too long for essential changes to be made
to the economic and political systems, and now we have to wait
longer," the Bangkok Post today quoted a Bangkok Bank trader as
saying, but did not give the trader's name.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Reviews Clinton's Nominee For Civil Rights Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Senate panel Wednesday
began reviewing U.S. President Bill Clinton's nomination of Bill
Lann Lee for the nation's top civil rights post.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the full Senate, Lee will become the first
Asian-American to hold the post of assistant attorney general for
civil rights in command of 250 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
During the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee
today, Lee called a California anti-affirmative action measure
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action is a formal effort to provide increased
employment opportunities for women and ethnic minorities, to
overcome past patterns of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court recently upheld the measure --
Proposition 209. An appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"This particular initiative violates the protection of the
14th Amendment," said Lee, who is a career civil rights lawyer and
Western regional counsel for the Legal Defense and Educational
Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP).
</P>
<P>
But Lee assured the senators that he is not the activist
ideologue that some critics say he is. He said the oath of office
would require him to enforce the laws as the courts decide them,
regardless of what he thinks.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a 48-year-old New York native and son of a Chinese
immigrant, began his career as an associate counsel for the NAACP
legal defense fund in New York in 1974. He moved to California and
the Center for Law in the Public Interest in 1983 before rejoining
the NAACP five years later.

<HEADLINE> Bank, Firm Intend to Form Fund for Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- German Dresdner Bank and China
Guotai Securities Co Ltd disclosed their intent to establish a
joint fund in the wake of a decision by China's central government
to choose several pilot firms to develop investment funds, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"The fund will be fully invested in domestic market for trading
A shares," said Zhao Dajian, deputy general manager of the Guotai
Securities Co, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
If licensed by the central bank, it would be the first
Sino-overseas fund allowed to invest in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors are so far restricted to trading B shares
and overseas-floated shares of Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
Allowing foreign institutions the access to A-share trading
would be a significant step in China's opening of the financial
market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, China declared the long-awaited regulations
on investment funds would come soon and the country would choose
several pilot firms to develop funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said as China is increasingly integrated into the global
economic framework, it is inevitable that China's financial market
will open wider.
</P>
<P>
By learning the advanced techniques of foreign institutions,
China will be able to avoid steep fluctuations in the stock market
and promote the market's role in rational investment.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Leads China's List of Top 500 Joint Ventures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Volkswagen Co.,
Ltd. has for the sixth consecutive year maintained its position as
the most successful overseas-funded industrial enterprise in
China, according to a report by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (Moftec) and the State Statistics Bureau
(SSB).
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen earned 24.3 billion yuan from sales in 1996,
followed by Motorola (China) Electronics, Ltd. and the Guangdong
Nuclear Power Corp.
</P>
<P>
Moftec and SSB listed the top 500 foreign-funded enterprises,
which includes the service industry for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jianhua, an official with the Foreign Investment Department
of Moftec, said that 124 overseas-funded enterprises had a sales
volume surpassing one billion yuan last year, up from 89 in
1995. The average sales volume rose by 205 million yuan to 940
million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
She said that this year's top 500 chart shows that
overseas-funded enterprises in China are continuing to grow and
perform well.
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of the top 500 overseas-funded enterprises
stood at 491.5 billion yuan last year, 40 percent more than in
1995. Nearly 90 percent of the companies recorded a profit in
1996, with the total estimated at 36 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Their total sales volume rose to 469.8 billion yuan last year,
an increase of 27.8 percent over the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the structure of foreign investment has
further improved, with capital- and technology-intensive companies
claiming a bigger share.
</P>
<P>
"The top 500 are from 43 trades, with the majority converging
in electronics, machinery and food processing," Lu said.

<P>
The sales volume of the capital- and technology-intensive
companies accounted for 66.9 percent of the total last year, up
27.4 percent from the previous year, while the number of companies
in the textile and garment sector dropped to 45 from 53 in 1995,
and that for the food processing sector shrank from 37 to 32.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that for the first time less than half of the firms in
the top 500 are companies funded by the Hong Kong and Macao
regions, with European Union countries gaining a bigger share of
the China market last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies in the top 500 that were funded by Hong
Kong and Macao regions slipped from 257 in 1995 to 241 last year,
accounting for 48 percent of the total. Japanese companies
increased their presence from 66 in 1995 to 71, while American
companies showed a slight gain from 51 to 52.
</P>
<P>
Companies funded by Hong Kong and Macao on the list sold 212.2
billion yuan of products last year, at an average of 880 million
yuan each. The average figure was compared to 930 million yuan for
Japanese companies and 1.2 billion yuan for American companies.
</P>
<P>
"Although the EU countries' companies take up a comparatively
small share, they saw an apparent rise in sales volume," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of the EU companies increased from 49.4
billion yuan in 1995 to 63 billion last year, up 27.5 percent,
with the average up from 1.3 billion yuan to 1.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
None of the overseas-funded companies from Qinghai, Tibet,
Xinjiang, Yunnan and Guizhou entered the top 500 chart, "but the
scale of the joint ventures in the central and western part of
China is on the rise," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of the overseas-funded enterprises in the
central and western parts of the country reached 51.2 billion yuan,
or 10.9 percent of the total last year, topping the 25 percent
average growth rate in the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 88.8 percent of the overseas-funded companies on the list,
or 444, are from coastal regions, compared to 456 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong was home to the most successful overseas-funded
enterprises on the list, followed by Shanghai and Jiangsu.

<HEADLINE> FAO Warns Against Food Deficiency in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) warned here today that
Mongolia faces a serious food deficiency.
</P>
<P>
A special report released as the result of a fortnight-long
mission to Mongolia said the country's economic reform had led to
significantly more poverty, greater unemployment, lower
consumption, and cuts in social services and safety-net provisions.
</P>
<P>
The FAO report said 453,000 people, or about 20 percent of the
population, can now be described as poor. The most vulnerable
143,000, requiring urgent emergency, were identified as the
jobless, the elderly, female-headed households, children and
pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people experiencing a dramatic fall in
nutritional standards was growing, the report said, and chronic
under-nutrition in children had risen to about 25 percent as poor
households shifted to cheaper and less nutritious foods.
</P>
<P>
"Without additional assistance, these groups, especially a
growing population of abandoned 'street children' will face great
hardship in the future," FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The organization estimated that food aid requirements for
1997-98 were 90,000 tons of which 23,000 tons should be emergency
food aid for the absolutely poor.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian agriculture has suffered heavily in the transition
from a centrally planned economy to a market one, and by the
withdrawal of substantial technical and economic assistance from
the former Soviet Union.

BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- World number two Michael Chang of
United States was upset by Frenchman Cedric Pioline, failing to
enter the third round at the Stuttgart Open tennis tournament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pioline's 7-5, 1-6, 6-4 victory over Chang was his first in six
career meetings. It was also a sweet avenge of the fourth round
loss to the American at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic, number five Greg Rusedski, number
six Carlos Moya and number eight Sergi Bruguera, all joined
Chang's upset fate.
</P>
<P>
Croat Invanisevic's departure was forced by a sore shoulder
when he retired with Briton Tem Henman leading 6-3, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Britian's Rusedski is one of the hottest players on the
circuit, but his superb form was stopped by a 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 loss
to German rising star Nicolas Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Moya was dispatched 6-3 7-6 by Todd Martin of the
United States while his compatriot Brugeura was beaten 7-5 7-6 by
France's Fabrice Santoro, who won in Lyon last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing University is
attracting more returned scholars and students with its rational
policies and effective measures, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or more, the university has sent 2,079
teaching staff members abroad either for advanced studies or to do
research work. To date, 1,413 have returned to the university,
becoming part of the school's "backbone" in teaching, research and
administration.
</P>
<P>
Following the principle of "encouraging those who want to study
abroad and welcoming their return after graduation," the
university has sent another 167 teachers to 25 countries for
long-term studies or research this year.
</P>
<P>
Armed with modern concepts, fresh knowledge and updated
information, the returned scholars have elevated the level of the
university's teaching and research. The teaching quality of such
disciplines as biology, chemistry, international policies and
economics have been improved so as to meet international standards
and domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
What is more, some outstanding returned scholars have been
promoted to important leading positions in the university. The
examples include President Chen Jia'er and vice-presidents Chi
Huisheng, Min Weifang, Chen Zhangliang and He Fangchuan. Another
50 returned scholars and students have become heads of departments.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the post-doctoral department in
1985, the university has admitted more than 450 post-doctoral
researchers, among whom 75 are from abroad. Most of them are
willing to stay on the campus after the completion of their
programs and their excellent work has had a positive effect on the

HAIKOU, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded businesses have
become a new force for economic growth in south China's island
province of Hainan and have contributed two-thirds of local fixed
assets investment.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 5,000 foreign-backed enterprises,
with 11 billion US dollars of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded companies had 1.5 billion yuan in industrial
output value in 1996, accounting for 23 percent of the island's
total, and 48 million US dollars in profits from exports.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is also co-operating with domestic investors to set up
10,000 companies locally, at a cost of 22 billion yuan. And seven
of 10 local leaders in industrial output value and half of the 10
export leaders are involved in overseas or domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
A local foreign-funded company, the Hainan Asia-Pacific
Brewery, has had more than 14 million yuan in output value in one
month this year.
</P>
<P>
A 50-million-yuan pharmaceutical company, funded by Chinese
investors, generated 140 million yuan in output value during the
first half of the year, a 63 percent rise from the same period in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banking System Stable: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines, in a fresh bid to ease concerns over the stability of
local banks, has reiterated that the country's banking system
remains stable and healthy due to its earlier measures to
strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the status of local banks are better than
those in neighboring countries since they have lower exposure to
the real-estate sector and higher capitalization position,
according to today's local newspaper Today.
</P>
<P>
While other countries in the region have an average
commercial-bank exposure to the real-estate sector of 12.6
percent, including trust loans ending in the first quarter of the
year, the average exposure of local commercial banks stood at a
low 3.4 percent, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said foreign-currency-deposit-unit (FCDU)
loans by local commercial banks were under control at 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars as of the end of this March.
</P>
<P>
It added that all borrowers of these FCDU loans are
structurally hedged against the risk of the current foreign
exchange rate afflicting the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The bank further supported its claim of a healthy banking
system by saying that local commercial banks' capitalization is
among the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, the relatively healthy position
of the banking sector, in part, is a reflection of the earlier
measures adopted by the monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
These measures include a higher minimum capitalization
requirement, a 20-percent cap on real-estate lending and a
30-percent liquidity cover on FCDU liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Due to the weakening peso and the country's overheating
real-estate sector, several sectors, including the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), have expressed concern over the state of the
Philippines' banking community.

<P>
BEIJING, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Facing strong competition from
the rapidly growing air and motorway sectors, China's railway
industry is set to sharpen its edge by upgrading its existing
facilities while introducing a high-speed transportation network,
Today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"A feasibility study on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed
railroad has been completed and submitted to the State Planning
Commission for further consideration," said Zhou Yimin, director
of the Science and Technology Department under the Ministry of
Railways.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement on Tuesday at a press conference for
the Modern Railways International Exhibition to be held at the
Shanghai Exhibition Center from June 2 to 6 in 1998. Its theme has
been defined as "raising the speed of passenger and freight trains
on existing lines and enhancing the capability of China in
developing technology and equipment for high-speed trains and
railways."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is expected to showcase the latest technology
and updated equipment from approximately 200 manufacturers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working around the clock on the preliminary study
for the 1,300-kilometre high-speed railway, and we have been in
discussions with companies from Japan, Germany, France, Spain and
Italy on the possible construction plan," Zhou said. "If the
project is approved, the first phase is likely to be built between
Shanghai and Nanjing in view of the economic strengthen of the
region and the short distance between the cities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Railways is expected to pour 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) into the establishment of
an advanced communications system on its current trunk lines.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Drafts Laws for Patent, Intellectual Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is in the process of
drafting laws concerning patent right, intellectual property and
industrial design, said a senior Myanmar science and technology
official.
</P>
<P>
U Aung Koe, director general of the Scientific and
Technological Research Department under the Myanmar Ministry of
Science and Technology, disclosed at a seminar on intellectual
property here Wednesday that the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) is helping his country to set up a Myanmar
Intellectual Property Office, official paper The New Light of
Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said protection and enforcement of intellectual property
would induce more inflow of foreign investment and technology,
especially at the time when Myanmar has joined the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar believes that cooperation and consultation on
intellectual property are beneficial to the participating
countries irrespective of the level of economic development by
sharing the view that the commitment to protecting and promoting
intellectual property is a vehicle for economic growth and
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, total foreign
investment in Myanmar reached 6.44 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of September this year, in which five ASEAN countries --
Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines --
shared 3.148 billion dollars in 131 projects.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which began Wednesday, was sponsored by
the WIPO in cooperation with the Myanmar Ministry of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Australia, Sweden and Myanmar as well as
officials of the WIPO participated in the seminar.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Ecuador registered
a 2 percent increase over the first half of the year, the Central
Bank reported today.
</P>
<P>
A study said that, if the effects caused by the El Nino
phenomenon do not affect agricultural output, growth by the
year-end might be 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose just 0.6 percent during
the first quarter of the year, due to the political crisis, but it
jumped 1.8 percent by June's end after political turmoil receded.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank study said agriculture grew 2.5 percent in the
first quarter, but fell 1.8 percent in the second quarter due to
production for foreign markets, primarily of banana, coffee and
cacao.
</P>
<P>
The oil and mining sector swelled 1 percent in the first
quarter thanks to a growing activity in the mines. By the second
quarter, production of oil raised 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panamana Claim of U.S. Vigilance "Plant" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian journal is
accusing the United States of installing a vigilance body under
the guise of the Anti-Drugs Multilateral Center (ADMC).
</P>
<P>
The daily "El Siglo", in today's editorial, said the U.S. was
setting about installing a hidden "watchful eye and a strong fist
of a policeman in Panama".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper wrote about the political and military
importance of the so-called enclave of the United States shortly
after the new round of talks between representatives of the two
countries began over the establishment of the ADMC.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the ADMC will work for the interchange of
information and intelligence data and facilitate military
operations in the region. It would be under the disguise of
fighting drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Raul Leis, sociologist and columnist of daily "El Panama
America", said it is difficult to accept the claim that the ADMC
is a neutral institution and dedicated only to anti-drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has repeatedly spoken of the foremost
geopolitical and strategic importance of keeping its military
presence in Panama, where it owns a solid infrastructure", said
Leis.
</P>
<P>
While one of the missions of ADMC was tackling drug-smuggling,
it also had the objective to ensure U.S. world hegemony and
national security, but in no way the interests and security of
Panama, the columnist said.
</P>
<P>
The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties require U.S. to withdraw its
troops from Panama no later than December 31, 1999 and return the
full administration of the Canal to the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
The accords were signed by Omar Torrijos and former
U.S. President James Carter.

as they sometimes use civilian transport.

However, there were no STF or security personnel in the bus.

QUITO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen cases of cholera were
detected over the last few days in Ecuador's provinces of Guayas
and Manabi, due to the pollution of drinking water, health
authorities reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Guayas, the Health Director of the province, Victor Hugo
Mite, said the 12 cases of cholera were detected in Balzar, El
Empalme and Naranjito towns.
</P>
<P>
The official said they only act on the known cases but it is
likely there are many other cases that have not been detected so
far. He stressed the importance of giving information to people
about danger of the cholera.
</P>
<P>
In the Manabi province, three cases came about in the Cojimies
town, because of the pollution of drinking water caused by a
recent flood, which have triggered outbreaks of tropical illnesses.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, in the Esmeraldas province, about 10,000
inhabitants from 20 towns suffered shortages of water, medicines
and food.

<HEADLINE> Videos on Breast Cancer Approved for Public Viewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Operators of a local cable
TV station in the San Francisco area received approval today to
air two videos that were previously deemed "inappropriate" for
family viewing.
</P>
<P>
The Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors voted 5-0 to
permit the televising of the videos that teach women how to detect
breast cancer. The supervisors also approved a measure to fund a
longer TV program on breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
More than 185,000 women in the United States suffer from breast
cancer; the disease has a much higher incident rate in the US than in
Europe or Asia. The San Francisco area on the west coast is among
regions with the highest rates of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to make lemonade out of lemons," said one of the
county supervisors, hoping the controversy would help focus
attention on breast cancer prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
Patricia Burker, the TV station's executive director, decided
not to televise one of the videos in question because it contained
five to six minutes of frontal nudity. She said it was more
appropriate for private viewing or in a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
The program's producers as well as officials for the American
Cancer Society expressed outrage that a video intended to
save women's lives was yanked for being too racy.
</P>
<P>
At the board's meeting, several breast cancer survivors said
the educational programs should be aired to help educate
women who may not able to spot the early signs of breast cancer.

for the whole of 1996, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Philippine National Police (PNP), the
Philippine Star said that kidnap-for-ransom gangs have raked in at
least 136 million pesos (4.5 million U.S. dollars) in ransom since
January this year.
</P>
<P>
The gangs have actually demanded a total of 435 million pesos
(14.5 million dollars) but the figure was lowered due to
negotiations between the victims' relatives and the kidnappers,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But during the same period last year, only 34.9 million pesos
(1.2 million dollars) were collected by the kidnapping syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The PNP Criminal Investigation Group attributed the rise in
kidnappings to the growth in the number of kidnapping groups.
</P>
<P>
CIG director Chief Superintendent Efren Fernandez was quoted as
explaining that factionalim often prompted the breakup of some
bigger and better organized syndicates.
</P>
<P>
According to Fernandez, these lesser kidnapping groups are
giving the PNP a headache since they have started targeting small
and medium-scale entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the police report, a private anti-crime watchdog
group gave more alarming statistics on kidnap-for-ransom
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The well-known Citizens Action Against Crime (CAAC) was quoted
as saying Wednesday by Philippine Daily Inquirer that a total of
116 kidnapping cases occurred in the country during the first 10
months this year.
</P>
<P>
After paying a staggering 248 million pesos (8.3 million
dollars) in ransom, 184 victims, most of them Chinese-Filipinos,
gained freedom during the period, said the CAAC, a network of 75
non-governmental anti-crime organizations.
</P>
<P>
The group said three victims are still in the hands of their
abductors for failing to pay huge ransoms.
</P>
<P>
The group warned that the number of kidnapping incidents will
rise with the advent of the Christmas season, when kidnappers are
expected to intensify activities.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reports said the official figures are
understandably smaller because many victims choose not to report
to the police in the wake of suspicions that many lawmen are
involved in kidnapping cases.
</P>
<P>
Kidnap gangs have been running rampant in the Philippines
during recent years, forcing many wealthy businessmen to live in
seclusion or just flee the country.

<HEADLINE> 9,000 People Evacuated Due to Floods in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 9,000 people
were evacuated today from along the Parana and Uruguay rivers due
to floods caused by heavy rains, the Maritime Prefecture of
Argentina reported.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture said some riverside towns are in a critical
situation and many houses are in danger of being washed away by
flood waters along stretches of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
Waters of the Uruguay River reached 13.90 meters high early
this morning, five meters above their normal level of nine
meters. They are predicted to reach 14.30 meters by midday with a
flow of 30,000 cubic meters per second, five times as much as the
normal average.
</P>
<P>
The Parana River had risen to a depth of 5.20 meters this
morning. People living in zones where there is danger of the
river overflowing were being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
There have been heavy rainfalls and hail storms in the
provinces in the past few weeks. Weather authorities say the
abnormal rains are caused by the El Nino phenomenon, which affects
South America every three or eight years; this time it's influence
is being felt throughout the world.

MOSCOW -- The Russian Yabloko faction would drop its
no-confidence motion against the government if it went through the
problem of the taxation code to the end, leader of the Yabloko
parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky told reporters that the document which his faction
considered to be "senseless and harmful" should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile voiced the strong doubt that Sergei Baburin
representing the People's Power bloc in parliament would collect
the necessary number of signatures to initiate a no-confidence
motion against the government. (Russia-Gov't-No Confidence)

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Defense Department issued an interim
policy Wednesday to request the military servicemen to turn in
their weapons to comply with a law prohibiting gun ownership by
people convicted of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
All the military's 1.4 million men and women are being required
to fill out a form to determine whether they had been convicted of
such an offense.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon expects the people affected would be in the
hundreds as most of the service members are young, unmarried and
unlikely to bring such a conviction with them, said Frank Rush,
the principal deputy assistant secretary for force management
policy. (US-Abuser-Weapons)

UNITED NATIONS -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Wednesday
presented his 2.583 billion U.S. dollars budget proposal to cover
the expenses of the United Nations during the next two years, as
the Fifth committee (Administrative and Budgetary Committee) began
its discussion of the subject.
</P>
<P>
The 2.583 billion dollars proposed budget for 1998 and 1999,
the Secretary-General's first since assuming office this year, is
20.3 million dollars less than that of the current two-year
period. The amount reflects a resource reduction of 124 million
dollars, as well as a 104 million dollars adjustment for inflation
and exchange rates prevailing in December 1996. For the next two
years, the UN chief initially proposed a staffing level of 8,839,
a reduction of 1,182 posts, including the abolition of 904 posts.

<P>
BUDAPEST, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government has
decided to stop its unprofitable production of uranium ore, local
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Mecsek Uranium Mine, the country's only one near the
southern city of Pecs, has been losing money for years, said the
latest issue of the newspaper "Heti Vilaggazdasag" (World
Economics Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The mine, which began production in 1957 with the help of the
former Soviet Union, has produced more than 20 million tons of
uranium ore, all of which have been shipped to the then Soviet
Union and now Russia for processing.
</P>
<P>
The miners stopped working on September 26 and the whole mine
will be closed down by the end of this year.

CARACAS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Venezuelan
Army said today the country will not accept military equipment
from the United States as part of the anti-drug cooperation unless
it is in good condition.

Experts are checking items of military equipment, including
aircraft and ships, that the U.S. government wants to hand over in
exchange for Venezuela's approval for entry into that country,
said the military source.

The United States said it would give logistics aid to Venezuela
for tackling drug-smuggling, but the delivery was delayed
because Venezuelan top officials said they opposed to receiving
"military junk".
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure the devices are in good condition, otherwise
they will not be accepted by Venezuela," said officials.
</P>

The aid includes two helicopters and two other aircraft, six

<HEADLINE> China Offers Vast Business Opportunities: Zeng Peiyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
are greatly benefited from the continuous expansion of their
economic and trade cooperation, said Zeng Peiyan, Executive Vice
Chairman of Chinese State Planning Commission here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation which
is visiting the U.S., expressed this at a special program arranged
by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech on "Seizing Opportunities and Initiating a
New Future", Zeng said the labor-intensive products exported to
the U.S. have created many jobs in China, as well as brought great
benefits to American retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the technology-intensive products
imported from the U.S. such airplanes, machinery, electronics and
telecommunication equipment, have created tens of thousands of
direct job opportunities and millions of indirect job
opportunities, as well as help raise the technical standards of
China's industries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far invested in 23,200 projects in China with a
total investment of 15.7 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on U.S. companies that have entered the Chinese
market, Zeng said the 1.5 billion dollar joint auto project
between General Motor and a Shanghai company started operation in
July and marked a new stage of U.S. direct investment in China.
</P>
<P>
With the phased opening of service industry in China, Zeng said,
the U.S. has become an active participant in this area.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, five U.S. banks have opened nine branches in China,
with one of them ratified to conduct domestic currency operation.
</P>
<P>
American International Group (AIG) has become the first among
the 6 foreign insurance companies approved to do business in China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I am very glad to announce here that the Chinese
government has authorized AETNA Insurance Company to initiate
life insurance service in Shanghai," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. can obtain sizable profit by exporting to China
advanced technologies in the fields of environmental protection,
peaceful use of unclear energy, automobile and energy.
</P>
<P>
China urgently needs modern communications service, advanced
transportation network, fully developed wholesale and retail
industry, said Zeng, adding that the liberalization of such
service industries in China will provide broad business
opportunities for the U.S. which has a fully-fledged tertiary
industry.

CANBERRA, October 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian dollar was sold down to its lowest level
against the greenback in two and half years yesterday as the
five-month-long Asian currency crisis deepened further. The local
dollar slumped overnight Tuesday, falling from 72.81 U.S. cents
to a low of 70.95 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Treasurer Peter Costello yesterday declared Australia a
haven from the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia, despite the
Australian dollar plunging to a two-and-half-year low after a
leading United states investment bank warned of harsh local
fallout.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard today was planning to use a
meeting with his British counterpart Tony Blair to try to avert
the Commonwealth heads of government meeting taking a tough line
on the greenhouse issue.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australia yesterday recorded its best inflation performance
for 35 years as fears about Southeast Asian crisis spilled over
into the local currency market, driving the dollar down almost two
U.S. cents to a 28-month low.

<HEADLINE> US Oil Companies Fare Well in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil Companies in the United
States reported profits increases this summer because of a roughly
3.5 percent growth in demand compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Big companies like Exxon, Texaco and Amoco saw robust
third-quarter earnings as reflected in their reports released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their net income rose 16.7 percent, 12.9 percent and 18 percent
respectively over the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of other major oil companies are also expected to show
higher earnings for the quarter, having run their refineries at
full capacity to meet the surge in demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the business boom to the decline in crude
oil prices, heavy vacation driving and growing tendency of
customers to buy sport vehicles consuming more gas instead of
conventional cars.
</P>
<P>
However, they warn that it may be difficult for the rest of the
year to see such a surge to sustain as a recent rise in crude oil
prices has a negative impact on refining profit in the first weeks
of the new quarter.

<HEADLINE> Greece Satisfied With Holbrooke's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today expressed satisfaction over the statements
made by U.S. special presidential emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke on the Turkish harassment of Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos' plane last week.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Tuesday that the harassment of a plane carrying
Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus last week was a fact, blaming
the U.S. State Department for not recognizing it outright.
</P>
<P>
Greece had kept the positive positions expressed and recorded
the negative ones, Reppas said. "What now remains to be seen is
how Washington will proceed concerning issues which are in
progress and whether Mr. Holbrooke's observations will have
practical consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos today welcomed Holbrooke's
statements, saying that Holbrooke was near to the reality and

<HEADLINE> US Oil Companies Fare Well in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil Companies in the United
States reported profits increases this summer because of a roughly
3.5 percent growth in demand compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Big companies like Exxon, Texaco and Amoco saw robust
third-quarter earnings as reflected in their reports released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Their net income rose 16.7 percent, 12.9 percent and 18 percent
respectively over the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of other major oil companies are also expected to show
higher earnings for the quarter, having run their refineries at
full capacity to meet the surge in demand for gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the business boom to the decline in crude
oil prices, heavy vacation driving and growing tendency of
customers to buy sport vehicles consuming more gas instead of
conventional cars.
</P>
<P>
However, they warn that it may be difficult for the rest of the
year to see such a surge to sustain as a recent rise in crude oil
prices has a negative impact on refining profit in the first weeks
of the new quarter.

<HEADLINE> Yabloko May Drop No-Confidence to Government: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Yabloko faction
would drop its no-confidence motion against the government if it
went through the problem of the taxation code to the end, leader
of the Yabloko parliamentary faction Grigory Yavlinsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky told reporters that the document which his faction
considered to be "senseless and harmful" should be recalled.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile voiced the strong doubt that Sergei Baburin
representing the People's Power bloc in parliament would collect
the necessary number of signatures to initiate a no-confidence
motion against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Yabloko leader noted that once the head of the government
had recalled the taxation code from the Duma, "the issue of no
confidence would have died without any concessions to communists."
</P>
<P>
If the premier of the government did not withdraw the tax code,
he added, the code's handling under the Duma's procedure would
only result in "protracting this issue."
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Igor Shabdurasulov, a government
senior spokesman, today criticized the manner of Yavlinsky as
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He told Itar-Tass in an interview that only an investigator had
the right to demand only a concrete `yes' or `no' answer to a
question, and not the leader of the Duma faction who was trying to
teach the chairman of the government how to fulfill orders of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday sent a message to Duma
faction leaders, which contained an instruction to the government
to withdraw a draft tax code from the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Communist faction, the largest in the lower house
of parliament, today withdrew its motion of no-confidence in the
government.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Concept Yields Wondrous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The operation of "one country,
two systems" between China and Hong Kong has yielded some wondrous
prospects after China's resumption of Hong Kong's sovereignty on
July 1, said Sir Peter Cazalet, president of China Britain Trade
Group.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here today, Cazalet said, "I do not wish
to dwell on the past but to look at the future. As the title of
this seminar suggests, it is the future that interests us all the
most."
</P>
<P>
The seminar dealt in detail with issues relating to the
historic event, including Hong Kong's financial autonomy after the
handover, its role as a springboard into China and the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Cazalet stressed the enormous combined economic potential of a
China reintegrated with Hong Kong by quoting a research by Boeing
as saying that "over the next decade, China and Hong Kong between
them will buy 1,900 commercial aircraft at a cost of about 124
billion US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Not only will this make China the world's largest market for
commercial aircraft, but "I am right in saying that orders on this
scale are unprecedented anywhere, any time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 15th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party,
Cazalet said it is the most significant event to have happened in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the pronouncements by Chinese leaders "have
put beyond any doubt whatsoever China's intended path to become an
increasingly open, market-driven economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-British relations in future, Cazalet said, "The prime
minister, the foreign secretary and the president of the Board of
Trade are all due to visit China in 1998."
</P>
<P>
"This sends exactly the right signal to China about the
importance the UK attaches to its relationship with China," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Satisfied With Holbrooke's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas today expressed satisfaction over the statements
made by U.S. special presidential emissary for Cyprus Richard
Holbrooke on the Turkish harassment of Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos' plane last week.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Tuesday that the harassment of a plane carrying
Tsohatzopoulos to and from Cyprus last week was a fact, blaming
the U.S. State Department for not recognizing it outright.
</P>
<P>
Greece had kept the positive positions expressed and recorded
the negative ones, Reppas said. "What now remains to be seen is
how Washington will proceed concerning issues which are in
progress and whether Mr. Holbrooke's observations will have
practical consequences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsohatzopoulos today welcomed Holbrooke's
statements, saying that Holbrooke was near to the reality and
"this confirms his credibility as a mediator."
</P>
<P>
Greece strongly condemned the statements by U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin as "unprecedented and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, Rubin said that Tsohatzopoulos' flight to Cyprus
for military exercises was "an overflight that violated an agreed
up moratorium."

LONDON October 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Emeka Anyaok has urged Nigeria, whose Commonwealth
membership has been suspended, not to send a delegation to the
Edinburgh Commonwealth Summit to be held later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief made the appeal a day after the Nigerian
government demanded a hearing when Commonwealth leaders discuss
Nigeria's suspended membership.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth spokesman Michael Fathers was quoted by the
Reuters as saying today, "He (Anyaok) sent a letter today to
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi strongly urging that no
Nigerian delegation should travel to Edinburgh."
</P>
<P>
"The letter points out that as Nigeria is suspended it cannot
participate in Commonwealth meetings. Nigeria's attendance would
require the agreement of all participants of the meeting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister said in a letter to Anyaoku that
"Nigeria should not be tried in absentia. We have therefore
concluded arrangements in Nigeria for our delegation to fly direct
from Abuja straight to Edinburgh" when the Commonwealth discusses
the Nigeria issue.

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Air Force T-38 Talon jet
trainer crashed today after an in-flight collision with an F-16
Fighting Falcon fighter jet at Edwards Air Base in southern
California, the Air Force announced.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 crashed shortly after the midair collision at Edwards
Air Force Base at 10 a.m. local time (1700 GMT) and the F-16 has
reportedly landed, but there is no immediately report on the
status of the crews, said an Air Force statement released at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The T-38 is a two-seater training jet, and the F-16 is a
single-seat jet.
</P>
<P>
The incident came just weeks after Secretary of Defense William
Cohen ordered all the services to perform safety "stand-downs" and
review their training procedures after a rash of air crashes.
</P>
<P>
On September 13, an Air Force C-141 transport crashed off the
coast of Africa. The next day, an F-117A Stealth fighter broke up
in flight at an air show in Maryland. The day after that a Navy
F-18 went down in Oman, and a Marine Corps F-18 crashed off North
Carolina.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton are hoping a White House
conference will raise awareness of the need for higher quality
child care.
</P>
<P>
In previewing the first-ever White House Conference on Child
Care to be held Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said today the meeting
would examine the full range of available options.
</P>
<P>
While promising the president would announce some policy moves,
including the possibility of federal subsidies in the future, she
said that much of the job, including licensing and training, falls
to the states and private industry.
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said it
wasn't really a question of needing a lot more cash and often
small amounts of training or harsher licensing requirements showed
marked improvements.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton was "very
keen on stimulating a national discussion," and that the first
couple hoped the meeting "will call national attention to an issue
policymakers historically have ignored."
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of American families with young children use
some form of child care and most are not pleased with it,
according to a Parents Magazine poll released today.
</P>
<P>
The random poll of some 2,000 parents generated 450 responses
that were projected nationally.

<HEADLINE> SAP Profits Soar by 86 Percent in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading software company
SAP AG today reported its pre-tax profits soared by 86 percent to
251 million marks (140 million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The German company is expecting continued good performance in
the fourth quarter and the pre-tax profits for the year to hit a
record of about 1.5 billion marks (837 million dollars), up 50
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The good news today sent SAP shares up 4.3 percent to close at
526 marks (293 dollars).
</P>
<P>
SAP attributed the explosive growth to the current strong
demand for standard software products R/2 and R/3 and the
continuing strength of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, data showed that the company gained
833 million marks (465 million dollars) in pre-tax profits, up
almost one-third over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The result was achieved on turnover of 3.8 billion marks (2.12
billion dollars), up 61 percent from the same period last year.
The figure was compared with a total of 3.7 billion marks 2.06
billion dollars) for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The German information technology firm said it expected that it
could get a listing on the United States stock market in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
SAP, specializing in software used for running businesses, has
registered remarkable growth over recent years. It is Europe's
biggest and most profitable software makers and the only
non-American player among the world's top five software companies.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in rural Walldorf, will have 12,800
employees at the end of this year, compared with 9,200 at the end
of 1996.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Decline on Wall Street, Hong Kong Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all fell heavily Wednesday, undermined by UK's uncertain position
on the European single currency, profit- taking on Wall Street and
continued big fall in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index on the London market suffered the steepest
decline in two months and ended 77.1 points lower at 5,148.8 amid
a sharp downturn in index futures.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that weakness on Wall Street, heavy selling in
Singapore and further jitters in Hong Kong also weighed on market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The index was dragged down by a sharp fall of shares of Hong
Kong-linked firms such as HSBC Holdings, Cable &AMP; wireless and
Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
Subdued retail sales figures in September failed to cheer the
market as the figures were clouded by several factors, including
the impact of shops closing for the funeral of Diana, Princess of
Wales.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt failed to sustain its early gains
and ended well below their best levels as traders reported
disappointment at low volumes and a weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index closed up 31.95 points at 4,171.45. However,
in later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,124.86,
47.61 points lower.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris dropped back below the 3,000 level to
end 31.83 points down at 2,958.06. Concerns about the near-term
outlook for European interest rates and weak bonds weighed on the
market.

UNITED NATIONS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- As the world was
developing towards globalization and integration, the varieties of
cultures should be respected, Chinese delegate Cui Ying said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly,
Cui said culture had been playing a more and more important role
in the international relations and the international society had
attached greater importance to the relationship between culture
and development.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the world was so colorful because all countries and
nationalities had their own cultures. Exchanges of cultures
between different countries had reached an unprecedented level in
depth and width.
</P>
<P>
Cui said culture and development were interdependent. Culture
reflected a country's fundamental characteristics of economy and
politics and it helped to promote the development of economy and
politics.
</P>
<P>
Cui said UNESCO would hold its 29th session soon. China hoped
that the session would recommend measures for the further
development of culture in the future.

<HEADLINE> US House Passes Stopgap Bill For Government Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted overwhelmingly for a stopgap bill today to
keep government running.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the legislation by voice vote to keep the
government functioning through November 7 when lawmakers hope to
adjourn for the year.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said the U.S. Senate probably
would vote on the measure Thursday when an earlier stopgap bill
expires.
</P>
<P>
The bill is needed because only five of the 13 spending bills
for fiscal 1998 that began October 1 have been enacted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congressional leaders hope the extension will give
lawmakers enough time to strike compromises among themselves and
with Clinton on lingering budgetary issues.
</P>
<P>
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston said
today that he hopes the congress can get onto completing its work
on the budget by November 7.
</P>
<P>
On the last days of fiscal 1997 which ended on September 30,
the U.S. Congress passed a stopgap spending bill to let federal
agencies function through October 23 and President Clinton signed
the measure.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky Announces China Insurance License to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Charlene Barshefsky, the
U.S. Trade Representative, today announced that China has approved
the application for Aetna to operate a joint venture insurance
operation in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Office of U.S. Trade Representative said
confirmation of the action on Aetna's application came at a
meeting in New York City by the China Economic and Trade
Delegation, a group of high level officials visiting this country
to seek commercial contracts with U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many U.S. firms have already established
representative offices in China, but they have not been permitted
to open business operations there. Aetna, the third largest
insurance company for life and health in the United States in
1996, becomes the second U.S. insurer to operate in China.
</P>
<P>
"Aetna is one of a number of U.S. insurance companies which
have been seeking a license to enter the large China market for
years," noted Barshefsky. "While we certainly welcome this news,
an economy as large and competitive as China's must undertake
further substantial market-opening actions, including in the
insurance and financial services sectors."

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Tax Modernization in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 2.7
million U.S. dollar loan to Peru to help improve its tax system.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be used to assist the Nation Tax
Administration Service in the development of an integrated audit
system, the establishment of an electronic tax payment system, and
information systems enhancements.
</P>
<P>
The program, the third phase of IDB-backed modernization of
Peru's tax system, is designed to apply a realistic tax level to
contributors based on wealth and incorporate new taxpayers who
have the ability to pay but are not now paying.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financed the tax reform effort in Peru with 5 million
dollars in 1991 and, in 1994, 2.2 million dollars from the
Japanese Fund, which is administered by the IDB. Apart from the
IDB loan, local counterpart will contribute a total of 2.16
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Turkey against Building Tension with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States was
concerned on Wednesday that Turkish fighter jets had buzzed the
plane of the Greek defense minister on his way back from military
exercises over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear to our Turkish allies the seriousness with
which we view the information we have received and the need to
ensure that any future Turkish activities do not contribute to an
atmosphere of tension between Turkey and its neighbors," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
It is important that Turkey and Greece both ensure that a
Turkish military exercise scheduled for early November does not
trigger a new confrontation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also repeated a U.S. call on the two NATO allies to
continue their promise of banning flights of combat aircraft over
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Greek defense ministry said earlier that two pairs of
Turkish F-16s buzzed the plane carrying Defense Minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos from Cyprus, as it flew about 80 miles southeast
of the Aegean island of Rhodes. The Turkish planes were
intercepted by eight Greek fighter jets, it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Hold Peace Talks between Afghan Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
intended to use a de facto cease-fire among warring factions in
Afghanistan to step up efforts for a negotiated peace, a senior
U.S. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian
Affairs, told a Senate foreign relations subcommittee that U.S.
officials had talked with Russia, China and four other nations
bordering Afghanistan to determine ways to progress toward an
accord. And Britain and Japan will also be involved, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that any side can win a military victory,"
Inderfurth said. "In our view all sides must recognize the
futility of fighting."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is neutral in the Afghanistan
conflict but wants a multiparty government to emerge from any
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While Inderfurth mentioned a "faint hope" for peace, another
witness, Zalmay Khalilzad, an analyst with the Rand Corp., said
prospects are not good. Part of the problem, he said, is the
Taliban, bent on a military victory, will not make a realistic
assessment of its recent setbacks and the resulting stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Taliban, which controls three-quarters of
Afghanistan, lost a key northern town to an opposition coalition.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Presents his 1998-1999 Budget Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2.583 billion dollars proposed budget for 1998 and 1999,
the Secretary-General's first since assuming office this year, is
20.3 million dollars less than that of the current two-year
period. The amount reflects a resource reduction of 124 million
dollars, as well as a 104 million dollars adjustment for
inflation and exchange rates prevailing in December 1996. For
the next two years, the UN chief initially proposed a staffing
level of 8,839, a reduction of 1,182 posts, including the
abolition of 904 posts.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the initial proposal was
formulated according to the priorities set for the Organization
last year when the General Assembly adopted the medium-term plan
for the period from 1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The total United Nations budget consists of the regular
budget and the extrabudgetary resources. But it is on the basis
of the regular budget that states' contribution are determined.
Each state is charged at a proportionate share of the budget
based on the scale of assessment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Global Warming Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today unveiled his proposals to curb the global warming,
suggesting gradual, mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases in a
longer time than the Europeans and environmentalists suggested.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan calls on U.S. industries to begin a path toward
reducing carbon emissions as soon as possible to bring them to
1990 levels over the next dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal falls short of what the Europeans have demanded
and what many environmentalists have said is needed to address the
warming threat.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists as well as the Europeans have urged more
aggressive controls, including emission reductions of 15 percent
below 1990 level beginning on a limited basis as early as 2005.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said four years ago that the United States through
voluntary efforts could cap carbon emissions at 1990 levels by the
end of the decade, but emissions have been growing and are now
expected to exceed 1990 levels by 13 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said today, "It would
be unrealistic to attempt to reach -- by the year 2000 -- 1990
levels on emissions... because it would most likely wreck the
world economy if you attempted to do that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's basic theme is that global warming concerns can be
addressed through technology innovations and without new energy
taxes.
</P>
<P>
His proposal, which will serve as the U.S. position at
negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, in December, calls for industrial
nations to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels in the 2008-2012
time period and over the following five years make further
reductions.
</P>
<P>
It also would create a 5 billion U.S. dollars package of tax
breaks to spur energy efficiency and development of new energy
technologies that would allow a gradual shift away from fossil
fuels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it would provide credits for industries that make
early emission reductions; develop an emissions trading program
among U.S. companies and among industrial nations to reduce costs
of carbon reductions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for an agreement among industrial nations to
stabilize greenhouse gases over five years beginning in 2008
followed by unspecified reductions between 2012 and 2017.
Countries would be able to average annual emissions within the
five-year periods, allowing them to postpone reductions in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged developing countries to make some commitment
on the matter before a treaty would be ratified and put into
effect.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not adopt binding obligations without
developing-country participation," the White House said.
</P>
<P>
But developing countries suggest the industrial countries to
take the initiatives to curb the greenhouse gases as they are the
major gas creators. The United States alone currently accounts
for a quarter of all greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Shelton: U.S. Shares Little of NATO Expansion Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States share of
costs involved in expanding NATO would have little impact on the
nation's military spending, U.S. military chief told Congress
today.
</P>
<P>
"These costs are less than one tenth of one percent of the
Department of Defense budget," said General Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"What we gain from that, in terms of the NATO collective
security, I think, fully justifies that type of an expenditure,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been invited to
become full NATO members by 1999 and other Eastern European
nations, including Slovenia and Romania, also want to join the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is scheduled to ratify the expansion treaty
next spring. But some Senators expressed concern that the costs to
American taxpayers could be greater than predicted by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimates that the total cost would be 27 billion
to 35 billion U.S. dollars. The three candidate nations would bear
much of the cost, with the rest shared by NATO members. The U.S.
share is put at about 200 million dollars over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The costs are to be determined at a NATO meeting in Brussels in
mid-December.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Opens in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The last preparatory meeting for
the global climate change conference in Kyoto in December opened
here today, with hope still remote for a breakthrough in setting
greenhouse gas emission limits for industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
Conference chairman Raul Estrada-Oyula from Argentina said more
could have been expected from Washington. The United States, along
with Japan, has been blamed for the failure to reach an accord on
how to reduce greenhouse emissions, which is linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commitment to reducing emissions was crucial to
reaching any agreement on the issue. The world's largest economy,
with only five percent of the world's population, produced 25
percent of the world's greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been opposing the European Union proposal for a
15 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by the year
2010 and instead urging mandatory targets for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the issue later today, U.S. President Bill
Clinton left out the call for mandatory targets for developing
countries, but his proposal for U.S. emission reduction fell short
of Europeans' goal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. would try to reduce emissions to 1990
levels between 2009 and 2012, with further reductions over the
following five-year period.
</P>
<P>
U.S. emissions are currently 8.3 percent higher than 1990
levels.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also noted that the U.S. would not accept binding
limitations unless the developing countries participated
meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
His announced plan will be pursued by U.S. negotiators at the
Kyoto ministerial meeting on climate change.
</P>
<P>
As host of the Kyoto summit, Japan has suggested that a five
percent decline from the 1990 levels as a base for reducing
emissions, with individual countries being allowed to set their
own targets.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has met criticism from Europeans who said it was
too weak.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 officials from all over the world are attending
the current meeting in Bonn, which will last 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Blair Calls for Closer Commonwealth Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair urged here today for closer Commonwealth economic and trade
cooperation in an effort to revitalize the institution
encompassing 54 nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business forum on eve of the Edinburgh
Commonwealth summit due to be held on October 24-27, Blair said
that all the Commonwealth member states should set out "a vision
for a new Commonwealth"
</P>
<P>
"I am determined that it should be a historic turning point for
the Commonwealth. An opportunity to modernize the institution and
prepare it for a new century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling for more concrete trade cooperation among Commonwealth
countries, Blair said, "The Commonwealth should not be reluctant
to take on an economic role and an economic profile."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Commonwealth countries could do more business if
they take more the following advantages: common language, many
share practices and similar legal and accounting system.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Edinburgh declaration will be an economic
declaration to set out our attitude to trade, to business and to
investment," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister also announced that his Labor
government would privatize the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) so it could raise substantial extra money on
financial markets to inject more investment in poorer Commonwealth
countries.
</P>
<P>
The CDC has 1.6 billion pounds (about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars)
invested in more than 400 private-sector projects in 54 countries,
ranging from tea plantations in Uganda to software development in
India.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Requests Domestic Abusers to Drop Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
issued an interim policy today to request the military servicemen
to turn in their weapons to comply with a law prohibiting gun
ownership by people convicted of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
All the military's 1.4 million men and women are being required
to fill out a form to determine whether they had been convicted of
such an offense.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon expects the people affected would be in the
hundreds as most of the service members are young, unmarried and
unlikely to bring such a conviction with them, said Frank Rush,
the principal deputy assistant secretary for force management
policy,
</P>
<P>
Rush said there would be no exemption for people who are in
potential combat zones, such as Bosnia, but that he did not expect
the new policy to "adversely impact military readiness."
</P>
<P>
The discharge will affect anyone convicted after September 30,
1996, the date that the law was passed. If the conviction was
before that date, their guns will be taken away. But those people
will be allowed to appeal the older convictions or even apply for
a pardon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Civilians who carry firearms, such as criminal investigators or
Pentagon police who work for the military, also come under the
law.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Sign Letters for Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The China Huaneng Group, a
leading power development company of the country, signed
agreements here today with two major U.S. companies for
facilitating the Dezhou Power Plant of eastern China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
This is one of a number of signings brought by a high-level
Chinese trade delegation prior to the official U.S. visit of the
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Sources said they have in their
hands a potential purchasing list worth more than 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two signings this afternoon involved two memorandum of
understanding to negotiate the contract for the design and
construction of a major expansion project of the power station,
which is planning to install a twin 660 megawatt (MW) generators.
</P>
<P>
The first one was signed with the Foster Wheeler Corporation,
the New Jersey-based leading U.S. company, which is intended to
provide highly technical boilers for the Chinese plant.
</P>
<P>
The other was signed between the Chinese company and the power
systems section of the General Electric Company, the major
manufacturer of power generators in the world.
</P>
<P>
Both of these two American companies were selected by the
Chinese after a series of bidding efforts, according to officials
of the project.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, Executive Vice Chairman of the State Planning
Commission, who headed the Chinese delegation, said these two
American companies have set deep roots in China and now have also
set up good examples for other American investors.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Chinese delegation came with a very
serious intention to narrow the trade gap between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the two American companies would take a
long-term point of view and offer more competitive terms in their
further discussions with the Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, with the help of the China National Technical
Import and Export Corporation, are expected to sign their final
contracts in Beijing later this year.
</P>
<P>
Del Williamson, President of the Global Sales, GE's Power
Systems, said that the signing represents a significant milestone
in its supplying of power equipment and services in China.
</P>
<P>
Henri Bartoli, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Foster
Wheeler Energy International, Inc., said China is now its largest
market. They will be committed in providing their best technology,
equipment and services on the market.
</P>
<P>
Foster Wheeler Energy International, Inc. began its large-scale
investment in China in late 1980s. It has won reputation for its
technology of enabling it boilers emit no pollutants. Its combined
investment in China has topped one billion U.S. dollars. One of
its noticeable project in China was the Yangcheng Power Station in
Shanxi Province signed in August, 1996, for which it will provide
power for six 350 MW generators. The project is expected to be
completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
GE traces its investment in China back to 1917, when it
installed two steam turbines in Yangshupu Power Plant in Shanghai.
Now there will be 56 GE steam turbines and 78 GE-technology gas
turbines installed or on order for power plants in China.

in Nanjin, China.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was held here today between visiting YMGC
president and general manager Huang Xiaoping and Ford vice
president and Ford China Operations president Vaughn A.
Koshkarian.
</P>
<P>
The 50/50 joint venture will make multivalve engines in the

various models of vehicles currently manufactured by YMGC, one of
China's pioneer vehicle manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
With total investment at 250 million U.S. dollars, the joint
venture will also form a technical development center for engine
localization and development.
</P>
<P>
Based in Nanjin, capital of Jiangsu Province, YMGC is presently
the largest light-duty manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
Ford officials said their company, U.S.' second largest car
manufacturer, has its history in China to be dating back to 1913
when it began selling Model T cars.
</P>
<P>
Ford's cooperation with the Chinese auto industry has
developed significantly over the past several years with five
other component ventures established, according to Ford's
officials.
</P>
<P>
They said Ford attaches importance to training Chinese
personnel with more than 300 Chinese engineers having received
training by Ford.

<P>
The joint venture "is clear evidence of Ford's commitment to
the Chinese people for the long term," said William Clay Ford, Jr.
chairman of Ford's Finance Committee.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Offers Vast Business Opportunities: Zeng Peiyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
are greatly benefited from the continuous expansion of their
economic and trade cooperation, said Zeng Peiyan, Executive Vice
Chairman of Chinese State Planning Commission here tonight.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Delegation which
is visiting the U.S., expressed this at a special program arranged
by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech on "Seizing Opportunities and Initiating a
New Future", Zeng said the labor-intensive products exported to
the U.S. have created many jobs in China, as well as brought great
benefits to American retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the technology-intensive products
imported from the U.S. such airplanes, machinery, electronics and
telecommunication equipment, have created tens of thousands of
direct job opportunities and millions of indirect job
opportunities, as well as help raise the technical standards of
China's industries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has so far invested in 23,200 projects in China with a
total investment of 15.7 billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling on U.S. companies that have entered the Chinese
market, Zeng said the 1.5 billion dollar joint auto project
between General Motor and a Shanghai company started operation in
July and marked a new stage of U.S. direct investment in China.
</P>
<P>
With the phased opening of service industry in China, Zeng said,
the U.S. has become an active participant in this area.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, five U.S. banks have opened nine branches in China,
with one of them ratified to conduct domestic currency operation.
</P>
<P>
American International Group (AIG) has become the first among
the 6 foreign insurance companies approved to do business in China,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I am very glad to announce here that the Chinese
government has authorized AETNA Insurance Company to initiate
life insurance service in Shanghai," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. can obtain sizable profit by exporting to China
advanced technologies in the fields of environmental protection,
peaceful use of unclear energy, automobile and energy.
</P>
<P>
China urgently needs modern communications service, advanced
transportation network, fully developed wholesale and retail
industry, said Zeng, adding that the liberalization of such
service industries in China will provide broad business
opportunities for the U.S. which has a fully-fledged tertiary
industry.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Opens in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The last preparatory meeting for
the global climate change conference in Kyoto in December opened
here today, with hope still remote for a breakthrough in setting
greenhouse gas emission limits for industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
Conference chairman Raul Estrada-Oyula from Argentina said more
could have been expected from Washington. The United States, along
with Japan, has been blamed for the failure to reach an accord on
how to reduce greenhouse emissions, which is linked to global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commitment to reducing emissions was crucial to
reaching any agreement on the issue. The world's largest economy,
with only five percent of the world's population, produced 25
percent of the world's greenhouse emissions.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been opposing the European Union proposal for a
15 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by the year
2010 and instead urging mandatory targets for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the issue later today, U.S. President Bill
Clinton left out the call for mandatory targets for developing
countries, but his proposal for U.S. emission reduction fell short
of Europeans' goal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. would try to reduce emissions to 1990
levels between 2009 and 2012, with further reductions over the
following five-year period.
</P>
<P>
U.S. emissions are currently 8.3 percent higher than 1990
levels.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also noted that the U.S. would not accept binding
limitations unless the developing countries participated
meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
His announced plan will be pursued by U.S. negotiators at the
Kyoto ministerial meeting on climate change.
</P>
<P>
As host of the Kyoto summit, Japan has suggested that a five
percent decline from the 1990 levels as a base for reducing
emissions, with individual countries being allowed to set their
own targets.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has met criticism from Europeans who said it was
too weak.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 officials from all over the world are attending
the current meeting in Bonn, which will last 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Requests Domestic Abusers to Drop Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
issued an interim policy today to request the military servicemen
to turn in their weapons to comply with a law prohibiting gun
ownership by people convicted of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
All the military's 1.4 million men and women are being required
to fill out a form to determine whether they had been convicted of
such an offense.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon expects the people affected would be in the
hundreds as most of the service members are young, unmarried and
unlikely to bring such a conviction with them, said Frank Rush,
the principal deputy assistant secretary for force management
policy,
</P>
<P>
Rush said there would be no exemption for people who are in
potential combat zones, such as Bosnia, but that he did not expect
the new policy to "adversely impact military readiness."
</P>
<P>
The discharge will affect anyone convicted after September 30,
1996, the date that the law was passed. If the conviction was
before that date, their guns will be taken away. But those people
will be allowed to appeal the older convictions or even apply for
a pardon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Civilians who carry firearms, such as criminal investigators or
Pentagon police who work for the military, also come under the
law.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The China Huaneng Group, a
leading power development company of the country, signed
agreements here today with two major U.S. companies for
facilitating the Dezhou Power Plant of eastern China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
This is one of a number of signings brought by a high-level
Chinese trade delegation prior to the official U.S. visit of the
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Sources said they have in their
hands a potential purchasing list worth more than 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two signings this afternoon involved two memorandum of
understanding to negotiate the contract for the design and

Both of these two American companies were selected by the
Chinese after a series of bidding efforts, according to officials
of the project.

</P>
<P>
He also said that the Chinese delegation came with a very
serious intention to narrow the trade gap between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the two American companies would take a
long-term point of view and offer more competitive terms in their
further discussions with the Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>

Import and Export Corporation, are expected to sign their final
contracts in Beijing later this year.
</P>

Shanxi Province signed in August, 1996, for which it will provide
power for six 350 MW generators. The project is expected to be
completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
GE traces its investment in China back to 1917, when it
installed two steam turbines in Yangshupu Power Plant in Shanghai.
Now there will be 56 GE steam turbines and 78 GE-technology gas
turbines installed or on order for power plants in China.

control of government troops, the Sudanese news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the agency, General Mohamed Sounssi Ahmed,
deputy Chief of Staff in charge of security and intelligence, and
spokesman of the Sudanese armed forces, denied western media
reports that areas surrounding Juba are in the hands of Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang, the largest
rebel faction in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
There were allegations recently from the SPLA that it had
controlled the river-course on the White Nile to Juba, but the
military spokesman said that the alleged rebel control of the
river-course was mere fabrications.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed confirmed the arrival of tugboats in Juba Tuesday, saying
that the tugboats, carrying supplies and foodstuffs from the
government to its troops in Juba, had not encountered any
resistance at Costi, the main port along the White Nile which is
the only course to Southern Sudan up to Juba.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also refuted allegations by the rebel movement
that it had controlled Eastern Equatoria State and inflicting
heavy losses upon government troops in the town of Toreet.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has claimed lives of over one million since
1983 when the southern rebels took up arms for greater autonomy
from the Islamic north for the Christian and Animist
south.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Hold Peace Talks between Afghan Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
intended to use a de facto cease-fire among warring factions in
Afghanistan to step up efforts for a negotiated peace, a senior
U.S. official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for South Asian
Affairs, told a Senate foreign relations subcommittee that U.S.
officials had talked with Russia, China and four other nations
bordering Afghanistan to determine ways to progress toward an
accord. And Britain and Japan will also be involved, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that any side can win a military victory,"
Inderfurth said. "In our view all sides must recognize the
futility of fighting."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is neutral in the Afghanistan
conflict but wants a multiparty government to emerge from any
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While Inderfurth mentioned a "faint hope" for peace, another
witness, Zalmay Khalilzad, an analyst with the Rand Corp., said
prospects are not good. Part of the problem, he said, is the
Taliban, bent on a military victory, will not make a realistic
assessment of its recent setbacks and the resulting stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Taliban, which controls three-quarters of
Afghanistan, lost a key northern town to an opposition coalition.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat will start visit Europe next Thursday
to meet European leaders on the latest development in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
His European tour starts in France and includes Germany, the
PNA-run Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and Arab countries have called for an active European
role in the peace process to balance U.S. mediation efforts which
have been accused of being in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which were suspended due
to Israel's settlement plans in Arab's East Jerusalem in March,
were resumed earlier this month after the mediation by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The JMCC also reported that the PNA reviewed the recent
development in the Palestinian-Israeli talks in its weekly cabinet
meeting this evening in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed the cabinet about the outcome of his meeting
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai last night.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour meeting was held at Arafat's guest house on the
Palestinian side of the Erez checkpoint Between Jerusalem and Gaza
for two hours and the two leaders agreed to resume cooperation on
all security matters between the PNA and Israel.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Presents his 1998-1999 Budget Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2.583 billion dollars proposed budget for 1998 and 1999,
the Secretary-General's first since assuming office this year, is
20.3 million dollars less than that of the current two-year
period. The amount reflects a resource reduction of 124 million
dollars, as well as a 104 million dollars adjustment for
inflation and exchange rates prevailing in December 1996. For
the next two years, the UN chief initially proposed a staffing
level of 8,839, a reduction of 1,182 posts, including the
abolition of 904 posts.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the initial proposal was
formulated according to the priorities set for the Organization
last year when the General Assembly adopted the medium-term plan
for the period from 1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The total United Nations budget consists of the regular
budget and the extrabudgetary resources. But it is on the basis

<HEADLINE> Syria: Resumption of Neogitations Depends on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdul
Halim Khaddam reiterated today that the resumption of negotiations
with Israel is tied to current Israeli government's approval of
commitments made by its former Labor government.
</P>
<P>
In an address at a meeting of heads of the ruling Ba'ath Party
regional bureaux and governors, Khaddam said the resumption of
negotiations depends upon Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan
Heights on the basis of 1967 borders as well as balanced and equal
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel snatched from Syria the Golan Heights during the June 5
War in 1967 and its parliament adopted law annexing the
1,200 square kilometers territory.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli labor government informally agreed to return the
Golan Heights to Syria in the final peaceful arrangements between
the two rival neighbors. But the current Likud-led government has
insisted on the annexation of the occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian news agency reported that Khaddam said Syria's
attitude toward the peace process does not change. Syria, he
said, has repeatedly announced its adherence to the option of just
and comprehensive peace that will completely restore the lands and
rights of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said the peace process is currently stalled due to
Israel's hostile policies and practices of maintaining its
occupation of Syria's lands.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president criticized Israel for its attempts to
magnify its military might as well as its alliance with Turkey.
He said that by doing so, Israel is trying to impose its hegemony
and control of the Arab land and the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey signed two military training agreements early
last year to allow their warplanes to be trained in each other's
airspace. The two countries and the United States have planned to
hold a joint military drill on November 16.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils Global Warming Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today unveiled his proposals to curb the global warming,
suggesting gradual, mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases in a
longer time than the Europeans and environmentalists suggested.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan calls on U.S. industries to begin a path toward
reducing carbon emissions as soon as possible to bring them to
1990 levels over the next dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal falls short of what the Europeans have demanded
and what many environmentalists have said is needed to address the
warming threat.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists as well as the Europeans have urged more
aggressive controls, including emission reductions of 15 percent
below 1990 level beginning on a limited basis as early as 2005.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said four years ago that the United States through
voluntary efforts could cap carbon emissions at 1990 levels by the
end of the decade, but emissions have been growing and are now
expected to exceed 1990 levels by 13 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said today, "It would
be unrealistic to attempt to reach -- by the year 2000 -- 1990
levels on emissions... because it would most likely wreck the
world economy if you attempted to do that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's basic theme is that global warming concerns can be
addressed through technology innovations and without new energy
taxes.
</P>
<P>
His proposal, which will serve as the U.S. position at
negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, in December, calls for industrial
nations to stabilize emissions at 1990 levels in the 2008-2012
time period and over the following five years make further
reductions.
</P>
<P>
It also would create a 5 billion U.S. dollars package of tax
breaks to spur energy efficiency and development of new energy
technologies that would allow a gradual shift away from fossil
fuels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it would provide credits for industries that make
early emission reductions; develop an emissions trading program
among U.S. companies and among industrial nations to reduce costs
of carbon reductions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for an agreement among industrial nations to
stabilize greenhouse gases over five years beginning in 2008
followed by unspecified reductions between 2012 and 2017.
Countries would be able to average annual emissions within the
five-year periods, allowing them to postpone reductions in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged developing countries to make some commitment
on the matter before a treaty would be ratified and put into
effect.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will not adopt binding obligations without
developing-country participation," the White House said.
</P>
<P>
But developing countries suggest the industrial countries to
take the initiatives to curb the greenhouse gases as they are the
major gas creators. The United States alone currently accounts
for a quarter of all greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Repatriates 400,000 Illegal Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 400,000 illegal
foreign residents in Saudi Arabia took advantage of a three-month
amnesty ending October 17 to leave for their home countries
without punishment, a senior Saudi official said today.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of the Interior Ministry's passports
department, Asaad Abdel Karim Al-Freih was quoted by Kuwait
News Agency in Saudi capital city of Riyadh as saying that
during the period, "400,000 illegal residents were allowed to
leave the country voluntarily and without penalty."
</P>
<P>
He also said that all illegal residents who reported to the
authorities within the period but could not be able to leave
because of transport problems were exempted from penalties.
</P>
<P>
He also said that so far 166,755 people have been able to
readjust their residency conditions and changed sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners make up one-third of Saudi population of 18
million. No official figures of illegal residents are available
but independent sources put the numbers of illegal residents in
the kingdom at 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudi newspapers said the illegal laborers mainly
fall into three categories including those who entered the
kingdom with a "free visa" and were later set free by their
sponsors after arrival, those who deserted their sponsors as well
as those who overstayed after their visiting or residence visa
expired.
</P>
<P>
The majority of illegal residents are pilgrims who visited the
kingdom for the Haj season and stayed on after the expiry of their
Haj visa.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities announced in July a three-month period
allowing the illegal residents leave without penalties and warned
that those who did not leave the country voluntarily in the period
would face punishments of up to six months in jail and a maximum
fine of up to 100,000 Saudi riyals (26,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Saudi nationals who have given shelter to overstayers and
people who breach residence and labor laws also risk being
fined up to 50,000 riyals (13,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities launched a crackdown on illegal foreign
laborers at the end of the three-month amnesty period as reports
said patrols from the immigration department have raided about
2,000 workplaces throughout the kingdom in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
But Al-Freih said so far no illegal residents were arrested
because "they all knew that our campaign was serious and that it
was impossible to stay in the country in an illegal manner."
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Interior Ministry said Monday night that
"citizens and expatriates were positively responding to calls for
cooperation issued by the ministry."
</P>
<P>
The departure of large numbers of unlicensed workers would
help regulate the local employment and labor market and boost
the country's Saudization plans, Saudi economists said.

<HEADLINE> Shelton: U.S. Shares Little of NATO Expansion Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States share of
costs involved in expanding NATO would have little impact on the
nation's military spending, U.S. military chief told Congress
today.
</P>
<P>
"These costs are less than one tenth of one percent of the
Department of Defense budget," said General Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"What we gain from that, in terms of the NATO collective
security, I think, fully justifies that type of an expenditure,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been invited to
become full NATO members by 1999 and other Eastern European
nations, including Slovenia and Romania, also want to join the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is scheduled to ratify the expansion treaty
next spring. But some Senators expressed concern that the costs to
American taxpayers could be greater than predicted by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimates that the total cost would be 27 billion
to 35 billion U.S. dollars. The three candidate nations would bear
much of the cost, with the rest shared by NATO members. The U.S.
share is put at about 200 million dollars over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The costs are to be determined at a NATO meeting in Brussels in
mid-December.
