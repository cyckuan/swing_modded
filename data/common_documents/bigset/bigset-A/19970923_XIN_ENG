<HEADLINE> Seminar: China's Environment Has Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China's environment
condition will have a bright future despite the grim situation it
presently faces, according to panelists of a seminar held here
today.
</P>
<P>
Being one of a series of seminars held before the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings, the
seminar entitled "China's Environment: Growing Greener?" is
especially devoted to China's environment protection issues.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of China National Environmental
Protection Administration, briefed participants on the present
situation of China's environment, the efforts China has made in
environment protection and the prospects of China's environment.
</P>
<P>
He said that historically rapid economic growth generally
causes serious deterioration of environmental quality, but the
fact of China tells a different story. With rapid economic growth
over the past years, China has basically averted the situation of
relatively abrupt deterioration.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons underlying this fact are that since the early
1980s, the Chinese government has adopted a series of policies and
measures for environmental protection, pushed vigorously the
coordination of environment and economic development, and
initially conceived a way of environmental protection based on
China's national conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the actions and achievements in China's
environmental protection indicate that China has both the
confidence and the capabilities to prevent and solve the
environmental problems resulting from economic development and
those left from history.
</P>
<P>
"The series of general and specific policies of environmental
protection and the strategy of coordinated development of
environment and economy carried out by China have been proved
correct and effective," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Xie also urged developed countries to do their part, as they
have promised, in helping developing countries solve their
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Steer, panelist of the seminar and a senior official
with the World Bank, said that the Chinese government is taking
the environmental issues very seriously. China is facing serious
environmental problems and the job ahead is very difficult.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a lot of ground for hope, he said, adding
that in addition to domestic efforts, China has been promoting
international cooperation in solving environmental problems and
has been borrowing money from the World Bank to address these
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic about China's ability to carry out its
policies concerning environment protection.
</P>
<P>
William K. Reilly from the United States said that the Chinese
government has given top priority to environment protection and
has adopted a series of measures to address environmental
problems, which provide a lot of hope for this sector.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Defends Germany's Treatment to Scientology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel today defended Germany's treatment to the Scientology
movement, saying the criticism by a U.S. senator was "intolerable"
to such a free country as Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The accusation that Scientology is being persecuted here is
absurd," Kinkel said in a statement in response to the claims by
U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato that Germany was restricting freedom
of religion with regard to Scientology.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel stressed, "Scientology is not a religion or world
outlook. Its goals are directed at economic activity."
</P>
<P>
He added that there were more and more signs that the
organization harassed its members and their families with
quasi-totalitarian methods.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, lawmakers have called for legislation to mandate
federal surveillance of Scientology by domestic security service.

Qin Zhenhua, a Congress delegate and Party secretary of

progress and material civilization, presided over a study meeting
just after returning from Beijing. People have been encouraged to
get on with their efforts to build these two parts of society, he
reports.
</P>
<P>
"In so far as I understand the report, we should encourage
farmers to get rich, but should also help them to learn more about
science, technology, and to be more cultured," said Tang Chengqi,
head of Hufang Township, in Jiangxi province's Nanchang city.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Kong Lingren, 73-year-old vice-chairman of the Central
Committee of the China Democratic League, has been a life-long
witness to the CPC's success in liberating the Chinese people and
in showing them the way to a better life. "The Democratic League
will join hands with the CPC to enter the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of China's ethnic minorities in autonomous regions have
also held heated discussions about the resolutions adopted at the
Congress. "The report has clearly shown that efforts must be made
to consolidate and develop equality, unity, and mutual aid among
different ethnic groups to seek a common prosperity," says
Tarqing, deputy director of the Tibet region's Commission of
Nationalities and Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Different ethnic groups live peacefully in Xinjiang and local
people enjoy religious freedom. This is the victory of the Party's
policies for ethnic minorities," says Xirip Mullah, a deputy
director of the Xinjiang region's Islamic Association, in
northwest China.

<HEADLINE> Annan Initiates Revival of Peace Process in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed his hope that the current session of
the General Assembly would address conflict situations in
Afghanistan, the Great Lakes Region and Bosnia and the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the general debate of the 52nd
session of the General Assembly, the secretary-general said, "In
Afghanistan, despite our best efforts, the parties continue to
wage a brutal and futile civil war, with heavy civilian
casualties. A renewed commitment on the part of regional and
international actors is required to prevent further bloodshed and
a humanitarian crisis of dreadful proportions."
</P>
<P>
"In the Great Lakes Region, despite the combined efforts of the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, bitter
legacies persist. I urge the countries of the region to pursue the
path of peace, democracy, reconciliation and reconstruction, with
full respect for human rights, and to work with the international
community to assist and sustain their efforts," said the U.N.
chief.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Bosnia, Annan said, "The international
community must be prepared to consolidate the gains achieved and
to prevent a relapse into the horrors that triggered its
involvement. We must ensure that our collective investments --
military, political and financial-- have not been in vain."
</P>
<P>
He finally stressed that the international community cannot but
view with grave concern the mounting threats to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He called on all sides to take
the courageous decisions required to re-establish mutual
confidence and rededicate themselves to achieving a lasting peace.

<HEADLINE> Two Cypriot Communities Leaders to Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the two
Cypriot communities will meet Friday again to discuss security
issues concerning Cyprus problem without preconditions and
without an agenda, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the U.N. mission in Cyprus said
that President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash will meet in the presence of chief of U.N. mission
Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the meeting will be held at Feissel's
residence in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement for a meeting between the two leaders was
announced a week ago by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during a stop over in Cyprus, after a four-day visit to
the island by U.S. State Department Special Coordinator for
Cyprus, Thomas Miller.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place following the failure of the
U.N.-sponsored two rounds of direct talks between Clerides and
Denktash in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides reiterated today
that the Greek Cypriot side would enter the security talks with
"good will, seriousness and responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He told his daily press briefing that Clerides was willing to
meet and discuss security issues despite Turkish threats
against Cyprus because of Cyprus' decision to deploy the
Russian-made surface-to-air missiles on this eastern
Mediterranean island, which has remained divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over 37 percent of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
"We will not play along with the Turkish side if it is trying
to prolong the situation and torpedo efforts," the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has said that it would use all necessary means to block
the transfer of the Russian-made missiles to the Cypriot
government.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Promote Exports to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is to open its
second trade exhibition in Kenya Tuesday as part of concerted
efforts by the Asian country to promote its exports to eastern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the Pakistan Golden Jubilee Exhibition is to
provide more industrial products to people in the eastern African
region, S. Nayyar, the chief of the show, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya is a very important market" and "full of potential" for
Pakistan, said Nayyar, also director of the Export Promotion
Bureau of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Pakistani government sees Kenya as the
gateway through which the southern Asian country can expand
markets effectively in the whole eastern African region.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has sent around 500 invitations to
prominent business figures in eastern Africa, including those
from Uganda and Tanzania, to attend the four-day fair, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 53 Pakistani exhibitors have put on display goods
such as air conditioners, domestic electronic gadgets,
agricultural implements, pharmaceuticals and fashion apparel.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Pakistan and Kenya is in favor of the latter,
which exported goods worth 89.8 million U.S. Dollars to Pakistan
compared to 65 million Dollars in imports in the fiscal year
ending in July, Nayyar quoted data from his government as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's exports to Kenya shot up by 124 percent in
the year from some 27 million Dollars in the previous fiscal
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's exports to Pakistan include tea, hides and skins,
sisal, fibers, natural gum-Arabic and tanned leather. Pakistan is
the largest consumer of Kenyan tea.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Pakistan consist of rice, fertilizers, medicines,
textile yarn, cotton fabrics, carpets and glassware.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive agency of the 15-nation European Union, today granted
1.87 million ECUs (1.68 million US dollars) worth of aid to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable non-governmental organizations to carry out
coordinated actions over the next six months in the Balkan country
that has just come out of several months of civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
The package of aid will provide food for vulnerable groups in
places that have been inaccessible to date. It also provides the
medical supplies that are lacking in many hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Albania is still suffering from the consequences of a crisis
that led to widespread lawlessness and the security situation is
still precarious though the Italy-led multinational protection
force, which was dispatched in mid-April to safeguard deliveries
of humanitarian aid, is now withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the aid program of the European Community
Humanitarian Office are the World Health Organization and
non-governmental organizations from Italy, Greece and France.

<HEADLINE> UK Launches New Britain Tourism Marque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The British Tourist
Authority's (BTA) new tourism marque for Britain is unveiled today
by Chris Smith, secretary of state for culture in London's
Trafalgar Square.
</P>
<P>
The marque has been created to represent Britain as a whole and
to reflect the English, Scottish and Welsh identities.
</P>
<P>
It has strong design elements which create a sense of unity and
ensure maximum impact and awareness of the destination name.
</P>
<P>
The new marque, designed by the London creative agency, Real
Time, will brand all BTA overseas campaigns -- ranging from the
Great British Heritage Pass and Britain's Gardens to Rock &AMP; Pop
and Style &AMP; Design.
</P>
<P>
It will also be used in all print and promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
Launching the new tourism marque, David Quarmby, BTA chairman,
said, "At its heart is the Union flag, which is recognized
throughout the world and reflects the traditional heritage of
Britain."
</P>
<P>
Britain's tourism industry is worth nearly 40 billion pounds
(64 billion US dollars) a year in revenue, including 15.4 billion
pound (24.6 billion US dollar) foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that overseas visitors to Britain in 1997 are
expected to produce another record year with visits at 25.8
million, up 2 percent, and spending up 5 percent to 12.9 billion
pounds (20.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Average annual growth rates from 1996 to 2000 are put at 9.3
percent in revenue, reaching 18 billion pounds (28.8 billion US
dollars) by 2000, and 4.5 percent in visits, totaling 31 million.
</P>
<P>
However, BTA chief executive Anthony Sell said, "If Britain is
to retain and improve its market share, we must capture the
imagination of potential visitors and offer them the motivation to
travel here."

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Warned Over Food Safety, Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- British Euro-MP Lord Plumb
warned European Union Farm Ministers today to "take tougher
measures to ensure food safety."
</P>
<P>
During an interview with BBC Radio Scotland, Plumb said, "The
EU must lead the world in setting tougher food safety regulations
and standards based on clear scientific evidence as we prepare for
the next GATT round in 1999."
</P>
<P>
"Consumer concern over recent outbreaks of E-coli and the BSE
crisis must be put to rest," stressed Plumb, who is now attending
a major world meat conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
As EU farm ministers gather in Brussels today to discuss food
safety agreements and BSE, Plumb attacked those in the EU and USA
who distort free trade. "To prevent future trade wars, the EU must
insure that national food safety standards abide by the GATT
principle on national treatment and non-discrimination," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Food safety regulations with no scientific basis must not be
allowed to prevent free trade. If consumer confidence worldwide is
to return, we must set clear standards," noted Plumb.
</P>
<P>
On BSE, Plumb said, "The recent move by the EU Scientific
Veterinary Committee is welcome. Farm ministers must now accept
Britain's success in tackling BSE and move swiftly to lift the ban
on British beef."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the effect of EU enlargement on rural development,
Plumb said, "Europe must not ignore the needs of the rural areas
and a quarter of Europe's population."
</P>
<P>
"History reminds us that we neglect our farms and food
production at our peril," he added.

<HEADLINE> Peres to Launch Peace Center in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli prime
minister Shimon Peres announced here today that he would open a
peace center next month to make contributions to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Tel Aviv, Peres said the
Peres Center for Peace would be formally inaugurated on October
20 in a ceremony to be attended by many famous statesmen and
business leaders from around the world.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that the center, a non-governmental and non-profit
organization, will focus its activities on pushing for economic
cooperation between Israel and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is basically an "economic exercise," and
would shift its focus from political monoply to economic emphasis
in order to achieve a better life for all peoples in the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have discovered many opportunities that we were
not aware beforehand and we do believe that this center can offer
real contributions to the peace process even at time of crisis
and time of desperation," Peres noted.
</P>
<P>
The center, established with the knowledge of the current
government, which he said looks upon the center favorably, would
keep in touch with other peace organizations to push forward the
peace process, Peres said, but adding that it would not be
actively involved in politics.
</P>
<P>
The long list of the center's International Board of Governors
comprises a number of former world leaders, including former
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali, former
U.S. president Jimmy Carter, former U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, former Soviet Union leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, current French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
Speaker of Palestinian Council Ahmed Queria.
</P>
<P>
Peres, a leading architect of the Israeli-Arab peace process,
was defeated in the May 1996 general elections by Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu. In June this year, he stepped down as the
leader of Labor Party and was replaced by former Army Chief of
Staff Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Program Launched to Promote Africa's Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Brussels-based center for the
Development of Industry (CDI) has, in conjunction with the Zimbabwe
Investment Center, launched a program to promote the export of
processed fruit and vegetables from eastern and Southern Africa into
the European market.
</P>
<P>
About 25 exporting companies from eastern and southern Africa and
an equal number of European fruit and vegetable importers are meeting
in Zimbabwe for the CDI-sponsored industrial partnership meeting on
export opportunities for processed fruits and vegetables from the
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which began in Harare today will move to the eastern
resort town of Nyanga.
</P>
<P>
Delegates, comprising CDI experts, fruit and vegetable company
representatives from the EU and Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe
will visit a number of fruit processing firms before going to Nyanga.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1977 during the first Lome Convention, the CDI is the
industrial-promotion arm of the partnership between the EU and member
countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) region.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the meeting, Zimbabwe's Secretary for Industry
and Commerce Kelebert Nkomani said the CDI is a practical
demonstration of the benefits that ACP countries are deriving from
the ACP-EU relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Fruit and vegetable-growing is a good source of employment in
the region, as most of the activities in this industry are
labour-intensive. In a region where unemployment levels are high,
the industry fulfills an urgent social need," Nkomani said.
</P>
<P>
CDI divisional head for technical services and EU networks Daniel
Nairac said the organization was involved in seeking ways to add
value to industrial raw materials from the ACP countries as a way of
generating employment.

<HEADLINE> RQAN Helps Qualified Africans Go Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Return and Integration of
Nationals Program (RQAN) has assisted more than 1,500 qualified
Africans to return and take up employment in key sectors of their
countries' economies since its launch in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is being implemented by the International
Organisation For Migration (IOM) in conjunction with
participating African governments, seeks to bring to an end the
brain drain on the continent and strengthen direct contribution
the trained and experienced African nationals abroad can make
towards development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
IOM spokesman Thomas Weiss said the program aimed at promoting
the return of qualified migrant Africans to or relocate them
within Africa so that their knowledge could be used towards the
development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Weiss was speaking during the Southern African Regional
Institute For Policy Studies (SARIPS) and Southern African
Political and Economic Series (SAPES) Colloquium which started
here today.
</P>
<P>
Africa faces a brain drain problem which is worsened by poor
salaries and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
RQAN, which was launched in 1983 with assistance from the
Ruropean Union, is currently working with 10 African countries to
try and lure African professionals living abroad to return home.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 colloquium, which is the 10th to be organised by
SAPES and SARIPS, seeks to enhance interaction among southern
African scholars, policy makers and technicians to promote
regular, rational and development related policy dialogue in the
region and improve understanding of the processes pertaining to
labour markets and migration.

</P>
<P>
The friendly cooperation between the two nations has been going
very healthily and their two-way trade has been growing so rapidly
that Chile has become China's second largest trade partner in
Latin America now, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
China and Chile, both of which are Pacific ridge nations, have
good cooperation in the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation and on
other international affairs, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier expressed thanks to Chile for its
support to China on the latter's accession to the World Trade
Organization, the American Development Bank and in other areas. He
hoped the two countries would further cooperate in the world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Insulza expressed his congratulations on the successful
conclusion of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China. He said he has the confidence that the congress would bring
an important and deep influence to the development in China.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Qian on the friendly ties between the two
countries and said he expected a good prospect in their
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign minister also said the two countries should
continue their mutual understanding and support in international
affairs.

China, invited Qian to tour Chile.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Military Cooperation Not to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to
Cyprus Semi Tzur said today that the military cooperation between
Israel and Turkey will not affect this eastern Mediterranean
island.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, Tzur said there has been an agreement between Israel
and Turkey which concerns cooperation on military issues. However,
it should be made clear that this is not an alliance, but
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said his country has no part in the Cyprus dispute and
rejected the view that in case of military conflict on the
island Israel would go against Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador also said that his country has an
agreement with Greece for military cooperation which has been
bolstered in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tzur and the Cypriot foreign minister
arranged a meeting between Kasoulides and his Israeli counterpart
David Levy which is scheduled to take place in New York.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are expected to discuss the Middle East
peace process, the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation and the
joint U.S.-Turkish-Israeli military exercises due to be held in
Eastern Mediterranean in November. The upcoming exercises have
caused concern to Cyprus as well as to some other countries in the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent its troops
and took over the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Stay of Prosecution Sought in Banana Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Former Zimbabwean President
Canaan Banana appeared before the High Court here today, facing
11 charges of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
But Banana submitted that he could not be guaranteed a fair
trial because of what he termed prejudicial publicity given to
allegations against him since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Banana, Zimbabwean President from April 1980 until December
1987, is supposed to answer to two counts of sodomy, three counts
of attempted sodomy, and six charges of indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
In his submissions before Justice Blackie siting with
assessors major Misheck Nyandoro and Tuttam Chaudry, Council for
Defence advocate Chris Andersen said he was applying for a stay
of prosecution of his client because of the pre-trial publicity
which tended to be prejudicial to the former head of state and
interferred with his constitutional right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Andersen told the court that the state had refused to hand
over to the defence essential documents such as the police diary
relating to the investigations of their client.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the publicity which he said prejudiced his client,
Andersen referred to various press publications and headlines one
of which read: ''Banana Sex Scandal Baloons''.
</P>
<P>
''The nature of the reporting projudiced the accused having a
fair trial,'' argued Andersen.
</P>
<P>
''The totality of these passages plainly suggests that the
accused has been guilty of a number of charges. Together with
the state outline it does irreparable harm to the accused,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''The only remedy would be a stay of prosecution.
The damage could not be undone by making it being referred to
another court because of the very wide publicipy by virtue of
newspaper reports and state outline.''
</P>
<P>
Rebutting Andersen's application, Director of Public
Prosecutions Augustine Chikumira pointed out that in any case the
High Court did not have the jurisdiction to order a stay of
prosecution. Only the supreme courty could do that, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Portugal, Mozambique to Tighten Military Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and Mozambique have
decided today to strengthen their military cooperation ties,
especially in the military training and safeguarding of their
territorial sea.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint communique issued after the meeting
between Mozambican Defense Minister Aguiar Mazula and visiting
Portuguese counterpart Antonio Vitorino, the two countries are to
materialize their cooperation programs in a framework plan.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the two defense ministers examined
the Lisbon Joint Communique signed between the two countries in
April 1994, and agreed to quicken the implementation of the
planned cooperation programs in the military field.
</P>
<P>
As to airforce cooperation, Mazula said that before they make
any decision for further cooperations, the two sides would have a
joint investigation into the current airforce status, especially
the situation with the former Soviet Union-trained personnel and
the Soviet Union made equipment.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that they could make use of the
military training centers in Maputo and Nacala (in Nampula
Pprovince ) training centers as basis for training soldiers for
other Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese minister, who has visited the two centers, said
that the centers have all the conditions necessary for military
training cooperation among the African Portuguese-speaking
countries.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Portuguese defense minister was also met by the
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano at Massinga County in
southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US President Addresses UN Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton stressed here today his support for the United Nations'
role on peace and freedom, but with little promise on paying out
all its huge sum of debts owed to this largest international
organization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 52nd General Assembly session, the U.S.
president said that the United States strongly supports the
leadership of Secretary General Kofi Annan in his pursuit of the
U.N. reform which he described as the "most far reaching." He said
the U.S. will pass the secretary general's reform agenda for this
session.
</P>
<P>
But he did not mention the time the U.S. will take to pay off
the more than a billion U.S. dollars it owed to the United
Nations. He said he hopes that member states will adopt a "more
equitable scale of assessment" (of their duties).
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations has a special responsibility to
help make sure that the global economy creates greater wealth, it
"does not produce growing disparities between the haves and
have-nots."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also voiced the support of his country for expanding
the Security Council of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
In his 27-page speech, the president also mentioned the fast
development of technology, which he indicated has benefited
mankind throughout the world, but also has been taken use of by
criminals who abused the vast power of technology to engage in
different kinds of international crime such as terrorism, drug
trafficking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The president called for worldwide efforts to continue to
prevent conflict, promote international human rights standards and
move people from poverty to dignity and prosperity through
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
On peace and security, he said, conflicts between nations, and
within nations, have cost 20 million lives. Clinton expressed his
appreciation for the United Nations' efforts to keep many nations
away from bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of eliminating weapons of mass
destruction. "We cannot allow them to fall or remain in the wrong
hands," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Turns Down UAE Territorial Claim on Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran today rejected once
again the territorial claim by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over
three islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi expressed Iran's regret over the UAE's claim over three
islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that it is not proper for Iran's Arab
neighbor to raise the dispute at a time when Muslims are facing
various conspiracies and maneuvers of the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the three Persian Gulf islands belong to
Iran, terming the raising of the issue as "a divisive move" which
serves the plots of the Israeli regime against the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Iran is ready to hold bilateral negotiations
with the UAE to resolve misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United Arab Emirates have been disputing since the
early 1970s over the islands, which are strategically situated at
the entrance to the Persian Gulf, opposite the Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
On November 30, 1971, one day before the British troops'
withdrawal and two days before the proclamation of the United
Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah, Fujairah,
Ajman and Umm al-Quwain, Iranian troops occupied the three
islands.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Tehran will not make any compromise with UAE
on the sovereignty of the three islands despite the change of the
Iranian government. The territorial dispute is the main obstacle
to the improvement of relations between Iran and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups the UAE, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar, has criticized Iran for
"not responding positively to calls" from the UAE to settle the
dispute over the islands.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin has stressed that "peace and stability are
unattainable in a world where billions are under poverty line."
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, the remarks were
made by the minister when he left here Sunday night for New York
to attend the 52nd General Assembly of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the inflow to developed nations of trade,
resource, finance and investment shows the unbalanced economic
and business relations between developed and developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The minister said " Thirtytwo of the 38 world poorest
countries are in Africa. These countries deserve special
assistance."
</P>
<P>
He said the problem demands the support of the international
community to developing nations through debt relief and cancella-
tion as well as economic assistance meant for infrastructure and
social service expansion. Ethiopia's foreign policy focuses on
ways of benefiting from such schemes, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Hails His Party's Gains in Hamburg Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 22 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today hailed his party's gains in Hamburg elections Sunday,
expressing optimism about the general elections scheduled for
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with the message the Hamburg voters sent
me," Kohl said. "I intend to win the (1998) elections."
</P>
<P>
Kohl is seeking a fifth four-year term in the general elections
after 15 years in office.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's regional elections in Hamburg, Germany's second
biggest city, Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) obtained
30.7 percent of the vote, up 5.6 percent over 1993.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) saw its
vote down by over 4 percent, managing to lead with 36.2 percent in
the northern port city, which is traditionally dominated by them.
</P>
<P>
Hamburg's SPD mayor, Henning Voscherau, announced his
resignation in response to the worst postwar result of his party.
</P>
<P>
The election result is viewed as a major setback to the SPD,
coming at the start of a series of regional polls leading up to
the country's general elections.
</P>
<P>
"The result is without any doubt a disappointment," said SPD
leader Oskar Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's elections, the environmental Greens gained 13.9
percent of the vote and are calling for a leftist coalition with
the SPD in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
The Greens also want to set up a "Red-Green" coalition in Bonn.
Opinion polls currently show such an alliance could defeat Kohl's
center-right coalition in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The CDU has urged the SPD to set up a CDU-SPD "grand coalition"
in Hamburg, like the one in Berlin and some other German states.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government's junior coalition partner Free Democrats
(FDP) received only 3.5 percent of the vote in the Hamburg
elections, short of the 5 percent specified by law to qualify for
seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The FDP has lost many regional elections in recent years,
raising the possibility that it might not be able to enter the
federal parliament in 1998 and, as a result, deprive Kohl's
coalition of majority.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Promote Girls' Education in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A five-day workshop on
promotion of girls' education in east African sub-region opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
The third sub-regional Forum for African Women Educationalists
(FAWE) is attended by delegates from several east African
countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the forum, Executive Director of the FAWE
Dddah Gachukia called on governments to be committed to translating
their recognition into tangible action.
</P>
<P>
She said, the acknowledgement of the value of female education
by itself is futile unless governments design viable policies and
implementation strategies to ensure increased and sustainable
enrollment for girls and women at all levels of education system
and training programs.
</P>
<P>
She said that the promotion of girls' education calls for
practical involvement of all concerned and influential bodies as
it could not be implemented only by the efforts of African women
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The goals of FAWE could best be implemented at
the national levels, she said, adding that participants returning
to their respective countries are expected to practically interpret
the terms of the forum which include capacity building for
increased coverage of girls'' and women education.

<HEADLINE> Water Subsidies for Farmers Should Be Stopped: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Water and
Forestry Minister Kader Asmal said today that the practice of
letting farmers get water virtually free of charge should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a water law workshop in Pretoria, Asmal said water
tariffs in South Africa are lower than the real value of
water, which amounted to the the subsidization of water.
</P>
<P>
"We do not subsidize fertilizer. We do not subsidize sheep. Why on
earth should we subsidize water?" he asked, noting it was becoming
difficult for the government to allow water to be used at subsidized
rate for practices resulting in the inefficient use of water.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said water subsidies should be phased out gradually and in
an orderly fashion. "We need to give farmers time to adjust, and the
ability to withstand the impacts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asmal denied that the proposed new water legislation is only aimed at
farmers, stressing new policies are being devised for all major users
of waters, including the industry, urban, and domestic consumers.
</P>
<P>
"No one will escape the need for better use of our limited water
resources," Asmal added.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has called on the
international community to continue assisting eastern and central
African countries in their search for peace in Burundi through the
process of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Jakaya Kikwete, Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation in his address to the 52nd session of
the United Nations General Assembly in New York, according to a press
released by the Foreign Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete told the U.N. session today that the region has no other
interest in Burundi but to help as reaffirmed by the September 4 Dar
es Salaam summit at which the leaders of the region had reiterated
their commitment to peace in Burundi and called on the military
regime in Burundi to abandon the course of confrontation and seek
dialogue and political accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi political crisis which was triggered by the
assassination of the country's first elected President Melchior
Ndadaye in 1993 reached a new turn in July 1996 following a military
coup that brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power after toppling a
civilian government of President Sylvester Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of eastern and central African countries have been making
efforts to search for ways to restore peace in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Mad House Employees Jailed for Letting Out Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian prosecution has
ordered nine employees of a mental hospital be jailed for letting
loose a lunatic who was charged of bombing a tourist bus downtown
Cairo last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Counsellor Hisham Saraya, attorney-general of the Higher State
Security Prosecution, said they would be jailed for 15 days
pending investigations on charges of taking bribes to facilitate
the exit of the suspect and others from the hospital, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The jailed include three doctors at the Khanka Hospital for
Psychological and Nerve Diseases, Sayed Ahmed Al Qot, Supervisor
of Psychological Health, Nessim Abdel Malak Nessim, the hospital's
former director who was dismissed on the same day the attack took
place, and Ahmed al Haggar.
</P>
<P>
Six male nursing attendants at Khanka hospital have also been
jailed for 15 days pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
The mentally-disturbed Saber Mohamed Farahat and his brother
Mahmoud Farahat had been arrested for the shooting and petrol bomb
attack which killed nine German tourists and an Egyptian driver.
</P>
<P>
Saber was sent to the hospital in 1993 after a court ruled he
was insane after convicting him of shooting dead three foreign
tourists in a Cairo hotel. Police said he escaped three days
before the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have revealed that the employees responsible for
the entry and exit of patients from the hospital have given Saber
a regular leave against payment of money.
</P>
<P>
Saber used to spend 20 days at home every month and five days
at the hospital. He even left the hospital five months ago to be
married at a grand wedding party attended by some doctors and
nurses from the mad house.
</P>
<P>
The Farahat brothers owned a bakery with daily profit of 400
Egyptian pounds (118 U.S. dollars). Saber said they launched the
attack to avenge the blasphemous posters against Islam in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the attack, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has ordered the transfer of administration of lunatic
asylums nationwide from municipalities to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Tourism Ministry reiterated today that the attack
was not "a terrorist act," but "a criminal act with no correlation
to organized terrorism" that will not affect Egypt's
multi-billion-dollar tourist industry.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev today urged the Russian parliament to ratify the START-2
treaty, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
"There is convincing evidence, thorough calculations and

adopting some protocol amendments to it, the report said.

But I hope the Duma with the assistance of the Defense Ministry

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Peacekeepers Clash With S. Leone Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG and troops of Sierra Leone's military junta today
traded gunfire near the airport in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The two sides first exchanged small arms fire and then artillery
fire, said residents of the Lungi district where the airport is
located, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
No casualty was reported in today's clashes. But the state
radio and television said that an ECOMOG plane bombed a power
plant Saturday in Freetown, injuring one person and damaging the
structure.
</P>
<P>
The military seized power in a coup on May 25, ousting the
legitimate government, and the junta has formed an alliance with
ex-rebels of the Revolutionary United Front which has been fighting
successive governments in the country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has deployed troops in Sierra Leone to enforce a stiff
economic embargo imposed after the coup in a bid to force the junta
out of power.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between ECOMOG troops and local forces have been frequent
and the junta claims that dozens of civilians have been killed in
ECOMOG air raids or bombardments aimed mainly at boats held to be
breaching the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's west African neighbors are in New York to solicit
support from the United Nations to the embargo. UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has reportedly pledged to back the efforts.

ADDIS ABABA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Tourism
Commission said today it will promote tourism in the country to
earn more hard currency.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here in connection with the World
Tourism Day to be celebrated on September 27, commissioner of the
organization Yusuf Abdullahi said the number of tourists has
dramatically increased during the past few years owing to political
stability and economic reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it is not satisfactory when compared with
the variety, beauty and high quantity of the tourist
attractions that the country is blessed with.
</P>
<P>
The existing quality and standard of tourist services,
infrastructures, marketing as well as advertising activities
should be improved in order to achieve the target, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the commission's readiness to work with
regional administrations, government and private organizations in
charge of administering tourist attractions, travel agencies,
tour operators, hotels, restaurants, air lines, the mass media
and other concerned bodies to promote tourism in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, about 110,000 tourists visited
the country last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's tourism day under the theme "tourism -- a leading
activity of the 21st century for job creation and environmental
protection" is to be celebrated in 131 countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Voices Opposition to Missile Deployment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said here today that Turkey will never accept the
deployment of anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press at the airport before leaving for Croatia
for a two-day official visit, Demirel said that Turkey will do
what it can to defend its state interests, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Turkey would seek for a diplomatic solution to
the missile crisis, but stressed that "it is impossible for
Turkey to accept the deployment of missiles in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, as two NATO member states, should play
positive roles in the settlement of the Cyprus issue, the Turkish
president said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed an agreement with Russia in January to purchase
hundreds of Russian-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports that the anti-aircraft missiles will be
transferred to the Greek Cypriots have caused a new wave of
tension between the small island country and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki Karaday
reaffirmed Sunday that Turkey will use all necessary means to
block the delivery of the S-300 missiles to the Cypriot
government.
</P>
<P>
Despite Ankara's repeated accusation, the Cypriot government
argued that it bought the missiles for defense purchase, not
directed against any country.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third part of the island to
protect the Turkish Cypriots following an abortive coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Wishes to Normalize Ties with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said today that it is
willing to normalize its relations with Syria so long as certain
conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that it was
Damascus' support for the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
that stands in the way of the normalization of the
Turkish-Syrian relations.
</P>
<P>
Syria has to give up its support for the PKK if it wants to
develop close ties with Turkey, Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Turkey hoped to enhance its cooperation with
Syria and this stance has remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have shared a bitter relationship due to the
PKK issue, the dispute over the water resources of the Euphrates
as well as other sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Damascus accused Ankara of taking part in the joint
naval war games with Israel and the United States to be held in
November in eastern Mediterranean, saying the maneuvers are
directed against Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has been trying to assure its Arab neighbors
that the tripartite exercises are not directed against any other
country, saying that it is "a search-and-rescue operation" devoid
of any strategic importance.

JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said today that PNA's
investigations showed that the suicide bombers striking Jerusalem
in past weeks came from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the press in Gaza that he refuted Israel's
allegations the militant attackers had came from the PNA self-rule
territories.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Austria Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said that he was 100 percent sure that the
militants had came from the West Bank and not from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said on the same day
that the attackers had received backing in the PNA territories.
</P>
<P>
"Give us the proof," Arafat said, referring to Netanyahu's
remarks about the suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem was struck by suicide bombings on July 30 and
September 4, killing 25 people and wounding more than 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Israel sealed off the PNA territories following the blasts and
have arrested more than 200 Palestinians in the West Bank,
suspecting them of involvement with Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two
radical Islamic resistance groups.

JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) --South Africa and Saudi

Defense Minister Joe Modise said today.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has not been signed and is still under

He declined to comment on a Sunday newspaper report that

would work together in the fields of training, military exercises
and technical assistance.

<HEADLINE> Dodi Personally Asks Paul to Drive Car: Diana's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the
bodyguard of Princess Diana and her friend Dodi al Fayed, has
revealed that Dodi personally asked Henri Paul to drive the
Mercedes S-280 sedan in the night when the fatal accident which
killed them took place.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted reliable sources as saying
that Rees-Jones told investigating judge Herve Stephan, "Dodi
called him (Paul) in order that he conducted us from the rear gate
of the hotel."
</P>
<P>
During the first interview of him by Judge Stephan last Friday,
the 29-year-old former British parachutist, who was the only
survivor in the crash, said that they first planned to leave Ritz
Hotel in two separate cars in order to shake the photographers,
but Dodi changed mind for an unknown reason.
</P>
<P>
He also remembered that when they left the hotel, they were
followed by "one car and two motors."
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it was a white vehicle with a trunk which
opened at the rear, a three-door, but I can remember nothing
else," Rees-Jones was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rees-Jones suffered from serious facial injury, light brain
contusion and pulmonary contusion from the crash.
</P>
<P>
Philippe Lacert, a neurologist at the Hospital of Lariboisiere
in Paris, said that it would take 12 to 15 months for him to
regain his memory, and that it was possible for his memory to
never come back again.
</P>
<P>
The British daily Guardian reported today that there could be a
collision between the Mercedes with a Fiat Uno about 60 meters
from the entry of the underpass near the Alma Square in downtown
Paris, in which the accident took place on the early morning of
August 31.
</P>
<P>
But investigators, who are looking for a Fiat Uno which had one
tail light broken, said they have not found any evidence to prove
a collision between the Mercedes and another car.
</P>
<P>
Police found some debris from a red tail light of a Fiat Uno
near the debris of the head lights of the Mercedes, as well as
some paint on the right front side of the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the crash took place, police so far have
officially acquired two certain points: the car was speeding very
fast, and the driver, Henri Paul, was drunk.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Warring Parties to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Warring parties in Sudan
today agreed to re-open face-to-face talks set here for October
28 to end their 14-year-old bloody confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mohamed, Sudan's Minister for Federal Relations, and Nhial
Deng, on behalf of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Moverment/Army (SPLM/SPLA), reached agreement at a ministerial
meeting of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD).
</P>
<P>
Under a joint communique, the two sides re-affirmed the
Declaration of Principles made by IGAD (Intergovernmental
Authority on Development) leaders in 1994 "as the basis for
negotiations and agree to cooperate fully in the search for a
negotiated solution to the conflict."
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, religious factor is recognized
as an important role in Sudan's development.
</P>
<P>
The one-day IGAD meeting was also attended by Kenyan Foreign
Minister Kalonzo Musyoka, Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Weldensae, Uganda's Acting Foreign Minister Martin Aliker and
Vice-Foreign Minister of Ethiopia Tekeda Alemu.
</P>
<P>
They urged the parties involved the Sudan conflict "to put
aside any issues that may hinder the progress of the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
"Since September 1994 when the IGAD peace initiative stalled,
the situation in southern Sudan has deteriorated considerably,"
said Musyoka at the beginning of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the meeting "will enable the (IGAD) committee
to determine the path we should follow to push for a lasting
solution" to the crisis in Sudan "as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SPLM/SPLA negotiators issued a statement to the
press after the meeting, charging that the Sudanese government
"does not seek a genuine dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum regime "aims rather at persuading the (regional)
leaders...to gently nudge the SPLM onto its internal 'peace'
bandwagon which essentially is a unilateral peace prescription or
the regime's own position paper," Nhial said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war erupted in 1983 when the SPLM/SPLA took up
arms for greater autonomy of the Christian south from the Moslem
north. All efforts to end the conflict have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD held two high-level meetings in 1994 on the crisis in
Sudan. Since then, all IGAD peace initiatives had stalled until
July, 1997 when an IGAD summit was held here and Sudan's
government accepted the Declaration of Principles as basis for
talks.
</P>
<P>
IGAD was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation on
anti-drought and economic development among the member countries
-- plus Djibouti and Somalia. Regional political affairs have
been on its agenda since 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The report by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan entitled "The United Nations: a
Program for Reform" was timely and opportune, said Luiz
Felipe Lampreia, minister of external relations of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the general debate of the 52nd
United Nations General Assembly, the minister said the Brazilian
government welcomed the report with satisfaction and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Those proposals would certainly warrant close attention in the
General Assembly and in parallel consultation, and would help
consolidate a new spirit that should inspire the organization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The new spirit is called leadership: that driving force of
history altering the course events within countries and in
international scenario, opening new horizons, giving hope to the
people of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of leadership has given the world a forum without
parallel in history, a stage for negotiation and a political
force in favor of international peace and security," the foreign
minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had an irreplaceable role in a world
that still combined forces of integration and cooperation with

</P>
<P>
"The past few years have shown that reform of the United
Nations can no longer be put off. We cannot lose sight of the
major institutional issues nor waste further precious energy,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "For the United Nations to make a difference and
provide leadership in today's complex world, it must recover the
original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential
mission: maintaining international peace and security, promoting
justice and international law, strengthening cooperation for
development, protecting human rights and providing humanitarian
assistance."
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the Security Council, the minister said that
Brazil had upheld a concept of reform that would strengthen the
Security Council and the United Nations as a whole, and it was not
geared to the individual interests of any one country.
</P>
<P>
"The Council must be enlarged both in its permanent membership
-- to contemplate the industrialized and the developing worlds --
and in its non-permanent membership -- to allow for more frequent
participation by interested states," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The international community needs a strong,
efficient and ever-present United Nations. We will continue to
rely on a political body with the universality and moral strength
that only the United Nations had been able to muster in the
history of mankind."

<HEADLINE> Liberia Cracks Down Upon Armed Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberian police and the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) killed one suspected armed
robber and arrested 20 others in weekend raids on the suburbs of
the capital Monrovia, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Police director Joe Tate said suspect Aloysius Kieh was shot
dead while attempting to escape in a joint police and ECOMOG
night patrols "to rid the city of armed bandits".
</P>
<P>
The police had launched "Operation Clean Monrovia to make the
city a safe place to live," Tate said, quoted by the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to carry out this operation until every armed
robber is caught and brought to justice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 400 police officers will soon be assigned to
neighborhood watch teams for crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood teams would jointly work with the police to
deter crime in the communities, Assistant Police Director Yvonne
Steward said.
</P>
<P>
Reports of armed robberies in the city have increased over the
last two months with at least five persons, including a
12-year-old girl, killed in such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Last month, President Charles Taylor expressed serious concern
about the reports, and ordered stte security and ECOMOG to deal
"firmly and decisively with the heinous crime".
</P>
<P>
Security is one of the major tasks of the newly-inaugurated
government in Liberia, where the seven years of civil war has
left many people in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The weapons of former warring factions which remain in the
hands of some individuals facilitate armed robbery in the
country.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Halts Training Flight to Review Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force today
suspended training flights for combat air crews at domestic bases
for 24 hours to review safety issues arising from a recent string
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Air Force, including transport and tanker units
and warplanes based abroad, will suspend training flights for 24
hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
After an Air Force B-1 bomber crashed last Friday, the Air
Force Combat Command decided to move up the service-wide halt of
training flights from Friday to today.
</P>
<P>
The Navy, Marine Corps and Army are scheduled to take a one-day
stand-down similar with the Air Force before the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen last week ordered a
military-wide stand-down for "a period of reflection" on safety
after a series of air accidents.
</P>
<P>
It is the first-ever suspension of all military pilot training.
Cohen's order does not affect operational flights such as those
over Iraq and in support of Bosnia peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday from his headquarters at Langley
Air Force Base, Virginia, Air Combat Commander General Richard
Hawley said the one-day pause was needed to "focus intently on
what we do and how we do it."
</P>
<P>
"We need to determine why these incidents happened and how to
prevent any more mishaps," said Hawley.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has lost a C-141 transport plane, a F-117a
stealth fighter, two F-18s, two F-16s and a B-1 bomber since
September 13 in air crashes.

CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Saudi Arabia achieved a growth rate of 8.6
percent in economy in 1996, according to the latest official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Planning Abdul-Wahab al-Attar attributed the
growth mainly to an increase in the gross domestic product of the
oil sector from 6.8 percent in 1995 to 16 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Saudi Press Agency as saying that non-oil
production witnessed a rise of 4.16 percent, while the production
of private sectors surged by 3.5 percent in 1996 due to a
recorded industrial growth rate of 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that Saudi Arabia had spent 640 billion
U.S. dollars in the last 27 years for social and economic
development programs.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait Stock Exchange today started showing
live daily trading deals in the Bahraini bourse via special
devices in a step towards the all-round linkage of the two
markets.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti bourse Director General Hisham Al-Otaibi said the
measure is aimed at getting Kuwaiti investors acquainted
themselves with the daily developments in Bahraini stock market
ahead of the linkage of the two bourses.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait announced Sunday the stock exchanges in the two Gulf
countries will sign an agreement Saturday to open the way for
cross trading between the two markets.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, expected to become effective early next year,
aims to link clearing houses and brokerage firms of the two
markets that will ease the way for cross trading.
</P>
<P>
A clearing house or similar body is also expected to be built
in Bahrain that will play the same role as the Kuwait Clearing
Company which guarantees share transactions here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would be the second of its kind among stock
markets of the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) states. GCC
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Bahrain have already linked their floors and a
number of companies from the two countries have been listed in
both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Exchange officials believe that the joining together of the
Kuwaiti and Bahraini markets would encourage cross-listing of
companies and the flow of capital between the two countries, thus
boosting the economic cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait stock exchange has been performing well since last
year and so far more than 70 companies have been listed on the
market.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 78,000 public
school students in the capital of the United States began classes
Monday, after a three-week delay to repair roofs at dozens of city
schools.
</P>
<P>
The work was part of a massive program to remedy fire code
violations that have caused delayed school openings in three of
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Children will start school each day at 8:30 a.m., 15 minutes
earlier than usual, and end at 3:30 p.m., 15 minutes later, to
make up for the lost time.
</P>
<P>
Schools chief Julius Becton had hoped a district would allow
the students to attend classes while the repairs were under way.
As Superior Court Judge Kaye Christian denied that request, Becton
postponed the original September 2 start date.
</P>
<P>
Christian fined the school system 61,000 dollars when officials
failed to have repairs completed last week as originally promised.
The last school was cleared Friday to reopen.
</P>
<P>
The judge monitors the schools as part of a 1994 lawsuit by the
advocacy group Parents United for D.C. Schools.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Newsmen Taken to Court for Libeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Six Egyptian reporters have
been charged of publishing stories libeling and slandering against
the Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Public Prosecutor Ragaa al-Arabi announced today that
a two-month investigation shows the stores published in Arabic
bi-weekly Al-Shaab are groundless.
</P>
<P>
Magdi Ahmed Hussein, Salah Bedewi, Adel Hussein and Hoda
Mekkawi of the bi-weekly, together with Essam Sharquwi, a
cartoonist of al-Ummah newspaper and Mohamed Hamdi al-Shami, a
freelancer, are facing charges of printing untrue stories defaming
Alfi and the police agency in Egypt, the prosecutor told the press.
</P>
<P>
The indictment sheet issued by the prosecution says that eight
issues of the bi-weekly published stories with phrases
"undermining Alfi's image, honor and reputation."
</P>
<P>
It accuses Magdi Hussein, Bedewi and Mekkawi of being contempt
of court for violating the prosecution's ban on reporting the case
by the press until the end of the investigations and printing
"baseless stories damaging the image of the police body."
</P>
<P>
Bedewi is also charged for breaching public peace by printing
groundless stories in which he claimed that the Interior Ministry
had been penetrated by a foreign intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab, with a circulation of about 130,000, has been
accusing Alfi and his associates of racketeering, nepotism and
involvement in a high-profile corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Alfi filed a libel suit on August 16 against Al-Shaab, accusing
it of defaming his families and his ministry. The paper then filed
a counter lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
It was the second case filed by Egypt's celebrities against the
press for slander this year.
</P>
<P>
On September 14, six reporters, three Saudis and three
Egyptians, were found guilty of libeling against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's two sons for defamatory stories about
their business dealings.

UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook today urged the United States to pay its 1.5
billion U.S. dollars debts to the United Nations without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Cook made the appeal in an interview with CNN( Cable Network
News)'s International program when U.S. President Bill Clinton was
addressing the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure of the conservative Republican-controlled
Congress, Clinton demand a reduction of the amount Washington
contributes to the largest international organization.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Washington could not expect to withhold its
debts while other members both from developing countries and
developed ones have paid up in full and on time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has repeatedly said that it would not
authorize the Clinton administration to pay off the arreas unless
the world body had implemented reform measures and proposals set
forth by Washington.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that even if the U.N. had met the U.S. conditions,
the Congress was prepared to pay only two-thirds of the U.S.
debts.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that he would not compromise on the question of the
U.S. debts to the United Nations, although he would risk offending
the sensibilities of a major ally by naming Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We would very much like Congress to recognize...that
countries like Britain which pays in full and pays on time does
not feel it's fair when other countries--whether it's the U.S. or
anybody else--does not pay in full and does not pay on time,"
Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Damages African Electronic Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Adverse weather, particularly
heavy rain, has been cited as one of the major factors to cause
damage of electronic equipment in some African countries, forcing
them to spend million of U.S. dollars to repair or replace it.
</P>
<P>
This was identified by the African energy experts, scientists
and technicians attending a five-day workshop to discuss modes of
power supply to minimize loss and destruction of vital electronic
equipment.

said their countries are more vulnerable to intermittent
disruptions of power to computers and other electronic equipment
during rain seasons.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains and thunderstorms are said to be among the major
causes of damage to the equipment.
</P>
<P>
A participant from the University of Zambia said that African
countries lose up to 80 percent of their electronic equipment,
worth million dollars each year in damage caused by power
interruptions.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the workshop, which opened today, are expected to
recommond the best ways of power conditioning to avoid power cuts
and prevent interruptions to protect the equipment.

Monday that it would not hold further senior talks between
Washington and Pyongyang because of "unacceptable demands" from
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The State Department said, however, working-level discussions
between U.S. and DPRK officials would continue so that deadlock
for four-party peace talks could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The State Department made the announcement after the four-party
preparatory meeting broke down in New York last Friday. The four
parties include the DPRK, South Korea, the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James foley said: "North Korea
insists on direct linkage between the food talks and the
negotiations, and they remain inflexible" on including American
troops withdrawal from South Korea and a bilateral peace treaty
with the United States as agenda items in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I would be surprised if we agreed to go back to New York,
absent a firm indication on the North Korean side that they're
willing to come to agreement at a next round to permit the
four-party plenary talks to begin," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that while the United States has already sent food
aid to the DPRK and is ready to consider more, it will not link
the four-party talks with the food aid. Neither would the United
States include its troop withdrawal as an agenda item, even it is
ready to discuss the future of its 37000 troops in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Warned Against Hazardous Pesticides Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The UN Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) today warned Zambia against exporting
hazardous pesticides, Zambia News Agency (ZANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to a release sent to ZANA from the office of the FAO
representative in Zambia, the pesticides, which are harmful to humans,
animals and the environment should not be exported without the
agreement of the importing country.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted the Rome-based FAO and the UN Environment Program
(UNEP) as saying today that a prior informed consent procedure has
been established to better monitor and manage the trade of the
concerned pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The procedure can help importers to decide whether they want some
pesticides to enter their countries or not.
</P>
<P>
Extremely hazardous pesticides including organo-phosphates-
methamidophos, methyl paration, monocrotophos, and some industrial
chemicals have been added to a existing watch list of the FAO and
UNEP.
</P>
<P>
The pesticides, the two world bodies said, pose a considerable risk
to the health of many small farmers and agricultural workers because
they can not be handled safely.
</P>
<P>
Studies on the application of organophosphates have demonstrated
that during normal spraying, farmers are exposed to contamination by
absorption of residues on clothing through the skin, said ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, reports show that consumers have also been at
risk of acute poisoning following the consumption of leafy vegetables
that have been treated shortly before harvest with organophosphate
pesticides.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Grand Slam Cup organisers said
in Munich on Tuesday that they were studying plans to extend the
event to women.
</P>
<P>
Tournament director Bill Dennis said the man who founded the
Grand Slam Cup, Axel Meyer-Woelden, had been keen to allow women
to participate or to create a similar tournament for women.

<P>
Meyer-Woelden, who started the tournament featuring the top
performers of all four grand slams in 1990, died last month of
liver cancer.
</P>

"In one of the last discussions we had with Axel, he told me
how keen he was to extend the formula to women," said Dennis.
"It's definitely a good idea and something we will work on."
</P>
<P>
First dismissed by many as a meaningless exhibition, the Grand
Slam Cup has become an important date on the tennis calendar. The
latest edition which started on Tuesday offers a total six million
U.S. dollars in prize money.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Launches Program for Export Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh today launched an
integrated program for strengthening the country's supply capacity
of exportable goods and services with an emphasis on development
and diversification of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
The capacity building for improved governance in trade and
trade- related areas are the other priorities of the program,
Bangladesh Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said at
the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The program is also aimed at integrating the Bangladesh economy
into the rapidly globalizing world economy and the international
rating system as an essential prerequisite for creating conditions
for sustainable growth and development, alleviating poverty and
generating employment.
</P>
<P>
"Export development is our top-most priority and this is the
only way through which we can integrate ourselves into the global
economic processes and eventually survive in the highly
competitive world," the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
"The objectives of poverty alleviation, rural development,
employment generation are all dependent on how best we mobilize
our resources in this direction," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export performance over the last decade, which
registered a real average growth rate of 14 percent in the 1990s
compared to 5.5 percent in the 1980s, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have been exporting 125 kinds of products to about
120 markets, 90 percent of the export receipts are occurring only
from three products -- ready-made garments, frozen food and jute
and jute goods," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Out of these products, ready-made garments alone contribute 67
percent to the country's export earnings, he said, adding that
about 50 percent of the export earnings are generated from three
market outlets -- the United States, the United Kingdom and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
"We urgently need concerted and coordinated efforts to improve
our supply capacity of the exportable goods and services and also
market access to strengthen and diversify the market base," the
minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Clinton's Reference in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed a
reference to it by the United States President Bill Clinton at the
United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in years that a U.S. President refers to
Cyprus in his U.N. General Assembly address." said Cyprus
Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides today at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
In his address Monday to the 52nd U.N. General Assembly,
Clinton placed Cyprus among the countries where the U.N. continues
to prevent bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"This means the Cyprus question is a priority of the U.S.
diplomacy," Christofides said, adding that Clinton's speech
coincides with "the atmosphere prevailing in the Cyprus issue and
heralds serious developments."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton in his address expressed hopes that the
differences between Greece and Turkey, the respective allies of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities in the divided Cyprus,
will be solved.
</P>
<P>
Also hailing Clinton's speech, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos has said it is important that the U.S. president has
placed the Cyprus problem and the Greek-Turkish relationship among
the issues that have to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops on this eastern Mediterranean island and took the northern
third in the wake of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls For Study Of Party Congress Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China's Central Committee, told a meeting of the Central
Committee's Organization Department today that an effort must be
made to bring the tasks set by the Party's National Congress to
the nation's attention.
</P>
<P>
"A conscientious attitude is needed to study the documents of
the Party's 15th National Congress and to follow its guiding
principles," he said, pointing to the Congress as a historical
milestone in the development of China and the Party.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Jiang Zemin summarized the Party's experience
gained since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee in 1978, at the Congress, and it embodies the Party's
collective wisdom, Hu explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that holding the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high is
the key to studying the documents and adhering to the basic line
of the primary stage of socialism. In doing so, a hard effort must
be made to get a good grasp of Jiang's report and its key areas,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Practical steps should be taken to solve remaining
contradictions and problems coming from economic and social
activities to push reforms and opening-up and the modernization
drive into the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
A consistent, strong, and improved Party leadership is
essential to meeting the goals set forth at the Congress, and most
importantly, an effort must be made to arm the whole Party,
especially leading officials, with Deng Xiaoping Theory to use it
as the guiding ideology, Hu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Policies have been worked out, and cadres are the dominant
factor in implementing them, so it is important that the work of
leading bodies at all levels be improved to provide a strong
organizational guarantee to the great cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, Hu concluded.

CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian military

fatal attack on a tourist bus in central Cairo that killed 10

ammunition and aided one of them to escape the mental hospital he
was committed to.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canada's customs agency
hopes to build three specialized warehouses at three major ports
as part of its stepped-up anti-smuggling campaign, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Canada Customs said about 60 percent of the illegal
contraband it seizes, ranging from drugs, weapons to pornography,
has come from containers entering Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver
ports.
</P>
<P>
Customs agents have found nearly 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in
drugs among the millions of the containers entering Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Canada Customs is trying to boost its inspections to about
three percent of all containers entering Canada, a fifteen-fold
increase from 1989.
</P>
<P>
"Containers pose the highest risk because of the volumes and
their size," said an official of the agency.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are now under way between the agency and Canadian
shippers on the proposals.

HELSINKI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A new Intertoto Cup format
may entice European soccer's big clubs who currently ignore what
they consider a summer inconvenience, UEFA officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Changes being proposed include abolishing the current league
format and replacing it with a home-and-away, knock-out
competition.
</P>
<P>
German and French clubs have supported the competition since it
was revamped in 1994 but bigger clubs from countries like England,
Italy and Spain have shown little interest.
</P>
<P>
UEFA thinks they might be enticed into entering if they had to
play just two, or at most four, matches in August to gain a
back-door entry into European club competition.
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals is an idea that teams from smaller
countries would play a series of knockout rounds. They would
eventually meet, for example, an English or Italian club, exempt
from the earlier stages, in a final round.
</P>
<P>
The winner of that tie would qualify for the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The idea is still being discussed by UEFA and European pools
companies who originally organised the Intertoto many years ago as
a way of providing revenue during the summer months.

JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Homeless Palestinians in
Jerusalem sent a letter today to visiting Czech President Vaclav
Havel, asking him to help improve their conditions through
mediation with Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The letter was handed over by the Committee of the Camp of
Steadfasting and Endurance. The camp, set up in the Siwaneh
quarter of Jerusalem, now houses the Palestinians whose homes were
demolished by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The letter urged Havel to help achieve a just and humane
solution that could help end the sufferings of the homeless
Palestinians in the camp.
</P>
<P>
Every minute, Israel is practicing an apartheid racist policy
among Arab citizens in Jerusalem, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied building permits to Palestinians in Jerusalem
and 70,000 Palestinians have been affected by such policies, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
Havel arrived here Monday for an official visit and is
scheduled to meet both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Newspapers Required to Renew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- All 13 newspapers currently
published in Sierra Leone have been given six working days (up to
the end of September) to renew their registration if they want to
continue publication.
</P>
<P>
State radio and television reported today that the order was
made late Monday after the Commissioner of Information and
Broadcasting Sedu Turay had a meeting with Frank Kposowa,
president of the Sierra Leone Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
Turay was quoted as saying that "the registration will be in
accordance with the 1980 Newspaper Act. We need to bring sanity
and responsibility into newspaper reporting."
</P>
<P>
"I would not take responsibility or make representation for
any publisher who draws inspiration from publishing untruths and
fertile imagination," said Kposowa.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1980 Newspaper Act, the initial fee for a
certificate of registration is 2,000 U.S. Dollars and 1,000
Dollars for annual renewal.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the papers have not renewed their certificates
for the past three years, source from the ministry of information
said.
</P>
<P>
The act gives the commissioner the right to refuse to register
or grant renewal or suspend or cancel any registration already
granted and the aggrieved proprietor of a newspaper can appeal to
the Sierra Leone High Court within 30 days against the
commissioner's decision.
</P>
<P>
Any proprietor who violates the act risks a fine not exceeding
1,000 Dollars or a jail term not exceeding one year or both fine
and imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Merchant Vessels Warned not to Enter Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Colonel Max Khobe,
commander of the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) in
Sierra Leone, today said in a statement warning all merchant
vessels and their owners "to keep away from Sierra Leone due to
the sanctions and embargo now in force."
</P>
<P>
The statement was broadcast today by the clandestine FM 98.1
radio, which is supporting the return of the ousted President
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
West African leaders at their summit in July in Abuja,
Nigeria, agreed to pressure the military government in Sierra
Leone to return power back to the civilian government through
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The military government, some businessmen and ship's agents
are bent on violating the embargo," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement specifically "warned the captain of the merchant
ship MV SKY, the agent of the ship and the military government
that if the MV SKY or any other ship attempts to berth in
Freetown day or night, the ship will be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
The statement also warned civilians living in the vicinity of
the port to "move out of the area with immediate effect as the
port is now regarded as a military zone."
</P>
<P>
Sources told Xinhua that the MV SKY is currently anchored on
international waters outside Sierra Leone with dozens of
containers of provisions and other scarce consumer items such as
sugar which were ordered by a Lebanese merchant in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Trade Ministry officials said they would not comment on the
statement.

BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, Chief of
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), met

understanding, friendship and co-operation between the two
countries' armed forces and promote all-round bilateral friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the Ukrainian visitor on China's defense policy and
army building and noted that General Secretary Jiang Zemin
announced at the Chinese Communist Party's 15th National Congress
the downsizing of the PLA by 500,000 people within three years.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only an important step of improving the PLA's
quality but also an action to safeguard world peace and regional
security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA will firmly implement that decision, Fu added.
</P>
<P>
Zatynaiko said he believes that his China visit will further
increase bilateral military co-operation, especially in military
technology.

<HEADLINE> OIC Urged to Help Develop Economy in Muslim Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today called on the Organization of Islamic Countries
(OIC) to play a role of catalyst in promoting economic development
in Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"The OIC has to be transformed into a dynamic organization and
bring the Muslim countries together for addressing matters of
mutual concern," Leghari said while inaugurating a three-day
conference on "the Muslim Ummah in the next century" here.
</P>
<P>
Institutions like the Islamic Development Bank providing help
for cooperation among the Muslim countries should be strengthened,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Muslim countries should develop their economies to be able to
respond to the challenges presented by a fast-changing world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater integration of the Muslim economies
to maximize the advantages of mutual trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Islamic financial institutions, he said, should not only be
strengthened but charged with the task of finding solutions to the
financial problems being faced by the Islamic world, Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Muslim countries should not remain
dependent on scientific and technological assistance from others.
</P>
<P>
"Continued dependence on imported technology cannot foster
autarky nor create a conducive environment for regeneration of
real and sustained interest in the development of a scientific
approach," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari noted that efforts should be made to foster greater
unity within the Muslim Ummah to overcome differences and
divisions.
</P>
<P>
"We must collectively defend those Islamic people who are
victims of aggression, or are suffering under foreign occupation
and oppression," he said. "We should stand united against the
denial of the inalienable right to self-determination."

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader to be Expelled from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet ministers of
the break away republic of Somaliland have unanimously approved
the expulsion of Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, deputy President of
Hussein Aidid's self-crowned government, from Somaliland within
24 hours starting from this morning.
</P>
<P>
A statement announced last night by Abdi Iddiris Duale, press
secretary of the president of the break away republic of
Somaliland, said the approval of the expulsion came after Tuur
failed to recognize the sovereignty and the independence of
Somaliland Republic.
</P>
<P>
Tuur and his delegation reached Hargeisa, capital of the
Somaliland three days ago where they were warmly welcomed and had
lunch with Mohamed Hagi Ibrahim Egal, president of the break away
republic.
</P>
<P>
The statement further noted that after serious talks, Turr
still insisted his position of seeking a federal system with
southern Somalia rather than accepting the secession of
Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
Duale said Egal and his cabinet ministers have understood that
the presence of Tuur in Hargeisa is endangering the security of
the whole republic and the unity of the people in Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Tuur will be sent back to Mogadishu.
There's no word yet from Tuur himself over the new situation, but
he is still in Hargeisa with his large delegation.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said Egal, president of the unrecognized
break away republic of Somaliland, has rejected a request from
Tuur to meet him privately. There's doubt that there will be a
forceful expulsion and it is not yet clear where Tuur will go
from Hargeisa, either to the town of Buro which is his home town,
or straight back to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
This expulsion might create a new wave of violence in
Somaliland despite Tuur's denial that he went there to make
trouble. Tuur still enjoys the support of quite a large number of
militiamen from his Garhajis sub-clan who are scattered in the
Southern Hawd (forest) reserve area of Somaliland.

Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf has voiced his country's wishes to
restore diplomatic relations with Syria in the near future, Iraqi
newspaper Al-Iraq reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that diplomatic relations between Iraq and Syria will
be reestablished in the near future, and that bilateral ties
... will expand for their common benefit." the paper quoted
al-Sahhaf as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Syria are for the time being limited to
reopening the joint border with the aim of promoting trade ties
and exchange of goods between the two countries," al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi-Syrian ties, severed in early 1980's because of Syria's
support for Iran in the Iraqi-Iranian War from 1980 to 1988, have
been improved in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reopened the border in June and later signed
an agreement for Iraq to import goods from Syria within the
framework of the oil-for-food deal between the United Nations and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi foreign minister also expressed the hope
that consultations between Iraq and Iran would resume for the
normalization of bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to postpone or review 214 government projects, state-owned
enterprises and private companies in a bid to realize economic
stability following the rupiah's depreciation against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
A presidential decree to the effect was issued last Saturday
and the projects to be affected are worth 178.789 trillion rupiah
(about 62 billion U.S. dollars), Minister/State Secretary
Moerdiono said when announcing the decree here today.
</P>
<P>
"The government has set up a team which will continue to
evaluate (the projects), and we will reevaluate the projects if
the situation enables (us to do so)," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
On September 16, the Indonesian government announced the plan
to postpone and review some government and private projects in
order to reduce state budget deficit as a result of the rupiah
depreciation since July this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects to be postponed are in mining, energy, oil
and transportation fields and some others have a high import
content.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attack following the de facto devaluation
of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso in July. The rupiah has
fallen about 25 percent since January this year.

meeting today with Peter Cazalet, president of the China-Britain
Trade Group, and a delegation led by Iwao Isomura, president of
the Tokai Japan-China Trade Center today, said that China will be
more active in its reform and opening up, now that Deng Xiaoping's
theory has been recognized as the Party's guiding ideology.
</P>
<P>
Li said that general secretary Jiang Zemin's report at the
Party's 15th National Congress is a political declaration and
action program and that establishing Deng's theory as the Party's
guideline was the most important issue of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will continue to implement its policy of
"one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" with a high-degree of autonomy in Hong Kong to maintain the
region's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Li discussed China's enterprise and fiance system reforms and

<HEADLINE> Suicide Bombers Come From Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated today that the suicide bombers who
struck two central Jerusalem markets came from the Palestinian
self-rule areas despite the denial by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Czech
President Vaclav Havel, Netanyahu said that Israel is much more
certain now that the perpetrators of the July 30 bombings in
Mahane Yehuda market and the September 4 bombings in Ben Yehuda
mall came from the Palestinian areas instead of abroad as the PNA
claims.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israeli security forces are still investigating
the two bombings in order to identify the suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Saying Israel is on high alert against more terrorist attacks,
Netanyahu demanded the PNA honor its commitments to the Oslo
accords by fighting terrorist organizations and their support
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He praised Jordan for making 100 percent efforts to fight
terror, although it could not get 100 percent results. He was
apparently referring to the Monday terrorist attack against Israeli
guards at the Israeli embassy in Amman, during which two
guards were wounded by a previously unknown anti-Israeli Islamic
group.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we expect from Mr. (Yasser) Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority: to fight terrorists and not embrace them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent wave of terrorist attacks in Israel that
seemed to have smashed Netanyahu's election promises to achieve
peace with security, the Israeli leader insisted it is still
possible to wipe out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will be able to affect the terrorists'
mentality, I think we can certainly affect their capabilities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Army intelligence chief Moshe Yaalon said
today that the suicide bombers of the recent two terrorist
attacks in Jerusalem came from Area B under Israeli security
control, but those who planned and ordered the attacks are
from Area A under sole PNA control.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Yaalon said that the breakthrough in probing
the bombings was achieved thanks to the recent massive arrests
of Palestinian suspects in the Nablus area.
</P>
<P>
Since the two Jerusalem bombing attacks which killed 20
people in addition to five suicide bombers, Israeli security
forces have arrested over 600 Palestinians suspected of being
involved in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Only in the single operation last Saturday night, 40
Palestinians were nabbed by Israeli security forces for being
affiliated with the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
which claimed responsibility for the two Jerusalem attacks.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the Israeli claim about the indentities of the
suicide bombers, the PNA leader Arafat demanded days ago that
Netanyahu provide evidence to prove the Israeli claim.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Pibi, adviser to Arafat on Israeli affairs, charged
Netanyahu today for misleading the public by claiming that the
terrorists came from the Palestinian areas. He said that the next
few days would prove that the opposite is true.

<HEADLINE> Forest Expect Tougher UEFA Action Against Anderlecht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nottingham Forest on Tuesday
said that UEFA should impose tougher penalties on Anderlecht for
bribing referees in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's biggest club will not be allowed to play in the next
European competition for which it qualifies, UEFA announced on
Monday, after UEFA said it bribed officials in 1983 and 1984, the
year Anderlecht beat Forest to reach the UEFA Cup final.
</P>
<P>
Forest spokesman Larry Lloyd said European soccer's governing
body had been soft on Anderlecht.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Anderlecht undermined the whole moral and
ethical base of football," Lloyd said in a statement. "Nottingham
Forest are of the opinion that UEFA have not gone far enough in
their punishment of Anderlecht."
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht recently admitted having paid one million francs
(27,000 U.S. dollars) as a "loan" to the Spanish referee in the
second leg of the 1984 Cup semifinal which they won 3-0. Forest
had a goal controversially disallowed.
</P>
<P>
Last week first division Forest said it would seek compensation
for their former players involved in the 1984 campaign as well as
suing Anderlecht for 1.5 million pounds (2.4 million U.S. dollars)
in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the players who played in that game have joined forces
with the club in agreeing to seek further action," Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
"Nottingham Forest and the players involved will be guided by
legal advice from Brussels, " he added.

<HEADLINE> English Transfer System Faces Shake-up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- England's premier league plans
to have a new transfer system in July, but the scheme faces
opposition from smaller soccer clubs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, which promotes "player power" in the
aftermath of the Bosman ruling, a player over 24 who reached the
end of his contract would be able to move clubs without a transfer
fee.
</P>
<P>
These players would, however, expect to attract a sizeable
signing-on fee and negotiate huge salaries.
</P>
<P>
Mike Lee, spokesman for the premier league, said on Tuesday it
wanted this new system to start from July 1, 1998, during the
soccer close season. It has the support of the players' "trade
union", the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA).
</P>
<P>
But he said the premier league had not reached agreement with
the Football League, representing the interests of clubs in lower
divisions.
</P>
<P>
"They understand the need for reform but they are seeking a
transitional period," Lee said. "We believe that this season was
the transitional period and we now need a clean and simple break."
</P>
<P>
He said the new system would not affect the in-contract system
from which most clubs in the lower leagues derive their transfer
income.

<HEADLINE> Britain Signs Missiles Contract with Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain has signed a
contract with Kuwait for the supply of anti-ship missiles to
be mounted on patrol boats of the Kuwaiti naval forces, the
visiting British Defense Secretary George Robertson announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said through a press release of the British Embassy
in Kuwait that "this contract is the latest to be placed under
government to government arrangements for the (supply of )
defense equipment which were signed after the Gulf War."
</P>
<P>
He said that the British Ministry of Defense has signed a
contract with the Kuwaiti government, under which Britain is to
sell Matra British Aerospace Dynamics Sea Skua anti-ship missiles
to this gulf country.
</P>
<P>
Previous purchases have been the GKN warrior infantry
fighting vehicles and short Starbust anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
He said "this is excellent news, Sea Skua missile was a major
factor in winning the naval battle during the liberation of
Kuwait and will be a great enhancement to Kuwait's ability to
deter and combat any future aggression."
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not disclose the value of the
contract and when the missiles are expected to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
Robertson arrived in Kuwait Monday on a three-day official
visit to the Gulf state during which he held talks with
Kuwaiti leaders on boosting military relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Robertson's visit is within a Gulf tour which already took him
to Oman and will also take him to the United Arab Emirates. It is
the first visit by a British defense minister to the sensitive
Gulf region since the new Labor government took office in Britain
in May this year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Robertson met with Kuwaiti leaders
and visited a British ship taking part in the commission of
enforcement of international sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told a limited pool of local reporters yesterday
that he held "detailed discussions" with senior Kuwaiti
officials raising security issues and several potential defense
deals for British contractors.
</P>
<P>
"We talked about a number of procurement orders that are
still ongoing," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
The British new Labor government reassured Kuwait in May
right after it assumed power that it would continue the
policy undertaken by the previous administration which is aimed
at ensuring Kuwait's stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reiterated their determination to strengthen
their defense cooperation in all fields in London last
February during a visit by Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheik
Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Britain signed a defense cooperation agreement in
1992 following the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang said today that, in the new situation in the world,
China and the United States should forge a new bilateral
relationship oriented toward the 21st century, one that focuses on
mutual benefit and co-operation and is not aimed at a third
country.
</P>
<P>
Shen told a press conference in Beijing this afternoon that,
because China is the biggest developing country and the US the
biggest developed one, and because both are permanent members of
the UN Security Council, a sound and good Sino-US relationship is
"very important". The two countries share common understanding on
many regional and international issues, and have had good and
effective cooperation on some issues.
</P>
<P>
"We should be aware of the fact that there is more in common
than difference between the two sides," he said, adding that
difference and different points of view on some questions can be
settled or reduced through dialogue and consultation and are not
really that important.
</P>
<P>
China places great emphasis on Sino-US relations, he said, and
in recent months, bilateral relations have continued to improve
and develop, and China is looking forward to further development
of bilateral ties after Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to
the US scheduled for this fall.
</P>
<P>
He said that improved Sino-US relations are good for the two
countries, and for regional and international peace and stability
as well.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the Taiwan question, he said that the US should
not interfere in China's internal affairs, but that it can do
something on this issue, that is, it should not sell large amounts
of advanced weapons to Taiwan and should not encourage in any form
 any activity aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question is a very important issue in Sino-US
relations, he noted, and if the US can handle this issue in
accordance with the three joint communiques, it will help relax
relations across the Taiwan Straits and will help advance the
process of China's peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> ILO Expects New Forest Code to Protect Loggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 30 experts from 10 major
forest countries today began a week-long discussion about a new
Code of Practice on Safety and Health in Forest Work which the
International Labor Organization (ILO) expects to protect loggers
and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Forest work is an occupation practiced by some three million
people and considered as one of the most hazardous in the world,
ILO said in a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
Every year, thousands of forest workers die or are injured in
forest work due to unsafe practices and the danger of working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the press release said that unsafe forestry has an
environmental impact, causing more damage than necessary to
remaining timber crops.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Gabon,
Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States
will meet at ILO headquarters here on September 23-30 to discuss
the new code of practice which draws on international experience
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The new code outlines a legal and institutional framework for
safety in forestry through which governments, employers, workers,
forest owners, labor inspectors, machine manufacturers and others
have specific roles to play.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests a training system which will ensure access by
the entire workforce and lead to demonstrated and certified levels
of skill.
</P>
<P>
The new code covers all types of forest workers, including
groups with higher than average accident frequencies like
contractors, self-employed and forest farmers.

<P>
KUWAIT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Council of Asian
(OCA) has reached an agreement with Thailand's Olympic Committee
that Bangkok will remain as the host of the 1998 Asian Games,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Ahmad al-Sabah of Kuwait
confirmed the decision. "With the solution we have reached here in
this meeting, Bangkok will host the (Asian) Games 1998, " he said
after an executive meeting.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the OCA had signed a memorandum of agreement
with the Bangkok Asia Games Organising Committee (BAGOC)
reasserting OCA authority for supervising the organisation of the
games which is slated for December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The agreement ensures that existing committees will oversee the
preparations of BAGOC and that it meets its deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The head of Thailand's Olympic Committee promised here earlier
Tuesday to ensure the success of the Bangkok games.
</P>

Thanajaro.
</P>
<P>
"I fully understand and am aware of your concerns" over delays
in preparing for the Games, he said in a speech to the OCA

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Military Leader Willing to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior foreign ministry
officials in Sierra Leone told Xinhua today that military leader
Major Johnny Paul Koroma "is willing to negotiate a peaceful
solution" to the current political impasse in the west African
state.
</P>
<P>
One official quoted a letter to the United Nations Security
Council by Koroma four days ago, saying the Sierra Leone leader
"wants to meet ousted President Tejan Kabbah and rebel leader
Foday Sankoh for talks."
</P>
<P>
"Major Koroma expressed gratitude for the welcome step taken
by the UN to appoint Uganda-born Francis Okelo as special envoy
to Sierra Leone to study the problem at first hand," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
"This is what the people of Sierra Leone have been asking for
over the past few months and we sincerely believe that this is a
move the international community should have taken in the first
place," according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
"Despite everything we have done to restrain the anger of our
people after the brutal massacre by the Nigerian component of
ECOMOG (west African peace-keeping force) on the 3rd and 4th of
September perpetrating on our innocent citizenry, despite all the
efforts that we have made to call on the rest of the world to
stop Nigerians from committing acts of aggression without the
mandate of the Security Council, despite the blood and tears of
our babies, our mothers, our sisters and our old people, Nigeria
continues to kill us with impunity and disregard for human and
international decency," the letter added.
</P>
<P>
It went on saying that "the people of Sierra Leone may be poor
and insignificant but according to the UN Charter, we are still
members of the human race. The UN and the world should not
require our battered and maimed bodies and our torn limbs to
prove it."
</P>
<P>
"We as a ruling council are nonetheless willing to enter into
talks with anyone for the sake of our people. We are ready to
talk at the level at ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West
African States). We are ready to talk at the level of the United
Nations and I am personally ready to enter into tripartite
negotiations with Mr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Corporal Foday
Sankoh," Koroma concluded in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said Koroma's letter marked the
latest twist to finding a workable solution to the constitutional
stalemate after the May 25 military coup.

<HEADLINE> China's Poverty-Eradication Success Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the UN World
Food Program (WFP) and other agencies today spoke highly of
China's poverty-elimination efforts at a seminar in the program's
Beijing Office.
</P>
<P>
They said they agree that China has set a good example for
other developing countries to follow in co-operating with
international organizations in assisting poor people.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hongbin, an official from the State Council Leading Group
for Poverty Alleviation and Development, said that China has
scored achievements in its poverty-elimination efforts and that
the number of rural people below the poverty line dropped from 250
million in 1979 to 58 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, he told the participants, China now encounters
enormous difficulties in the drive because the remaining 58
million live in remote, rocky mountainous areas and in areas
inhabited by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Because of extremely harsh natural conditions in these areas,
he noted, the international community should continue to help
China in its anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government spent 15.3 billion yuan on
poverty relief in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
Present at the seminar were a delegation from Rome's WFP
headquarters. Members of the delegation are scheduled to visit
Qinghai and Gansu provinces where there are WFP-aided agricultural
development projects.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Rejects Charter Change Petition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the
Philippines today rejected a petition of the People's Initiative
for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA) for a people's
initiative to amend the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal unanimously voted 13-0, junking the PIRMA petition
for charter changes to lift term limits of the president and other
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
The junking of the petition came two days after President Fidel
Ramos categorically declared that charter changes should be made
after the May 1998 elections and he will not run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, the president serves a single
six-year term and is not allowed to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos, who was inaugurated on June 30, 1992, thus
cannot run for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
After the supreme court rejected the PIRMA's petition,
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres urged the group to abide by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I think the supreme court has already decided on their case so
they should abide by that decision," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
Torres said Ramos has proposed that charter changes should
take place after next year's national election and delegates to a
constitutional convention (ConCon) should be elected
simultaneously with the May 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
"I think the call of the president for ConCon should be the
right move to take and that will be after 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president suggested that charter changes be made by the way
of a constitutional convention.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Receives 90 Percent of Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has received 90 percent
of the contracted foodstuff within the first phase of an
oil-for-food deal, U.N. humanitarian affairs coordinator in Iraq,
Dennis Haleidy, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Haleidy said 2 million tonnes of the
food articles including vegetable oil, sugar and rice have arrived
since the deal came into force last December.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the remaining amount of the food
articles will reach Iraq within the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Haleidy pointed out that the U.N. Sanctions Committee has been
slow in approving the contracts Iraq concluded with foreign
companies, subsequently delaying the arrival of food supply.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the food supply can reach Iraq more
promptly in the second stage of the oil-for-food deal beginning in
June.
</P>
<P>
Haleidy, who is an Irish, has been the U.N. humanitarian
affairs coordinator in Iraq since early this month.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has called on the U.N. Sanctions Committee to hurry up in
approving its contracts for purchasing food articles and medicines
and to set a time ceiling for Iraq to receive them.
</P>
<P>
Iraq struck an oil-for-food deal with the U.N. in May 1996
which allowed Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over a six-month period to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods. The deal was renewed in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people have been suffering from the six-year-old
U.N. sanctions imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Daily Amount of Defaulted Bills Sharply Up in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The daily average amount of
defaulted bills in South Korean banks marked a hefty 13-fold
increase from that of seven years ago, in a chain-reaction to
bankruptcies of major corporate failures, including Hanbo and
Sammi groups.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the first half of this year reached 70.2 billion
won (7.8 million U.S dollars), more than 13 times over the 5.4
billion won (6 million dollars) recorded in 1990, said the Bank of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The figure, which had steadily increased from 12.6 billion won
(1.4 million dollars) to 43.9 billion won (4.8 million dollars) in
1995, showed a temporary decline to 41.9 billion won (4.7 million
dollars) last year, before surging to a record high this year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of bouncing checks for the first six months of
this year was 566,700, worth about 10.18 trillion won (11 billion
dollars). The average amount per defaulted bill was 18 million won
(20,000 dollars), up 309 percent from 4.4 million won (4,800
dollars) recorded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The average amount of defaulted bills was also on a steady rise
from 8.1 million won (9,000 dollars) in 1991 to 12.5 million won
(14,000 dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rate of defaulted bills also rose from 0.04 percent in 1990
to 0.06 percent in 1991 and hit 0.20 percent in 1995. Last year,
it dropped to 0.17 percent but rebounded to 0.29 percent in the
first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The default rate of personal checks was 2.31 percent, while
those of promissory notes and corporate checks stood at 0.45
percent and 0.18 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> IMF Official Calls for Imposing Monetary Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Stanley Fischer, first
deputy manager director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
today urged Thailand and other member-countries to impose monetary
control and improve financial structure for avoiding financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center focusing on the recent financial crisis in
Thailand, Fischer said the recent financial turmoil in Thailand
showed the consequences of a combination of a weak financial
system and inadequate macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said, the IMF views the widespread
incidence of major banking failures throughout the world as of
extreme importance for its surveillance of its members'
macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also said Thailand should improve its financial system
and monetary conditions before the deadline fixed for mid-October
in accordance with the IMF's bailout program.
</P>
<P>
In August, Thailand was forced to turn to the IMF for arranging
a loan of 17.2 billion U.S. dollars after the country's financial
system went into a tailspin, causing financial disturbances in the
Southeast Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Modern Prison Established in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A maximum security
prison for South Africa's most violent criminals was officially
opened in Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Inmates at the new closed maximum security unit (CMSU) would
not be allowed to smoke, shave or talks to one another, and would
be locked in their solitary cells for 23 hours a day, local media
today quoted Minister of Correctional Service Sipo Mzimela as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the new concept was a forerunner to envisaged super
maximum prisons, the first of which was expected to be launched
in the country in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The CMSU would house murders, rapists, escaped inmates, gang
leaders, prisoners with violent records, and those found guilty
of murdering fellow inmates, prison staff and police members.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners in the unit would be allowed only the minimum human
rights as enshrined in the constitution, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
All the prisoners' meals would be served in their cells, to be
eaten with plastic utensils, and they would at no stage be
allowed to leave their cells without cuffs.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said the CMSU had several high-tech security features,
including stun belt, and the cuffing of the inmate's hands to his
waist which should be needed when the inmates have to leave the
prison to go to court or a hospital, guarded by two security
staff.
</P>
<P>
An electronic device is attached to the stun belt which can be
activated by remote control to administer a 50,000 volt shock,
rendering the inmate paralyzed, but not dead.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's crime rate is one of the highest in the world.
The government is taking a number of steps to enhance the police
and security systems.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Leather Industry Has Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's leather industry
could become one of the country's major foreign exchange earners
if it is properly harnessed, the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) has
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently the sector is producing intermediary products for
export and ready-made items to meet local demand, according to
the latest EBZ Export Review available here today.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ said that the industry continued to grow in terms of
export last year by a notable seven percent and contributed a
total of 2.093 million U.S. Dollars to the total earnings of
Zambia's non-traditional exports of 310 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the largest market with a total value of 1.4 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Crust leather accounted for a total 128,000 Dollars, all of
which went to South Africa while the remaining finished leather
was exported to Malawi, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector has been facing varied problems, such as
inadequate supply of raw materials that has led to tanneries not
operating at full capacity with big producers operating at around
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other problems include the high tariffs in potentially
lucrative markets such as South Africa which is inhibiting access
on a competitive basis.
</P>
<P>
South Africa slaps a 35 percent import tariff on Zambia's
leather products as opposed to free access which members of the
Southern African Customs Union enjoy.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ said that Zambia as a whole stands to benefit from an
increase in export if only a vigorous pursuit on the issue of
bilateral trade agreements with neighboring countries mounted.
</P>
<P>
The EBZ also said Zambia's crocodile skin continued to show
great potential, earning the country 320,000 Dollars from export
last year.

<HEADLINE> Bihar State Leads in India's Leprosy Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Notwithstanding the Indian
government's program to eradicate leprosy by the turn of the
century, 50,000 new cases had been reported in the country's
eastern state of Bihar by March this year, a state government
survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Bihar leads the country in prevalence and spread of the disease
with an estimated 500,000 patients, according to the survey, whose
results were published today.
</P>
<P>
Though the spread rate came down from five per thousand in 1995
to two per thousand last year, it was still higher than the
national average of 0.9 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Patna, capital of Bihar State, as well as Nawada, Purnea and
Rohtas have been identified as the worst-affected areas, where
union government-sponsored multi-drug therapy has been introduced
to check it, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The state government has decided to set up special committees
to identify fresh cases, particularly in villages, and launch a
special drive to eradicate the disease, a state spokesman said
today.

<HEADLINE> Small is Beautiful for Role of Govt: WB Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Government should play a
small and consolidated role, leaving the market ample room in
economic life, according to panelists at a World Bank seminar here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar on "The Role of the State", Anatoly
Chubais, first deputy prime minister of Russia, mentioned two
principles: "First, there should be as less state role as
possible; second, in the field that needs a role of government,
the role should be as strong as possible."
</P>
<P>
Chubais, also minister of finance of the Russian Federation,
said that since 1991 the Russian government has taken steps to
rebuild its role in a market economy in transition.
</P>
<P>
The state has played a macroeconomic role, said that the
official, by curbing inflation from ten percent per month several
years before to ten percent per year now, stabilizing the exchange
rate between the Rupee and the greenback, and controlling
government finance and budget.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is in progress as the government is withdrawing
from the economy, according to Chubais. He stressed that the
government role is strengthened in such fields as providing a
social safety net, attacking corruption and ensuring law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Another speaker at the seminar, Trevor Manuel, minister of
finance of South Africa, listed some fundamental roles government
should play, including establishing a foundation of law,
maintaining macro-economic stability, providing basic
infrastructure and protecting the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
In his presentation, Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, minster of
Federal Administration and State Reform of Brazil, proposed to
"set the limits for the sphere of action of the state".
</P>
<P>
He said that civil service should be the exclusive and core
activities of the state. The social and scientific services should
be shifted from the control of bureaucratic bodies to the hand of
the non-profit organizations, while production of goods and
services should be privatized to let market play its role,
according to the Brazilian official.
</P>
<P>
Today's discussion was among a series of four-day seminars
organized by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) prior to and during their joint annual meetings, which
opened here today.

<HEADLINE> HK Dollar, Thai Baht Not in Same Basket: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today ruled out any possibility of major impact on the
Hong Kong dollar by the recent currency turmoil in Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
In view of different situation in capital accounts of Hong Kong
and Thailand, the HK dollar and the Thai Baht are not in the same
"basket of currencies", IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley
Fischer said at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international financial center and its economy
has unique advantages, so the HK dollar is entirely a single
currency, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"It's theoretically possible but extremely difficult to tie
them to a basket of currencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So given the role of Hong Kong as a financial center, it's a
very different economy with different level of development from
Thailand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that it is crucial to strengthen
government surveillance over the banking sector to reduce currency
risks. The IMF believes that "much importance" should be placed
on surveillance, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the IMF warned Thai authorities against
possible crisis last April. If proper measures were taken then,
the prices paid now to deal with the problem would have been much
less, he added.
</P>
<P>
While describing the current devaluation of the Thai Baht as
"not a massive overreaction" by the market, he expressed
confidence that the problem can be dealt with eventually.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Belarus to Promote Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko
vowed to improve bilateral relations in a joint declaration issued
here today.
</P>
<P>
In the Kazakh-Belarussian Joint Declaration, the two presidents
agreed the traditional friendship among the former Soviet
republics would be kept on bases of mutual respect, equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
They said that strengthened integration would be helpful to the
development of the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev told reporters that the Kazakh-Belarussian bilateral
trade has dropped in the past two years due to some problems in
transportation and taxation policies.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries would make joint efforts to promote
the cooperation within the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who arrived here Monday for a three-day visit to
Kazakhstan, said that Belarus and Kazakhstan have great potential
in economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the Customs Union formed by
Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan in improving trade
development in the four countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two governments also signed accords on
free trade, cooperation in air transportation, mutual protection
for labor rights of each other's citizens in the other country,
mutual militarized supervision over import and export of military
supplies, and youth policies.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Reduced Sharply This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's foreign trade deficit
dropped to 1.67 billion U.S. dollars in the first eight months of
this year, 44.3 percent lower than that of the same period last
year, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The decrease is mainly attributed to a rapid increase in
exports, with ten main export lines having stable markets in the
world and to a three percent decrease in import between January
and August, compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, imports of August were 13 percent lower than those
of July, with priorities given to imports of modern machinery and
equipment and limits on imports of automobiles, motorbikes and
steel.
</P>
<P>
Also during this period, import value of consumer goods made up
5 percent of the total import turnover. Import and export duties
reached 8,400 billion dong (711.86 million dollars), said the
reports.

<HEADLINE> 65000 HIV Infections Reported in Western Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization's (WHO) Western Pacific Conference was told today in
Sydney that as of August this year, 65,000 HIV infections had been
reported in the Western Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
But it was estimated 300,000 people had the disease in the
region, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the 65,000 cases 70 percent were attributed to sexual
transmissions and 30 percent to injecting drug use.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region where increasing HIV epidemics have
been recorded included Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, China, Malaysia
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The conference was told low levels of HIV transmission were
recorded in Japan, Pacific island nations, the Philippines and the
Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Declining HIV epidemics were recorded in Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
WHO estimates by the year 2000, 700,000 in the region will be
infected by HIV.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Piot of the United Nation's HIV/AIDS Program said the
only way the problem (HIV infection) will be beaten is if a
vaccine is discovered.
</P>
<P>
"If we ever want to eradicate AIDS we will have to have a
vaccine," he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Australia's HIV/AIDS reduction schemes, such as the
controversial needle exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Although not willing to become involved in the public debate on
the program, Piot said Australia's AIDS strategies were now being
modeled by "conservative" countries such as China, Nepal and
Vietnam.

<P>
One stock that has attracted strong interest today is Qantas,
Australia's largest airline, whose shares finished 13 cents down
at 2.80 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some brokers suggested the fall could be attributed to an
article in an aviation trade magazine which said Qantas faces
declining profitability in the face of flat revenue growth.

Australian dollars, while its preferred shares improved 16 cents

National Australia Bank (NAB) has closed steady at 22.25
Australian dollars, ceding its position as Australia's largest
company by market capitalization to resources giant BHP after just

BHP has reclaimed its position as Australia's biggest company
after its shares rose 11 cents to 15.89 Australian dollars, taking
its capitalization to 32.08 billion Australian dollars (23.09
billion U.S. dollars) compared to NAB's 31.52 billion Australian
dollars (22.69 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the poor outlook for commodities has continued to
affect the major resource stocks, with mining company WMC falling
seven cents to 6.14 Australian dollars and Rio Tinto finishing
down 14 cents to 20.98 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the gold sector, stock prices have closed generally down
with the bullion price trading at 320.75 U.S. dollars per ounce
compared to yesterday's close of 320.90 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Tourism Ministerial Meeting Opens in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The two-day tourism
ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, SAARC Secretary
General Naeem Hasan and tourism ministers from the seven SAARC
member states attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga called the meeting "a historic event" in
the region's development.
</P>
<P>
She said the tourist industry has been the major engine of
progress for the developed countries as well as the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The South Asian nations have some of the most beautiful
natural resorts in the world and deserve to receive more tourist
arrivals," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Tourism Minister Dharmasiri Senanayake in his
address urged the ministers to adopt necessary measures to speed
up the development of the region's tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said the total SAARC region only receives less than one
percent of the international tourist arrivals in the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, SAARC Secretary General Naeem Hasan said: "We
need to remind ourselves that promotion of tourism is not only
important from the economic point of view, but is also deeply
important to projecting and promoting images of our countries to
the outside world."
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, it's necessary to develop intra-regional tourism
within the SAARC countries in order to promote people to people
contacts, which can make important contribution to the development
of the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Several policy decisions relating to tourism in the region are
expected to be taken up for discussion in the meeting. The last
tourism ministers meeting was held in 1969.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda are the possibilities of simplifying visa-related
procedures and documentation for nationals of SAARC countries,
establishing direct air links between the seven capitals and
introducing special air fares within the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also explore the possibility of the
convertibility of SAARC currencies within the region and the
simplification of customs formalities to and from SAARC nations.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, established in December 1985, groups India, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, the Maldives, Bhutan, Pakistan and Bangladesh and has a
total population of 1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Model Families Commended in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- One hundred families across
China were commended here today as models in a national drive to
promote moral standards in families.
</P>
<P>
Ten won special awards as outstanding representatives of the
100 families in today's commendation event, which is the
culmination of the drive to create "civilized families" launched
last November by 18 state ministries and commissions, including
the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF), and
the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The families were honored for carrying on the Chinese tradition
of respecting the old and caring for the young, respecting the
equality of the sexes and preserving harmony between husband and
wife, managing the household in an industrious and thrifty way,
and promoting neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at today's event, Chen Muhua, Vice-Chairwoman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and ACWF
Chairwoman, said: "These model families both retain the fine
tradition of the Chinese nation, and represent the characteristics
of the socialist civilization."
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese society is in a period of transition, she
pointed out, problems concerning familial ethics arise, making it
all the more necessary to promote moral standards for families.
</P>
<P>
Chen emphasized that promotion of familial ethics is beneficial
to not only family harmony and stability, but also the improvement
of national quality, promotion of economic development and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central
Committee; and Peng Peiyun, State Councillor and chief of the
Working Committee on Women and Children under the State Council

<HEADLINE> Huangpu (Whampoa) Alumni Learn Gist of 15th Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Some alumni of the Huangpu
(Whampoa) Military Academy established by Dr. Sun Yat-sun, the
forerunner of the Chinese revolution, have called on alumni both
at home and abroad to make more contributions to national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based alumni made the call at a forum on the study
of the just-ended 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Mo Wenhua, vice chief of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni
Association and a special delegate to the Congress, presided over
the forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin in his report to
the congress voiced his wish that the Chinese people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait will work together for national reunification
and rejuvenation. His report expressed the common aspirations of
all Huangpu alumni and their friends and relations, Mo said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's smooth return marked a significant step toward
national reunification, and the post-return situation proved that
the "one country, two systems" theory not only suits Hong Kong,
but Taiwan as well, said Mo.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwan authorities' attempts to create
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" run counter to the
historical trend for national reunification and the common wishes
of all the Chinese people. He urged the Taiwan authorities to stop
separatist activities and return to the "one China" stand.
</P>
<P>
Other alumni attending the forum asked that fellow alumni and
their friends and relations both at home and abroad heed Jiang's
call, and do more to ensure peaceful unification of the motherland
by promoting cross-strait economic, scientific and cultural
exchange and cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has launched partial privatization of
the state telecommunication monopoly France Telecom by putting 20
percent of its stocks into the market, which is the first time for
a French public enterprise to sell its shares in stock
exchange. The government wishes to obtain 36 billion francs (6
billion U.S. dollars) from the operation, and use the money to
finance international development of the group at a time when
France opens its telecommunication market to competition by
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
-- The Solidarity trade union of Poland and the electoral
alliance it had formed by gathering around it 38 rightwing parties
was confirmed to be the first political force of Poland on Monday,
and is now intending to form a coalition government with the central
parties. The result of legislative elections on Sunday was a frank
victory for the right, which was eliminated from institutions in the
1993 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The major financial take-overs in Europe have doped the stock
exchange in Paris and other European financial centers, with the CAC
40 index of the Paris Bourse attaining 3,017.45 points on Monday.
The markets have been doped by three other factors since August: a
strong dollar, a euphoric Wall Street and relaxed banking interest
rates. The recent take-over bids, such as the Casino supermarket
chain by Promodes, the Salomon sports commodities group by Adidas,
had made the financial operations in the bourse wild.
</P>
<P>
-- The European space rocket Ariane will send its 100th
satellite, an American telecommunications Intelsat 803 satellite,
tonight from Kourou, the French Guiana, since it began sending
satellites in December 1979. These 18 years have proved the
reliability of European space technology and brought about
commercial success for the European Space Agency, which now runs 60
percent of the world market of satellite-launching.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Interest Rates Drop to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Optimism about continuing
low inflation in Sweden and positive news from the United States
made Sweden to lower its interest rates on Monday to its lowest
level in years, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The yield on ten-year bonds fell to a record low of 6.25
percent Monday, surprising many financial analysts, most of whom
have been preaching for months that the bond market was levelling.
</P>
<P>
However, after a turbulent spring, interest rates defied
forecasters by starting to fall. Compared to their high of 7.47
percent at the end of March, long-dated bonds fell by over 150
basic points to Monday's 6.25 percent, the lowest rate since early
1987.
</P>
<P>
The drop in interest rates was mainly driven by rising
expectations that today's report from the Sweden's central bank
will confirm the low inflation trend as well as the decline in the
yields on U.S. 30-year T-bonds.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Reduce Uncertainty in World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The developed countries
must act as soon as possible to reduce uncertainty and
destabilizing factors in the world economy, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) which opened here today, Chinese
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said that although the world economy
situations continued to be encouraging, a wide range of risks and
fragility's persist in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The international financial market has experienced some
unrest," he said. "Especially disturbing is that developed
countries continue to shirk their international obligations --
official development assistance as a share of their gross national
product has dropped to the lowest level in 50 years."
</P>
<P>
These problems, if not addressed in a timely and effective
manner, will not only dampen the economic future of developing
countries, but also undermine the sustainability of the global
economic growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting the World Bank's contribution in promoting the
development of developing countries, Liu hoped the Bank to make
full use of its comparative advantages and continue to focus on
transferring resources to developing countries, alleviating
poverty and promoting sustainable development as its core
operations.
</P>
<P>
He said China supports the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency to increase its underwriting capacity, and is willing to
take its share of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
As for the implementation of the debt relief initiative for the
highly indebted poor countries, Liu urged creditors, especially
the Paris Club members, to honor their commitments in a timely
manner to benefit eligible countries as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that the responsibility of fighting corruption
rests solely with sovereign governments.
</P>
<P>
"The two institutions should act in strict accordance with
their respective mandates, limit their anti-corruption activities
to the economic aspects, and ensure uniformity of treatment of
all members based on objective criteria," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
China supports the extension of the IMF's jurisdiction to
capital account and endorses its inclusion in the IMF's purpose,
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed those members with immature conditions
should be allowed to proceed toward capital account convertibility
in an orderly and healthy manner based on their real situations.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Corruption Drive Successful, Says Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-corruption
campaign has produced remarkable results since the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1992, according
to the Party's top disciplinary body.
</P>
<P>
The nation has worked out an effective way to battle corruption
while building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in its work
report, which was earlier submitted to the newly-concluded 15th
Party Congress for approval.
</P>
<P>
The central collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core
has considered improving the work style of the Party, building up
a clean government and countering corruption as "an issue that
concerns the survival or death of the Party and the state" and has
achieved a lot in this regard over the past five years, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 263,000 officials at or above the county (section) level
made self-evaluations for rule and discipline violations between
1993 and last June, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The nation's disciplinary and supervisory agencies investigated
731,000 corruption cases and solved 670,100 of them between
October 1992 and June 1997, and took disciplinary or
administrative action against 669,300 party members. A total of
121,500 members were expelled from the Party, among whom 37,492
were punished for their criminal acts.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Corruption Drive Successful, Says Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the years China has also succeeded in rectifying unhealthy
practices in various departments and sectors. Professional ethics
and the moral standards of Party officials have improved, and a
number of laws and regulations on improving the work style of the
Party and building up a clean government have been formulated.
</P>
<P>
Based on a summarization of years of experience, the report
said that the anti-corruption campaign must closely center around
economic development and serve the best interests of the whole
Party and the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that to push forward the anti-corruption
in a healthy and orderly manner, the leadership of the Party must
be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the success, anti-corruption is a complex,
difficult and protracted struggle, as corruption has not been
brought under complete control and is still spreading within some
parts of the Party, government and judicial system, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The spread of corruption within the Party and government and
among officials must be eradicated in five years, it vowed.
</P>
<P>
To this end, greater efforts must be made to guarantee the
effective implementation of the Party's lines, principles and
policies, strengthen the leadership, improve education in Party
spirit, work style and discipline, and increase disciplinary
examination, the report pointed out.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Employment Index Drops to Years' Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Amid a protracted business
slowdown, the number of retiring employees in South Korea has
topped that of new employees in the past two years and the gap is
getting wider, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the NSO report based on a Labor Ministry tally,
the ratio of new employees to retiring employees in the
manufacturing sector stood at 84.0 percent in July, marking the
lowest level since January 1993, when the corresponding figure was
79.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
July's ratio of 84 percent was also the lowest figure since
July of 1980, when the ratio was 82.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ratio in the manufacturing sector has remained below the
100-percent level since September of 1995. The last time it stayed
above 100 percent was in August 1995 with 100.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The entrants-retirees ratio in the job market stayed at around
90 percent throughout last year but fell to 84.3 percent in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
NSO officials said the ongoing decline of the ratio, which
often serves as a leading indicator of economy, shows that the
economy is likely to bottom out.

<HEADLINE> Hubei Sets up Protection Zone for Fossilized Dinosaur Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has built a 15,000-square meter protection zone for the world's
most well-preserved groups of fossilized dinosaur eggs discovered
in its Yunxian County.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yang Jialu, a well-known paleontologist from China's
Geological University, said the eggs date back more than 65
million years.
</P>
<P>
He added that the well-preserved fossilized eggs will have high
value in the study on prehistoric geography, the earth's natural
disasters, the origin of life, the reasons for the extinction of
dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
The location where local paleontologists spotted the fossilized
dinosaur eggs in March 1995 covers a total area of 450,000 square
meters. More than 1,300 of the eggs were visible above-ground.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new egg discovery, another group of fossilized
eggs had been unearthed in Xixia County in Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The local government has announced that anyone who digs up or
sells the eggs will be punished, and that the related departments
will extend the area of the zone to better protect the eggs.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Benefits from Solar Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Most residents of northwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region, even the lamas, who used to
regard solar energy as an insult to the Sun God, have been
benefiting from various solar-powered facilities.
</P>
<P>
With an average sunshine time totalling from 3,100 to 3,400
hours each year, Tibet ranks second in the world in terms of
receiving the amount of solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has invested over 17 million yuan
(about 2.2 million US dollars) to build two million-plus square
meters of greenhouse area, 80,000-square meters of housing with a
solar energy heating system, and about 100,000 solar-powered
kitchen ranges, according to Zhang Jie, director of the Tibetan
Solar Energy Research and Demonstration Center.
</P>
<P>
She added that scientists and researchers have been working
since the early 1980s to promote the solar energy-related
technology in the region so as to conserve resources and protect
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is going to build the country's largest solar energy
power station in Ando with the highest power-generating capacity
and most advanced equipment in the country in a move to maintain
the region's leading role in the field.
</P>
<P>
The Shuanghu Solar Energy Power Station, currently China's
largest solar energy power station, was set up in Tibet in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The region has applied 1,000 kilowatts of solar battery power
to the radio, TV broadcasting, telecommunications and other
transmitting systems in the area, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"Various facilities using solar energy in Tibet have saved
conventional energy sources amounting to more than 110,000 tons of
standard coal each year," said Zhang Jie.

<HEADLINE> Talks Going on to Avert Teachers Strike in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Serious consultations are
taking place in a bid to find solutions to avert the planned
national teachers strike, the East African Standard today quoted
Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized here Monday that "we hope for a
workable solution before the expiry of the deadline (October 1)"
of the strike call by the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT)
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had hoped the stalemate would be resolved
between KNUT and the Ministry of Labor, adding, "the matter is
now under very active discussion at government level."
</P>
<P>
Since KNUT issued a notice of the strike to be called on
October 1, many branches of the teachers union all over the
country have supported the move.
</P>
<P>
Taita Taveta District teachers vowed to proceed with the
strike unless the Ministry of Education adhered to their specific
demands.
</P>
<P>
teachers in Kwale also resolved to support the October 1
strike and told Kamotho to resign.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Busia branch called on all local teachers to "participate
fully" in the planned October 1 strike.
</P>
<P>
Keiyo District was warned "not to dare" report to their
respective schools on October 1.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with top KNUT officials here last night,
Kenyan Labor Minister Philip Masinde criticized KNUT officials
for resorting to the strike option.
</P>
<P>
The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150
and 200 percent and has also called for the resignation of
Education Minister Kamotho.
</P>
<P>
But, the Kenyan government agreed to give an increase ranging
between 10 and 28 percent, which Kenyan teachers rejected as "an
insult to their intellect".
</P>
<P>
Kamotho pointed out that "surely it is not realistic for
anybody to ask for a 200 percent hike. The teachers must be told
the truth about the pressures from the International Monetary
Fund and general poverty."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Kenyan Ministry of Labor had formed a
committee to address the issues raised by the teachers union.

news items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's main opposition Conservative leader
Williams Hague is preparing to take on the Conservative old
guard and give demoralized grassroots Tories a far bigger

expected.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Jack Straw, Britain's Home Secretary, is preparing a
dramatic change in the rules governing British elections,
including the compulsory registration of parties. The
changes could mean more restrained campaigns in Britain and
would ensure that British voters never endure the huge
propaganda efforts pumped out by U.S. political parties and
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair is facing a
continuing revolt from some Cabinet ministers, who are
digging their heels in and refusing to give up all of their
16,000 (about 25,600 U.S. dollars) pay rise.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Agree to Exchange Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey agreed to put
an end to their six-month-old diplomatic crisis by exchanging
ambassadors, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the decision
was made by their foreign ministers during talks in New York on
the sidelines of the ongoing U.N. General Assembly session on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say whether the two countries would appoint
new ambassadors or simply send their previous ones back to
work. Nor did it give a specific date for that.
</P>
<P>
Ankara had accused Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Reza Baqeri of
interfering in Turkey's internal affairs by voicing support for
the rule of Islamic law in the politically secular country at an
Islamists' rally in the Ankara district of Sincan in early
February.
</P>
<P>
This culminated in Turkey's requesting Iran to withdraw its
ambassador and the expulsion of other two Iranian diplomats.
Tehran took a tit-for-tat move by expelling Turkish ambassador and
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem also agreed to
reactivate joint committees dealing with economic and political
cooperation in order to further broaden bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi lashed out at Israel's hegemonic tendencies and warned
that the military cooperation between Turkey and Israel has caused
concern among regional states.
</P>
<P>
Cem was quoted as saying that Ankara was determined to further
strengthen relations with Tehran and exchange ambassador with it
in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran and Turkey, as the two founding members
of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) which also groups
Pakistan and central Asian countries, should shoulder greater
responsibilities in the organization's future activities.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers underlined mutual cooperation in connection
with the forthcoming Tehran Summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) in December.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Borrows $27.5M to Meet Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government
borrowed 15.1 billion Shillings (about 27.5 million U.S. Dollars)
in the 1996/97 fiscal year to finance the budget deficit, the
Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 12.8 billion Shillings (23.3 million Dollars)
were from non-bank private sectors, the report quoted the
Quarterly Budget Review from the Ministry of Finance as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 7.7-billion-Shilling (14 million Dollars) debt, owed by
the government to the Central Bank of Kenya, was repaid.
</P>
<P>
All governmental borrowing during the year was in the form of
funded debt, with the Treasury bill being the leading debt
instrument.
</P>
<P>
The stock of public debt has been declining over the last four
years, to stand at 449 billion Shillings (8.2 billion Dollars) by
the end of June 1997, compared to 489 billion Shillings (nine
billion Dollars) in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
The decline was due to a continuous drop in the level of
external debt which has gone down by 16 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
Total government revenue fell short of target from 6.2 billion
Shillings (11.3 million Dollars) during the 1996/97 fiscal year
and 149.2 billion Shillings (2.7 billion Dollars), or 26.4
percent of the gross domestic product were collected as revenue
that year.
</P>
<P>
Total expenditure and net lending increased by 8.6 billion
Shillings (15.6 million Dollars) during the year over the 1995/96
year to 160.8 billion Shillings (three billion Dollars).

national wrestling teams, had informed him of the U.S. intention
to attend some sports events in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The American sports officials said that the U.S. is interested
in taking part in the 1997 World Greco-Roman Wrestling
Championships, sports events in the 10-Day Dawn celebrations and
the World Free-style Wrestling Championships in 1998, all to be
held in Tehran, Taleqani said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has in turn asked Iran to participate in the 1998
World Cup Free-style Wrestling competitions as well as the World
Youth Championship to he held in the U.S., Taleqani said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not attend the 1995 World Youth Wrestling games
and other competitions held in Tehran. Taleqani stressed that only
after the U.S. participation in the upcoming competitions here,
Iran would consider attending the games in the U.S. next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iranian teams will participate in the competitions
next year if Iran decides that it is not against its national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. broke diplomatic relations in 1980 after the
U.S. hostage crisis. Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in
Tehran on November 14, 1979 right after the Islamic revolution and
took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
The United States has imposed economic sanctions against Iran
since they broke diplomatic relations. Washington still regards
Tehran as a state sponsoring terrorism and seeking weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, the administration of the U.S. President Bill Clinton
has shown interest in having dialogue with the administration of
Iranian liberal President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
An American women delegation had planned to visit Tehran. But
the trip was canceled in the last minute by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Regarding recent U.S. overtures toward Iran, Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi said at a recent press conference that
Washington was not seriously seeking resumption of ties with
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Americans are not serious in their
requests for negotiations. We are ready to negotiate only when it
is based on mutual respect, the recognition of Iran's realities
and the principle of non-interference," Kharrazi added.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the U.S. must lift its sanctions and
stop leveling allegations against Iran, otherwise it is impossible
to have any talks between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Cooperation to Be Sought to Minimize Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will seek
cooperation from the other ASEAN members to look into ways to
minimize the impact of severe currency fluctuations on their
economies, especially on trade and investment, a Malaysian
official said today.
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz told a
news conference here that Malaysia would bring up the currency
crisis affecting several ASEAN countries at the 29th ASEAN
Economic Ministers' Meeting to be held here from October 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The minister said one way the ASEAN countries could minimize
the impact was to develop specific industries in specific
countries within ASEAN, which were most cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
She said that whatever strategy the economic ministers might
adopt would probably be brought forward to the ASEAN Leaders'
Informal Summit to be held here in December.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, ASEAN currencies have been battered
by foreign speculations, causing them to decline significantly
with Malaysia's Ringgit having fallen by 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah dismissed the speculation that the currency crisis
would impede the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) process, saying "all
of us are in the same boat."
</P>
<P>
She called on Malaysian manufacturers to use the opportunity
created by the depreciation of the local currency to increase
exports.

<P>
NANJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province, has 367 hectares more green area than
two years ago when it had 9,253 hectares of tree-covered space in
its urban areas, according to the Nanjing Bureau of Parks and
Woods.
</P>
<P>
The city has increased its green area coverage to 40 percent,
or about eight square meters per person, continuing to rank among
the top green capital cities in China, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing has taken great efforts to build ten green squares with
a total area of 260,000 square meters and plant nearly 100,000
trees along 50 streets in last two years. It has also newly built
13 parks covering 40,000 square meters and flower beds totaling
22,700 square meters, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In its suburbs, Nanjing has built hundreds of hectares of
shelter-forests to prevent industrial pollution and beautify the
surroundings, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing now has an urban environment further improved by the
green project, and has recently been honored as "State City of
Gardens" by the Ministry of Construction. Consequently, Nanjing
has hosted more and more international conventions, national
conferences and trade expositions.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Nanjing has witnessed a boom in tourism, the
official noted. In the first half of this year the numbers of
tourists from home and abroad have increased by 15 percent and 30
percent respectively from the same period of last year, with the

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Calls for Efforts to Meet Challenge of Inclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn today called for "a quantum leap" in the development
effort to narrow the gap between the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Annual Meetings of the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Wolfensohn
outlined a plan to meet what he called "the challenge of
inclusion", which is "the key development challenge of our time".
</P>
<P>
"Our goal must be to reduce these disparities across and within
countries, to bring more and more people into the economic
mainstream, to promote equitable access to the benefits of
development regardless of nationality, race or gender," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must recognize that we are living with a time bomb and
unless we take action now, it could explode in our children's
faces," he warned.
</P>
<P>
If world leaders do not act now, he warned, the number of
people living in acute poverty could grow from 3 billion to 5
billion in the next 30 years. The environment would deteriorate
over that time, and the number of wars could increase.
</P>
<P>
Whether seen as a social, economic and moral issue, "this is a
challenge we cannot afford to ignore", the president said. He
called on all developing countries to "educate their people,
ensure their health, give them voice and justice, financial
systems that work, and sound economic policies".
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn highlighted the achievements of East Asian countries
in lifting people from poverty and sharing the benefits of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent turbulence in the region's financial
market, he said, "We still expect long-term growth and poverty
reduction to be strong."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the Bank is scaling up its work to
restructure banking and financial systems in developing countries,
and pointed to East Asia's recent currency turbulence as evidence
of the need for such assistance.
</P>
<P>
The "challenge of inclusion" is too big to be handled by any
government or development agency alone, he said, emphasizing
"partnership" resting on four pillars as a "cornerstone" of the
concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, the government and the people of developing
countries must be in the driver's seat, exercising choice and
setting their own objectives for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, partnerships must be inclusive, with involvement of
bilateral and multilateral agencies, labor organizations,
non-government organizations, foundations and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, development agencies should help all countries, but
concentrate on those which were most likely to use external
support effectively. "We must be selective in how we use our
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
And finally, the development community must aim for a quantum
leap in results by focusing heavily on social and human
development, rural and environmental development, and financial
and private sector development.
</P>
<P>
As the ninth president of the prestigious international
financial institution, Wolfensohn also outlined a number of
changes now underway within the World Bank Group, designed to make
it more effective in its mission of reducing poverty.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Launch National Women's Employment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Government is
likely to launch a National Action Plan (ANP) in the last week of
October for ensuring the employment of women at all levels, it was
learned here today from an official source.
</P>
<P>
The ANP, has been already approved by Bangladesh Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, the sources said, adding that it was prepared on
the basis of assessment of 12 ministries.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that the plan emphasizes the strategy of
mainstreaming women's development into government policies and
programs.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been formulated to remove all the disparities
against women at all levels in the country, a high-ranking
official from the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
It has proposed in the NAP to explore the possibilities whether
women can be appointed to the post of Bangladesh's permanent
representative to the United Nations or to the post of Chairperson
of the University Grant Commission, and to enhance the appointment
of women to the posts of ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing quota for each of the ministries,
female should be given appointment at least 10 percent of Class 1
gazetted officers' posts and 15 percent in the case of
non-gazetted posts.
</P>
<P>
"But no ministry is complying with it," the official pointed
out, adding that as a result, there were less than five percent
representation of women in Class 1 gazetted officers' posts and
less that 10 percent in the case of non-gazettes posts.
</P>
<P>
The NAP will ensure accountability in all the ministries in
implementing the policies regarding women's and children's
development, the official said.

<HEADLINE> WB/IMF Meetings Have Special Meaning for HK: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said here today that the annual meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which opened here today, is of
special meaning for Hong Kong shortly after its reunification with
China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the meetings, Tung said the
presence of Premier Li Peng and many distinguished guests of the
international financial community signified their strong support
for Hong Kong and underlined its status as a leading international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
The meetings, scheduled for September 23 and 25 in Hong Kong,
also provide a unique opportunity for people from all over the
world to witness at first hand the pride and confidence and the
continuing prosperity and stability of Hong Kong under the
framework of "one country, two systems", said the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Tung continued: "July 1 has come and gone. We, who live and
work in Hong Kong, continue to work hard for an even more
successful and prosperous future."
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that business is as usual in Hong Kong
after July 1: the SAR government has been functioning normally,
economy continues to grow, there has been no change in life style,
 and recent surveys have shown that 78 percent of the Hong Kong
people expressed confidence over Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental reason for our confidence is the solid promise
of the Basis Law," said Tung. "All the factors critical to Hong
Kong's success have been enshrined in the Basic Law, which
provides a constitutional framework for the HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
He accredited Hong Kong's remarkable success over the past
decades to free competitive environment, rule of law, a level
playing field, clean and efficient civil service.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive noted that the fixed exchange rate regime
is the anchor of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability. He
said: "We do not intend to compete internationally on the basis of
exchange rate adjustment. We compete equally and fairly in terms
of private sector productivity and public sector efficiency. Our
open markets, free trade and sound finance are the hallmarks of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Asia may be going through a period of consolidation, he said,
adding that many countries that have suffered from the recent
turmoil in the financial market will soon be on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing rapid growth and development in many parts of
Asia will bring new opportunities to Hong Kong," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Olympics Organizers Agree to Consider Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nagano Winter Olympic officials
are considering new environmentally friendly ways of raising the
starting point of the men's downhill race, which the International
Ski Federation says falls short of Olympic standards.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions presented by federation will be passed on for
government consideration, Makoto Kobayashi, director general of
the Nagano Olympic Committee, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
International Ski Federation secretary general Gian-Franco
Kasper assured Japan that the proposed course would not damage
surrounding national park land.
</P>
<P>
Kasper said: "We can guarantee the Japanese people there will
be absolutely no construction that will touch the ground."
</P>
<P>
The men's downhill will be one of the main events of the
February 7-22 games. But the course has been panned as too easy
for a top international competition.
</P>
<P>
The ski federation and the International Olympic Committee want
the start raised to 1,800 meters from the current 1,680 meters.
</P>
<P>
Nagano officials have countered that a longer course would
require building platforms for cameras, putting up safety nets to
protect athletes or using chemicals to harden the surface -- all
of which is illegal in national parks.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest proposal the starting area would be
constructed of snow. FIS has said chemicals need not be used
within the national park boundaries, and that compromises could be
worked out on the other issues as well.

NEW DELHI, September 23 (Xinhua)-- The U.S.-based Silicon
Valley corporation Knights Technology Inc. (KT) is planning to set
up their first office in India in Mumbai (Bombay) to primarily
cater to the needs of their customers in the Far-East Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
"The Mumbai branch would be an extension of the California
office which will act as a vendor for reputed software systems,"
said Jese Ring, chief of KT Mumbai office.
</P>
<P>
KT is a 100 percent subsidiary of the U.S.-based semiconductor
equipment major Electrogras Inc. and is in the business of
designing, developing and subsequently marketing of systems
software.
</P>
<P>
"The choice of India as an extension in general and Mumbai in
particular are due to two specific reasons. Firstly, a lot of
technical manpower is readily available in Mumbai who are
extremely efficient and reasonably in terms of compensation.
Secondly, and more importantly, this is a strategic location for
other Asian countries who make up our customer base," Jese Ring
said.

<HEADLINE> Sailing Start From City Downtown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- With their whistles blowing,
three luxury yachts slowly sailed out of a harbor in the Funan
River in this capital city of Sichuan province recently, cheered
on by tens of thousands of local residents watching from the
riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
The southwest China city recently resumed its shipping business
after half a century's suspension caused by serious water
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"It is rare in China that passenger vessels can sail in the
downtown area of a big city," said Chengdu Mayor Wang Rongxuan,
adding that some ancient poets even recorded such grand scenes in
their verses.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1993, when clean-up work began on the river, some
100,000 local residents had turned out to get away from the dirt
and foul odor.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city government has invested a total of 2.7
billion yuan (325 million US dollars) to clear the river, build
new banks, plant trees and flowers, open parks nearby, and remove
600-plus wastewater dumping pipes.
</P>
<P>
"The smelly river, at last, was transformed into a green
necklace for the city," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The ecological project received more than 20 million yuan (2.4
million US dollars) of donations from local residents, and it also
drew attention from cities in Britain and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The city government has also worked out plans for the next five
to ten years to recover the water transport between Chengdu and
the Yangtze River region.
</P>
<P>
"Boats may sail directly to cities of Nanjing, Yangzhou and
Shanghai on the lower reaches of the country's longest river in
the near future," said the mayor.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The general health reports
on children in Shanghai, have approached the standards set by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in terms of both weight and height.
</P>
<P>
A survey from the Department of Children's Health shows that
the growth of children under age seven has improved, compared with
ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The average weight of urban and rural children in this age
group increased by 0.54 kg and 0.5 kg respectively, while their
height increased by 1.17 cm and 1.38 cm.
</P>
<P>
The growth indices of children under age one and between the
ages of four and six have met the WHO's standards.
</P>
<P>
Health experts attributed the improvement in children's health
to the effective health care measures provided by communities.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, many clinics specializing in prenatal
health care, particularly treatment of liver and heart diseases in
 newborns, have been established in the city.
</P>
<P>
The health care networks for women and children at all levels
have set up a "Children's Health Card" system to monitor and
record the growth of children under seven and spread information
about children's health care to new mothers.
</P>
<P>
The health organizations also improved the prevention work of
common diseases among children, such as children's anemia, rickets
and digestive and respiratory ailments.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A bus driver asleep at the
wheel led to a fatal accident which killed 33 and injured 16 in
Vietnam last Friday morning, press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The bus went off the road and tumbled into a lagoon in
Vietnam's central coastal province of Phu Yen.
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the sleepy driver, wakened by the terrified
cries of the passengers, tried but failed to gain control of the
bus, which was sliding all over the wet road.
</P>
<P>
The driver, who survived the crash, fled the scene of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
A witness said the bus tumbled over and over, then hit a rock
outcropping beneath the road before it sank into the salt water.
</P>
<P>
"Some people and luggage were flung out of the bus", said a
local fisherman who rescued four passengers from the ill-fated bus.
</P>
<P>
Police and local people rushed to the crash site, but could
rescue only 22 people from the bus which was submerged in seven
meters of water.
</P>
<P>
All the bodies of victims have been found and identified.
</P>
<P>
Despite the great efforts of the traffic police, traffic
injuries and fatalities have continued to rise in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Drivers' carelessness was the primary cause of the
wrecks. Poorly maintained infrastructure system is also to blame
for many accidents.
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement of the traffic system and loose enforcement of
the laws has turned the country's roads into a motorized
free-for-all.

<HEADLINE> Khirbash Outlines Priorities for World Bank, IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mohammed Khirbash, chairman
of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), today outlined three major priorities for the
two international institutions as the financial cooperation,
governance and help for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 1997 Annual Meetings of
the World Bank and IMF at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, Khirbash underlined the need for all member-countries to
accelerate efforts to achieve sustained growth and harmonious
development.
</P>
<P>
"Let me highlight three areas where a strengthened common
effort is making a significant difference: financial sector
cooperation, governance and the initiative for heavily-indebted
poor countries," said Khirbash, also minister of state for finance
and industry of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
On financial sector cooperation, he said "enhanced cooperation
would ensure that financial sector problems are promptly
identified, and that each institution takes the lead in its areas
of primary concern."
</P>
<P>
As to the governance issue, he said, "Promoting transparency,
accountability, and institutional capacity are critical to
successful, sound and equitable development."
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Debt Initiative for heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC), he said that the initiative "is a striking
development and a radical departure addressing the debt problems
of these countries in a comprehensive fashion, including debt owed
to multilateral institutions. We look forward to continued
expeditious implementation of this initiative and further transfer
of concessional resources to developing countries."
</P>
<P>
The world economic environment remains "broadly favorable for
the achievement of our objectives," Khirbash noted, and most
countries are achieving growth, with increased attention to an
investment in people and with an increased concern for the
environment.
</P>
<P>
However, there still exist some dangers in economic growth, he
said, noting as an example the recent financial crisis in the
Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He urged the World Bank and the IMF to make further efforts in
minimizing the dangers and in fostering liberalization of capital
movements in ways that are consistent with a sound international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Khirbash also called on all member-countries of the two
international institutions to go forward for an increasingly
integrated world economy.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the annual meetings open, he expressed thanks to the
Chinese Government and the people of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) for their "generous hospitality in
this beautiful city in this historic year."

<HEADLINE> Capital Cinemas Report Record Box-office Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- After a protracted slump in
ticket sales, cinemas in the Chinese capital are reaping record
box-office revenue.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since last year, 76 cinemas in Beijing
reported a total revenue income of about 100 million yuan (12
million US dollars) and market analysts have projected their 1997
turnover to be in excess of 110 million yuan (13.25 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The soaring business profit was resultant from the
establishment of a shareholding movie business entity early last
year that put an end to the monopoly of the municipal film
company.
</P>
<P>
Under the unified movie release system, the 76 cinemas formerly
generated a yearly income of 30 million yuan (3.6 million US
dollars to 40 million yuan (4.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new movie company has continued to tap the market by
launching unprecedented ad campaigns. A domestic-made movie "The
Days Without A Hero," for example, fetched a total box-office
revenue of 5.8 million yuan. One out of four Beijing residents is
said to have seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
And the growing number of cinema-goers reflects the quality of
the movies generally are on the rise, industry analysts pointed
out, especially as the drab propaganda content is waning.

today that a portable artificial heart will soon be available.
</P>
<P>
During the 31st International Heart Diseases Meeting held today

ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian delegation is
expected to arrive here in the first week of October to know
findings of the ongoing probe into the murder of five Iranians
last week in Pakistan, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by a cabinet minister and
"because of strict security, the dates of the visit are not being

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian state-owned oil firm
Agip has discovered a vast oilfield in the Agri valley in south
Italy, the ANSA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Agri oilfield, which is believed to be the largest in the
European continent, has a proven deposit of 622 million
barrels. So far, it has four wells that produce oil.
</P>
<P>
Agip plans to invest 2.457 trillion lire (approximately 1.4
billion U.S. dollars) in the oilfield in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Italy, long plagued with an oil shortage, started oil
exploration in the Agri valley as early as 1936 but had to give up
after failing to find oil at the depth of 300 meters.
</P>
<P>
Oil was struck in the valley in 1980 after drilling 3,000
meters deep, but it has no commercial value.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, oil gushed out of some wells when they had
drilled deep under 5,000 meters.

<HEADLINE> Thai Traders Urged to Prevent Jasmine Rice Adulteration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Foreign Trade
Department has called on Thai rice millers and exporters to pack
their jasmine rice in five-kg bags, in stead of large sacks, to
prevent adulteration, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Jasmine rice, now in high demand in the world market, is
currently packed in 100-kg sacks. The rice is often repackaged
into small bags for retailing. Adulteration is often done at this
repackaging stage.
</P>
<P>
The call has been made after a number of complaints have been
filed by foreign importers alleging that Thai fragrant rice
shipped overseas has been mixed with non-jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
The department has also called on millers and exporters to
label their bags with their own trade marks.
</P>
<P>
Jasmine rice adulteration has also caused concern to Thai
Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee. He said if the problem is
not urgently resolved, foreign confidence in fragrant rice will
erode, just at a time when it is becoming increasingly popular
with overseas consumers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Crack Down on Out-of-Date Food, Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government is
enhancing its cracking down on expired food and medicines on sale
in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar quoted a
reminder issued by the Ministry of Health as notifying that all
brands of bottled water, traditional and imported Western
medicines, tinned provisions, foodstuff and preserves packed in
plastic cases or bags on sale should bear the date of manufacture
and expiry.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Myanmar health authorities banned some 14
brands of traditional drugs and 26 local and foreign brands of
purified bottled water for public consumption in the country for
their failure to meet the required standard after examination.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar enacted the National Food Law in March this year,
forming a special Food and Drug Authority in its bid to enable the
public to consume food of genuine quality, free from danger and
hygienic problems, and to control and regulate the production,
import, export, storage, distribution and sale of food
systematically.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Explains Principles for Helping Developing Countries (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peng said, "Fourthly, countries should learn from each other
and complement each other with respective advantages."
</P>
<P>
Both the developed and the developing countries have their own
strengths and advantages. The developed countries are advanced in
science and technology and strong in financial capital, while the
developing countries are rich in natural and human resources and
large in market potential.
</P>
<P>
The economic interdependence between the two groups is
deepening steadily, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with such increasingly serious global issues as
environment, poverty, debt and refugees, the two sides will find
it hard to cope with the challenges unless they can learn from and
complement each other and work together to bring about common
prosperity, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Fifthly, it is essential to choose a development road
suited to one's own national conditions."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries do need a favorable external environment
in order to eliminate poverty and achieve economic take-off, Li
noted, Yet in the final analysis, they must depend on their own
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from their actual situation at home and in light of
their needs and possibilities, the developing countries should
work out effective domestic policies and actively conduct economic
restructuring in response to shifting economic and technological
trends in the world.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, South-South cooperation in every field should
be strengthened and North-South relations improved and further
promoted.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said, "Sixthly, international cooperation in financial
field should be reinforced."
</P>
<P>
Free flow of capital across national boundaries is a strong
feature of the development of world economy. It can facilitate
absorption of capital by various countries but may also carry
financial risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Being prone to have such risks, developing countries may also
become easy targets of international financial speculation.
Financial crises will do no country any good. The international
community, international financial institutions included, should
play a positive role in maintaining international financial
stability, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Li
said, have played a useful role in promoting the world economic
growth, economic exchanges among counties and economic and social
progress of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
With rapid advancement of science and technology and
unprecedented expansion of economic cooperation, the world is
moving towards multipolarity with accelerated pace, he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank Group and the IMF, as the most influential
multilateral financial institutions, will preserve their vigor and
hold out a bright future only when they can undergo timely
readjustments and reform in keeping with the new and shifting
world situation and give expression to the reasonable demands of
the developing countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army to Withdraw From Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Command of
the U.S. army will begin to leave Panama next Thursday, after more
than 30 years' presence in this country, a Panamanian Foreign
Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Southern Command, the U.S. army for operations in
Central and South America, will move to Miami, the United States,
the spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
About 770 civil and military officers will leave Panama.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal is of historic significance for Latin America,
because the U.S. military presence symbolizes U.S. hegemony over
the region during this century.
</P>
<P>
"The dismantling of the Southern Command headquarters
represents a step forward to the definitive withdrawal of
U.S. military bases and the return of the Canal to Panamanian
hands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter treaty signed by Panama and the
United States in 1977, the United States must transfer the Panama
Canal to Panama and the U.S. military forces will pull out from
the country before December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The first American military force was installed in Panama in
1914 to protect the canal facilities.
</P>
<P>
In 1963, for a wider operating control in the zone and more
influence in Latin America's political and military affairs, the
U.S. government established the Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the number of U.S. soldiers has
reduced from 18,500 in 1994 to 5,600 this year in accordance with
the Torrijos-Carter treaty.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by October 1, only 4,400 U.S. soldiers and
officers will stay in the country.

During the meeting, which took place just before the opening

with a high degree of autonomy, thus ensuring the prosperity and

</P>
<P>
China will firmly adhere to this policy, the premier told Bush.

Kong before its return to China, and that facts have proven that
such doubts are unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming state visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
the U.S. would help increase the understanding of the American
people of China, Bush added.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the former president on the recent 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Li described the
congress as very successful.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union
(EU) have strengthened their economic and trade relations in the
past years and there are prospects for greater cooperation in such
areas, senior officials from the two sides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and the EU have been growing
satisfactorily in general since the latter's implementation of a
long-term China policy in July 1995, with efforts made by both
sides, said Qian Qichen, vice-premier and foreign minister of
China in meeting with EU leaders.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is attending the 52nd session of the United Nations
General Assembly, met with Jacques F. Poos, deputy prime minister
and minister of foreign affairs of Luxembourg, the current EU
presidency, Hans Van Mierlo, vice prime minister and foreign
minister of the Netherlands, the last EU Presidency, and Bobin
Cook, foreign secretary of Britain, the next EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting, Qian said China and the EU have increased
exchanges of high-level visit and contacts and political
consultations in recent years that pushed the development of
economic and trade relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Qian also, on request, briefed his EU counterparts on the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which ended
last week.
</P>
<P>
He said the congress showed to the world that China will
adhere to the course of deepening reforms and opening up to the
outside world which was drawn by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
China will meet the goal drawn at the congress, which will
provide greater opportunities for China and EU nations as well as
other states to expand their economic cooperation and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
In their turn, Poos and the other EU officials said that the EU
appreciated China's rapid development and attached importance to
its ties with China.
</P>
<P>
They said the EU saw new scopes for further strengthening its
economic and trade ties with China after China's party congress,
which laid out the plan for deepening reform and opening-up to the
outside world and the nation's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The EU was willing to broaden its cooperation with China and
increase mutual understandings so as to promote bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the issue of China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier noted that great progress has been
achieved in the talks between China and some other nations. The EU
should also take an more active and realistic attitude toward the
matter and push the process moving.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU to take measures to end its protectionism and
promote the development of trade with other nations.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed to make active efforts for China's early
accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
On the human right issue, Qian reiterated China's position for
dialogue on the bases of equality and mutual respect in settling
human right issues between nations.
</P>
<P>
Poos agreed for new ways of cooperation and exchanges in moving
its differences with China on the human right issue.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Seize Tamil Rebels' Arms Lorry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's police on Monday
seized a lorry used by the Tamil rebels to transport explosives,
firearms, ammunition and suicide kits from the North to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested three Tamil rebels who were fleeing in the
lorry, in Vavuniya town in the Northern province, the local press
said today.
</P>
<P>
The lorry owner who had a contract for regular haulage of goods
to and from Vavuniya had fled from Colombo earlier when the police
in the capital city went hunting for him.
</P>
<P>
The lorry was wanted in connection with an abortive attempt by
the rebels to attack the Ratmalana Airport in the suburb of
Colombo which is now used as an airforce base.
</P>
<P>
A large arms cache of the rebels was discovered on September 16
in a safe house at Ratmalana, some 20 kilometers south of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The plot was revealed when two terrorists of the suicide squad
were arrested for spying in the airport premises. Subsequently
five others were arrested but their leader and four others managed
to escape.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the large cache of arms, including explosives,
hand grenades and suicide kits, police found maps of government
buildings in Colombo which the rebels had apparently planned to
target.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok to Seek Loan to Increase Jasmine Rice Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is to borrow about
330 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank to boost the
production of jasmine fragrant rice in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry is drafting a
proposal to the World Bank, which is expected to give a soft loan
for the purpose, according to the Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
In recent years there is a strong demand in the world market
for jasmine fragrant rice, of which Thailand is the only producer.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to improve irrigation networks in two
northeastern provinces, Nakhon Ratchasima and Buri Ram, and to
improve rice seeds.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is trying to find ways to solve soil salinity in
the target areas to double the yield of fragrant rice from about
450 kilograms per rai (one hectare equals to 6.25 rai) to 1,000
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that improved irrigation networks will help dilute
salinity in the soil.

<HEADLINE> China's Energy Sector Greets Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China needs and welcomes
foreign capital and technology to help accelerate its huge but
still inadequate energy supply, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's third largest bank of energy resources, after
the United States and Russia, had used some 12.1 billion US
dollars in foreign investment to build facilities for its power
industry by 1994.
</P>
<P>
The capital helped build 64 large and medium-sized power
projects with a total installed capacity of 40.7 GW, of which 19.6
GW is now in operation.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry had absorbed 3.76 billion US dollars in
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
In early 1993, the Chinese Government announced that foreign
investors could participate in the power industry by setting up
co-operatives or joint ventures or establishing solely
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Power companies from Japan, Kuwait, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada, supported financially by their respective governments, are
vying for a share in China's power market.
</P>
<P>
US companies have participated in China's coal, petroleum and
natural gas sectors, and have been well repaid. The prospects of
co-operation between the two countries in other energy sectors
such as coal and petroleum are also bright.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has made unremitting efforts to improve
the domestic investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Electric Power, which protects power investors and
ensures balanced generation, supply and use of electricity, went
into effect in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
And the provinces and autonomous regions are empowered to
examine and approve joint mining projects with a contracted value
of less than 3.6 million US dollars.

"The reduction is part of our commitment to continue lowering
interest rates. We just wait for the right time to do it," the
bank's foreign exchange division vice chairman Bambang Sindu said
here last night.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its benchmark interest rates to as high
as 30 percent on August 19 to curb massive speculative attacks on
the rupiah after its free floating on August 14.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was trading at 3,020/3,030 against the U.S. dollar
late Monday afternoon from its opening of 2,970, or down by 45
points compared with last Friday's close at 2,975/2,985 per U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Sindu discounted suggestions that the rate cuts prompted the
rupiah to weaken, saying, 'I don't think the rupiah was weaker
because of the rate cuts."
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely because of the Malaysian ringgit weakness,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta stock exchange gained
0.2 percent following the SBI's rate cut, with the composite index
closed up 4.522 points at 535.601.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the upward momentum, amid regional stock falls,
was sustained by the interest rate cut, which would make
investment in equity more attractive.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 25 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Forbidden City Wall Renovation Project to Be Finished Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The renovation of the wall
surrounding the Forbidden City or the Palace Museum, is expected
to be completed before National Day, which falls on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1420 A.D. and covering 720,000 square meters, the
Forbidden City was the imperial palace of two feudal dynasties and
is China's largest and most well-preserved cluster of ancient
building structures.
</P>
<P>
The wall stretches more than 3,000 meters around the Palace
Museum and is ten meters high.
</P>
<P>
Pei Huanlu, deputy curator of the Palace Museum, explained
that deteriorating bricks from the wall are being replaced by new
ones of the original color, which are produced by companies which
specialize in making ancient building materials. The bricks will
be laid using original techniques.
</P>
<P>
The renovation work, which started at the end of 1992, is the
Forbidden City's biggest overhaul project since the founding of
new China in 1949, Pei said. Total investment for the project is
is 3.5 million yuan (about 420,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 meters of wall, or about half of the total length,
will be repaired, Pei said.

<HEADLINE> US Parties Raise More Soft Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Major political parties in
the United States raised more 'soft money' in the first half of 1997
than they did during the same period of the last presidential
election cycle, the government reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Republicans raised 21.7 million dollars from January to
June, up from 16.6 million dollars in soft money during the first
half of 1995, when the Republican Party was amassing funds for the
presidential race, according to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Democrats collected 13.7 million dollars, compared to 10.8
million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Soft money is at the center of a current fund-raising
controversy.
</P>
<P>
Soft money comes in large donations that are unregulated and
unlimited. Soft money, exempt from the 25,000-dollar-a-year legal
contribution limit on donations from individuals, comes from rich
businessmen, corporations and unions that typically give five- and
six-figure checks to political parties.
</P>
<P>
The money can be used for generic party-building activities
like voter outreach, but not for supporting candidates.
</P>
<P>
Government watchdog groups have long criticized soft money as a
way for special interests to gain access into the political
system. Congress may soon take up a bill that would ban the
donations.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies and tobacco firms were the biggest
contributors of soft money to the Republicans during the first
half of 1997, while Democratic Party committees received most of
their soft money from labor unions, lawyers and lobbyists,
according to an analysis by the watchdog group Common Cause.

new violence, the officer said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Li Peng: Hong Kong's Future Will Be More Splendid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
predicted here today that Hong Kong's future will be more
splendid.
</P>
<P>
Li made this prediction this morning in his address at the
opening ceremony of the 1997 Annual Meetings of the Boards of
Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
As the head of government of the host country, Li extended his
warm congratulations to the meetings and sincere welcome to all
the delegates and honored guests.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meetings are the largest international
conference held in Hong Kong after its return to the motherland on
July 1 and the first such meetings ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance for promoting mutual understanding,
exchanges and cooperation among various parties, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Li quoted a Chinese saying which goes "Seeing it once is better
than hearing about it a hundred times."
</P>
<P>
"Now you are in Hong Kong, you can see with your own eyes that
the Chinese Government's basic policies of 'one country, two
systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and 'a high
degree of autonomy' have been carried out in earnest, and the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
headed by Mr. Tung Chee Hwa is operating normally and effectively
in accordance with the 'Basic Law'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed China's confidence that the SAR government and the
Hong Kong people will do a good job in running and building Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
It can be predicted that Hong Kong's future will be more
splendid, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, in its continued capacity as a free port and an
international financial, trade and shipping center, will play an
even more active role in strengthening the cooperation between
China's mainland and other countries in the economic field, Li
said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Explains China's Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng explained
China's goals for economic and social development in the next 15
years at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Annual Meetings of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the just-concluded 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) is an extremely important meeting
held at the turn of the century to carry forward the past and
break new ground for the future.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has "identified Deng Xiaoping Theory as our
guiding ideology after drawing upon the experience of past two
decades' reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"In grasp of the situation, our central collective leadership
with President Jiang Zemin at the core is strong and enjoys the
support of the whole party and the entire population," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's political situation is stable and the reform
and opening-up policies will not only remain unchanged but also
continue to develop and the cause pioneered by Deng Xiaoping will
not only go on, but also make even greater progress.
</P>
<P>
The period from now to the end of the first decade of the next
century, he went on, is crucial for China's modernization, during
which two tasks must be properly fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
One is to establish a rather complete structure of socialist
market economy and the other is to maintain a sustained, rapid and
sound development of the national economy, so as to lay a solid
foundation for basically realizing modernization by the middle of
the next century and building China into a prosperous, democratic
and culturally advanced socialist country.
</P>
<P>
China must actively promote a fundamental shift in both the
economic structure and the mode of economic growth, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China must continue to deepen reform, effect breakthroughs in
the reform and transformation of state-owned enterprises and the
diversification of the forms in which public ownership can be
realized, Li added.
</P>
<P>
China must also implement the policy of national rejuvenation
through science and education and the strategy of sustainable
development and achieve coordinated socio-economic development and
 overall social progress.
</P>
<P>
"These goals are magnificent and, given hard work, entirely
achievable because we have already found a right road of
development suited to China's national conditions, secured a
stable social and political situation, acquired quite a solid
material and technological base, and possessed a large market and
rich resources, and finally we have 1.2 billion industrious and
talented people," the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Lions Clubs International Helps Chinese Blind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Tanshi, a 52-year-old
Chinese farmer with cataracts, regained his eyesight after an
operation paid for by Sight First China Action (SFCA).
</P>
<P>
The SFCA campaign, which mainly aims at helping Chinese people
cure or prevent cataract disease with 15 million US dollars funded
by the Lions Club International (LCI) and some special government
funds, is carried out by the China Disabled Persons'
Federation (CDPF) and the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Li Tanshi comes from the Luliang mountainous region, one of the
most impoverished areas in China. People of all ages there develop
cataracts, Li said, and it is not unusual for whole families to
have the disease.
</P>
<P>
China has nine million blind people, including four million
with cataracts, according to Han Jibin, an official from CDPF.
Han added that the population with cataract grows by 400,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the blind live in rural areas and have limited access
to medical treatment. In China, there are still 500 county-level
hospitals without ophthalmology departments and some 70 percent of
the country's optometrists live in the cities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid special attention to the plight
of the blind. From 1988 to 1996, some 1.75 million patients with
cataract have regained their eyesight through operations organized
by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and LCI have signed an agreement to
perform some 1.75 million cataract surgeries, to train 1,1000
optometrists and to build up ophthalmology departments in 100
county hospitals in the coming five years. The project will cost
165.48 million US dollars.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng stated here
today that China will unswervingly carry out its policy of
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will work energetically to embrace the world

extensive opening pattern.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Annual Meetings of the

development of China is closely linked with that of the world.
</P>

A prosperous Chinese economy needs a substantial absorption of
advanced technologies, capital and management expertise from
abroad, he added.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs under the new situation of reform, opening-up
and economic development, the Chinese government has decided to
further lower its tariff level by 26 percent in general and adopt
preferential policies on the access of new and high-tech equipment
and practical advanced technologies to China, Li said.
</P>

China's vast market and enormous growth potential will
undoubtedly provide even more opportunities for its cooperation
partners and instill fresh vigor into global and regional economic

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here
today that as much as the developing countries need the developed
countries, the developed countries can not stand without the
developing countries because the world economy is an interrelated
whole.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 1997 Annual Meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here this
morning, Li said, after several decades' efforts, the overall
strength of developing countries has increased remarkably, their
international status has risen and the prospects of their
economic growth look promising.
</P>
<P>
"The rise of developing countries is a far-reaching event in
the present-day world," he noted. "It has smashed the monopoly of
world affairs by a few countries and lent a powerful push behind
the movement towards a multipolar world."
</P>
<P>
He called attention to the fact that 1.3 billion people in the
developing world are still struggling in poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said that economic disparities among countries are
staggering as the gap between the rich and the poor continues to
widen and the unjust and inequitable international economic order
still puts interests of the developing countries in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
"If these problems remain unresolved, the developing countries
can not become developed, neither can the existing developed
countries sustain their growth," Li said.
</P>
<P>
To sustain their prosperity, the developed countries must have
markets for their goods, outlets for their capital and suppliers
of raw materials they need, on all of which they must look to the
developing countries for answers.
</P>
<P>
If the developing countries enjoy economic development and
social stability, this will increase the capacity of world market,
create more commercial and job opportunities for all countries and
generate tremendous benefits, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, if their economy is sluggish and society turbulent,
there will be no peace and tranquillity in the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prosperity and affluence of a small number of countries can
not last long on the basis of poverty and backwardness of the
majority countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
"When we approach this issue, we must have in mind
cross-century development and entire mankind," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Explains Principles for Helping Developing Countries (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today urged
the international community, developed countries in particular,
to take a long-term view and adopt effective measures to meet
their pledges of providing fund and technical assistance to the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Annual Meetings of
 the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) here
this morning, Li said that creating favorable conditions and
helping developing countries achieve sustainable development is a
shared responsibility of the international community and also an
important task of international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he set forth six propositions of principle.
</P>
<P>
He said, "First, full attention should be given to the urgent
development needs of the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, some people no longer regard
development as crucial issue. This view fails to consider the
whole picture, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the question of development bears on the future
destiny of the world, which calls for proper attention, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
If the international community wants to concentrate on
developing the economy in a peaceful and tranquil environment,
then it can not afford to ignore the reasonable demands of the
developing countries and must attend to their concerns over
finance, debt, trade, environment and poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Secondly, extensive cooperation should be conducted
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 countries in the world, and all of them,
big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Trade discrimination and exchanges of unequal values in
economic relations should be opposed, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Such practices as bullying the weaker or less fortunate by dint
of one's power or wealth should not go unchecked, still less
should countries be allowed to impose sanctions, or threaten to do
so, at every turn against others, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are equally entitled to participate in
the making of decisions and rules affecting the international
economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "Thirdly, the right of every country to independently
choose its social system, mode to development and lifestyle should
 be respected."
</P>
<P>
Countries differ from one another in historical background,
social systems, level of development, cultural tradition and value
system. Such diversity is the fact of life one must face squarely.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, we can very well regard these differences as something
favorable for greater cooperation and exchanges if we can pursue
common ground while reserving differences and refrain from
interfering in each other's internal affairs," Li added.
</P>
<P>
In no circumstances should any country be allowed to impose its
 social system and ideology on others, he said. Assistance has
always been mutual. And economic assistance must not be attached
with any political conditions.

<HEADLINE> 66,000 Mine Workers Laid off in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 66,000 miners, or 38
percent of the total mining workforce, have been laid off since
the government began to implement changes in the mining industry
in August, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Due to the absence of modern technology and low profits, the
coal and nonferrous metal mines -- the pillar industries in
Romania -- have received subsidies from the government every year.
</P>
<P>
Romania has recently decided to close down 30 mines between the
years 1998-2000, which will cost some 1,200 billion lei (about 160
million U.S. dollars), a senior official of the Industry and Trade
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Besides laying off unnecessary workers, the government is also
taking measures to improve the technology, renew the equipment,
and raise working efficiency and benefits of the mines, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
President Emil Constantinescu said at a rally on August 2 in
the Jiu Valley Coal, the biggest coal operation in the country,
"We must straighten out the problems in the Jiu Valley Coal
operation. We should not continue to perpetuate a situation of
low profits and dependence on subsidies."
</P>
<P>
Romania has set up three special agencies to deal with the
problem re-employing the sacked workers, asking medium- and
small-sized enterprises to absorb more of them.
</P>
<P>
Every sacked worker is eligible to receive a relief fund of
12-15 million lei (about 1,600-2,000 dollars) from the
government.

<HEADLINE> Panama Considers China Outstanding in Global Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- China is an outstanding
participant in world trade, a Panamanian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Juan Jovana, director of the Center of National Studies of the
University of Panama (IDEN), said in an interview that China, the
third most important user of the Panama Canal after the United
States and Japan, provides great economic opportunities for Panama
and other Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe China will replace Japan as an economic
superpower in Asia next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jovana added this has prompted many countries to maintain
better relations with the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he stressed that out of their short-term
interests, a group of small countries are strengthening ties with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Taking advantage of short-term benefits from Taiwan may harm
our relations with China, which can be our most important partner
in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Panama's position is more crucial than other nations, because
Hong Kong has become the biggest supplier of Colon's free trade
zone in Panama after it returned to China in July, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report on the Panamanian trade, the free
trade zone in Colon, 80 kilometers west of this city, imported a
total of 5 billion U.S. dollars of goods, with 1.3 billion coming
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The IDEN director denied that the Panamanian authorities have
not strengthened ties with China. "If China bans Panamanian ships
entering its ports or if our businessmen are denied entrance to
Hong Kong, that would be worrisome for Panamanian economy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Potash JV Close to Signing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Negotiations for
establishment of a Sino-Israeli potash joint venture have entered
the final crucial stage, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources from the Ministry of Chemical
Industry as saying that two sides are striving to sign an
agreement for the establishment before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations have lasted about a decade. If the agreement
is signed at the end of the year, production may start in five
years after the plant is built.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the potash joint venture, which will
be situated on a salt lake desert near Golmud in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, will require a total investment of 4.6 billion
yuan and will be able to produce 800,000 tons of potash or
potassium carbonate annually when completed.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will be jointly financed by United
Development Industry Co. of Israel, and Mingda Corporation of the
the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry and Qinghai Salt Lake
Industrial Group Co.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will apply Israeli techniques to
manufacturing potash for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Potash is very important for grain harvests, and China's
agricultural development is creating a huge market for
potash-based fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
China now needs 3.5 million tons of potash a year for
agricultural use, but has to import 2.2 million tons annually from
Canada, Israel, Jordan, Russia and other countries to fill the
domestic production gap. By the end of this century, the country's
annual demand for potash for agricultural use is expected to hit
five million tons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital to Step Up Reforms in Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will hasten the
development of its small commercial enterprises by merging them
into bigger group companies, setting up a modern enterprise system
and closing those heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
The first step the city will take is to encourage small
companies to cluster together and urge big ones to take in small
partners to form large group companies, said Gong Li,
deputy-director of the Municipal Committee of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to build two or three large commercial groups
with an annual income of over 10 billion yuan by the year 2000,
Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also expects to see more small retail shops merging
into chain-shops and increase the proportion of their sales volume
to the city's total from the current 4.5 percent to 18 percent in
years, she explained.
</P>
<P>
The small companies are also encouraged to establish a modern
enterprise system, with the focus on building a cooperative
share-holding system. More than 60 percent of the small
enterprises in the city are expected to adopt the shareholding
system by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of ownership will be applied to small enterprises
to make them more open and flexible, Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Those which are deeply in debt and cannot make up deficits and
increase profits should be sold in accordance with relevant
policies or declare bankruptcy, she said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the number of small commercial enterprises
in Beijing amounts to over 90 percent of the total, with 7,700
small shops reporting an average annual revenue of less than
50,000 yuan (about 6,000 US dollars) each.

WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Mint is starting
the public sale of the nation's first-ever platinum bullion coins
on Tuesday in one-ounce and tenth-ounce denominations, said an
Associated Press report today.
</P>
<P>
Sales of uncirculated American Eagle platinum coins in
half-ounce and quarter-ounce denominations will begin in October.
</P>
<P>
All the coins bear a portrait of the Statue of Liberty on front
and a soaring bald eagle on back. They will be sold at market
price, currently around 425 dollars for one ounce, plus a premium
which varies.
</P>
<P>
The 100-dollar face value of the one-ounce coin is the highest
denomination ever made by the U.S. Mint. The half-ounce coin will
bear a face value of 50 dollars. The quarter-ounce and tenth-ounce
will bear face values of 25 and 10 dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>

purchasers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch authorities and
the football association on Monday signed agreement in an effort
to fight against the soccer hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for more co-ordination between government,
local authorities and the police, and recognises hooliganism as a
national rather than a localised problem.
</P>
<P>
The proposals include higher level surveillance of hooligans,
co-ordination over stadium bans and an insistence that "high risk"
matches are played in the afternoon, rather than in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement follows last week's decision by Ajax and
Feyenoord to ban away supporters from attending games between the
two clubs.
</P>

An Ajax supporter was killed by Feynoord fans in March, the
first death in the Netherlands linked to soccer hooliganism.

SHENYANG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas funding is becoming
increasingly more attractive to the state-owned enterprises in
Shenyang, an industrial base in northeast China. Latest
statistics show overseas investment has been drawn to 37 percent
of the firms in the city.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1995, the city government approved 2,415
foreign-funded projects, accounting for 70 percent of such
projects in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded International Trade Fair of Shenyang
brought in from overseas entrepreneurs 1.2 billion US dollars of
contractual funds, 65 percent of which were involved in industry.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Mayor Mu Suixin said that in order to build a new
enterprise system that conforms to the international trend,
Shenyang's large and medium-sized enterprises should introduce
funding, new products, new technology and modern management modes
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to create a more favorable environment for overseas
investment in the city, where more than 340 large and medium-sized
enterprises are located, the city government has canceled some 130
unreasonable fees.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 60 percent of Shenyang's industrial profit comes

<HEADLINE> Trial Sheds More Light on Mafia-Politician Link in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A Rome court trial of former
Christian Democrat Minister Calogero Mannino shed more light today
on the strong links between the Sicilian Mafia and Italian
politicians in 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Gioacchino Pennino, an ex-Mafia affiliate, told the court that
the Mafia "inspired and conditioned" many of the political
candidates of those years in Palermo, capital of Sicily.
</P>
<P>
Without Mafia support, it was impossible to enter and perform
the public service, Pennino claimed.
</P>
<P>
Pennino, a well-known Palermo doctor, named a number of former
Christian Democrats who had "close" relations with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Mafia has a tradition to turn to political parties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "first the Monarchists, then the Liberals, the the
Christian Democrats and finally the Socialists, for whom the Cosa
Nostra bosses gave an order to vote en masses in the 1987 general
election."
</P>
<P>
Pennino said that he used to frequented Christian Democrat
circles but never agreed to run for political office.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to make it even easier for the Mafia to
blackmail me, " he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had no knowledge on whether Salvo Lima, a
powerful Christian Democrat and the leader of former Italian Prime
Minister Giulio Andreotti's faction in Sicily, was a Mafia-linked
member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lima, who was killed by the Mafia in 1992, has been alleged as
the main link between Andreotti and the Mafia bosses.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti, a life senator and the seven-times premier denies
all charges against him, saying they are part of a Mafia plot to
revenge him for crackdowns on organized crime by governments he
headed.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti's trial began in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Souvenirs on HK's Return to China Still in Great Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Uncle Wang, 72, waited all night
outside a post office here to buy a set of commemorative stamps
just issued to mark Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the 150 years we Chinese spent waiting for Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, standing here for several hours
is nothing," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Around the time of handover day on July 1, souvenirs honoring
the event flooded Chinese markets and department stores. Nearly
three months later, demands from all over China continue to pour
in to distributors for the endless array of watches, pens, rings,
calendars, caps, T-shirts, porcelainware and mugs.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 types of stamps, commemorative coins and magnetic
cards also have been issued, according to conservative estimates.
</P>
<P>
Some of the stamps, especially those issued by the government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), broke sales
records, according to an official. Stamps bearing designs related
to the historic event issued by more than 20 countries and regions
are also hotly sought after by collectors.
</P>
<P>
The number of stamp-collectors has increased by about 20
percent in Hong Kong since last year, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
When issuing gold and silver commemorative coins, the People's
Bank of China (PBC) had to send security guards to look after the
queues of buyers.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the 100 million new coins featuring a bauhinia
flower rather than the crown of the Queen of England were snatched
up in just over a month by citizens, forcing the Hong Kong
Government to issue an additional 160 million.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of commemorative magnetic cards for telephones, subways
and parks are treasured by collectors, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many people are still searching for copies of Chinese
newspapers dated July 1, particularly those specially-made
editions, including a miniature version of the People's Daily,
silk copies of the July 1 Shanghai Wenhuibao and China News
Pictorial, and even 97' 24k gold editions of Hong Kong's "Ta Kung
Pao" to honor HK return to the motherland.

<HEADLINE> New Preservation Method Keeps Coconuts Fresh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers and
technicians in south China's Hainan Province have developed a new
preservation technique which keeps newly-picked coconuts
fresh for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from China Tropical Agriculture and Coconut
Institute, in cooperation with technicians from a local coconut
processing factory in Wenchang, have reported success with the
method of soaking just-picked coconuts in mineral water, then
shaping them into different artistic designs before freezing and
packaging them.
</P>
<P>
The method has increased the expiration term of green coconuts
after picking from only seven days to 40 days.
</P>
<P>
At a recent trade fair of fruits and vegetables held in Hainan,
dubbed the "island of coconuts" and also a leading coconut
producer of China, the preserved coconuts sold like hot cakes.
Orders for 150,000 coconuts were made on the first day of the
fair, said a local source.

<HEADLINE> More Light Shed on Mafia-Politician Link in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A Rome court trial of former
Christian Democrat Minister Calogero Mannino shed more light today
on the strong links between the Sicilian Mafia and Italian
politicians in 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Gioacchino Pennino, an ex-Mafia affiliate, told the court that
the Mafia "inspired and conditioned" many of the political
candidates of those years in Palermo, capital of Sicily.
</P>
<P>
Without Mafia support, it was impossible to enter and perform
the public service, Pennino claimed.
</P>
<P>
Pennino, a well-known Palermo doctor, named a number of former
Christian Democrats who had "close" relations with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
The Mafia has a tradition to turn to political parties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "first the Monarchists, then the Liberals, the the
Christian Democrats and finally the Socialists, for whom the Cosa
Nostra bosses gave an order to vote en masses in the 1987 general
election."

<HEADLINE> Household Workshops Growing in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, Chen Huili, a
46-year-old laid-off worker in Shanghai, picks up her knitting
after finishing the daily chores.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that I not only can take care of my home, but
also earn some money by knitting," she said.
</P>
<P>
On Dongjiadu Street in Shanghai's Nanshi District, nearly 200
laid-off workers like Chen are involved in cottage industries of
knitting, sewing and making packing boxes, earning an average of
about 500 yuan each month.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, the district government plans to
develop up to 800 varieties of such home-based workshops. The
local government has earmarked a special fund of two million yuan
for the project, and formed a company to lease machinery and
materials to the workers.
</P>
<P>
The cottage industries have great development potential as
they attract more redundant workers and do not create pollution,
said Gu Junyi, the director of Shanghai Labour Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai boasts large numbers of skilled folk craftsmen and a
history of traditional crafts such as embroidery, woollen
needlepoint tapestry and dough modelling. Some of the laid-off
workers also make tourist souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Enzhen, a local economist, said that the handicrafts can
also be expanded to include products of higher value, including
software development, home-based consulting services, and
industrial design.
</P>
<P>
However, reemployment training is key to a healthy, sustained
development of the household industry, as most redundant workers
have no special skills, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hong, a well-known sweater designer, started out by
knitting and selling sweaters at home and now runs 30 chain
stores. "I am ready to teach my knitting skills to laid-off
workers," she said.
</P>
<P>
The local government will offer a three-year cut in taxes for
the cottage industries, and the laid-offs doing the work can
retain their old-age and medical insurance benefits from their
former jobs.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's biggest club
Anderlecht have been banned from all European club competitions
due to alleged bribes to referees in 1983 and 1984, European
soccer body UEFA said in a statement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA said that they had made the decision "for ethical and
moral reasons arising from incidents in 1983 and 1984 concerning
bribery of referees". The decision was made after an executive
committee meeting led by President Lennart Johansson.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians, the UEFA Cup winners in 1983 as well as Cup
Winners' Cup champions in 1976 and 1978, are in the UEFA
tournament this season. They lost their first round first leg
match 3-4 to Salzburg in Austria last week.
</P>
<P>
The club won the second leg of the 1984 semi-final 3-0 at home,
and 3-2 on aggregate, after England's Nottingham Forest had a goal
controversially disallowed and Anderlecht scored from a disputed
penalty.
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht earlier this month admitted to having paid Spanish
referee Guruceta Muro one million francs (27,000 U.S. dollars) for
that match. Muro died in a car crash in 1987.

Nikolinakos, director of the institute for the study of the Greek
economy, said that the CPC congress consolidates the reforms
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and creates the
basis for a continuing course towards a big economic and political
power in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new Chinese leadership with President Jiang
Zemin as the core will be an almost absolute unanimity in the
leadership which is "a strong factor for its future efficacity and
the favorable climate expected, within which developments will
occur."
</P>
<P>
The conclusions reached and the decisions taken by the Congress
seem to be "of extreme importance" in respect both to the economic
development of the country and the radical changes to be carried
out in regard to structures and institutions as well as to the
position to be taken by China in the world scene.
</P>
<P>
A big country like China, he noted, is thus expected to play a
leading political role in the future not only in Asia but also in
the whole world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese economy will be further integrated
into the world economy by an increased import of foreign capital
to be established in China in the form of joint-ventures or on its
own, bringing with it modern technology and know how. Besides,
Chinese exports are expected to increase together with a tendency
of foreign economic expansion through Chinese investments abroad
in the form of joint-ventures or of Chinese enterprises on their
own.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the expected economic achievements, China's
political role at an international level will gain gradually
importance, thus offering a balance of forces in the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that China and Greece can take advantage and benefit
mutually from all-round cooperation between the two countries,
which is not only good for them but also conducive to the
development of the world economy.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Officials Welcome Turner's Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking officials
of the United Nations have welcomed the one billion U.S. dollar
contribution by U.S. media tycoon Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
"All U.N. agencies will come together to ensure the best use of
this extraordinary endorsement," said several chiefs of U.N.
bodies in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, the Vice Chairman of Time Warner Inc. announced
last Thursday his decision to contribute a total of one billion
dollars in a ten-year timespan to the U.N. for its humanitarian
work.
</P>
<P>
The fund "comes at a crucial moment for the U.N. which grapples
with dwindling resources to meet a growing array of vital needs,"
said UNICEF (U. N. Chidren's Fund) Director Carol Bellamy, UNFPA
(U.N. Fund Population Fund) Director Nafis Sadik and UNDP (U.N.
Development Program) Administrator James Gustave Speth.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised Turner's
action, saying his offer demonstrated his belief in the U.N.
organization and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will inspire governments to pay what they owe,"
Annan emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The country owing the U.N. the most is the one which houses the
U.N.. The United States has so far accumulated its membership dues
to some 1.5 billion dollars, more than half of the annual U.N.
budget.
</P>
<P>
The funds from Turner "will not offset the 1.5 billion dollars
that the united States owes the United Nations because the world
body cannot accept contributions from private citizens for that
purpose," said the spokesman for Annan.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the 52nd session of the U.N. Assembly
here today, Annan again called those indebted member states to
liquidate their arrears and to pay their future assessments "in
full, on time and without conditions."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton in his address to the U.N. Assembly
today did not say when U.S. arrears will be cleared, but rather
hinted that the question should be solved by Congress first.
</P>
<P>
Annan had said that the U.N. cannot accept the conditions put
forward by the U.S. Congress as they would jeopardize U.S. image
and aggravate tensions between the U.S. and other U.N. member
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- One of Australia's two biggest stevedoring companies has
told the Howard government to "put up or shut up" on waterfront
reform, describing recent rhetoric as "unhelpful" and "becoming
boring", and said the government had "no proper understanding of
the complexity of the whole subject."
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The number of New South Wales Lower House seats would be cut
by six to maximize Labor's reelection chances under a proposal
adopted unanimously Monday by the cabinet. The premier, who took
the plan to cabinet, will ask caucus today to approve the cut to
93 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government and employers last night attacked a
new push by the Australian Council of Trade Unions for a 20-a-week
Australian dollars pay rise for more than 1.5 million workers,
warning that it would increase unemployment and inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government moved last night to open Australia's
four billion Australian dollars (2.88 billion US dollars) local
telephone market to full competition by forcing Telstra, the
telecommunication giant of the country, to underwrite the cost of
switching a customer's phone number to another carrier.

<HEADLINE> US Budget Deficit Going to Be Smallest Since 1974 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit of U.S.
government totaled 34.6 billion dollars in August and the red ink
is on track to be the smallest in 23 years, the U.S. Treasury
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that revenue totaled 103.5 billion
dollars last month and expenditures was 138.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. government has received about 1.4
trillion dollars in revenue and spent 1.48 trillion dollars. It
brought the shortfall for the first 11 months of the budget year
to 71.3 billion dollars, 50 percent less than during the same
period of fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
With a substantial surplus expected in September, the last
month of this fiscal year, the U.S. government should have little
trouble recording a deficit for all of fiscal 1997 at or under the
37 billion dollars projected last month by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
It would be the smallest since 1974 and would mark the fifth
consecutive improvement since President Clinton took office in
1993.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit of the U.S. government swelled to a record
290 billion dollars in fiscal year of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. budget deficit was 107.4 billion dollars in fiscal
1996 and the Clinton administration is projecting it will increase
to 58.3 billion in 1998 and won't decline below the 1997 level
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and the U.S. Congress reached an agreement
earlier this year to eliminate all the deficit by 2002 and a
balanced-budget bill was signed into law in August.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Concerned" over Arab League on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said it
was "concerned" over a statement by the Arab League calling for
lifting sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned by what appears to be an Arab League
call to violate sanctions against Libya. If there are violations,
it would be a matter for the immediate attention of the U.N.
Security Council," State Department spokesman James Foley said at
a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League voted in Cairo on Sunday to allow flights
carrying "the political leadership and official Libyan
delegations" to land on member-nations territory.
</P>
<P>
the statement also urged 21 Arab nations to permit Libyan
flights for humanitarian reasons, such as transport of people to
an annual Muslim pilgrimage in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
But Foley said Libya continues to defy the will of the
international community by refusing to comply with U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 after Libya refused to
hand over for trial two suspects wanted in Britain and the United
States for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scotland in
1988. The blast killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has proposed to hand over the suspects to the World
Court in the Hague, Netherland, but the proposal was rejected by
the United States and Britain.
