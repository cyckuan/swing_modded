<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged Thursday that an allied
warplane had mistakenly bombed a civilian vehicle in southern
Kosovo on Wednesday while trying to stop Serb forces from attacking
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the episode as an unfortunate but understandable
accident of war, NATO officials took the unusual step of
broadcasting a taped interview with the American pilot of an F-16
that participated in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In calm tones, the pilot described circling over villages set
aflame by Serb troops before directing a laser-guided bomb at what
he believed was a military truck. He then left the scene and
another patrol continued the attack. The end result, according to
NATO, was that a civilian vehicle was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it had no information on the number of civilian
casualties. Yugoslav authorities, who took Western correspondents
to see what they said were victims of the NATO attack, said more
than 70 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark retracted his claim that
it was Serb forces who had done the damage, allied officials said
that Yugoslav military and paramilitary units had put hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians at risk by forcing them from their
homes and by attacking them.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO acknowledged striking a civilian vehicle, the time
and location it gave still differed from the reports of the
Pentagon, refugees reaching Albania and reporte had no information of such flights Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in San
Francsco on Thursday, President Clinton said the mistaken attack
was ``regrettable.'' But he added, ``It is also inevitablein a
conflict of this kind, with planes traveling at high speeds, doing
the best to fulfill their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the requirement is that nothing like this can ever
happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr. Milosevic
displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon
thousands of them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it would not put new restrictions on its attacks
against Serb forces in Kosovo. Allies officials said it was
unrealistic to think that civilian casualties could be excluded in
an intense bombardment designed to force the Yugoslav military and
paramilitary units out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fate of the hundreds of thousands of displaced
Albanians has become an emotional debating point for both sides,
especially since NATO has cast itself as the potential savior of
the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   With its account Thursday, NATO was trying to maintain its own
credibility by owning up to a mistake while deflating Belgrade's
repeated allegations that the alliance was wantonly bombing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO confirms, from its preliminary investigation, that it
appears that one of its aircraft mistakenly dropped a bomb on a
civilian vehicle in a convoy yesterday,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, Italian Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani. ``Serb police or
military vehicles may have been in or around the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has charged that at least 70 civilians were killed
Wednesday in NATO raids on Kosovo. NATO says it has no way of
knowing the number of those that might have been killed or wounded
by its attack, but formally apologized for the civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in southern Kosovo vividly illustrates what
military historians call ``the fog of war.'' Information about the
conflict is a confusing welter of reports based on NATO briefings
and reconnaissance photos, e-mails accounts from Kosovo Liberation
Army partisans inside Kosovo, the testimony of refugees fleeing
across the Albanian and Macedonian border and the Serb-controlled
press. Many of the on-the-scene accounts by journalists are based
on trips to the region organized by authorities in Belgrade.

BRUSSELS: in Belgrade.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its effort to present an authoritative account of Wednesday's
episode, NATO spokesman took the highly unusual step of playing a
taped interview with one of the pilots for hundreds of reporters
here. The identity of the pilot, an American who flew one of the
F-16s, was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and his wingmen were patrolling in southern Kosovo.
near the highway that runs from Prizren to Djakovica. NATO
officials say that road is an important supply route for the
Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1 p.m. local time, the pilot observed a flood of
refugees near Djakovica, quickly concluding they had fled because
Serb forces had set their villages on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the picture that I'm building now in the southwestern part
of Kosovo is that MUP and VJ forces are methodically working
themselves from the north to the south through villages, setting
them ablaze, and forcing all the Kosovar Albanians out of those
villages,'' the pilot said, using the acronyms for the Yugoslav
Interior Ministry and Military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot saw three dark green vehicles near one village and
assumed they were military trucks. But he was flying at 15,000
feet, a precaution established by NATO planners to avoid
anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see three uniformly-shaped, dark green vehicles, look like
a deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot said. ``I'm
convinced now that's the VJ and MUP forces working their way down
towards Djakovica and the refugees, and they're preparing to set
this next house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot circled around twice to get a better look visually and
with the help of a special infrared targeting device that creates
images from the heat of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I roll in on two passes to get a close look, both with my
eyeballs and with my targeting pod,'' the pilot says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I make a decision at that point that these are the people
responsible for burning down the villages that I've seen so far,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot directed a laser-guided bomb at one of the vehicles,
destroying it. He did not attack the rest because his wingman was
running low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The planes flew away but reported the situation to flying air
controllers and battle management planes. That information was, in
turn, passed on to a new patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The new patrol saw three large trucks in a housing area which
was near to where the first F-16 had stuck. It attacked all three
of the trucks, Marani said. Taped interviews with those pilots were
not released by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbs charged NATO had attacked civilians, NATO
confirmed that a civilian vehicle had been destroyed in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of confusing allegations, counter-charges and
fragmentary reports, however, there were still a host of vexing
questions, including whether the site of NATO's mistake is the same
place that figures in the original Serb charges of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said Thursday that the incident occurred north of
Djakovica, on the road between Djakovica and Decane. Serb
authorities, however, appeared to have taken some reporters to
sites south of Djakovica, including Bistrazin. It is the sites
south of Djakovica, which also seem to have been featured in Serb
videos and television reports.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serb take reporters to a location where they themselves
caused the casualties and damage? Or will NATO release still more
data on civilian casualties that it might have cause in attacks on
convoys south of Djakovica on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon acknowledged that there was at least one
strike on a convoy on Wednesday south of Djakovica. Indeed, the
Pentagon seemed to have that attack in mind when it briefed
reporters on the incident Wednesday evening. NATO said Thursday
that its investigation is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's accounts shows how difficult it is to limit civilian
casualities, even in an age of high-precision weaponry and
high-technology reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed the dominant view within the
alliance Thursday when he said that civilians casualties were
unavoidable in a conflict in which high-speed jets dropped powerful
bombs on Serb armor that was situated near fleeing refugees.
Avoiding all civilian casualties, he said, would be tantamount to
shutting down the military campaign to create an autonomous Kosovo
for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of NATO's inquiry, Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman, insisted that the alliance would continue to press the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a loss of momentum,'' he said. ``We
will continue to take every conceivable precaution that we possibly
can in this area. But obviously, again, I am not going to pretend
for one minute that we can eliminate the risks involved,
particularly in trying to strike at the tanks and the artillery, in
the field.''

PENTAGON WILL ASK FOR 30,000 RESERVISTS FOR NATO WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon plans to ask President Clinton for the
authority to call up about 30,000 reservists and National Guard
members to bolster the attack against Yugoslavia, significantly
widening the American contribution to NATO's war in the Balkans,
senior military and administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the size of the call-up, its impact is likely to
ripple across the country, affecting families, interrupting college
educations and putting strains on employers. Since a majority will
be pilots or aircraft crew members, the impact may be felt most in
the aviation industry, which employs thousands of reservists and
Guard members, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes in Yugoslavia continued Thursday and into the
night, with reports of attacks on military sites, television
transmitters and bridges. NATO warplanes were reportedly launching
the most intensive attacks in recent days in Montenegro, the junior
republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On a day overshadowed by confirmation that an allied warplane
mistakenly bombed a civilian vehicle in Kosovo, President Clinton
offered a rationale for American involvement that, like the
activation of the reserves, signaled a prolonged effort.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors in San
Francisco, Clinton said that only a democratic transition in
Yugoslavia would clear the way for stability in the Balkans,
although that is explicitly not one of NATO's military objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will require a democratic transition in Serbia, for the
region's democracies will never be safe with a belligerent tyranny
in their midst,'' he said. ``It will demand from us a recognition
that there is no easy way out of the region's troubles, but there
is a solution that advances our interest and keeps faith with our
values, if we are ready to make a long-term commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of that commitment continues to rise. The White House
is expected to ask Congress for $5.9 billion in emergency spending
to cover the costs of American involvement in the operation over
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which officials said could be formally submitted as
early as Friday, has increased significantly from estimates of $3
billion to $4 billion earlier this week, administration officials
said. They attributed the increase to the activation of so many
reservists and the request by NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark, for about 300 additional American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers have criticized the
administration's strategy in the Balkans, Clinton's senior military
advisers urged patience, saying that an air campaign would
ultimately undermine Milosevic or at least level the playing field
for a resurgent rebel force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there is any question that we can
accomplish the mission, the military mission that was laid out with
air power, to reduce the capabilities of the Serb military and
police forces,'' Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate's Armed Services Committee. But,
in the strongest language to date, Shelton conceded publicly that
military success might not yield NATO's political goals of
returning the refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen warned senators that as
NATO's air raids continued, American casualties were no longer
``possible'' but ``probable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick or easy or neat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO strikes continued Thursday, with reports of new attacks on
military targets, television transmitters and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO warplanes were reportedly launching the most intensive
attacks in recent days in Montenegro, the junior republic in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the forces arrayed against Milosevic has grown
steadily. Requests for more aircraft from NATO nations would
increase the total to more than 1,000, more than double the 430 the
alliance had ready when the strikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Clark's request for American aircraft, which
surprised officials within the Pentagon, has forced officials to
consider the large call-up of reservists and Guard members.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the aircraft requested, for example, are aerial
tankers, needed to refuel the waves of fighters and bombers
conducting raids into Yugoslavia. Many of those tankers _ KC-135's
and KC-10's _ are assigned to reserve or national guard units
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is still working out the details of which units
will be called up and how many people will be needed. While a
senior defense official said the total would be around 30,000, an
administration official said it could be as high as 33,000. By law,
Clinton can authorize the activation of 200,000 reservists or Guard
members for 270 days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The final details of the activation are expected to be completed
by the weekend and could be approved by Cohen by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, as expected, the call up would be the largest
single activation since 265,000 took part in the Persian Gulf war
in 1990 and 1991. It is the first of any significance since since
3,800 reservists and Guardsmen went to Bosnia with the first NATO
peacekeepers in 1995. Since then, thousands have continued to serve
in Bosnia, where they now account for about 1,000 of the 7,000
American troops there.
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Pentagon has relied on several hundred reservists
who have volunteered for duty in the Balkans, many of them pilots
willing to serve a few days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those called to duty will be in the Air
Force Reserves or the Air National Guard. While many of them will
be pilots or crew members for tankers, cargo planes or other
support aircraft, some of those activated will operate fighter
jets, including F-16's and A-10's.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is also expected to have a large contingent of
reservists, many of them soldiers needed to support the deployment
of two dozen Apache helicopter gunships to Albania. The Apache
force is slowly setting up an operating base in Albania's rough,
undeveloped terrain and needs engineers and security officers, as
well as Army reservists trained to interact with locals.
</P>
<P>
   The total size of that force is now expected to be as high as
4,800 soldiers, more than double the 2,000 officials estimated when
the deployment was announced, Army officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps will contribute far fewer reservists,
the officials said. All of them will come from units in high demand
in the fighting, including crews of EA-6B jets, which jam the
enemy's radar and other electronic communications, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the total that Cohen requests will be a
ceiling. In other words, the Pentagon plans to seek authority for
some 30,000, but may not need all of them to report to duty. The
officials said they probably would be called up in batches as the
campaign continues.
</P>
<P>
   All of the armed services have come to rely more heavily than
ever on the nation's 900,000 reservists. In the Air Force, in
particular, reserve and National Guard units are routinely used
during their scheduled training periods to patrol the skies over
Bosnia and Iraq. Rarely, though, have so many been called up at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Although the activation is not nearly as large as that for the
Persian Gulf war, its impact will be real, particularly in the
aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of commercial pilots come from a military
background,'' said Michael Sellwag, an airline industry analyst for
Warburg, Dillon, Read in New York, ``and if they're in the reserves
and they're called to active duty, that could lead to scheduling
headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The activation _ as well as the dispatch of still more aircraft
to the Balkans _ comes at a cost to the government, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5.9 billion in emergency spending the White House is
expected to request from Congress, $5.4 billion would cover the
cost of reservists' salaries, fuel and other supplies and
munitions. Another $500 million would pay for aid to the thousands
of Albanians who have fled Mr. Milosevic's campaign in Kosovo.

CRITICS COMPLAIN PROPOSED ROSE BOWL FLOAT WOULD GIVE WRONG IDEA OF
GLENDALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ It's just a basset hound wearing a party hat,
but to Glendale's civic leaders, it's one hot dog.
</P>
<P>
   A battle has erupted over the city's float for the 2000 Pasadena
Tournament of Roses parade.
</P>
<P>
   A majority on Glendale's Rose Float Committee wants a float
dubbed ``Party Animal,'' featuring a sad-eyed basset hound in a
field of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But a renegade minority on the panel, led by the committee's
president, say it presents the wrong image for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party animal part of it just doesn't reflect what Glendale
stands for,'' Marilyne Wiechmann, president of the Glendale Rose
Float Association and chief opponent of the dog, said Thursday.
``One of the parks commissioners said we'd be the butt of Jay Leno
jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman David Weaver, a longtime member of the float
committee, loves the basset hound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun. It's a float people will look at and start
smiling,'' Weaver said. ``You need a float that catches the judges'
eyes. I can't imagine someone will look at that float and say
Glendale is going to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the opposition group scored a major victory,
convincing the city's Park and Recreation Commission that the
basset hound float should be junked in favor of something more
appropriate. Getting the city's blessing is, of course, important
because Glendale once again will provide $60,000 of the float's
$90,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver is placing discussion of the issue on the City Council's
April 27 agenda. He said the council already has voted to fund the
float and that he does not believe it has the power to overrule the
float committee, which is an independent organization.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney Scott Howard could not be reached to comment on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Ginger Bremberg said she is certain the City Council
will have the final say on the float choice because the city is
footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the city's determination which float should be put in
the parade,'' Bremberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's a dog lover with two of her own at home, Bremberg
admits to an anti-``Party Animal'' bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think it suits the dignity of our community,''
Bremberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said this would be the 88th entry for the city of
Glendale, which is second only to the city of Los Angeles in terms
of entering floats in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Ransford, a member of the parks commission, called the
basset hound design ``darling.'' Still, she voted against the
float. She said the city pays for the float each year as a way to
promote the city to everyone around the world who watches the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're using this as an opportunity to market ourselves to
the world, I'm not sure Glendale wants to say we are a party-animal
city,'' Ransford said.
</P>
<P>
   But she thinks there could be an easy compromise: Keep the dog,
but drop the ``party animal'' title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the best solution,'' Ransford said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have argued that the party dog doesn't fit with the
parade's theme &UR;  &LR; _ ``Celebration 2000: Vision of the Future.'' But
Weaver said the dog fits with the celebration part of the theme
even if it's lacking in visions of the future. He said organizers
of the parade already have announced that they have too many
science fiction and outer space floats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is doing the next millennium thing. They won't even
accept any more floats that have an outer space theme,'' Weaver
said. ``Everyone is getting hung up on the vision of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog was chosen over 10 other possible floats presented to
the selection committee of the float panel, said Bill Lofthouse,
president of Pasadena-based Phoenix Decorating, which has created
the city's floats for the past 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lofthouse said the dog is ``definitely a potential
prize-winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be competing with a lot of other more expensive
floats and you don't want it to get lost in the shuffle,''
Lofthouse said. ``You need a hook or a schtick.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he is so frustrated by the current situation that he
might not agree to build the float if the minority on the Glendale
float committee is successful in killing ``Party Animal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to question whether I'd be involved if this
democratic process didn't work,'' Lofthouse said.
</P>
<P>
   He too suggested compromising by changing the name of the float,
perhaps from ``Party Animal'' to something like ``Where's the
Party?''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Leland, director of sponsorship and marketing for the
Pasadena Tournament of Roses, said the dog was one of 300 designs
pre-approved by the tournament officials for the New Year's Day
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament has already blessed it,'' Leland said, noting
that the float is consistent with the celebration theme.
</P>
<P>
   Before designs are even pitched at cities and corporations by
outfits like Phoenix Decorating, they have to pass muster with
tournament officials. ``Party Animal'' not only made the cut but
was deemed ``cute'' by the tournament's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament is a fairly conservative organization,'' Leland
said, adding that the parade does not accept alcohol or cigarette
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Party Animal'' float was not offensive by their standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't rule it out thinking it was too provocative or unfit
for family viewing,'' Leland said. ``It's a basset hound wearing a
party hat. It's cute!''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged Thursday that an allied
warplane had mistakenly bombed a civilian vehicle in southern
Kosovo on Wednesday while trying to stop Serb forces from attacking
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the episode as an unfortunate but understandable
accident of war, NATO officials took the unusual step of
broadcasting a taped interview with the American pilot of an F-16
that participated in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In calm tones, the pilot described circling over villages set
aflame by Serb troops before directing a laser-guided bomb at what
he believed was a military truck. He then left the scene and
another patrol continued the attack. The end result, according to
NATO, was that a civilian vehicle was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it had no information on the number of civilian
casualties. Yugoslav authorities, who took Western correspondents
to see what they said were victims of the NATO attack, said more
than 70 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark retracted his claim that
it was Serb forces who had done the damage, allied officials said
that Yugoslav military and paramilitary units had put hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians at risk by forcing them from their
homes and by attacking them.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO acknowledged striking a civilian vehicle, the time
and location it gave still differed from the reports of the
Pentagon, refugees reaching Albania and reporters taken to the
scene. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   While the American pilot spoke of an attack north of Djakovica,
for example, the reporlanes, which frequently fly low on brief
missions. NATO said it had no information of such flights
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in San
Francisco on Thursday, President Clinton said the mistaken attack
was ``regrettable.'' But he added, ``It is also inevitable in a
conflict of this kind, with planes traveling at high speeds, doing
the best to fulfill their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the requirement is that nothing like this can ever
happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr. Milosevic
displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon
thousands of them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it would not put new restrictions on its attacks
against Serb forces in Kosovo. Allies officials said it was
unrealistic to think that civilian casualties could be excluded in
an intense bombardment designed to force the Yugoslav military and
paramilitary units out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fate of the hundreds of thousands of displaced
Albanians has become an emotional debating point for both sides,
especially since NATO has cast itself as the potential savior of
the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   With its account Thursday, NATO was trying to maintain its own
credibility by owning up to a mistake while deflating Belgrade's
repeated allegations that the alliance was wantonly bombing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO confirms, from its preliminary investigation, that it
appears that one of its aircraft mistakenly dropped a bomb on a
civilian vehicle in a convoy yesterday,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, Italian Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani. ``Serb police or
military vehicles may have been in or around the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has charged that at least 70 civilians were killed
Wednesday in NATO raids on Kosovo. NATO says it has no way of
knowing the number of those that might have been killed or wounded
by its attack, but formally apologized for the civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in southern Kosovo vividly illustrates what
military historians call ``the fog of war.'' Information about the
conflict is a confusing welter of reports based on NATO briefings
and reconnaissance photos, e-mails accounts from Kosovo Liberation
Army partisans inside Kosovo, the testimony of refugees fleeing
across the Albanian and Macedonian border and the Serb-controlled
press. Many of the on-the-scene accounts by journalists are based
on trips to the region organized by authorities in Belgrade.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its effort to present an authoritative account of Wednesday's
episode, NATO spokesman took the highly unusual step of playing a
taped interview with one of the pilots for hundreds of reporters
here. The identity of the pilot, an American who flew one of the
F-16s, was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and his wingmen were patrolling in southern Kosovo.
near the highway that runs from Prizren to Djakovica. NATO
officials say that road is an important supply route for the
Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1 p.m. local time, the pilot observed a flood of
refugees near Djakovica, quickly concluding they had fled because
Serb forces had set their villages on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the picture that I'm building now in the southwestern part
of Kosovo is that MUP and VJ forces are methodically working
themselves from the north to the south through villages, setting
them ablaze, and forcing all the Kosovar Albanians out of those
villages,'' the pilot said, using the acronyms for the Yugoslav
Interior Ministry and Military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot saw three dark green vehicles near one village and
assumed they were military trucks. But he was flying at 15,000
feet, a precaution established by NATO planners to avoid
anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see three uniformly-shaped, dark green vehicles, look like
a deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot said. ``I'm
convinced now that's the VJ and MUP forces working their way down
towards Djakovica and the refugees, and they're preparing to set
this next house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot circled around twice to get a better look visually and
with the help of a special infrared targeting device that creates
images from the heat of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I roll in on two passes to get a close look, both with my
eyeballs and with my targeting pod,'' the pilot says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I make a decision at that point that these are the people
responsible for burning down the villages that I've seen so far,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot directed a laser-guided bomb at one of the vehicles,
destroying it. He did not attack the rest because his wingman was
running low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The planes flew away but reported the situation to flying air
controllers and battle management planes. That information was, in
turn, passed on to a new patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The new patrol saw three large trucks in a housing area which
was near to where the first F-16 had stuck. It attacked all three
of the trucks, Marani said. Taped interviews with those pilots were
not released by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbs charged NATO had attacked civilians, NATO
confirmed that a civilian vehicle had been destroyed in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of confusing allegations, counter-charges and
fragmentary reports, however, there were still a host of vexing
questions, including whether the site of NATO's mistake is the same
place that figures in the original Serb charges of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said Thursday that the incident occurred north of
Djakovica, on the road between Djakovica and Decane. Serb
authorities, however, appeared to have taken some reporters to
sites south of Djakovica, including Bistrazin. It is the sites
south of Djakovica, which also seem to have been featured in Serb
videos and television reports.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serb take reporters to a location where they themselves
caused the casualties and damage? Or will NATO release still more
data on civilian casualties that it might have cause in attacks on
convoys south of Djakovica on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon acknowledged that there was at least one
strike on a convoy on Wednesday south of Djakovica. Indeed, the
Pentagon seemed to have that attack in mind when it briefed
reporters on the incident Wednesday evening. NATO said Thursday
that its investigation is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's accounts shows how difficult it is to limit civilian
casualities, even in an age of high-precision weaponry and
high-technology reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed the dominant view within the
alliance Thursday when he said that civilians casualties were
unavoidable in a conflict in which high-speed jets dropped powerful
bombs on Serb armor that was situated near fleeing refugees.
Avoiding all civilian casualties, he said, would be tantamount to
shutting down the military campaign to create an autonomous Kosovo
for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of NATO's inquiry, Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman, insisted that the alliance would continue to press the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a loss of momentum,'' he said. ``We
will continue to take every conceivable precaution that we possibly
can in this area. But obviously, again, I am not going to pretend
for one minute that we can eliminate the risks involved,
particularly in trying to strike at the tanks and the artillery, in
the field.''

GRETZKY INDICATES RETIREMENT IS NEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Wayne Gretzky, one of Canada's best-known natural
resources and the subject of great debate, both within his mind and
among those all around him, was saluted on Thursday night in what
may be his last game in his native land.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky is strongly considering retiring after completing this,
his 20th season in the National Hockey League and his 21st as a
professional. His announcement could come as early as Friday
afternoon at a news conference scheduled at Madison Square Garden.
The New York Rangers will play their season finale on Sunday at
home against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday night's 2-2 tie with the Senators, Gretzky
strongly hinted that retirement was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``All indications are obviously pointing that direction,'' he
said. When someone asked if this was his last game in Canada, he
said, ``I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky spoke at length in a large news conference, with members
of his family present. His blue eyes turned moist a few times, but
he frequently flashed a toothy smile. When the game ended and he
was selected the star of the game, he skated back onto the ice to
take a bow and was called back twice for curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a weak decision, believe me,'' Gretzky said.
``I've thought about this for a long time. Unless a miracle happens
either tomorrow or Saturday morning, I'll probably go make it
official.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky added that his decision was ``not 100 percent,''
many reporters responded in chorus with ``99 percent?'' in
reference to the number he wears on his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky said he would meet Friday morning with Charles Dolan,
whose Cablevision company owns Madison Square Garden. ``Let's put
it this way, it's going to take a miracle,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third period, during a television timeout, many in
the crowd of 18,500 began to chant: ``One More Year! One More
Year!''
</P>
<P>
   The public address system then played ``Nobody Does It Better''
while Gretzky skated alone from the Ranger bench, under a bright
spotlight, to the face-off circle while his teammates remained a
respectable distance away. Players from both teams tapped their
sticks on the ice in tribute.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his stick and waved his hand as the fans rose to their
feet for a long, loud ovation. In the stands, fans held signs that
said ``Gretzky Is Hockey'' and ``The Greatest One Forever'' and
``Wayne Please Don't Retire.''
</P>
<P>
   His Rangers teammates seemed pretty certain that the
announcement would involve the word goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how important he is to the game,'' said Kevin
Stevens, one of the older New York players who is closest to
Gretzky. ``As a player, we all know what he has meant to the game.
He is a great ambassador. It's a big blow to hockey. You're losing
a guy who has pretty much put this game where it is at right now.
He probably will play his last game on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gretzky took the ice for warm-ups and, later, for the
opening face-off, he was greeted with warm applause but no intense
emotional outpouring. Some spectators wore team jerseys with
Gretzky's name and his 99, from various stops in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The sweaters, as they say in Canada, represented the Edmonton
Oilers, the Los Angeles Kings, the St. Louis Blues and the Rangers.
Several fans also wore the jersey of Team Canada, for which Gretzky
played in several international tournaments, including the 1998
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. During a timeout in the first
period, the television screen on the scoreboard showed Gretzky
sitting on the bench as the speaker system played a song called
``Simply the Best.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's parents, wife and children were here, and so was Gary
Bettman, commissioner of the National Hockey League. One news
report suggested that Gretzky was under pressure from Canada's
prime minister, Jean Chretien, to make his announcement in Canada,
not the United States, where he has played since Edmonton dealt him
to Los Angeles in 1988. Gretzky's face on Thursday adorned the
front pages of most newspapers here, and television stations
carried videotapes of his words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bigger than the prime minister, to be honest,'' said Todd
Harvey, a Ranger forward from Hamilton, Ontario. ``If you were to
have the prime minister go and make a speech and Gretz go and make
a speech, there would be more people at Gretz's speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien could not attend Thursday night's game because he was
attending a state dinner. But he, like most Canadians, discussed
the possibility of the Great One's retiring at 38, with most of his
sport's scoring records and a page in his nation's history book.
The prime minister said Gretzky should play another season.
</P>
<P>
   John MacLean, a veteran player, put it in professional
perspective. ``He has had such an impact, he has done so much for
everybody as far as exposure of the game and bringing salaries
up,'' MacLean said.
</P>
<P>
   In his best season, 1981-82, Gretzky scored 92 goals, but he has
only 9 this season. He has been slowed by age and by a bothersome
injury to a disk in his neck that caused him to miss 12 games.
During his absence, the Rangers went 6-3-3 and played some of their
most spirited games.
</P>
<P>
   When he could play, Gretzky was hit harder and more often by
opposing checkers than was common in his best seasons. Gretzky's
rating of minus-23 in the plus/minus ratio is the worst on the
team. It measures a player's presence on ice when goals are scored
for and against his team, excluding his team's power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brantford, Ontario, on Jan. 26, 1961, Gretzky was a
nationally known athlete in Canada long before he turned
professional, with Indianapolis of the World Hockey Association, in
1978. He, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr are considered the best players
ever to play in the NHL. All are from Canada, which takes a large
part of its national self-image from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his anticipation for Thursday night's game,
Gretzky said: ``I'm going to enjoy it, no question. I'm very proud
of Canada. I love Canada. I'm Canadian.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the signs held by the fans was one that showed his No. 99
superimposed over the red maple leaf of the Canadian flag.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey, Gretzky said, is ``everything in this country.'' &QL;

SOWARD GETS PRESEASON HONOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward has been selected to Playboy's
preseason All-American team as a kick returner. Soward is the only
Trojan selected to the squad, and first since Daylon McCutcheon and
Jim Wren made the team in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy I made it,'' Soward said. ``It's a great
accomplishment. I'm a little on the downside because I'm only a
kick returner.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward will travel to Phoenix next month to spend time with the
rest of the All-American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be real fun,'' Soward said. ``I'll be with the top
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Grade problems: Freshman tailback Sultan McCullough had his last
practice Thursday after becoming academically ineligible because he
needs to drop a class today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He's going to zero
in and focus on finishing the year the way he needs to finish. I
don't want any guys to be behind the eight ball.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who is already one of the nation's top sprinters,
will miss the USC-UCLA dual meet in May but will be eligible for
the Pacific-10 and NCAA track championships if he enrolls in summer
school.
</P>
<P>
   He had emerged as one of the pleasant surprises of spring
practice, after gaining 99 yards in last weekend's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one guy that's improved, it's Sultan,'' Hackett
said. ``Can he develop into a first-class runner? All the signs
point yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed them a little bit, but I can do much better,''
McCullough added. ``Right now, I'm not in that great football shape
because I was running track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said about five other players will probably have their
last practices this weekend _ either because they will be
ineligible or because Hackett wants them to concentrate on
academics. At least two of the players are starters.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, Frank Strong and Jason Steen were among those who sat
out practice, but Hackett said Soward would not miss any more
spring practices.

THREE KILLED IN SALT LAKE CITY SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting)   (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A gunman entered a genealogical library on
Thursday at Temple Square, the heart of the Mormon Church, killed
two people, wounded five more and died after a gun battle with
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Ruben Ortega said on Thursday night that the man,
Sergei S. Babarin, 70, lived here and had a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Deedee Corradini said Babarin, who used a .22-caliber
handgun, had schizophrenia and had not been taking his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Babarin was arrested four years ago after a
fight in a church-owned business here. At the time he was carrying
a .22-caliber pistol, but he was never charged with a weapons
offense.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the police evacuated much of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   With the city serving as host of an annual genealogical
conference this week, 2,700 people filled the five-story building,
the world's largest genealogical library, at 10:30 Thursday
morning, when the gray-bearded gunman walked in.
</P>
<P>
   He walked up to a woman sitting at the front desk and shot her
in the head, witnesses told The Deseret News, this city's
church-owned newspaper. Firing and reloading from a handgun, he
shot two more women _ one in the head and one in the shoulder.
Another man was also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A 62-year-old security guard, Donald Thomas, and an unidentified
female library patron were killed in the attack, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the woman wounded in the shoulder as
45-year-old Chris Webb, and the two others wounded as 80-year-old
Nellie Leighton and 71-year-old Theda Weston. The fourth victim, a
man, was unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming from the lunch room, popping his little gun,''
Adair Harding, a visitor from Provo, told the newspaper. ``He just
had his hand out. It wasn't real loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Franz, a visitor from Sandy, said: ``It was after about
four or five of those that somebody yelled out, `Get under the
table.' A man's voice then told us to pull the chairs down over
us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jaqueline Nelson, a professional genealogical researcher from
the area, said, ``There were at least 10 pop, pop, pops, then a man
shouted to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos, 17 panicked library patrons barricaded themselves
for two hours on the library's second floor. The gun battle also
trapped a group of 95 fourth-grade students on a field trip. The
students were outside the library and their teachers called the
police and their principal on a cellular telephone, and the group
escaped without harm.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting continued for as long as an hour after the first
police officers arrived, the police said. The gunman fired from the
building while a police SWAT unit shot at him from outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the exchange of shots, a SWAT unit officer suffered a minor
gunshot wound. The police said they shot Babarin and that he died
in an ambulance. The officer was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Barbarin, a Russian emigre, was married and had children.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Otterson, a church spokesman, said: ``We are saddened
by the terrible tragedy which occurred at our Family History
Library this morning, in which three people were killed, including
an employee of the Church. It is incomprehensible that innocent
people, pursuing a peaceful pastime of tracing their family
history, could be the victims of such a senseless attack as we have
seen today.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Utah's top 10 tourist attractions, the library stands
across from Temple Square, site of the Salt Lake Temple and
Tabernacle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The
library has more than two million rolls of microfilm copies of
census and other records from more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The church collects the records for what it calls the baptism of
the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms give the dead the
opportunity to join the church in the afterlife.

RANGERS SWEEP AS HELLING EXCELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Rangers won a game yesterday without Aaron Sele
pitching and without flogging the opposing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they gutted one out with timely hitting, steady defense
and a hard-nosed pitching performance from starter Rick Helling.
The combination was good enough to give the Rangers their first
sweep at the Kingdome since 1992 in a 4-3 victory in 10 innings
against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Helling and relievers Tim Crabtree and John Wetteland held the
Mariners to five hits and no walks over 10 innings; the Rangers
played their fourth consecutive game without committing an error;
and they made the most of their nine hits _ six singles and three
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't flog people,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``It's tough to flog people every day and win by flogging
alone. To be considered a good baseball club, it takes two things,
pitching and defense. It's nice to score runs, but you can't do it
day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching we've got the past few days, the whole team can
feed off that. It's what we've been waiting for. This was a great
series for our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had lost 26 of their past 34 games at the Kingdome
before this series. But the Mariners were without all-star
shortstop Alex Rodriguez for the series, and center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. missed yesterday's game with an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now Texas is the better ballclub,'' Seattle manager Lou
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good ballclub, too. It has been tough for us to
win in here,'' outfielder Rusty Greer said. ``It's been tough to
beat them at our place. Hopefully, we can start playing a little
better against these guys because to win your division, you have to
play good against all three division opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took most comfort in Helling's performance. Their
20-game winner from last season had given up 13 runs in his first
two starts, setting off a tremor that seemed to unsettle both the
rest of the rotation and the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, the first Rangers pitcher this season besides Sele to
allow fewer than four runs in a start, had some early trouble
yesterday, giving up a two-run home run to David Bell in the third
and a run-scoring double to Butch Huskey in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Huskey was the last Mariners batter to reach base. Helling
retired the last 14 batters he faced in getting through the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to go a long way to put those first two games
behind me,'' Helling said. ``After my first two starts, I really
wanted to come out and pitch a good game, keep it close and give us
a chance to win. To do it in the Kingdome against a good lineup
like they had reassures me in my mind that those first two games
are behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense also went dormant after taking a 3-0 lead
in the third inning against Mariners starter Jeff Fassero. Mariners
pitchers retired 18 of 22 batters they faced after that until the
Rangers broke through in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens lined a single to center off reliever John Halama;
Royce Clayton bunted pinch-runner Tom Goodwin to second; and Luis
Alicea, the offensive hero of the day, brought him home with a
double to right center.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea was a late addition to the lineup after second baseman
Mark McLemore was scratched with a strained leg muscle. He
responded by going 3-for-5 with two runs scored and two runs batted
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out right after batting practice I was playing,''
Alicea said. ``I kind of had an idea because Mac was complaining
yesterday about his leg, and he mentioned to me he might not be
able to play. It's a tough role to be in, but you just have to
prepare for it as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, helping the Rangers come away with what Oates and his
players said was their best all-around game of the season.

SWEEP OF MARINERS HUGE FOR STRUGGLING RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From the manager's office, to the trainer's room and
in most precincts in the visiting clubhouse, the cliched company
line rolled forth in all its majesty after the Rangers completed a
three-game sweep of the Mariners with a 4-3, 10-inning victory at
the Kingdome yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   No, they weren't at all worried about a shaky 3-4 start in their
season-opening homestand.
</P>
<P>
   They knew, without a doubt, that they'd eventually get better
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   No (insert stifled yawns here), a sweep over the Mariners in
this concrete hellhole is really nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   Liar, liar, pants on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the Rangers kid you. This three-game tourniquet was
huge for a number of reasons. Just ask closer John Wetteland, who
tells the truth, even when it doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was real big,'' Wetteland said after striking out two of
the three hitters he faced in a perfect 10th for his third save of
the season. ``Especially since we just don't play well here. I
don't know a team that does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved to ourselves that this ballpark can't hold us
either.''
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping the Mariners to open this four-city, 12-game road
trip, the Rangers put that disastrous first week in their rearview
mirror, beat up on a key division rival and found a way to stop the
bleeding, both in their starting rotation and the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded pysches are healed. Confidence soars. Fans relax. The
sun comes out again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit it,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``I probably let
losing affect me too much, and I don't enjoy the wins as much as I
should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know you can't make too much of three wins in a row any
more than you can three losses in a row. You can't get giddy or
you'll get the rug yanked out from under you just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of good things happened for the Rangers in this series:
the 9 RBI-night for Pudge Rodriguez; outstanding production from
the bottom of the order and the bench; eight solid innings
yesterday from No. 1 starter Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   But do not underestimate the part played in all this by the
call-up of little-known reliever Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman got the day off yesterday after pitching four shutout
innings in the first two games of the series. His youthful
enthusiasm, his competitive nature and, most important, his
above-average ability, has been like a Vitamin B-12 shot for a team
desperate for a psychological lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immeasureable,'' is how Wetteland sees it. ``When he got
called in that first night \RTuesday\S, we're all sitting there,
remembering our first appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He responded so well in his first two games, we had to bring
him up in \Rkangaroo\S court on a case of making the rest of us
look like idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has put a smile on Oates' face like the way Zimmerman
pitched Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what somebody who comes in and pitches just four
innings can do for a team,'' Oates said. ``It's not just what I
see. I hear the talk in the clubhouse and how it's changed since he
arrived. I heard it when we left Texas, and it definitely has a
different tone now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' biggest challenge _ other than to resist the temptation
to overuse Zimmerman _ may be in juggling his bullpen to be sure
the former TCU right-hander is in the right role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't write it in stone that he's going to be pitching middle
innings all season,'' Oates raved after Zimmerman had worked 22/3
innings of perfect relief of John Burkett for the win Wednesday
night. ``He's too valuable for that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's throwing the ball right now, I can't be using him
as a long man. I want him to be available for the seventh and
eighth innings. Somebody else may have to take the long-man role.
He's passing some people right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fine for a team to believe it's good. At some point, it has
to actually prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the atmosphere ever actually got heavy,'' said
Mark McLemore, who sat out yesterday's game with an aching tendon
behind his knee. ``I just think we're starting to come together,
starting to execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of road games ahead of us, and we need to play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe to the Rangers, this was just another series (don't
believe it).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, to them, winning three in a row in the Kingdome really is
nothing special (of course it is).
</P>
<P>
   But back in Texas, where fans were watching anxiously for signs
of life, I have a feeling this little sweep couldn't have come at a
better time.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can settle in and get on with the season.

DESERT AIR CAPS TEXAS-SIZED NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ It was a Texas beginning to a Texas-sized
celebration last night at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   The track began its third thoroughbred season with perhaps the
fastest Texas-bred in training, 4-year-old colt Desert Air, winning
the Premiere Stakes for his Texas owners. Seven of the next eight
races also went to horses owned by Texas residents. And that
followed Charley Pride's rendition of the national anthem in his
decidedly Texas style, and the on-track unfurling of the University
of Texas' giant state flag.
</P>
<P>
   The state celebration went off theme only once _ and for a
dachshund instead of a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite sure where Brutus The Skydiving Dog fit in
there,'' Lone Star general manager Corey Johnsen said of one of the
pre-race promotions, ``because I'm fairly certain he's not a
Texas-bred.''
</P>
<P>
   On-track attendance (13,171) and betting ($1.1 million) on Lone
Star races were down more than 10 percent from opening day a year
ago. Johnsen said he isn't concerned that will be a trend. He
believes some fans stayed home to do taxes, or opted to attend the
races on Sunday to watch 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet
compete in the Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell it's the third year for us, because things have
gone much smoother,'' Johnsen said. ``I felt good about the
enthusiasm in the crowd. Texas pride is what it's all about here.
Our fans take pride in our racetrack like fans take pride in a
sports team, and that separates us from some other tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air, owned by the Houston-based Mt. Brilliant Stable,
started the parade of Texas victors by leading from start to finish
to win the 1 1/16 mile Premiere by 2 3/4 lengths under jockey Corey
Lanerie.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Three Sox finished second, and Best Dressed Truck was
third.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air set a fast pace and was weaving in and out through
the stretch, at one point drifting out in the path of Chief Three
Sox. But he had enough left to prevail as the odds-on favorite in
1:44.85, and paid only $3.40 to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping there wouldn't be a \Rsteward's\S inquiry,''
Lanerie said of the stretch run. ``He just got there. He was the
best horse tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning trainer Mike Stidham said he hoped Desert Air's victory
was a harbinger of good things to come for his strong stable, which
also sends out Desert Air's full brother, Desert Demon, in Sunday's
Lone Star Derby. Sure enough, Stidham struck again in the fifth
race with Autumn Dancer, another heavy betting favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air could have run against Real Quiet in the Texas Mile,
Stidham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my philosophy has always been to try to put my horses
where they can win,'' he said. ``I thought he could win here, but I
didn't know if he could win that other race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star's reworked one-mile dirt surface, which includes an
influx of a fir-bark additive, met with good comments from the
jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better,'' said Ronald Ardoin. ``It's staying
together better. It's not as powdery and `cuppy' as it has been. So
far, it's staying tight.'' / nn

MAVERICKS EXTEND WINNING STREAK TO 2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two nights after dumping the San Antonio Spurs, the
Mavericks had to struggle just to beat a Minnesota Timberwolves
team playing without starters Kevin Garnett and Terrell Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley didn't have to fend off Garnett's long arm, and
as a result his season-high 34 points paved the way for the
Mavericks to eke out a 101-95 triumph over Minnesota last night at
Reunion Arena. The Mavericks will take a two-game winning streak
into tonight's game against the Phoenix Suns at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Finley scored 26 of his points in the second half. In the first
two games against Minnesota, both losses, this season, he scored a
total of 17 points, with Garnett mostly shadowing him.
</P>
<P>
   But with Garnett back in Minneapolis with the flu, Finley had a
field day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're missing your best offensive player and one of your
best defensive players, we have to use that to our advantage,''
Finley said. ``We weren't going to roll over and play passive just
because he wasn't playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew without him they might have come out with a little
more energy. So our main thing was just to get a win, with or
without Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks (13-25) led by 14 points in the first half, but
squandered it all and nearly let the game slip away. A Joe Smith
hook in the lane got Minnesota within 97-95 with 19.3 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley drilled two free throws shortly thereafter, A.C.
Green intercepted James Robinson's inbounds pass, and a pair of
free throws by Hubert Davis with 11.2 seconds left closed out the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows what Kevin means to this team,'' said Smith,
who scored 21 points and grabbed nine rebounds. ``But we have 10 or
12 other players that can go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 2-17 against the top eight teams in the
Western Conference. Plus, this is just the sixth time the Mavericks
have scored 100 or more points in game this season, and they are
5-1 in those instances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give \Rthe Timberwolves\S a lot of credit,'' Mavericks coach
Don Nelson said. ``They really hung in there tough and made it very
difficult for us. Thank goodness we found a way to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to get two in a row at home against two pretty good
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first game of a three-games-in-three-days set for
the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota lost despite collecting 18 offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have played better,'' Gary Trent said. ``We won the
game, but we didn't play as good as we should have played. ]
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly why we have so many close losses. We get a team
down, and we get them on the ropes, and we don't knock them out. We
give them breathing room to recover to where they get back in their
stance and make it a game again.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent finished with 22 points and nine rebounds, Steve Nash had
11 points and six assists, and Shawn Bradley collected 10 points,
nine rebounds and four blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks forward Dennis Scott, who played for the
Mavericks from Sept. 24, 1997 until Feb. 18, 1998, scored 18 points
on 7-of-12 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was 3-of-4 from 3-point range, and shot from beyond
halfcourt. But it was waved off because he released the ball a
split-second after the end of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   worse than starting a six-game, eight-day trip with a loss,''
Nelson said. ``I'm just real pleased to somehow scratch that win
out.''] / nn

SALMON'S BAT SLAMS OAKLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Two one-run losses to the Oakland A's had the Angels a
little cranky, but it wasn't anything Tim Salmon and Omar Olivares
couldn't remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon drove in a career-best six runs and Olivares gave up one
run in seven innings to lead the Angels to a 12-1 victory before
7,148 at the Oakland Coliseum on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon doubled, walked twice and hit two homers, including his
fourth career grand slam, but he wasn't alone. Every Angel who
batted had at least one hit, including Darin Erstad and Orlando
Palmeiro, who had three hits apiece. Todd Greene also homered for
the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It all might have been overkill considering Olivares (2-0) had
his second consecutive stellar start. The only run he surrendered
Thursday came on Jason Giambi's solo homer in the seventh. Olivares
gave up four hits and for the second game in a row, walked only
one.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with his 71/3 scoreless innings against Texas last
week, Olivares has allowed only one run and seven hits in 141/3
innings for an ERA of 0.63.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave the Angels a winning trip, despite the two losses
to the A's to begin the series. They returned home having gone 4-3
against the Rangers and A's and continue with their AL West
opponents when they start a three-game series against the Seattle
Mariners tonight at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Considering they are without starters Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and
Gary DiSarcina, the Angels are managing to keep their ``heads above
water, as manager Terry Collins put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this game bad,'' Collins said. ``We needed to get
off the road trip on a positive note and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon got the Angels going almost immediately. His two-out RBI
double in the first inning off losing pitcher Gil Heredia (1-1)
gave the Angels a 1-0 lead and they never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit a solo homer leading off the fifth, then came up with
the bases loaded and one out in the sixth, hitting a line drive
grand slam over the left-field fence off Kevin Jarvis that made it
10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, traditionally a slow starter, is hitting .395 (15 for
38) with four homers and a league-leading 15 RBI. An effort to get
more at-bats during the spring is paying off now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the last couple of years there's been an emphasis to
get it going in spring training earlier,'' Salmon said. ``So you
get your focus going a little earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Vaughn and Edmonds in the lineup, Salmon has found
himself with added responsibility to carry the offense. He's
responded, but credits his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see Troy (Glaus), Greenie (Todd Greene), Ersty (Erstad),
Palmeiro, you see everybody stepping up, it takes off the load,''
he said. ``You see guys driving in runs. It's not falling on me and
GA's (Garret Anderson) shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are putting the ball in play, moving the ball
around,'' Collins said. ``But as long as Tim Salmon stays hot,
we're going to score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares was happy to see all the offense, even if not all of
the A's were impressed with him. Giambi, noting that Olivares went
0-3 against Oakland last season, said of Olivares: ``Sometimes even
a blind squirrel gets a nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares didn't forget about last year's struggles against
Oakland and did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week in my mind I was thinking it's time for them to
pay,'' he said. ``I had a real positive approach going into this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really saved us,'' Collins said of Olivares, the club's
No.5 starter. ``And he's saved our bullpen a lot. He came into
spring training determined to win a spot. Not only did he do that
but he's taken it into the season.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

GUESS WORK FOR CLAIBORNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NFL draft is nearly here, but instead of
winding down and relaxing a little bit, Chris Claiborne is busier
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, he was still fielding calls from teams and
coaches via cell phone, and just trying to stay abreast of the
latest news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall Faulk just got traded,'' Claiborne said, aware that
the Indianapolis Colts had traded their top tailback, and would
probably select Texas running back Ricky Williams with the fourth
pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There had been plenty of speculation that the Colts would take
Claiborne, but as the former USC linebacker has learned, nothing
seems certain when it comes to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``New developments every day,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Claiborne will be one of the day's highest
picks, expected to go anywhere from sixth to 10th in Saturday's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he gets selected, Claiborne will simply be relieved
that the hectic process that started in January, when he declared
he would turn pro, finally concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been work. A lot of work,'' Claiborne said. ``I didn't
know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He has worked out for teams, had doctors pull and tug on his
body, taken mental tests and been grilled by NFL coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask you stuff about your background and family. Things
they might have heard. It's more like a rumor-mill thing,''
Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   The endless questions might have bothered Claiborne, but he did
so many interviews at USC this season, it's become second-nature to
talk about himself regarding virtually any subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best thing about going to SC. All of the
exposure,'' Claiborne said. ``It prepares you for this. I don't
mind it.''
</P>
<P>
   As numbing as it can be to have NFL teams scrutinizing every
detail of your life, it hasn't changed Claiborne's mind about
whether he made the right decision to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go to the league and play ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, however, USC coach Paul Hackett wouldn't mind
having him for another season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would take him back,'' Hackett joked this week. ``Can you
back out of that? Is there some legal thing you can do?''
</P>
<P>
   There were similar sentiments among USC fans who congratulated
Claiborne during last Saturday's spring scrimmage, when he came to
watch his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   But the sideline is about as close as he'll get to being a
Trojan anymore, so Hackett will have to be satisfied with the
Butkus Award he keeps on his desk. It's a reminder that Claiborne
was considered the top college linebacker last season, not to
mention the top linebacker in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he'll be an impact player for the next several years,''
said Bears director of player personnel Mark Hatley.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has the seventh pick, and Claiborne is one of a handful
of players the Bears have on their short list of potential
selections.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Claiborne doesn't really care where he goes, but
he spends as much time as possible scanning mock drafts on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend a lot of time. A lot of time. Everybody says you're
going to go here or going there,'' Claiborne said. ``I look at
everything. I listen to (sports-talk radio).''
</P>
<P>
   He's learned not to worry about the mock draft projections,
though, taking advice from one of his best friends, former USC
cornerback Brian Kelly, who went through a similar experience last
year before being selected by Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're just going to go where you're going to go,'''
Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne wouldn't mind being the eighth pick, which would make
him an Arizona Cardinal. He likes the idea of living in Phoenix,
which would keep him close to his mother in Riverside, and his
father, a Marine gunnery sergeant in Japan who is about to be
transferred to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he will do with his first paycheck, Claiborne said,
``(Buy my mom) a house and another car.''
</P>
<P>
   While Claiborne was a unanimous All-American and claimed
virtually every individual honor possible, he also knew that some
NFL teams would ask him about the Sun Bowl, where USC lost to Texas
Christian University, 28-19.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne seemed a step slow in the game, and admitted afterward
he had gained too much weight during the month of December. But he
said he has allayed fears about that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked about the game, but I had 13 tackles,'' Claiborne
said. ``I played middle and outside linebacker in that game, so I
showed I can play two positions.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his size, Claiborne said he is back to his optimum
playing weight of 250 pounds, and even added a little muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just toned up. I'm 250 pounds,'' he said. ``I've been
working out at Gold's Gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all he has to do is collect the gold.

CART DRIVERS TO PERUSE COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ Finding the proper race-day setup won't take place
today when the CART FedEx Championship drivers hit the streets for
the first time in practice and first-day qualifying sessions to
prepare for the 25th running of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of mash (preseason testing) together with what you
learned from this race last year and those things comprise your
starting point,'' said Bryan Herta, who drove his Shell
Ford-Cosworth/Reynard to third place a year ago. ``Then you have to
continually improve the car until hopefully you arrive on Sunday
with a really good race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting to Sunday in good shape is important, but getting
through Sunday's two-hour race in good shape is the real key.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be there at the end,'' said Player's Forsythe
Racing driver Greg Moore. ``Last year, there was a big pileup at
the hairpin, which cost a lot of guys. You have to be fortunate to
steer clear of that kind of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, steering clear at the conclusion of the
front straightaway will require taking a sharp left turn and
looping around the dolphin statue in front of the Aquarium of the
Pacific. Seven new turns were created to complete the link to the
Seaside Way back straightaway and help create an 11-turn, 1.85-mile
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already had a sneak preview of the changes in the Long
Beach circuit and I like what the organizers have done,'' said Team
Kool Green driver Dario Franchitti, who trailed only winner Alex
Zanardi in last year's Long Beach Grand Prix. ``There's more
character to the course and possibly a new passing zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The serious work toward learning the new track for the CART
teams will begin today at 10:30 a.m. in a 90-minute practice
session. Provisional qualifying takes place in a pair of 30-minute
sessions beginning at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the changes to the track and the fact we can't test
there, it will be a challenge for the drivers to find the fast line
and the teams to find the proper setup,'' said Paul Tracy, who is
Franchitti's teammate. ``Those that do will start up front, which
is extremely important on a tight street circuit. For those that
don't, it will be a long day trying to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that the usual quick qualifiers in Long Beach will
be running up front again this year. So look for guys like Moore,
Franchitti, Herta, Gil de Ferran (who was on the pole position
twice at Long Beach), Max Papis or former winners Michael Andretti
and Jimmy Vasser to be among the quickest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always could be a surprise in there,'' Moore said.

STARS PREPARE FOR DEFENSEMAN'S SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Colin Campbell, the NHL's director of operations
and chief disciplinarian, has scheduled a 1 p.m. meeting today in
New York with Stars captain Derian Hatcher and general manager Bob
Gainey _ a sign Hatcher could receive a suspension of four or more
games for a hit that broke the jaw of Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy
Roenick on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In NHL protocol, players are typically called in for
face-to-face meetings only when suspensions are for four games or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is he's not going in there for a holiday,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said of Hatcher. ``We're preparing to play
without him on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   If suspended four games, Hatcher would miss the Stars' return
match with the Coyotes at 3 p.m. tomorrow in Phoenix, and the
regular-season finale on Sunday at Colorado. Hatcher would also
miss the Stars' first two playoff games against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars argue Hatcher shouldn't be suspended, even though
Roenick likely will miss the remainder of the playoffs with a
broken jaw and a broken thumb. Coyotes general manager Bobby Smith
said yesterday Roenick would take months to recover from jaw
surgery and added that a slash by Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig
earlier in the game resulted in a broken thumb that alone would
keep Roenick out for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars contend the hit on Roenick was no worse than a hit
Roenick delivered to Mike Modano in a March 23 game in Phoenix,
causing the Stars center to leave the game with a lacerated eyelid.
Roenick wasn't suspended at that time because Modano returned to
play the next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much been clarified I didn't hit him with my
elbow, I hit him with my shoulder. I guess the unfortunate thing is
I did come off my feet a bit,'' Hatcher said of his hit on Roenick.
``It's a play that happens throughout the course of the game, and
it happens in a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes contend Hatcher's hit was worse because it was a
premeditated attempt to get even for the hit on Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no premeditation,'' Hatcher said. ``If you can find
me a quote in any paper that says we were going to get Jeremy or
that said I was going to get him, then find them and show them to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the lack of a suspension of Roenick was
disappointing, but said his team was not out to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt strongly, very strongly that there should have been
closure right after the hit on Modano,'' Hitchcock said. ``That
upset a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher has a history concerning suspensions, which Campbell
might take into consideration. Hatcher was suspended four games
during the 1998-99 preseason for punching St. Louis Blues
defenseman Chris Pronger in the back of the head. Hatcher also was
suspended two games in the 1992 playoffs for breaking the jaw of
the Detroit Red Wings' Kevin Miller in a stick-swinging incident.
</P>
<P>
   The decision likely will be the biggest Campbell has faced since
he replaced Brian Burke as the league's chief disciplinarian over
the summer. Burke shied away from suspensions that cost any player
time in the playoffs, including not suspending San Jose's Bryan
Marchment after a hit that knocked the Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk out of
last season's playoffs. However, Campbell has been more aggressive
with his suspensions after an edict handed down by Commissioner
Gary Bettman to reduce hits to the head.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, Campbell issued a 12-game suspension to Los Angeles
Kings' forward Matt Johnson for a blow to the head of Rangers
defenseman Jeff Beukeboom. It was the longest suspension in the NHL
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Campbell issued the statement: ``The league has
made it clear that deliberate blows to the head _ particularly
those which cause injury to the head of an opponent _ will be
treated severely.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Hatcher might compound problems on defense for the
Stars. Defenseman Richard Matvichuk is struggling with a sore groin
that has kept him sidelined for 14 of the past 15 games. Defenseman
Sergei Zubov is expected to miss tomorrow's game in Phoenix with a
bruised wrist. The Stars have recalled defenseman Petr Buzek from
the Michigan K-Wings on an emergency basis so they can be sure to
have six healthy defensemen for tomorrow's rematch with the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Matvichuk and Zubov will be ready to play when
the playoffs begin on Wednesday or Thursday against the Edmonton
Oilers at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at it as an injury, just like any player,''
Hitchcock said of Hatcher's possible suspension. ``We'll take
whatever happens and move ahead. It's no different than Pat Verbeek
or Roman Turek being injured.''

DODGERS NOT ASKED TO FUND FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Dodgers representatives met with members of the Fort
McDowell Indian Community just outside of Scottsdale on Thursday,
but Yavapai tribal members didn't ask the Dodgers to help fund the
proposed $30 million spring training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised in a published report that said tax money
raised with a county surcharge on rental cars would be exhausted,
possibly until 2017 instead of 2010. Such a surcharge would be used
to help pay for the construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Coons, the Dodgers' director of business development,
said the subject was never broached during the day-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is they could probably self-fund this entire
package,'' Coons said. ``But at the same time, if they can get some
public funding ... they could get a better return on their
investment. ``I think they're looking at all the financial
packages. It's how can we put our heads together and see what's
available at the city, county and state level. I think everything
is OK. It's just a question of timing of the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yavapai tribe's original funding plan called for private
money, loans and public funding to be used. While the projected
loss of public funding changes how the spring training complex
would be funded, Coons said it shouldn't change the tribe's ability
to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
   Coons, Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano, the club's
secretary and general counsel Sam Fernandez and director of ticket
marketing Bob Wymbs met with Yavapai representatives, including
president Bernadine Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Coons also said the Dodgers would be reluctant to help with the
funding unless the tradeoff was a more lucrative revenue split with
the Yavapai Tribe, which owns the land the proposed complex would
be built on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preference would be not to (help fund it),'' Coons said.
``The primary reason (to meet) was to get back together. We didn't
talk anything specifically about contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vero Beach (Fla.) and Indian River County continue in
their attempt to get $20 million worth of funding to keep the
Dodgers in Dodgertown, their spring training home for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida legislative session ends May 5, and Coons said the
Dodgers may hear something from Vero Beach as early as April 26. He
said it would take a few weeks for the Dodgers to digest the
information, and then negotiations with Vero Beach and Fort
McDowell would heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Side work for Hundley: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley and
third-base coach Rick Dempsey, a former big-league catcher, were
out on the field before batting practice working on Hundley's
throwing mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have stolen 10 bases with Hundley behind the plate.
Hundley's thrown out no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hundley) was standing up there a little bit back there,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Instead of firing out and
staying low, his technique has been muscling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something the Dodgers noticed in the spring, but Hundley's
workload was slowed because of his reconstructed right elbow. Now
that he's been able to catch more and is in the routine of catching
a few days in a row, the Dodgers are able to work with him on the
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a few small things,'' said Johnson, noting most of the
bases were stolen off the pitchers. ``Out of the 10, (Hundley had a
chance) on a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez vs. lefties: Dodgers left-hander Carlos Perez said it was
merely coincidence he gave up four runs in the seventh inning in
both of his starts this season. The latest came Wednesday against
Arizona, and afterward Johnson said he was mistaken for not yanking
Perez sooner, noting Perez looked fatigued because he was getting
his pitches up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the same thing happened to Perez in his first
outing, when he allowed a three-run homer to left-handed hitting
Todd Helton. Against the Diamondbacks, lefty David Dellucci had the
game-winning single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to start working more on my slider,'' Perez said.
``That's not good giving up hits to lefties. When the season starts
I used to lose my first two or three starts and then I go and win
five or six. Maybe it's the same thing this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not including pitchers, lefties are 4 for 15 (.267) with two
homers and six RBI against Perez.

BROWNBACK'S VIEW ISN'T OFF BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Sen. Sam Brownback took predictable flak for saying
abortions contribute to Social Security's problems, the
conservative Kansas Republican was more on point than most
Americans realize.
</P>
<P>
   As a strictly economic matter, Social Security's long-range
funding problems have been exacerbated to the extent that abortions
have reduced the population below what it would have been in the
absence of these abortions. This is a fact of economic life because
Social Security's basic problem is that its pool of beneficiaries
is increasing while the relative number of taxpayers supporting the
system is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   There are many explanations for economic problems. In Social
Security's case, the explanation is demographics. While the effect
of abortion over a generation's time can't be precisely measured,
it can be said with certainty that abortions have made future
funding problems more challenging than otherwise would have been
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The math is simple. A half-century ago, there were about 16
workers for each Social Security beneficiary. Today there are just
over three workers for each beneficiary, and within another
generation's time, the ratio will fall below two workers for each
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, older Americans are living longer not only because
they're healthier, but also because of ready access to health care
made possible by Medicare, which incidentally faces the same
demographic problem as Social Security. This trend will continue,
which makes it remarkable that proposed Social Security solutions
don't focus more on the need to encourage population growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some may contend that Brownback's view overstates abortion's
effect because abortion doesn't thin the potential population
enough to be a significant factor. This sounds plausible, but it
doesn't take that many more babies to make a substantial
difference.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article by two leaders of the pro-family movement in
/{The Weekly Standard/}, a conservative magazine, estimated that an
additional 100,000 children born in any single year would
contribute an additional $24.3 billion in Social Security taxes
over a working lifetime. If U.S. marital fertility were to return
to 30-year-ago levels, they said, the additional births in one year
would add $274 billion to Social Security's future revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this insight, they noted, is how it traces its
intellectual roots to the work of Gunnar Myrdal. The Swedish Nobel
laureate economist, they said, understood how old-age benefits
socialized the long-term benefits of having children.
</P>
<P>
   Before governments became increasingly responsible for the
elderly's economic welfare, large families were the key to parental
old-age security. Nowadays, however, the need is for more and more
children to pay future taxes into a government-run pension pot.
</P>
<P>
   While noting Myrdal's sympathies toward socialism, the article
said today's conservatives might characterize policies promoting
larger families as ``supply-side'' family policy.
</P>
<P>
   The only other alternative, if benefits are to be maintained at
current levels, is to continue increasing Social Security taxes to
the point of devastating the economic fortunes of our children and
grandchildren.

MORE DEATH IN THE BALKANS COULD TEST PUBLIC'S RESOLVE, POLLSTERS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ They come, like war itself, in sporadic bursts _
events that at once mold American opinion even as they test U.S.
resolve for saving Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   First it was wave after wave of ethnic Albanian refugees. Next
were images of three captured and battered American soldiers. And
this week, NATO's own planes blasted Kosovar refugees on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, polls reveal, public opinion gradually has
mounted in favor of ever stronger action in Yugoslavia. Keep the
bombs coming, Americans tell pollsters. Send in ground troops to
wrap this whole thing up, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Still...
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten to crunch time yet,'' said Martin
Sletzinger, the director of East European studies at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are almost guessing at their own opinions now.''
</P>
<P>
   So will America have the patience and stomach for months and
months of war in the Balkans?
</P>
<P>
   The test of American resolve, if it comes, pollsters say, will
occur when reserve forces are yanked from their civilian jobs, when
U.S. troops tiptoe through Serb mine fields, when flag-draped
coffins are flown back to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties won't necessarily doom domestic support for overseas
conflict, pollsters say. Rather, public opinion will turn on myriad
factors, including how troops are killed, perceptions of the
chances that bombs and bullets can succeed and how Americans'
emotions are shaped by events yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, polls attempt to gauge the country's willingness to
sacrifice lives to protect Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical poll last week, ABC News tried to gauge the depth
of support for sending in ground troops. Nearly 60 percent
supported the move, but that figure dropped to 44 percent if ``some
soldiers would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It dropped again, to 37 percent support, if there were a chance
of up to 100 casualties, to 31 percent if there were a chance of
500 dead, and finally down to 26 percent if up to 1,000 soldiers
might die.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the military. They are soldiers. They sign up to
fight and die for their country,'' said Benjamin Barber, a
political science professor at Rutgers University. ``That's what we
have the military for.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlyn Bowman, who studies public opinion at the American
Enterprise Institute, is skeptical about polling on hypothetical
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you might expect some drop-off in support with
casualties,'' she said. ``But we don't know how quickly the deaths
would come or how.''
</P>
<P>
   If, for instance, several soldiers were killed because they were
acting on foolish orders, she said Americans might become skeptical
of the Pentagon's ability to direct the war. But if U.S. troops
were tortured, Bowman and others said, that might ignite rage at
home and cement support for continued fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that the American people have no
stomach for a war that lasts a long time,'' said Doris Graber, a
scholar of political communication at the University of
Illinois-Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That overlooks the years and years we tolerated Vietnam before
frustration set in.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed since Vietnam in part because people don't
want to go through that again,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of
the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ``Americans were also
spoiled with the Gulf War. It was quick and decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff argues that Americans will not have much patience for
an extended, far-off war that holds still-uncertain objectives for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be quicker,'' he said. ``It's the times
we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters agree most Americans hold still-pliable opinions about
the Kosovo conflict, but they also say it's hard to compare the war

   Is this 1930s Europe, where delays might have allowed genocide
to proceed? Is it 1960s Southeast Asia, a quagmire with little
promise? Or is this the Middle East of the early 1990s, where
decisive action can force a despot into retreat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans generally either want to act decisively or get
out,'' Bowman said. ``People say that if we're going to be involved
then we have to win _ if we know what winning means here _ and get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans haven't yet forecast the odds for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a clear understanding that there are Kosovars in
deep trouble and that we have an obligation to do something,'' said
Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press. ``They're less certain about what.''
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty means that public opinion could prove fickle.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls, for instance, show wide ranges on the issue of
whether to send in ground troops. Although support has been rising,
with 73 percent in one poll last week backing the move if it was
the only way to stop fighting, only 41 percent in a poll also taken
last week wanted Americans helping Europeans in a ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is just suddenly upon us, and that has people
confused,'' said Jean Johnson of the Public Agenda think tank
devoted to studying public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this on foreign policy on issue after issue. People
are not going to think strategically like a foreign policy analyst
might. They just want to know: Is it the right thing to do? Is it
going to work?''
</P>
<P>
   People are learning as they go.
</P>
<P>
   In a Los Angeles Times poll conducted March 25, 63 percent of
respondents didn't know which side the United States is supporting
in the conflict. A Pew poll conducted the same week found that most
people couldn't name Kosovo as the Yugoslav province ``where there
is conflict between Serbians and ethnic Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   But the showdown in Kosovo also has grabbed America's interest.
A continuing survey by the Pew Research Center of attention paid to
news events found in late March that 74 percent of Americans were
following the war ``very closely'' or ``fairly closely.''
</P>
<P>
   That's slightly more attention than was paid to the stock market
crash of 1987 and slightly less than the federal government
shutdown in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That hothouse of close scrutiny of an exotic subject, said
California pollster Don Dixon, nurtures a softness of public
opinion that could affect how President Clinton responds to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few weeks ago Clinton was ahead of public opinion'' in
terms of proposing American military action. Now, with the call for
ground troops, ``public opinion is ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he commits to a ground war and we're stuck in a
protracted guerrilla conflict,'' Dixon said, ``public opinion could
leave him very quickly.''

STRUCTURE OF COMPANY IS VITAL TO SUCCESS, EX-PORSCHE CEO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ The car is pronounced POR-sha, not porsh.
Once he cleared that up, Peter Schutz could focus on his primary
business lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and chief executive of Porsche-AG, who led
the automaker from a money-losing to a profit-soaring operation in
the 1980s, shared some of his turnaround tips this week with a
group of Kansas City area CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Tops on his list was the admonition to scrutinize their
organizational structures. The right structure will help a company
compete and prosper in fast-changing environments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz, who operates Harris &AMP; Schutz Inc., a management
consulting company based in Florida, spoke to a chapter of The
Executive Committee meeting in Lee's Summit. TEC is a national
organization of CEOs from midsize companies. Members meet in small
groups once a month to share experiences and learn new strategies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schutz, the functional organization chart, in place
at many companies, creates conflict. It burdens individuals with
conflicting job titles and conflicting responsibilities that aren't
possible to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Schutz outlined a standard organizational chart:
CEO at the top and four vice presidents reporting to him or her:
VP-sales and marketing; VP-production and product development;
VP-personnel management and human resource development; and
VP-accounting, finance and information systems (and maybe legal,
too).
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you see sales and marketing in the same job, you can
count on the fact there'll be no true marketing in that
organization,'' Schutz contended. ``What they call marketing will
consist only of sales support activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Schutz said sales was a production and administration function,
designed to sell current products or services and meet current
customers' needs. Managing sales well requires a full-time
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Schutz said, marketing is an entrepreneurial
function, designed to anticipate customer needs. It must be ahead
of market changes, he said, instead of reacting to them.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Schutz said, managing daily production is a full-time
job that leaves no time to adequately address product development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a vice president of production to help change the
company, you'll get change through cost cuts and quality
improvement of existing products,'' he said. ``You will not get
innovation, because production is not an entrepreneurial
function.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for other job titles that mix running-in-place functions
with planning-for-the-future functions, Schutz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have production roles in their codes have to take
care of daily business, of existing customers; therefore, they're
incapable of dealing with visions for change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz said such functional organizations had two big negatives:
They're slower to change and they lose their entrepreneurial-minded
people to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz said he had guided several client companies through
transitions from functional organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned the CEOs that such transitions took time and must
include better communication, more mutual respect among all workers
and a shared understanding of how to pull together. That's a big
change from many standard corporate hierarchies, which inhibit the
flow of information and foster turf-protection battles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that prosper will be the ones in which everyone
understands the common goal: to make money by being their niche
market leader.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz said there were several alternative organization charts.
One he suggested had a CEO at the top (because someone still has to
make final decisions) and four persons reporting directly to the
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   These people would have slightly different job titles and
responsibilities from the vice presidents in the old functional
organization chart. The new chart might include:
</P>
<P>
   A chief operating officer, who leads sales, production,
administration and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   A chief administrative officer, who leads accounting,
information systems and legal.
</P>
<P>
   A chief development officer, who leads marketing, product
development and financial.
</P>
<P>
   A human resource officer, who leads training and staff
development.
</P>
<P>
   The first two positions must be held by people who are excellent
at leading daily business demands. The latter two positions must be
held by forward-thinking individuals who see that diversity _
social and philosophical _ is the best tool a company has, Schutz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A CEO must focus his or her best people on making money in a
market niche and give them the freedom and authority to do what it
takes to meet that goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A CEO must separate administrative and entrepreneurial duties.
No one can do a good job at both at the same time. If you're stuck
in a production and administrative organization, and change is
going on, your best people will be out the door, and you'll be out
of business.''

NATION'S DRUG CZAR PRAISES KC AREA TREATMENT PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo) _ The United States has made dramatic progress
against illegal drugs, but the struggle is constant and endless,
the nation's drug policy director said Thursday during a visit to
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, praised Jackson County for innovative efforts and called
for more prevention and drug treatment in the nation's communities
and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of things you're organizing here will actually
work,'' he told a gathering of prosecutors, police, court and
social workers at a Country Club Plaza restaurant. ``It takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that in 1979 about 14 percent of the U.S.
population used illegal drugs. Now he said about 6 percent still
use drugs and he wants to reduce that to 3 percent in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But that will mean stopping methamphetamine, which McCaffrey
called ``the worst drug to ever hit America.''
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine is plentiful in about a half-dozen states,
including Missouri. Meth and other drugs that users make at home
with toxic chemicals and legal precursor drugs will be big threats
in the next century, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention programs and treatment are important, he said, and he
praised Jackson County for such efforts as its anti-drug tax, Drug
Court and coordinated treatment efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Drug courts have spread nationwide since Jackson County's
started in 1993. It allows minor offenders to avoid jail if they
complete a year of drug treatment, counseling and job training.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also called the county's new Family Drug Court ``bold,
creative new thinking.'' Drug-addicted mothers in the program must
complete treatment or risk losing their children to foster care.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the vast majority of those in prison had
abused drugs or alcohol and should be seeking treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Corrections Director Dora Schriro told the group that
the state had increased prison drug treatment beds from a few
hundred to about 3,000 in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A study this year showed that 15 percent of the state's rapidly
growing prison population were drug offenders. It also showed that
many judges were sending drug users with no prior records to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Schriro said her department in one year has helped establish 154
treatment providers statewide. She said they will give rural judges
an option besides prison and help monitor drug use by parolees.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey told the group that community efforts were the key
to cutting illicit drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay at it,'' he said. ``We do the kind of things this
group has put together.''

KANSAS CRACKING DOWN ON MORTGAGE BROKERS, HIGH-RATE MORTGAGE
LENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Kansas legislators are putting new teeth into state
regulations for mortgage brokers and high-rate mortgage lenders,
hoping to curb minor infractions and outright lending abuses that
have proliferated with the growth of both activities.
</P>
<P>
   The measures recast the state's laissez-faire approach toward
the industry but stop short of protections adopted in other states
and those recommended by trade groups in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Kansas has required mortgage brokers to register
with the state bank commissioner's office, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had $100 and could fill out a form, you could be a
mortgage broker,'' said A.W. Pickel, president of Leader Mortgage
and past president of the Kansas Association of Mortgage Brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 241, effective last week, places new bonding
requirements on brokers and gives the state banking commissioner
new powers to punish brokers who are in violation of the code.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage brokers are independent contractors who can arrange
home loans through a wide variety of lenders. Because they offer a
wider choice of loan products, they can usually find the best and
cheapest loan to meet customers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   It's a booming business. Since the state registration statute
passed, more than 500 individuals and companies have signed up to
broker mortgages in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 67 percent of those registered, however, have no
office in the state, according to regulators. They are out-of-state
companies that solicit business through telemarketing, direct mail
or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because brokers had no formal licensing, educational
or certification requirements in the state, regulators had little
control over their activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevin Glendening, deputy state bank commissioner in
Kansas, the bulk of consumer problems cropping up are relatively
minor. A broker might not be registered. Or a poorly organized
broker might fail to follow through on commitments to clients,
situations that are hard to remedy when operators have no financial
stake in the state.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of brokers has increased, however, so have
instances of outright consumer fraud. Problems include
``steering,'' where brokers automatically send customers to lenders
who pay the highest finder's fee; the arrangement of loans with
excessive interest rates and fees; and the improper disbursement of
clients' loan proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Association of Mortgage Brokers maintains that the
``few bad apples'' in the industry are primarily out-of-state
operations. Consequently, it has been a vocal proponent of beefing
up requirements, even to the point of mandatory education and
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Legislature adopted several amendments to the
1996 law, including requirements for out-of-state brokers to post
$100,000 surety bonds or meet a minimum net worth requirement of
$50,000, with lesser such requirements for in-state brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments also give regulators the authority to fine
brokers for infractions of the code and issue cease-and-desist
orders to those doing business without a license. They also force
brokers to establish escrow accounts and keep more-detailed records
on the disbursement of clients' funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations don't match the specific educational or exam
requirements in such states as Illinois, Ohio, Arizona and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't eliminate the fly-by-night ... operator,'' said
Michael Richmond, president-elect of the Kansas Association of
Mortgage Brokers. ``There are plenty of big shops out there
treating consumers unfairly that would have no problem posting a
bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a beginning to regulate our industry, to at some
point pass legislative powers for education requirements. This
keeps people from flocking into the state for a hundred bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the House and Senate passed a bill last week
mandating new disclosures for consumers who get high-rate and high
loan-to-value mortgages _ those in which the interest rate exceeds
12 percent or the loan exceeds the value of the collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 301, which is awaiting the governor's signature,
also eliminates balloon payments and negative amortization on
high-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Both occur when consumers are left with a large lump-sum payment
at the end of their loan term _ sometimes higher than the original
loan amount _ that they are forced to repay in full or refinance.

OBSESSION WITH HOMERS HURTS BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Great Scorer in the Sky must now change his eternal motto.
</P>
<P>
   It's no longer whether you win or lose, or how you play the
game. The real story is whether Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa went
deep. If Sosa fails to hit a home run, it's big news, and if
McGwire hits two in one game, then it can be reported he's ahead of
last year's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the New York Yankees could care less if they hit a home run,
and they won 125 games last year, nor has it ever been a big deal
to Craig Biggio or Jeff Bagwell, the two most team-oriented players
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. even tried to plead indifference last year when
he said, ``I don't care about hitting home runs, I just want to
win.'' But no one believed him because the Great Home Run Chase was
on, and he was supposed to be a big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark figured out a long time ago that only winning
mattered, but he was constantly reminded as a Rangers player that
Rafael Palmeiro was averaging 36 home runs a year in Baltimore
while he was struggling to hit 20.
</P>
<P>
   Clark came to Texas saying, ``I didn't come here to lose,'' and
he fulfilled his promise. Palmeiro was great in Baltimore, putting
up numbers that could eventually get him to the Hall of Fame. But
the reality is the Orioles weren't any more successful during those
five years than the Rangers were with Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer is one of the best players ever to wear a Rangers
uniform, and he has hit more than 18 home runs just once in five
seasons. Juan Gonzalez has earned much more respect the past few
years with his incredible RBI totals than he did in 1992-93 when he
won back-to-back home-run titles.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez has succumbed to the home-run fever sweeping
baseball, demanding that the Rangers move in the fences at The
Ballpark in Arlington as part of his next contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know why Roger Maris went nuts with the media's
questions. It wasn't because he was hounded every step of the way
in 1961 when he hit his record-breaking home runs. Jerry Izenberg
of the ``Newark Star-Ledger'', who covered the Yankees that year,
said Maris was fine with the press that season; it was only the
next year when it all turned sour, with people constantly asking
him if he would do it again.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire promised at the start of the spring training he would
stop talking about home runs once the season started, but it
remains a major topic of conversation wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game of baseball, it's not a home-run game,''
McGwire said after hitting two home runs against the Pittsburgh
Pirates on Tuesday. ``I do what I can to help the ballclub. If I
don't hit any home runs, it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people will start realizing that it's no big deal when
they realize the proliferation of offense in baseball has become
obscene and excessive. Who really wants to watch the Rangers get
clobbered by the Anaheim Angels, 13-5, then turn around and hammer
the Seattle Mariners, 15-6 the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Is that really exciting baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Pitching and defense are still important; they are the reasons
why the Houston Astros had the best team in Texas the past two
years and will again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is the best player in baseball not only because he hits
50 home runs a year but because he can race into deep center field
and make a brilliant twisting, over-the-head catch, as he did
Wednesday night against Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball juiced the ball up _ please, Tom Schieffer, don't deny
it _ because officials believed more offense would bring fans back
from the devastating players strike of 1994-95 and to a point they
were right.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, they threaten to destroy much that is
aesthetically beautiful about the game and, in the process, divert
attention away from what's really most important.
</P>
<P>
   Winning.

CURVEBALL IS GOING OUT OF STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan could throw a fastball close to 100 mph, but always
insisted many of his 5,714 strikeouts came on the curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters would be setting up for that fastball,'' former
pitching coach Tom House said. ``Then he'd break off one of those
curves. The hitter would see that ball coming at his head and
freeze, then all of a sudden it would break over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``See ya. We called it his Good Night, Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other names for the pitch. The Hook. Snapdragon.
Deuce. Uncle Charlie. Lord Charles.
</P>
<P>
   It is has long been an American institution. What Little League
pitcher doesn't dream about throwing his first curveball and have
that hitter look bewildered?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 11 years old when I first started throwing mine,''
Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele said. ``But it was under very tight
restrictions. I was allowed to throw one per game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the curveball may take on another name.
</P>
<P>
   Extinct.
</P>
<P>
   This great American pitch, famed in song and story, is going out
of style, replaced by other breaking pitches such as the slider,
sinker, split-finger fastball, cut fastball and knuckle curve.
</P>
<P>
   Only three pitchers on the Rangers throw a genuine curveball:
Sele, John Wetteland and Mike Munoz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even that is unusual,'' Rangers third baseman Todd Zeile said.
``Most staffs you're likely to find only one guy who throws a real
curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman: ``The number of people
who throw it is very low, and it's getting less and less. It's a
very difficult pitch to learn to throw. \RPitching coach\S Sid
Hudson, God bless him, tried everything he knew to teach me to
throw a curveball and couldn't do it. I don't even teach it unless
a guy comes to me first and wants to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The slider has become the preferred breaking ball of
major-league pitchers because it's easier to learn and easier to
control. It breaks tighter and sharper.
</P>
<P>
   The curveball goes from ``12 to six,'' starting out high and
dropping down low as it breaks. Because of the unusual angle of the
pitch, it's much more difficult to throw for a low strike,
especially with today's smaller strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to control both the distance and the direction,''
Sele said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wetteland: ``It's a difficult pitch; you have to stay with
it constantly. The upkeep is huge. I have to throw mine a ton just
to get a feel for it. Once you start throwing a slider, your
ability to throw a curve lessens because the muscles it takes to
throw both are completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the danger if a pitcher throws a hanging curve, a
hitter is likely to deposit it somewhere in the outfield seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a good one or it gets hit hard,'' Zeile
said.
</P>
<P>
   The curveball can also be hard on an arm. Steve Stone won 25
games and a Cy Young Award in 1980 for the Baltimore Orioles but
was never the same pitcher again. He admitted he overused the curve
that year. Former Orioles reliever Gregg Olson had an outstanding
curve but started having serious arm troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had flexor problems and forearm problems because of the way
he threw it,'' Bosman said. ``He got sore quicker and didn't
recover quicker, and pretty soon there were large concerns about
his health.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson averaged 32 saves per year between 1989-93 before having
arm troubles. He had 13 saves over the next four years. Olson made
a comeback last year with Arizona, saving 30 games, but has
struggled this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd guard against throwing a breaking ball pitch until you're
15 or 16 years old,'' Wetteland said. ``If your bones and muscles
aren't developed, you run the risk of certain types of calcium
deposits.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably wise advice but also disappointing for so many
Little Leaguers who can't wait to throw their first snapdragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably don't know the difference between a curve or a
slider,'' Wetteland said. ``They just want to see the ball break.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally. / nn

ZIMMERMAN RECEIVES PRAISE FOR EARLY WORK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Johnny Oates has seen Esteban Loaiza this spring. He
has also seen Jeff Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   After Zimmerman's first two major-league outings, Oates is
convinced the right-hander from TCU is no Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't put his name and Loaiza's in the same sentence,'' Oates
said. ``He's passing some people right now. From what I've seen in
spring training and now, I'm impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates was especially impressed after the Rangers' 9-6 victory
over Seattle on Wednesday at the Kingdome. Zimmerman replaced
starter John Burkett in the fifth inning and retired eight
consecutive hitters, putting a halt to the Mariners' attack and
allowing the Rangers to mount a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a perfect world,'' Oates said. ``He was able to get
us to our short guys... This is why we needed a 12th pitcher, but
little did we know how good he would be. He's pitching like he's
been here his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's only complaint was that the first batter he faced,
Jay Buhner, hit a sacrifice fly to give the Mariners a 4-3 lead.
But the Rangers came back, tying it in the sixth inning on Juan
Gonzalez's sacrifice fly and going ahead on Tom Goodwin's
run-scoring single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed Zimmerman to earn his first major-league victory
with the eventual help of John Wetteland's fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of bittersweet,'' Zimmerman said. ``I came in with
a runner on base, and I didn't want to let him score. But I fell
behind Buhner and gave him something to hit, and he got it in the
air. I was disappointed I didn't do my job there, but it worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman made his major-league debut Tuesday, throwing 12/3
scoreless innings in the Rangers' 15-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel as good as I did the night before,'' Zimmerman
said. ``I don't think I had the same velocity, and I couldn't go
after hitters as much. I had to hit my spots and change speeds
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Rangers' order _ Todd Zeile, Lee Stevens,
Royce Clayton and Goodwin _ provided most of Texas' offense. They
were 8-for-16 with four walks, three stolen bases, seven runs
scored and four runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our order, we're batting at the bottom because
we have so many great hitters in the lineup,'' Stevens said. ``When
the big guys are not driving in runs, we're there to pick up the
slack. There's definitely a pride factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, batting with the bases loaded, might have done more
damage with his sacrifice fly, a long drive to deep center. But Ken
Griffey Jr., raced back and made an over-the-head catch to hold the
Rangers to one run.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for 28 hits and Zimmerman was the only
pitcher to go more than one-third of an inning without giving up a
run.

ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WHEN JOHNSON PITCHES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - They opened the roof for a reason at Bank One
Ballpark. With Randy Johnson pitching anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   The sky's the limit.
</P>
<P>
   What's he liable to do?
</P>
<P>
   Pitch a shutout?
</P>
<P>
   Flirt with a no-hitter?
</P>
<P>
   How many will he strike out tonight _ 10, 12? Last start he
fanned 15 Braves.
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher in the game today stirs expectations and generates
more excitement than the tall lanky figure who stood on the mound
at Bank One Ballpark Thursday night, ball hidden in his left hand,
a scowl on his face, menace in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen?
</P>
<P>
   A big disappointment, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   After losing three in a row to the Diamondbacks the Dodgers took
out their frustration with an 8-1 victory that spoiled Johnson's
home debut.
</P>
<P>
   Two home runs. A triple. As the visitors merrily circled the
bases in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings the picture of the
dejected lefthander brought to mind something Buck Showalter said
the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy's not perfect. He's human. He's not a robot,'' the
manager reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Some games he will be overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights trying to hit Johnson's fastball will be like trying
to drink coffee with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Other nights he will make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I pitched bad,'' Johnson said flatly. He
smiled at the assembly of media huddled around his cubicle. ``No
point pulling the wool over you guys, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   The major league strikeout leader fanned 10. He struck out six
of the first 10 batters. But the Big Unit lasted only six innings
and when he walked with his head bowed to the dugout with his team
trailing 7-1 the only person who felt worse than he did was
Showalter, sick with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks didn't hit. They committed three errors.
Johnson's outing was the poorest of his three starts.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't how he had envisioned his home debut. Pitching for
the first time at BOB meant more to him than pitching on Opening
Day when he threw seven strong innings against the Dodgers and left
the game with a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He was keyed up. Perhaps too much so. His first seven pitches
were balls.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end cameGf the fourth. Gary Sheffield,
waving his black bat like a windshield wiper, drove a pitch into
Diamondbacks bullpen to give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Next inning Eric Young lashed a triple over rightfielder Tony
Womack who stood there momentarily, as if he didn't see the ball.
Mark Grudzielanek then deposited a Johnson offering over the
right-centerfield fence, near the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that Johnson's first game at home came against the
Dodgers. Last July Lisa Johnson was in Seattle watching ``Oprah''
when a news bulletin crawled aross the bottom of the screen _
``like one of those storm warnings,'' her husband said at the time.
The station reported that Johnson had been traded from the Mariners
to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic, Lisa reached Randy by phone just before he boarded a
plane in Baltimore. The TV report proved to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle traded Johnson to Houston where he put the Astros on the
cover of Sports Illustrated. ``Houston, We Have Liftoff.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the launch Johnson had envisioned in Arizona. But
there will be better nights. `` I figure I'll get 34 starts and
half of them will be at home. If I pitch 15 bad games'' _ Johnson's
smile said that wasn't likely _ ``then I may be looking to pitch
for some other team.''
</P>
<P>
   No chance of that. He is one of the game's premier attractions.
A fastball pitcher with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological edge you get when you're taking charge on
the mound is important. Let a fellow know you're mean and he's
going to be a little leary. The mound is no place for charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson could have said that, but he didn't. Former Dodger
Don Drysdale did. In 1960. &QL;

COWBOYS SIGN ISMAIL, BUT IRVIN MAY BE ON TRADE BLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The signing of free-agent Raghib Ismail was one
of several developments at wide receiver for the Cowboys yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ismail deal, for seven years and $21 million, including a $5
million signing bonus, was completed when the Cowboys received a
signed contract from Ismail's agent, Jack Mula, about 5 p.m.
yesterday by fax, perhaps a fitting way to end the monthlong
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones also announced that the team would not
match the $1.25 million offer sheet that restricted free-agent
receiver Patrick Jeffers signed with the Carolina Panthers, ending
the former Fort Worth Country Day star's stint with his hometown
team after one season.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest news of all heading into this weekend's NFL
draft might be that league sources have confirmed that the Cowboys
are willing to listen to trade offers for Michael Irvin, the team's
all-time leading receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones denied that Irvin has been included in
any trade talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not right,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Another team official also denied it, saying, ``What would we do
for receivers without Irvin?''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 33, a 12-year veteran, had little comment about the trade
talk, saying ``that's fine.'' Irvin is in the final year of his
contract, which comes after a frustrating 1998 season, when he led
the team in receptions for the eighth consecutive season with 74
passes but caught only one touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his loss would be a major blow to the Cowboys' offense,
considering he is the team's only proven star receiver and coach
Chan Gailey's penchant for multiple-receiver sets. Additionally,
it's unlikely that any of the top receivers in the 1999 draft would
be available when the Cowboys select at No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Ismail came about, in part, because of the
Cowboys need for a speed receiver to help discourage opponents from
the double-team tactics used so effectively against Irvin last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' main off-season priority was to acquire a quality
speed receiver to make plays opposite Irvin. Ismail, a former Notre
Dame football and track star who will turn 30 on Nov. 18, became
the target after career-best numbers of 69 receptions for 1,024
yards and eight touchdowns in 1998. His previous season-best was 36
catches in 1997 with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He limits the things opponents can do if they are trying to
take away one guy because he's a guy you have to double as well
because of his speed,'' Cowboys receiver coach Dwain Painter said.
``He's a home-run threat any time you put the ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   A six-year veteran in the NFL, Ismail began his professional
career in the CFL in 1991, playing two seasons with Toronto before
joining the Raiders in 1993. He has played with the Panthers the
past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he was impressed with Ismail's attitude as well as
his athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he is a great talent,'' Gailey said. ``He has
excellent speed, and he will make big plays. Those are things we
look at, the speed, the big- play ability and his attitude. He
wants to come in and be a part of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the process of signing Ismail took so long is still unclear.
The two sides say they are just happy to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Mula, who indicated that Ismail
probably wouldn't make it to Dallas until next week. Mula said
Ismail's wife, Melani, who is pregnant with their third child, is
not feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is happy the Cowboys were able to get the deal done in a
cap-friendly way. In 1999, Ismail's base salary is $400,000, and he
counts just $1.1 million against the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has given out $21.5 million in signing bonuses to Ismail,
quarterback Troy Aikman ($13 million) and center Mark Stepnoski
($3.5 million) in the past week. However, he is not through, saying
``the push'' is on to complete a deal with linebacker Quentin
Coryatt before the draft begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be working late to get something done,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Jeffers decision, Jones said it was simply a
salary-cap issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him on the team,'' Jones said. ``We basically looked
at it with disappointment. We thought he could contribute for us
this year. But we felt that amount of cap room would be better used
on some other part of our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers, who caught 18 passes for the Cowboys last season,
becomes Carolina's highest-paid receiver. However, he is expected
to be the Panthers' third receiver behind starters Rae Carruth and
Muhsin Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   In other free-agent news, the Cowboys have shown interest in
former St. Louis Rams quarterback Tony Banks. The Baltimore Ravens
are also in the running for Banks.

MILLER SHOWS HE'S AN IRON MAN  
 CATCHER QUIETLY PUTS IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Damian Miller once went a stretch of catching 30-some
games, but never a game in which he caught 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He did that Tuesday when the Diamondbacks and the Los Angeles
Dodgers played into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was way past my bedtime, so I don't remember what I was
doing,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers are normally drained after nine innings, both
physically and mentally. In the later innings of the marathon,
Miller, while his team was at bat, put heat pads on tightened
hamstrings to loosen them.
</P>
<P>
   He was back behind the plate Wednesday for nine innings and
again Thursday night and went 1 for 3 in the Diamondbacks' 8-1 loss
to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller isn't complaining about the work load as Kelly Stinnett
heals from a deep quadriceps bruise suffered in Atlanta last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get an opportunity to catch every day in the big
leagues, you're going to take advantage of it,'' Miller said.
``That's what I get paid to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out there and play as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is seizing his moment. He started the season as the
backup, providing relief for Stinnett on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Miller came into Thursday's game with a .308 batting average
and, in a five-game stretch, hit .381 (8 for 21) with four doubles
and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to go out and get more consistent, take every
at-bat like it's my last at bat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catching coach Glenn Sherlock said if his catchers can provide
offense, that's gravy. Their primary job to defend and call the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Doing 16-inning games isn't in the job description, but Miller
survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go out and dig a little deeper each inning,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played hard every inning and it's so stressful back there
when the game is so close,'' Sherlock said. ``We knew he was
capable of playing this way and now he's getting the opportunity to
play on an every-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller knows Stinnett will be back, perhaps as soon as this
weekend for the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett fielded bunts out of the crouch position Thursday and
said he felt the best he has since being kneed by Atlanta's Ryan
Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some pain, but it's a good pain, the kind you have the
day after you work out,'' Stinnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been durable in Stinnett's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing the job defensively and offensively,'' Sherlock
said. ``He's getting some big hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider him more of a defensive catcher. But he certainly
has pop in his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was excited about catching Randy Johnson on Thursday
night. He did last Saturday in Atlanta when Johnson struck out 15
in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge,'' Miller said. ``He expects to go out there
and dominate every single time. I've got to go out there with my
`A' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struggled this time and left after six innings, his team
trailing, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Andy Benes and Omar Daal, Miller is catching a new
starting staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training sometimes is not long enough to get a feel for
a guy,'' Miller said. ``They just want me to go out there and help
the starters get through seven or eight innings, whatever they can.
That's my job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, what I do is a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's been a big plus. &QL;

D-BACKS STRIKE OUT LESS OFTEN THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One of the Diamondbacks' goals this season has been to
cut down on strikeouts, and thus far, they have made noticeable
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona led the major leagues last season with 1,239 strikeouts.
Entering Thursday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the
Diamondbacks had struck out 53 times in nine games, 13 fewer than
at the same point a year ago. Eleven National League teams had more
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   One player showing more patience at the plate has been third
baseman Matt Williams. Entering Thursday night's game, he had
struck out just twice and had not once since the second game of the
season, April 6 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to give yourself the best opportunity to hit. Have
patience and not try to do too much,'' Williams said. ``By not
trying to do too much, maybe that's why we have more home runs,''
Williams said. Arizona led the majors with 20 entering Thursday's
game. &QL; 
Turf test &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Kentucky bluegrass turf at Bank One Ballpark is holding
up well after the first series, according to head groundskeeper
Grant Trenbeath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still showing its (young) age, but it's a little more
resilient than what we had last year (with zoysia),'' Trenbeath
said.
</P>
<P>
   The only noticeable blemish was from when the Dodgers' Gary
Sheffield took a large divot out of the grass in left field in the
second game. &QL; 
Finding relief &QL; 
Before Thursday's game, the Diamondbacks' bullpen had allowed three
earned runs on seven hits in 11 innings. In the last nine innings,
it yielded no runs and just two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a change from the first week of the season when the
relievers struggled to get outs.
</P>
<P>
   John Frascatore worked the last two innings of Wednesday's game,
allowing just one hit. It was a nicer ending than the extra-inning
affairs in Los Angeles and Atlanta, where the right-hander was
tagged with two losses. &QL; 
Moving up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Luis Gonzalez moved up to third in the batting
order Thursday against the Dodgers. He had been hitting mostly
fifth, but he's been swinging a hot bat. He came in with a .333
batting average. &QL; 
No panic attack &QL; 
Tuesday's 16-inning victory was huge for the Diamondbacks, but
Frascatore said that Wednesday's 6-2 win was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you can come back the next day from that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all settled in,'' Gonzalez said. ``We've got a bunch of
veteran guys. Nobody really panicked after we lost the first few
games. It's not a short sprint. It's a long race.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - The day after the hit that knocked out Jeremy Roenick
for the playoffs, the Coyotes' star center was recovering from 5{
hours of surgery, his wife was suggesting he quit and the
perpetrator was still claiming innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Stars captain Derian Hatcher, who inflicted the injury
that sidelined JR on Wednesday, will meet today in New York with
Colin Campbell, the NHL's punishment czar, and is likely to be
suspended for at least five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' No. 1 line of Mike Modano and wingers Brett Hull and
Jere Lehtinen won't have to worry about taking a similar hit
Saturday when the teams play in the regular-season finale at
America West Arena. Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock said before
Wednesday's game that the trio would be getting that day off to
rest for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference playoffs,
and Stars, the No. 1 West seed, could meet again as early as the
conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick underwent surgery at a Valley hospital Thursday to
repair the jaw that was broken in three places from a crushing hit
he took into the boards from the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick also suffered a fractured right thumb _ which alone
would have knocked him out of at least the first round _ a
split-second before the Hatcher hit when he was slashed hard by
defenseman Craig Ludwig, who may also face suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, when a player is summoned to the league office for a
hearing with Campbell, the NHL's senior vice president and director
of operations, he receives no less than a five-game banishment. It
means Hatcher can expect to miss the Stars' final two
regular-season games and at least the first few games of the
opening-round playoff series against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the penalty, it won't appease Roenick's wife, Tracey,
who spent time in the hospital earlier this week with the couple's
daughter, Brandi, who underwent an adenoid procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just wheeled him into the recovery room a minute ago, and
he's a mess,'' Tracey Roenick said Thursday morning, adding that
the operation took two hours longer than expected. ``I think it's
disgusting. It's absolutely disgusting. When he wakes up, I'm
saying to JR, `Retire, it's just not freaking worth it anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to his wife, Roenick had two steel plates fitted into
his jaw during the operation and an oral surgeon told her that at
least eight teeth likely will have to be replaced. He wasn't
scheduled to be released from the hospital until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A still-angry Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith had little to
say about the Hatcher hit, which many in the organization viewed as
a premeditated attack as retaliation for a check Roenick threw at
Modano three weeks earlier in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident the league will deal with this
appropriately,'' said Smith, who suffered two broken jaws during
his NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the game whether he thinks Hatcher faces a lengthy
suspension, Hitchcock said: ``Not at all. The original call was two
minutes. It's because there was blood there it went to five. It's a
normal part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars General Manager Bob Gainey is preparing for the worst when
Hatcher meets with Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (the Coyotes have) got a player badly injured is
something I think nobody can feel good about,'' he said. ``That is
not what the sport is about. In the normal course of the game or
the season, players do get injuries, but injuries shouldn't be the
result of things that are not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher repeated Thursday that he never singled out Roenick on
the hit, that he didn't even know it was Roenick until just before
crashing into him, and that he didn't use his elbow to make
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate Jeremy broke his jaw,'' he said. ``I feel
bad, but there's nothing I can do about it now. . . . I hit him
with my shoulder. The bad thing about it is, I did come off my feet
a bit. It's a play that happens in a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Roenick wishes the Coyotes would have decided to sit her
husband Wednesday night in Dallas. She said he told her the day
before he left that the Stars were going to target him, something
which ``The Arizona'' ``Republic'' and the ``Dallas Morning News''
each warned was possible in stories Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher claims he never said anything to the media that could be
construed as premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. If you can find me a quote in any paper saying we were
going to hit Jeremy, or for that matter, saying I was going to get
him, find them and show them to me,'' said Hatcher, who also ended
Roenick's season during the 1994-95 playoffs with a questionable
knee-on-knee hit. ``It wasn't even mentioned in the room before the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick can't say much of anything with the condition of his
jaw, but his wife said she is fairly confident he wouldn't rip
Hatcher for the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably hasn't seen replays of the hit, but knowing `J,'
he wouldn't say what I feel like saying,'' Tracey Roenick said.
``When Derian took out his knee (in 1995), Jeremy never bashed
Derian for that and I know he wouldn't today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so frustrating because of the timing with the
playoffs coming up. I feel sad not only for Jeremy, but for the
Coyotes, the fans, for hockey, for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Might Roenick, 29, contemplate retirement? Maybe for a second,
but probably not. Tracey, however, wonders if it is time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making unbelievable money and that's great,'' she said,
``but he plays because he truly loves the game. But how much can
you love the concussions, the knee injuries and now, the broken
jaw? He has two young children. How much is it worth? He wants a
chance to play for the Stanley Cup but where is he today? He's in a
hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (retiring) could make Jeremy happy, I'd back him 100
percent. . . . I don't want my husband crippled so he can't go to
my son's hockey games.'' &QL;

   EVERGLADES-SUGAR (Clewiston, Fla.) _ The sugar industry is at
the center of a political struggle over a $7.8-billion project to
restore the watery wilderness of the Everglades, one of the most
threatened ecosystems in the world. The cane fields, former
marshland drained by a huge flood-control system for South Florida
50 years ago, stand like a plug between the Everglades and their
water source, Lake Okeechobee. For years, environmentalists have
labored to push back the fields. But the sugar industry has grown

   FREUD-EXHIBIT (New York) _ How should we interpret the writings
of Sigmund Freud? One way to regard him has always been as a
literary figure rather than as a scientist. Thomas Mann once even
endorsed Freud's nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Because it caused a widely-publicized fracas even before the plans
for it were finalized, the Freud exhibition, organized by the
Library of Congress and opening Sunday at the Jewish Museum, will
almost surely attract big crowds of curiosity-seekers. Crowds now
being a dominant feature of the museum experience, they are also,
to a degree, self-perpetuating, since people tend to want to go
where other people already are. The resulting frustration involves
trying to see what is on view in a throng. Freud might have noted
how we tend to seek out what we abhor. By Michael Kimmelman.

   APPLES-ST-LOUIS (St. Louis) _ In 1904, St. Louis was the fourth
largest American city. It was rich, river-rich, thanks to the
Mississippi, then the nation's main north-south artery. Although
Chicago had developed into the dominant railroad hub, St. Louis
deemed itself the rightful capital of the Middle West. So the city
staged the grandest, giddiest, most glorious fair the world had
ever seen, on this continent or any other, the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. That was the apogee; life in St. Louis has never been
quite as sweet since, and people here still murmur wistfully about
the summer of 1904. But the lights did not go out right away. St.
Louis prospered through the next few decades, ``a solid expanse of
bricks and mortar stretching away into dim, measure-defying
distances,'' as Mark Twain wrote, making money on beer and shoes
even as it fell behind boom towns like Detroit and Los Angeles. It
built an array of big-time cultural and civic institutions that
serve it well to this day. And fate found ways to keep its name on
the nation's mind. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   BROADWAY-REPLACE (New York) _ Richard Chamberlain's performance
in ``The Sound of Music,'' is one of those rare instances of
replacement casting that compels a theatergoer to ask, ``Why didn't
they think of him in the first place?'' Maybe they did. Whatever
the circumstances, this ``Sound of Music'' is appreciably better
than it was a year ago, and in the nonstop revolving door of
Broadway role playing, it is one of the best examples of how a
show's stock can rise on the strength of its personal investments.
As with the stock market, too, the Broadway trading floor is almost

GOV. DAVIS ANGER BOTH SIDES BY SEEKING MEDIATION ON PROP. 187
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Trying to sidestep the politically charged debate
over Proposition 187, California Gov. Gray Davis angered both sides
Thursday by announcing he would seek a negotiated compromise
through federal mediation rather than pursue a court appeal in
support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents and proponents of the measure, which would block
public benefits to illegal immigrants, questioned the legality of
the unusual maneuver, despite the governor's claims that mediation
would be best for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a piece of legislation, I would veto it,'' Davis
said. ``But it is not. I have taken an oath of office to enforce
all the laws of California and all the laws of this nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe both the plaintiffs and proponents of Proposition
187 will act responsibly. But if I must _ to ensure the will of the
electorate is respected and that we get beyond this divisive issue
_ I will knock heads to reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how far Davis was willing to go in dealing with
the overarching concerns about illegal immigration that prompted
voters to pass the initiative in 1994 by a margin of 59-41. In
1995, U.S. District Judge Maria Pfaelzer of Los Angeles ruled key
portions of the initiative unconstitutional. Last year she issued
her final order forbidding enactment of those provisions, and the
state under Gov. Pete Wilson appealed that ruling. Davis faced a
deadline to notify the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco whether he would pursue that appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question on illegal immigration, Davis said,
``I'm against anything that's illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Latino leaders adamantly contended Proposition 187 is
unconstitutional and renewed their calls for the state to drop the
case for its support.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the initiative said it reflects the will of the
voters, and they demanded Davis vigorously defend it in court.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who personally opposed Proposition 187, repeatedly has
vowed not to overlook the voters' mandate.
</P>
<P>
   In his toughest decision since taking office, Davis said he
believes negotiation is the best way to reach agreement on the
divisive issue, and he said it will spare taxpayers a lengthy,
costly legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Any settlement would be consensual and turned over to a 9th
Circuit judge for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' announcement infuriated Lt. Gov Cruz Bustamante, the
first Latino to hold state office in more than 100 years.
Addressing reporters on the steps of the Capitol with jaw clenched,
he tersely said he was disappointed by the governor's decision not
just to drop the case for an initiative Bustamante considers not
``morally or legally defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said he listened with pride to Davis' inaugural
speech declaring an end to wedge-issue politics like Proposition
187.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that meant that we were going to wait for a
federal judge to do our job for us,'' Bustamante said. ``I thought
it was about what we were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa angrily opposed Davis'
action.
</P>
<P>
   In the mediation process, Davis, represented by Attorney General
Bill Lockyer, will be in the position of supporting the initiative.
Also at the table will be a group of lawsuit plaintiffs who oppose
the initiative. Davis also said he would be seeking informal input
from Pacific Legal Foundation, a group which represented backers of
Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   Davis urged the lawsuit plaintiffs to come to negotiations with
an open mind. But lawyers representing illegal immigrants said,
while they will listen to any proposal from the governor, they are
far from open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you have an open mind? There's no such thing when you
are an advocate,'' said Vibiana Andrade, the counsel on Proposition
187 for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
``What the governor doesn't seem to understand is that for the
Latino community, (the initiative) was ground zero for the culture
wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrade said she realized that, since the initiative passed,
there have been new federal laws that address some of the same
concerns that prompted Proposition 187. For instance, now illegal
immigrants cannot receive Social Security or nonemergency
health-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the legal landscape has changed,'' Andrade said. ``But
if the governor walks in and demands certain things, like the
denial of education for children, that's something we wouldn't
stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Browne, an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, said
the governor couldn't be trusted to provide a good defense for the
initiative, even though it was approved by 59 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO: _ 59 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Davis has said he doesn't believe in Proposition 187
and that if it came across his desk he would veto it. I think that
gives us a good idea of how vigorously he will defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Klausner, a Los Angeles attorney, said he has grave
concerns because the Pacific Legal Foundation is not being given a
formal place in the mediations, and he questions how the process
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge could say no; he would not endorse it,'' Klausner
said. ``Would a 9th Circuit judge go along and validate the
results? That's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts questioned the use of mediation for a
constitutional issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is that mediation makes more sense not in matters
of principle, like Proposition 187, but in matters of fact,'' said
Evan Caminker, a University of California, Los Angeles,
constitutional law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich blasted the
governor's decision and took a swipe at him in a prepared statement
that alluded to Davis' longstanding reputation as a publicity
hound.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when we needed a profile of courage, we had all
profile _ and no courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Southern California, said the ACLU ``will accept no offer
that removes children from schools they attend or denies needy
individuals the necessary health care or social services to which
they are entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACLU believes that the governor has both the
constitutional authority and the constitutional obligation to
dismiss the appeal in the Proposition 187 litigation,'' Rosenbaum
said. ``The governor's oath to uphold our federal constitution
accordingly requires that he cease to attempt to enforce all laws,
including Proposition 187, which he believes to be
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   After long delaying a final decision, Judge Pfaelzer ruled it
unconstitutional on the grounds immigration issues are federal
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal would be dropped under Davis' mediation plan,
preventing a definitive ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.

MARINERS LOSE IN 10 INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was a perfect day for baseball _ at Safeco Field,
perhaps. But not indoors at the Kingdome, not for Lou Piniella and
the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers finished off a three-game sweep Thursday with
a 4-3 victory in 10 innings. The Mariners ended their
season-opening homestand with a 4-6 record. It's early of course,
but Piniella's patience was challenged _ though that happened after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   On a day in which Ken Griffey Jr. did not play because of an
upset stomach, the Mariner manager was also churning inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your thoughts on how the game turned out,'' Piniella was asked
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts on how the ballgame turned out?'' a puzzled
Piniella asked. ``What should my thoughts be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably frustrated,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   And then Piniella caught himself, just like Jeff Fassero did,
before damage ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing is that Fassero pitched well,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game with a 10.80 earned run average, the Mariners'
No. 1 starter gave up a single on his first pitch to eventual hero
Luis Alicea and a run-scoring double to Roberto Kelly. The
left-hander resembled a quality pitcher after that, going eight
innings, allowing three runs on seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw his fastball on both sides of the plate (for
strikes),'' said catcher Tom Lampkin. `` ... He demonstrated he
knows how to pitch. He'll change people's minds about what kind of
season he's having.''
</P>
<P>
   In workouts this week with pitching coach Stan Williams, Fassero
changed a couple of mechanics. He took the ball out of his glove
earlier in the windup, resulting in better control and a more
downward trajectory toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was jumping out front too quick,'' Williams said. ``His arm
couldn't catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero said that his recent poor outings had not affected his
confidence, but Williams offered another perspective: ``When you're
getting your brains beat out, it's hard to be positive without
positive results.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella: ``He's worked hard, and it's starting to bear
some fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an orchard, but better than the cores Fassero produced
in his first two outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been terrible. We needed something out there,'' said
Fassero, who has been mentioned in unsubstantiated trade rumors for
the Yankees' Hideki Irabu. ``I can build on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boldly and consistently, Fassero threw fastballs inside. When
the Rangers started looking inside, he changed up and painted the
other corner, resulting in harmless ground balls to the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, he pitched me tough,'' said Rusty Greer,
who went 1-for-4 against Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Down 3-0 at one point, Fassero left with the score tied 3-3
after David Bell's two-run homer in the third and Butch Huskey's
RBI double in the fourth evened it up.
</P>
<P>
   That was it for Mariner punch. Rick Helling, another struggling
starter, allowed five hits, and Tim Crabtree and John Wetteland
finished up with an inning each of hitless relief. Every Ranger
pitcher was around the plate all afternoon and, consequently, the
Mariners were more apt to be on the dugout bench instead of the
basepaths. Seattle left just two runners stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the pitchers' fault,'' Huskey said. ``We needed five
runs to win the game. As hitters, we didn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Halama suffered the loss after pitching reasonably
well. But a single, a sacrifice and double by Alicea gave Wetteland
the opportunity to record his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just off the center, just above the belt,'' Lampkin
said of the pitch Alicea drove to right-center field. ``He was
trying to get the ball down to the inside of the plate. He didn't
get it there. He knows it, I know it and, if you saw the replay,
you know it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Piniella's final analysis, Texas simply has ``more horses,''
but the stampede has left town along with the Mariners. The search
for victories and an identity continues in Anaheim tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results indicated otherwise, it was evident that
the sun's rays somehow found a crack in the concrete and shone on
Lampkin's locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without two of the best players in baseball (Griffey and Alex
Rodriguez), we stayed with `em for 10 innings,'' Lampkin said. ``At
least we didn't give up 10 and score 2. We were in that game until
the last out. How can you not take something positive out of
that?''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who remain cynical about the Mariners' hopes, it
was Lampkin who made that last out, swinging helplessly at
Wetteland's final pitch.

KINGS SURPRISE DUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ For much of Thursday it looked as if the Mighty
Ducks might regain control of their playoff destiny. Phoenix was
leading St. Louis and Anaheim appeared on its way to completing a
six-game series sweep of the Kings before 14,669 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   But in a matter of minutes things turned completely around. The
Blues rallied to beat the Coyotes and the Ducks were being pushed
to the limit and eventually defeated by the Kings 4-3 on a goal by
Ray Ferraro at 2:21 of overtime with the Ducks two men down.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks not only failed to stay alive in the race for fifth
place _ they still haven't wrapped up sixth either.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bad news on the scoreboard from Phoenix, the Ducks
were leading 2-1 when the final meeting of the year between the two
teams turned into a run-and-gun affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who had managed only five goals in the five previous
games versus Anaheim, tied a team record when they scored twice in
six seconds to take a 3-2 lead with 12:07 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bodger tied the game with 40-footer that beat a screened
Dominic Roussel shot at 7:47. The crowd was still going wild when
Luc Robitaille beat Dan Trebil to the net and shoved the puck
through Roussel's pads for his 39th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was short-lived as Anaheim tied the game, 3-3 at
8:17, with the third goal in 30 seconds. Teemu Selanne did the
honors scoring his league-leading 47th goal off a nice setup by
Matt Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim got a much-need boost going into dressing room when it
took the lead with 3.4 seconds left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin won the draw cleanly back to Selanne, whose slap shot
from the high slot was blocked into the right circle by Stephane
Fiset. Unfortunately for the Kings goalie, Ducks defenseman Fredrik
Olausson had jumped right to that very spot and flicked the rebound
over Fiset for his 16th goal of the year. It was only Olausson's
second goal in his last 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   But during intermission Anaheim's chances of finishing fifth
took another body blow. Phoenix was leading St. Louis going into
the third period, but the Blues rallied to win with four goals in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who started fast on Wednesday night and wound up with
nothing to show for it, took a quick lead Thursday when Tomas
Sandstrom deflected rookie defensemen Scott Ferguson's point shot
past Fiset at 2:12.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was tangled up with Sandstrom in front of the crease and
argued for an interference call, but the Anaheim winger's 14th goal
of the season stood.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' lead lasted only six minutes thanks to a quick goal
by the Kings' much maligned power play. Ranked 24th in the league
with the man advantage, the Kings got a goal from Ray Ferraro at
6:12, only nine seconds after Jamie Pushor was sent to the penalty
box. Ferraro was wide open at the right post to receive a nice
cross-ice pass from Donald Audette and score his 11th goal of the
season and first in 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had several chances to regain the lead, but it was
their No. 1 ranked power play that let them down. The Kings took
two consecutive penalties late in the first and early in the second
and another midway through the period, but the Ducks generated
virtually no pressure on Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   A key to Anaheim's success all season the Ducks' power play unit
had converted only one of 16 chances heading into Thursday's game.

JAZZ GETS EVEN
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers may not need a bigger bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   And they can wait to rotate the tires on their current model,
because the parade that was threatening to break out on their road
to nowhere has stalled on the course.
</P>
<P>
   The rig was pulled over Thursday by the Utah Jazz, who thumped
the feisty Clippers, 103-89, in front of 10,447 at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no embarrassment losing to the Utah Jazz,'' said Clippers
coach Chris Ford, who - at 6 up and 32 down - now knows the emotion
well.
</P>
<P>
   But the defeat did end the Clips' victory run at two laps in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (30-8) also accomplished a little pick-and-role reversal
from March 27, when the Clippers experienced a harmonic convergence
- and a 103-77 triumph - in Anaheim. This time, the Clippers were
bothered by hearing too many whistles while they worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz hoisted 12 more free-throw attempts than they did, but
- to the young Clips - the timing of those calls was brutal.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, our Thursday Night Nitro rematch between Utah's Karl
``The Mailman'' Malone and Clipper Maurice ``Phonecrusher'' Taylor
(he never seems to get any calls) was as dry as, well, most of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Malone finished with 25 points and seven rebounds while working
the officials from the lost post, a place he has zoned as the whine
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when Karl Malone cries,'' Clipper Lorenzen Wright
said. ``It means we made him mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the other mad guy, was limited to 33 minutes by frequent
fouling, countering with 16 and six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' Taylor said - among other things -- in
reference to the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's physical starting crew had Malone's back, with John
Stockton (nine assists) and Bryon Russell each checking in with 19
points, Greg Ostertag contributing 19 rebounds and 16 points, and
Jeff Hornacek on the board for another 15.
</P>
<P>
   Wright scored 15 points and grabbed 12 rebounds off the Clipper
bench. Point guard Sherman Douglas had 17 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   Utah started their payback campaign with a 12-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With three starters on the twilight side of their powers, the
Jazz still execute their schemes like the death squad from a YMCA
league. But the Clippers are harder to shake than a bad credit
rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, showing appreciable pluck, kept fighting and
trailed 46-44 at intermission. But Malone and Stockton - death and
taxes - scored nine and eight points, respectively, as Utah pounded
its way to a 75-61 advantage entering the final period. The
Clippers scrapped to within seven on a three-point play by Murray
with 3:56, but the wheels came off again.

STRAWBERRY'S DRUG ADDICTION AN EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sports stars have long leashes. When the 3-pointers
and touchdowns and home runs keep coming, the slack we are willing
to cut them is generous.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when they betray that flood of trust and
adulation?
</P>
<P>
   The leash gets yanked. It gets pulled back hard. With a
vengeance. With anger.
</P>
<P>
   The internet, radio talk shows and baseball clubhouses are alive
across America right now with talk of Darryl Strawberry.
Overwhelmingly, the words are harsh, the sentiments stern.
</P>
<P>
   All these things were said Thursday, in the wake of news that
Strawberry, 37, was arrested in Florida on charges of sex
solicitation and cocaine possession:
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics) A selfish person ... He acts with no regard to
others or other people's feelings ... No more chances, he's out ...
Put the dopester in prison where he can rot ... It's not about
drugs, it's about irresponsible behavior ... No more sympathy. (end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   At the Kingdome, veterans who have been around the game and
Strawberry were dismayed to hear the news about the Yankees
slugger, whose battles with cocaine and alcohol abuse twice landed
him in rehab and once got him a 60 day suspension from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro said he feels bad for Strawberry's family, but
not Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get talked to about all this stuff in spring training,''
the Rangers first baseman said. ``We have FBI agents brought in to
tell us we're targets. Things like that will happen if you put
yourself in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner said it was a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I feel sorry for him,'' he said. ``I know that
sounds rude and harsh because we're all family in baseball. When
something like this happens, I have concern for Darryl the person,
outside of baseball. I worry about Darryl. He's got a family and
kids. He's a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got to be the toughest, to know a kid might grow up and
have to say, `My dad was a druggie.' I couldn't look my kids in the
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to understand how a man with such athletic
gifts, who has had so many chances already, could just go out and
blow it.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this is another round of public education on the
insidious nature of addiction. That is what the experts say, though
they are no less disheartened to hear such news about a man whose
private demons, failures and disease are a matter of public record.
</P>
<P>
   David Mactas is the former director of the National Center for
Substance Abuse Treatment, the United States' principal agency for
this problem. He is now president and CEO of Hazelton, one of New
York's largest abuse treatment centers. He said the news about
Strawberry was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible because he is human and because he had gone down to
Florida to try and win a job (back in the major leagues) and
because his wife stood beside him all during his plight with colon
cancer,'' Mactas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the nature of the disease. It's a chronic,
relapsing condition. It's not a requirement to relapse. It is not
part of the job description but it is quite common.''
</P>
<P>
   While the charges allege only that Strawberry had 0.3 grams of
cocaine and there was no evidence that he had been using, it opens
the question about what is so powerful about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhilarating. It's seductive. It's viable. It's
affordable. It's addictive,'' Mactas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laboratory rats would sooner use cocaine than eat food or
drink water. So will humans. It is a very powerful feeling of
exhilaration and most seductive for people who too often feel they
are missing feeling terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that the brain's chemistry and structure
change with substance abuse. The neurotransmitters and receptors in
the brain, which pass along substances that create the sensation of
euphoria, can be affected.
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, addiction is a ``modified brain disease,'' Mactas
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the glare of the bright lights of major-league sports,
the nature of Strawberry's illness is fractured. The charge will be
that Strawberry is extra-responsible for keeping up his end of the
bargain. The feeling is he has let everyone down. Straw is worthy
of scorn, not forgiveness, because he has used up his ration _
whatever that mysterious ration may be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the pendulum swing of emotion against Strawberry now is so
thorough because eight months ago, Strawberry's battle with colon
cancer drew so many people's interest and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   If fact, ever since Yankees owner George Steinbrenner decided to
act like Father Flanagan by inviting Strawberry into the Bronx
Boystown four years ago, Strawberry has been a solid citizen. He
has been a positive, contributing member of a very unselfish,
personable, compelling Yankee team.
</P>
<P>
   If Steinbrenner had to open the door for Strawberry with a
warning not to mess up, Strawberry had fulfilled his obligation to
his boss, to baseball and to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   At least he had up until the time of his arrest, which did us
the favor of reminding us that recovery is never-ending, that the
stigma of addiction is almost as bad as the disease.

LAKERS DECIDE TO WAIVE RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Dennis Rodman experiment, as intriguing as it
was combustible, finally fizzled out Thursday afternoon, just 23
games after it began.
</P>
<P>
   And not a championship banner or ticker-tape parade to show for
it. Just the usual trail of chaos left in Rodman's choppy wake.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers decided to give up on the talented but troublesome
rebounding specialist late in the afternoon, and he will be placed
on waivers today.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made jointly by executive vice president Jerry
West, general manager Mitch Kupchak and coach Kurt Rambis, just
hours after Rodman again arrived late for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis sent Rodman home, signaling that the end of the
38-year-old veteran's tenure here was near.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers owner Jerry Buss, who befriended Rodman in the offseason,
then insisted on signing him despite West's strong objections,
signed off on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time we feel it's in the best interests of the Lakers
to end the relationship,'' West said in a prepared statement.
``This obviously didn't work out like we had hoped. But we would
like to thank Dennis for the contributions he did make to the team
and wish him the best of luck in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Team officials could not be reached for further comment, but
Kupchak is scheduled to speak with the media today. There was no
immediate word from Rodman's army of Hollywood agents and public
relations specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers must pay the remainder of Rodman's one-year contract,
about $122,000. Rodman had an option for $1 million for next
season, but that provision has been negated.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who won five NBA championships with Detroit and Chicago,
ended his brief Lakers career having averaged a team-leading 11.2
rebounds, 2.1 points and 1.3 assists in 28.6 minutes. He played in
23 games, started 11, and the Lakers went 17-6 when he played. They
were 8-9 without him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Third-year forward Travis Knight, the starter until Rodman
replaced him, will be activated from the injured list to take his
roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end came shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday,
when Rodman arrived a few minutes late to practice at Southwest
College. Rambis, exhibiting a new zero-tolerance stance, sent him
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made exceptions and special cases to accommodate him, but
in my mind, the accommodation period is over,'' Rambis said
afterward, but before the team decided to waive Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The coach's declaration was the strongest stance the Lakers had
taken since signing Rodman on Feb. 23, when the club's official
policy was ``Dennis is Dennis,'' as Buss put it.
</P>
<P>
   But letting Rodman play by his own rules didn't work out as
planned. He added double-figure rebounds when he played, but his
energizing performances were too often interrupted by both on- and
off-court flare-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous late arrivals. Four skipped practices. Four missed
games, and a trip to Las Vegas while the team was on a six-game
road trip. And four instances of refusing to re-enter a game, the
last one Tuesday, when he claimed elbow soreness and sat out the
second half of the Lakers' 113-86 loss to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   That history, combined with the Lakers' recent struggles on the
court, led Rambis to draw the line. Rodman's explanation didn't
help his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was looking for socks and shoes,'' Rambis said,
``and I told him practice was 11, and why don't you just go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Lakers had the luxury of indulging such antics. But
not after losing their past two games and four of their past seven,
with just 10 regular-season games left to prepare for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time that we really, everybody, jump on the same
page. You're either involved with the team, on the team, with the
team or you're not,'' Rambis said. ``I just feel that we have to be
more concerned with the team than individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal said he supported Rambis' decision to send
Rodman home, but added, ``I really didn't see him as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's actions, O'Neal said, are ``not really OK, but the guy
does his job in the game most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Tuesday's deflating defeat at Portland, and with
a tough road game at Utah on Saturday, Rambis is determined to do
whatever is necessary to pull his floundering team together.
</P>
<P>
   So after sending Rodman home, Rambis kicked all bodyguards,
security people and hangers-on out of the gym, and posted a
handwritten sign on the door: ``Practice is closed. NO ENTRY.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he put the team through a non-nonsense, 2{-hour workout and
afterward said the closed-practice policy _ players, trainers and
coaches only _ will continue for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more focused as a team, we have to be more
dedicated as a team and we have to know that when we're coming
here, we're coming to work,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher welcomed the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been up and down, and right now we're just down,'' he
said. ``You can't sit there and just allow that to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Glen Rice (tonsillitis) and Derek Harper (sore back)
attended practice but did not participate. Rice, out the last two
games, said he hoped to be able to practice today and play
Saturday, but ``how much, I have no idea.''

HAWKINS' `3' BEATS KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ At this point in the regular season, the
Sonics need victories like cars need gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Hersey Hawkins, the rough-riding Sonics left ARCO
Arena full.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' buzzer-beating 3-pointer in overtime beat the pesky
Sacramento Kings Thursday night in a must-win game for the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible relief,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal
said, who jumped around the court, exchanging high-fives with
players and his assistants. ``It was a stunning relief. This win
was huge for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 96-93 with 1:30 left in the game when Detlef
Schrempf hit a 3-pointer to tie the score. Sacramento muffed two
trips to the foul line that could have sealed the Sonics' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' game-winner came after the Sonics put the ball in play,
down 98-96 with 7.3 seconds left. Gary Payton drove the baseline
and passed out to a wide-open Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Hawkins hurt his knee when he fell to the floor. He
could hardly run on the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is Paul said to me as I walked by, `Go knock
down a three and let's get out of here.' It worked just like he
said,'' Hawkins said. ``If I had to run, I would have been in
trouble. But I'm happy for Paul. It's been a rough season. We
haven't had any breaks so it's really nice to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins picked the right time to make his only jump shot of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to figure sooner or later it's going to go our way,''
Schrempf said. ``There's nothing sweeter than seeing a shot fall
through at the buzzer and running out with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory put the 19-19 Sonics a half-game in front of the
Phoenix Suns for the seventh seed in the Western Conference playoff
standings. The Sonics also moved 2{ games ahead of the Kings
(17-22).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 90-86 with 1:24 left in regulation. Kings rookie
Jason Williams scored a layup with 31.5 seconds remaining. The
Kings then missed two chances to tie the game _ and the Sonics
missed a chance to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics center Olden Polynice went to the the free-throw line
four times, making just one of them. The Sonics clung to a 91-88
lead with 4.4 seconds left, giving Sacramento just enough time.
</P>
<P>
   Kings center Vlade Divac dribbled the ball past midcourt and
found Predrag Stojakovic wide open in the corner opposite the
Sonics' bench. Stojakovic's off-balance 3-pointer fell as the clock
expired and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics argued the shot came after the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in the NBA you win two games in one
night,'' Polynice said. ``When did we start playing
doubleheaders?''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics play New Jersey at home tonight and play the Suns for
a third and final time Sunday at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   After another slow start, the Sonics trailed 51-45 at halftime.
Westphal used eight players in the first half and got solid
production from most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics needed a balanced attack considering Payton played
his worst half this season. The team's leading scorer made good on
just 1 of his first 10 shots _ four of which were 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker, Jelani McCoy and Dale Ellis kept the Sonics from
falling behind by more than six points. Baker had 10 points and
McCoy connected on each of his three shots.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 25-24, Baker's three-point play capped an
8-0 run the Sonics used to start the second period. The Sonics
stormed in front 32-25 and then got into a shootout with the Kings.

 &HT;    BRUINS BEAT PENGUINS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 &HT;     By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bruins insist they don't care whom they face in the first
round of the playoffs. Good thing, because the potential opponent
keeps changing.
</P>
<P>
   When they woke up Thursday morning, they were slotted to face
the New Jersey Devils in a No. 1 vs. No. 8 matchup.
</P>
<P>
   As of this morning, on the strength of a convincing 4-2 victory
over Pittsburgh at the FleetCenter Thursday night, the Bruins
vaulted over both the Penguins and Buffalo Sabres into sixth place
and were looking at No. 3 seed Carolina as their possible foe next
week.
</P>
<P>
   With two games remaining _ Saturday against the Sabres and
Sunday against the Flyers in Philadelphia _ it's likely to be
scrambled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to the dance, we just don't have a partner
yet,'' said coach Pat Burns, who has been the most vocal in telling
his players and the media that it matters not one whit who stands
in their way of first-round success. ``If you play well, you've got
a good chance to win the game. If you do that, good things are
going to happen. If you worry about the next two or three games
down the road and where you're going to finish, you forget about
how you're supposed to play. I thought this was playoff hockey
Thursday night and we played it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   If Thursday night was any indication, the Bruins (9-2-3 in their
last 14 games) are prepared to give anyone a run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the first period got off to a very slow start, due
in large part to both teams being off since last weekend. The
Bruins struck first midway through as a result of their power play.
Hal Gill, who always seems to rise to the occasion against Penguins
star Jaromir Jagr, helped set up his team's first score when he
drew a penalty on Jagr for hooking.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Van Impe started the play with a shot from the right
point that goalie Tom Barrasso gloved. The puck popped out to Jason
Allison in the slot. Allison, who had one goal and two assists,
shoveled a short pass to Joe Thornton, who was positioned low in
the right circle. Thornton popped it over the downed goalie and the
Bruins were ahead, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Just over five minutes later, the Bruins made it a two-goal lead
on Allison's 23d tally. He beat defenseman Kevin Hatcher in the
right corner and took advantage of a pick set by teammate Anson
Carter on center Brian Bonin. Carter got position on Bonin, Allison
skated past and went right to left around the net and out front,
where he fired in a shot that sailed past Barrasso for the 2-0
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins pulled to within 2-1 at 1:49 of the second. With
Pittsburgh on the power play, Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque tried
to clear the puck out of the zone. His clearing attempt ended up
right on the stick of center Alexei Kovalev, who teed up a slapper
from the point that blistered past netminder Byron Dafoe. It was
Kovalev's 22d goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh came looking for more midway through the period,
during which the dangerous Jagr, a runaway for the Art Ross trophy
as the league's top scorer, skated around and around the Boston
net, doing everything but scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Jagr's shift, the Bruins made it 3-1 when Carter
fired home a slapper from the right circle at 9:08. Carter's goal,
his 23d of the year and first of two in the game, was unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins came oh-so-close to tying it at 14:25 when they had
a goal disallowed. Right wing Alexei Morozov, positioned to Dafoe's
left, dished a feed through the crease for Kovalev, who was
charging the net. Kovalev arrived, though, a nanosecond too soon
and was ruled in the crease prior to the puck, nullifying the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr broke through, making it 3-2 with 1:27 left with his 41st
of the year. In the season series, which finished with the Bruins
earning a 2-1-1 record against Pittsburgh, Jagr was limited to two
goals _ his only points.
</P>
<P>
   Carter closed it out with an empty-netter with 49.8 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the Bruins end up after the regular season, no one
seems concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a matter of us playing at our highest level and
not worrying about the opponent,'' said Dafoe, who picked up his
31st win. ``We've picked our road game up so much. To be honest,
the pressure's off you when you start on the road in the playoffs.
All you have to do is win one game there. It's the other team
that's expected to win both games. It will be a good situation for
us.''

 &HT;    BRUINS' 1-2 PUNCH KEY TO SUCCESS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
 &HT;    By Kevin Paul Dupont  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Hockey here in the Hub hasn't been exactly the clearing house of
unbridled optimism the past few years. You noticed? It hasn't been
Antoine Walker bad, but there hasn't been the glow and excitement
around the game that we grew so accustomed to in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's almost playoff time, and what's playing out on Causeway
Street is the best brand of Bruins hockey since they moved into the
Vault almost four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing well,'' said Jason Allison, after Thursday
night's 4-2 win over the Penguins, Boston's sixth triumph in the
last seven games. ``But I still don't think we're on top of our
game yet. It might be good to have that room to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs will come down to many things: Byron Dafoe's
netminding; referee's calls (where they register, either ridiculous
or sublime), penalty killing, five-on-five play, the man-advantage
. . . all the subsets that get reviewed and dissected as the
postseason unfolds and once it is finished.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to Boston's success or failure will be rooted in its
first- and second-line offense. For the first time since leaving
the Garden behind, they'll actually have a first- and second-line
attack. They have two lines that can go out and present a viable
threat, make something happen with the puck, and that's whether the
opponent is Ottawa, New Jersey, or Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in the playoffs, we had only one line going,'' said
Allison, who centered that line with Sergei Samsonov and Dmitri
Khristich. ``This time that's not going to happen. We have two
lines going. So it's not going to be like last year, especially
with Joe (Thornton) on top of his game like lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton most often now has Allison's former No. 1 wingers as
his running mates. Allison plays the pivot with Steve Heinze and
Anson Carter, the latter of whom has become the hottest contributor
in a Black-and-Gold uniform the past 2-3 weeks. Carter potted a
pair of goals Thursday night and added an assist, improving his run
to 8-3_11 over his last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anson has proven that how good he wants to be is all up to
him,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``I've asked him in practice, `How
good do you want to be? . . . because it's all up to you.' It
depends on how you are going to come to work everyday. He's
bettered himself in practice. He's big. He's strong. He's a great
skater. And he knows the game. I put him on the ice, no matter what
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's last goal came with the Penguins pressing in Boston's
end, hoping to tie, goaltender Tom Barrasso pulled for the extra
skater. Carter burst out of Boston's end with the puck and
punctuated his night's performance with an open-net stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be a bonafide power forward in this league,'' said
Allison, who played with Carter briefly in Washington and came here
with him when the Bruins gave up on their old guys, Adam Oates,
Rick Tocchet, and Bill Ranford. ``He's got the size, the speed, the
strength. It's like any of us . . . Joe, me, Sergei (Samsonov) . .
. it's a matter of time for a lot of guys. This is AC's second full
year, playing regular, and he's developing that consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins captain Ray Bourque says Carter can be a ``scary
player.'' He likes his skating, his speed, his attack to the net.
</P>
<P>
   This is a rebuilding program that finally has come to blossom.
Will two lines carry the Bruins to the Cup finals for the first
time since 1990? No one knows. If they can make it out of the first
round, that alone will be heady stuff, considering that only 24
months ago they finished dead last with a dead-last product.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins aren't what they were in the early '90s (Mario
Lemieux's retirement and a trip to bankruptcy court can be, well,
limiting), but they certainly represent a fair measuring stick for
what the Bruins could face against Ottawa or Carolina _ two of
their prospective first-round opponents. The murmuring around the
locker room is that New Jersey could be Boston's toughest foe, but
the consistency and the enthusiasm in the Boston room the last
couple of weeks doesn't make the Devils look like those late-'70s
Canadiens. New Jersey is good, but beatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of teams are wondering about us right now,''
said Dafoe. ``The last 20 games, we've been one of the better teams
in hockey. There's a lot of confidence. I've won five in a row, and
I expect to win every time I go out there. And it's not just me _
it's everyone in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   They're back. They're viable. They're not big scorers, but
they're respectable, and they can button down in the back end as
well as anyone. The Hockey Hub has a pulse again, finally.

DODGERS BEAT JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Three hours before Arizona left-hander Randy Johnson
was supposed to dominate Los Angeles' lineup, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson mused about how such a matchup could be good for Darren
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a pitching exhibition _ and not for the guy you'd
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, in his second season as a starter, allowed two hits in
seven innings as the Dodgers avoided a four-game sweep with an 8-1
shelling of Johnson and the Diamondbacks on Thursday at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave up as many home runs as Dreifort did hits. Gary
Sheffield and Mark Grudzielanek each hit two-run homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is one heck of a pitcher, but Darren Dreifort is one
heck of a pitcher, too,'' Johnson said. ``He just needs experience
on the hill. Against a hot-swinging team, he just shut them down.
It was a very dominating performance right when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ended a losing streak at three games and won for the
first time on the road. It's also the first time in seven games
against the Diamondbacks that the Dodgers didn't yield a homer. And
the Dodgers finally had an answer to a Diamondbacks offense that
scored 25 runs on 42 hits in the first three games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) was overpowering them,'' Dodgers catcher Paul
LoDuca said. ``I was talking in the pen and I said, `I'll sit right
down the middle and let you hit it.' When he's throwing like that,
it's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bugaboo in Dreifort's four-walk, five-strikeout outing
was some control problems in the fourth, after Sheffield's homer
gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's only flirtation with catastrophe came when Luis
Gonzalez smacked an RBI triple and Dreifort walked the next two
batters. But Steve Finley grounded into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller's fifth-inning single was the
Diamondbacks' other hit. Dreifort (2-0) retired the last eight
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (facing Johnson) pumped him up a little bit,'' LoDuca
said. ``Sometimes he has a tendency to space out and throw some
balls, but that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' battery was in such sync that Dreifort didn't shake
LoDuca off once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to think, just grab the ball and throw it,''
Dreifort said. ``He knew what was working for me and what wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   What was working was Dreifort's fastball and slider. It kept the
Diamondbacks off balance and guessing so much that he needed to
throw only one changeup.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of reveling in one of his finest outings since
joining the starting rotation _ he threw a six-hit shutout at the
BOB last season _ Dreifort talked about the defense behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young was at the forefront. Not only did he
triple in the fifth inning as a precursor to Grudzielanek's homer,
but he made a pair of spectacular plays in the first two innings to
set a tone of tight defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, he snared Jay Bell's line drive while
diving to his right. An inning later, he took a hit away from Matt
Williams by ranging behind the second-base bag to field a grounder
and throwing to first.
</P>
<P>
   Young left the game after five innings with tightness in his
right calf. He said it's been bothering him for a few days and
he'll be re-evaluated today in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all defense,'' Dreifort said. ``Our guys played
outstanding defense all night long. Defense, unbelievable, and then
we score eight runs on top of that. Makes pitching easy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dreifort was dominating, Johnson, coming off a
15-strikeout complete game win against the Atlanta Braves, was
battling the Dodgers hitters and his control.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out six times in the first three innings, the
Dodgers' timing at the plate improved. Sheffield's and
Grudzielanek's homers gave them a 5-1 lead, and Johnson left after
a sixth inning in which Devon White had an RBI double and Adrian
Beltre added a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we saw Randy with his best stuff,'' said Young,
who shifted his attention to his pitcher. ``Dreifort was on top of
his game. He got key ground balls. When you have a ground-ball
pitcher like Dreifort, you have to make the plays for him. The odds
were against us, losing the first three games and going against
their ace.''

BLUES' POWER PLAY TOO MUCH FOR COYOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Was it a sign of impending doom? Whatever it was, it
was a perfect contrast of two teams going into the playoffs while
headed in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference, are going
in without Jeremy Roenick, their leading scorer, and are operating
with a dark cloud above their heads and on a five-game losing
streak after surrendering five third-period goals in a 6-4 loss to
the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues, on the other hand, have lost only one of six games in
April and captured the No. 5 playoff seed and a first-round date
with the Coyotes thanks to the comeback victory and Anaheim's 4-3
overtime loss to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get it turned around with a win,'' Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``We have one more game (Dallas at home on
Saturday) and if we don't get that one, we'll win the first playoff
game and everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Blues defenseman Al MacInnis didn't disagree, saying,
``They've known where they're going to finish for quite sometime
and it's tough to get motivated when there's really not a lot to
play for.''
</P>
<P>
   With Roenick in a local hospital after undergoing a 5{-hour
surgical procedure to repair a jaw broken in three places on
Wednesday night at Dallas, Keith Tkachuk produced two goals, Rick
Tocchet one and Shane Doan a late goal, but it wasn't nearly enough
to offset the Blues third-period explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're upset at losing JR, but you have to put it in the
back of your mind,'' Tocchet said. ``We've got guys who don't play
as much who are going to have to play more and fill the role up the
middle. We can't sit around here everyday and say, `We wish we had
JR.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better chance at winning the Stanley Cup with JR,
but right now we have to figure a way to beat the St. Louis Blues
and we have enough guys to do it, but we have to get more
disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   As in eliminating the dumb penalties.
</P>
<P>
   As for filling the role up the middle, Schoenfeld experimented a
bit by playing Tkachuk at center with Greg Adams and Dallas Drake
on the wings.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those rare games when the term ``power play''
actually meant something. The Coyotes, who scored two power play
goals for the first time in 52 games after scoring only five on
their previous 45 chances, and especially for the Blues, who scored
four.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis took a 4-2 lead with almost 8:57 left on Scott Young's
second goal, and neither team had scored an even-strength goal. The
Blues capped off a four minute and four second span in which they
capitalized on three straight power play opportunities to make a
2-1 Coyotes' lead provided by power play goals from Tkachuk and
Tocchet a fleeting a memory.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that the Blues fourth-ranked power play
was unimpressed with the Coyotes' third-ranked penalty killing
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to kill basically for the whole third period,'' Tocchet
said. ``Robert Reichel, myself, Dallas Drake were all sitting, so
you can't get an offensive thrust going and they get four power
play goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to play hard. We played hard (Wednesday) in
Dallas and we battled to the end tonight. Their special teams
outplayed our special teams today. I'd rather lose now than in
another week.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden demise started when Coyotes defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky was hit with a double minor for high sticking St. Louis'
Michel Picard at 6:42 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' Geoff Courtnall knocked home the tying goal past
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 93 seconds more for the Blues' Young score on a
slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes defenseman Keith Carney picked up a penalty on the play,
and Al MacInnis, who possesses the NHL's hardest slap shot, scored
his 21st, tops among NHL defensemen.

WE HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH OUR DEMONS EVERY DAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the mysteries of our civic life is how our most prominent
public sinner, Bill Clinton, is able to diagnose the human
condition with such consistent accuracy. Maybe it's because he's
had to confront his own iniquities so publicly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent example of his insight is found in remarks he made
earlier this month when he asked Congress to extend federal hate
crimes legislation to cover gays and lesbians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The old, haunting demons,'' he said, ``are hard to root out of
the human spirit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter what good people do _ and sometimes that good is
simply breathtaking _ the reality is that they also are
persistently infected by evil, by bad motives. They are, thus,
capable of cruelty, malevolence, savagery. Why else would we even
need hate crimes legislation? Why else would we need jails or
armies or police or, for that matter, any laws at all? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is not a new phenomenon, unique to our bloody
century of Holocaust and surgical airstrikes that produce
``collateral damage,'' the kinder, gentler name we now use for dead
people. Rather, this condition is as old as holy writ. The King
James Version of Jeremiah 17:9 shouts this truth through the long
corridors of sad human history: ``The heart is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This recognition of human failings caused some of the 16th
century theological reformers to adopt what is known as the
Doctrine of the Total Depravity of Humankind. Despite its overblown
name, it does not say there is no good in us or that we are
incapable of good deeds. But it does acknowledge what Bill Clinton
was conceding recently: We all sin and fall short not only of God's
mark for us but also of our best mark for ourselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ who in his post-impeachment life can't say these
things without them seeming to drip with accusatory irony _ put it
this way: ``We should remember that each of us. . .wakes up every
day with the scales of light and the scales of darkness in our own
hearts, and we've got to keep them in proper balance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crucial insight in his words is that, this side of heaven,
we cannot rid ourselves of the darkness in our hearts. Rather, we
must wrestle with those demons every day, trying our best to keep
them from lashing out and injuring ourselves and others. And we
must take responsibility and try to make amends when, in our
weakness, we give in to their destructive urgings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, we continue dreaming of perfection. History is
full of efforts to create utopia, some golden age of righteousness
in which our all motives are pure, all our acts benevolent, all our
problems solved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, our idealistic nation is dotted with failed utopias _
from the Ephrata Community in Pennsylvania to New Harmony in
Indiana, from Brook Farm in Massachusetts to the Oneida Community
in Vermont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what the utopian enthusiasts behind these naive efforts
either forgot or never knew is that when Sir Thomas More first used
the word utopia in the early 1500s, its roots were Greek _
(ital)ou(end-ital) for ``not'' and (ital)topos(end-ital) for
``place.'' So utopia, literally, meant nowhere. And even today that
is where we'll find utopia _ nowhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this are sobering. It means we are,
individually and collectively, called on to remember our weaknesses
and vulnerabilities and to support each other's efforts to suppress
the evil within us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stained human condition requires vigilance against the
twisted inclinations our pestilent hearts. And this, sad to say, is
a lifelong task. &QL;
</P>

 &HT;    Cities must develop 20-year plan by 2001
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA _ Some political leaders here look 100 miles to the
south and see a paradise called Atlanta, a land of silk and money
where jobs fall from trees like ripened fruit and the sun never
sets on opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these politicians will tell you, they know about metro
Atlanta's traffic gridlock and dirty air and out-of-control sprawl.
But they think they can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have that problem,'' said Hamilton County
Commissioner Harold Coker. ``Twenty-five percent of the growth in
the Southeast in the next 10 years will be in Atlanta. Give us that
25 percent growth. We'll handle the roads and traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Tennessee Legislature, determined not to replicate the
problems plaguing Atlanta and other urban sprawl areas, is not so
sure that local leaders can handle growth without some strict
guidelines. That's why last year the legislature passed the Urban
Growth Policy Act, mandating that each county and city in Tennessee
develop a 20-year plan for orderly growth. Failure to do so by July
1, 2001, could result in the loss of state grants and loans for
highways, community development and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who's talking, the Tennessee law is either one of
the most progressive or one of the most restrictive in the nation.
Some people will say it's both.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chattanooga area, a builders' group bought radio ads in
January warning of jeopardy to ``the American dream of
homeownership.'' At the same time, a group of developers,
manufacturers, mortgage bankers and insurers disseminated a
four-page letter questioning whether the new plan would be so
restrictive it would stifle growth, drive up housing prices and
scare away employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of fear about taking this kind of step,''
said Ann Coulter, executive director of the Regional Planning
Agency, which handles planning for Hamilton County and all but one
of its 10 cities. ``Any change is fearful. We've never done this
kind of planning before, and that's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Tennessee plan dictates that each county and
the cities within that county must agree on urban growth boundaries
to guide development for the next 20 years. Each plan must detail
how compact and contiguous high-density development will be
handled. The Tennessee law says communities must protect
agricultural, forest, recreation and wildlife areas.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, counties and cities must agree on how to make their
growth plans work together, offering a unified master blueprint to
the state. In Hamilton County, that means that Chattanooga and nine
other municipalities must agree with county officials on the master
plan.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-member county Coordinating Committee started work in August
1998 to work out details of the plan. The panel expects to issue a
preliminary report by the end of May, said Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   After that, each of the local governments must hold two public
hearings before submitting proposed boundaries back to the
coordinating committee, which will then have three months to work
out differences. According to that ambitious timetable, the
comprehensive plan would be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But obstacles already are cropping up. Earlier this month, some
county commissioners said they want to take responsibility for the
growth plan away from the coordinating committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's quite a lot of upheaval about the fact that a
non-elected group is going to manage the land use,'' County
Commissioner Coker said. Coker also sees the growth plan helping to
develop Chattanooga at the expense of Hamilton County. Part of that
suspicion is based on the $355 million that Chattanooga has spent
on downtown redevelopment in the past 10 years, achieving notable
success with such ventures as the $45 million Tennessee Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Coker says Chattanooga Mayor Jon Kinsey is ``attempting to keep
everything downtown.'' ``That's not the case,'' Kinsey replied.
``We want growth in this area, in this region.'' That growth must
be planned, said Kinsey, a former developer, to provide for
infrastructure and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   This county vs. city conflict is not new, nor solely the result
of the growth plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had some of that, and I regret that,'' Coker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, the regional planning head, downplays any territorial
squabbles among the elected officials on the coordinating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dedicated to their own jurisdictions, but I've seen a
tremendous amount of realization on their part that we're all in
this together,'' she said. ``They're doing a good job of keeping
their eyes on the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton County Executive Claude Ramsey says he supports both
growth and the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue to see housing developed in unincorporated
parts of the county as well as incorporated parts of the county,''
he said. ``We're looking at orderly transition. I'm all for putting
in sewers and roads.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ramsey said, he wants to be able to protect
the rights of private property owners, particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A farmer should have the right to operate his farm that's been
there. Government shouldn't take that away from him,'' Ramsey said.
``And a farmer should have the right to sell his property. For a
lot of farmers, that's their retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter also wants to reassure property owners' concerns that
they will lose control over their land, particularly if they want
to sell or develop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already make decisions locally on a daily basis that affect
private property values,'' she said. ``This legislation does
nothing that is not already affected.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the growth plan as a tool to catalyze growth rather
than inhibit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to believe this will create opportunity,'' Coulter
said. ``We can use good information to pinpoint places where growth
makes the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she and most others working on the plan realize
they have much difficult work ahead, particularly getting all the
competing economic and political interests to agree on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not until then will anyone be able to judge the new law, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell how good it is,'' Coulter said. ``How we
approach it and implement it will determine how good a law it is.''
</P>
<P>
   quote: ``Twenty-five percent of the growth in the Southeast in
the next 10 years will be in Atlanta. Give us that 25 percent
growth. We'll handle the roads and traffic.''

 &HT;    '99 Southern Economic Survey: Progress and problems to be dealt
with
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta, the South's party animal of growth, has met
its morning after.
</P>
<P>
   But upon looking around, it appears plenty of others who enjoyed
the good times are wondering if maybe they haven't had a little too
much themselves. Once a languishing region, the South and its
cities are spreading faster than lard on a hot skillet.
</P>
<P>
   The region claimed nearly half of the nation's 50
fastest-growing metro areas this decade. And the Southeast holds
five of the 10 states that grew fastest last year.
</P>
<P>
   Growth overload _ for years a point of controversy in mostly
only the biggest metro areas _ has filtered down to midsize and
even small cities throughout the United States. The South is in the
thick of it. We said ``Y'all come,'' and people did. And did. And
did. And did.
</P>
<P>
   City and suburban dimensions have exploded. Development
regulations and miles of new roads and sewers have made it easier
and cheaper _ for both home buyers and developers _ to go farther
out than to stay within urban areas. And people like what they get
farther out. What wonderful appeal: a fresh start, good schools,
less crime, big houses, big yards, new stores. Less hustle and
bustle, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   But growth has gotten less comfortable. And a lot more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't simply there are more people than ever before
in the South. It's that the region and much of the rest of the
nation stumbled in planning ahead. It didn't build enough schools,
roads, sewers or public transportation to accommodate the
newcomers. And the job of providing all that stuff got harder and
more costly the farther out and more spread out people went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was just grand to keep growing and
growing,'' said John DeGrove, a growth management scholar at
Florida Atlantic University in Fort Lauderdale. ``All of a sudden,
it ain't so grand any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just that we suddenly decided to care about it,''
DeGrove says. ``There were some very serious problems 20 years ago,
but we have grown substantially since then.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGrove cites suburban sprawl: monolithic development, almost
entirely dependent on the car, hopscotching toward the horizon. ``I
call it `sluburbia,'' he said. And he concludes that even though
people continue to rush to distant suburbs, Americans are
recognizing that kind of development carries high environmental,
social and economic costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh-Durham, big high-tech firms worry that increasing
traffic will limit their ability to expand because it will be
harder to find talented workers willing to move to the area. In
metro Atlanta, nearly every chamber of commerce backed creation of
a powerful state authority to force growth changes to ease the
area's air pollution problems and bring back federal road dollars.
In Austin, Texas _ a metro area a third the size of metro Atlanta _
officials face the certainty that soon the city will have dirtied
its air so much that it will fall out of compliance with federal
clean air laws.
</P>
<P>
   From Oxford, Miss., to Charlotte to Virginia's northern suburbs,
communities are struggling with the challenges of sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   In some metro areas, home buyers and developers have begun to
return to inner cities, though generally in far smaller numbers
than those continuing the suburban march. And in many communities,
tidbits of former development trends have returned as alternatives
to sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``smart growth'' by supporters, the idea calls for
compact, well-designed development, with mixtures of homes, stores
and workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The projects are supposed to reduce dependence on driving a
motor vehicle alone and maximize people's ability to walk, bike,
and ride buses or light rail.
</P>
<P>
   For all the South's population bonanza, some cities and rural
areas have had little growth, or even population losses.
Communities like Leesville, La., worry about how to draw the
economic boom that others in the South have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, the South's economy and population have grown
faster than the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawing people in from the rest of the country is a really big
deal for the continued economic growth of the South,'' says Tom
Cunningham, a senior economist at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Newcomers fill new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But both he and DeGrove say it's clear the region has to tackle
sprawl's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more than ever before,'' DeGrove says, ``you find people
say we've gone too far.''

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A young girl gets her pony
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Georgia Morgan
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl, I was crazy about horses. I begged my folks for
one. There was a slight problem, though.
</P>
<P>
   We lived in the city. No space for a horse, and probably against
zoning laws, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Too young to understand, I refused to accept that excuse. I saw
no reason why a horse couldn't be kept in our garage at the back
alley.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes on Sunday afternoons, our family piled into the car
for a drive through the country, where I pointed out every horse
along the way, determined that my parents wouldn't forget my wish.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever we went to a fair or amusement park, I headed first for
the pony rides.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I was given extra rides free because I was a good
little rider, or perhaps the owner of the ponies thought it might
draw a crowd to see a little girl having such a good time and
handling the pony so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Round and round, the pony and I went in the little ring, both of
us bouncing fast all the way.
</P>
<P>
   If no pony rides were available, I settled for second choice,
the merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the ride stopped for my turn, I had scrutinized
every horse and chosen one that had the characteristics I wanted:
arched neck, flowing mane and black.
</P>
<P>
   I was very upset if someone else grabbed that horse first.
</P>
<P>
   The best times came in summer when I spent a couple of weeks at
my grandparents' farm. What a wonderful change from the confining
city!
</P>
<P>
   Roaming over the land, exploring everything, gave me an
exhilarating feeling of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The barn was a favorite place to play, so huge and seemingly
mysterious to a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the ladder to the loft, I jumped into the fragrant hay.
After a few jumps, I was covered with scratchy hay, all through my
hair and even inside my clothes.
</P>
<P>
   On the farm were lots of animals: milk cows, pigs, sheep,
chickens _ but best of all, two huge work horses: Dick, a dark
horse, and Lindy, a gray.
</P>
<P>
   When my grandparents had some extra time, which wasn't often
because they worked hard from sunup to sundown, Lindy would be led
from her stall and I would be hoisted up to ride bareback around
the barnyard.
</P>
<P>
   I perched precariously on top of her broad back, pressing my
legs as tightly as I could along her big, round sides.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy was in no hurry, so we plodded along, her huge hooves
marking circles in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Those vacation days sped by quickly, and too soon I was back in
the city, back to begging my parents for a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when I was about 10 years old, my parents bought a
house in the country with 10 acres and plenty of pasture for a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   They had no excuses left, so the search for a horse began.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy located an old horse trainer who from time to time
acquired horses and trained them for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In his pasture lot was a beautiful, sleek black stallion with a
white blaze down the front of his head.
</P>
<P>
   After mounting him, I realized he was a lot of horse to handle,
but I hoped more training would settle him down.
</P>
<P>
   Off to one side, Daddy and the trainer had a discussion and the
deal was set _ or so we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Later we found that the trainer had sold the horse to someone
else for a better price.
</P>
<P>
   I was crushed and Daddy was angry, and he let the trainer know
it. To make amends, he gave us a good price on a lovely black and
spotted filly, nicely trained for riding and ready to come home
with me.
</P>
<P>
   What a thrill to be saddling up my very own horse and taking off
down the country road, the filly happily tossing her head and
occasionally snorting or neighing at some other horse in a nearby
pasture.
</P>
<P>
   The feel of her strong body moving under me and responding to my
every command was exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I found first an old buggy and light driving harness
and then a beautiful red sleigh with bells on the shaves in
neighboring farmers' barns and I trained my horse to pull them.
</P>
<P>
   What a wonderful horse I had! She and I learned to accommodate,
trust and respect each other, and we always remained friends.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Only months ago, doom-meisters were having a field day
with Latin America after reverberations from Asia's financial
crisis appeared to be swamping the region.
</P>
<P>
   There were bloated deficits, collapsed currencies, and weaker
earnings by U.S. multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola Co.'s sales in Latin America, which shot up 19
percent in the first quarter of 1998, fell 4 percent to 5 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But now analysts are re-thinking their gloomy predictions for
the region's still-fragile -- but recovering -- economies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Latin America's future remains a shaky one as the
region's largest economy, Brazil, continues to wrestle with the
after-effects of a crisis spurred by last year's financial chaos in
both Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst could be over, and many countries are expected to
show signs of a rebound during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is much more upbeat now, and Brazil's recovery has
played a major role in this new optimism,'' said William Cline,
deputy managing director of the Institute of International Finance,
a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents international
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans still expect to see negative growth this year.
Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela all are bracing for recession.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the region's economy is expected to shrink by 1 to 1.5
percent this year, following growth of 2.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Cline said the economic panic that took Brazil by storm in
mid-January when the currency fell 46 percent has abated.
</P>
<P>
   Even moreso, Brazil's stock markets have surged. Interest rates
have been lowered to 34 percent. And the country's currency, the
real, has strengthened, regaining about 15 percent of its value in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute much of the economic turnaround to the new
president of Brazil's Central Bank, Arminio Fraga, a former fund
manager for Wall Street financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga brings enormous credibility to the table and a coherent
approach to addressing the fiscal deficit, and he's moved very
swiftly to deal with the country's problems,'' said Lawrence
Goodman, managing director of Global Economic Associates, a New
York-based economic advisory firm.
</P>
<P>
   He said inflation could fall to as lows as 10 percent by year's
end, and that interest rates could drop to lower than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is so upbeat about
Brazil's economy that in late March it approved the second
installment of a $41.5 billion rescue package, providing Brazil
with more much-needed reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government's next big priority is passing a fiscal
responsibility law that will be the linchpin of plans to get a
whopping public deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would permit the government to impose rigid limits
on all areas of spending, including on state governors and city
mayors, and establish stiff penalties and fines for those who
exceed their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the brighter picture in Brazil, economic turmoil has
yet to be averted in other parts of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, for example, is an economic basket case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government decided to float the currency earlier this
year, the sucre, it has fallen drastically.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year it's expected to lose 60 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the Andean nation's national debt of $16
billion is totally disproportionate to its annual budget of $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its troubles can be traced to El Nino, which caused $2.6
billion in flood damage last year, as well as to falling world
prices for oil, the country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador hopes to negotiate a deal with the IMF and other world
lenders that could provide the country with as much as $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking with authorities in Ecuador for quite some
time now,'' said the IMF's Francisco Baker, who refused to indicate
whether a deal was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ecuador, other countries such as Argentina, Brazil's
major trading partner, have been dragged into recession by Brazil's
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of Argentina's exports go to Brazil. But these
exports are expected to fall by at least a third this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a recovery in the flow of capital to Argentina,
but we still believe Argentina will experience a recession this
year,'' said Felipe Frydman, economic minister at Argentina's
embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off a deepening crisis, Argentina's President Carlos
Menem stunned U.S. officials by recently proposing that Argentina
abolish its national currency, the peso, and replace it with the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   That means salaries, car payments, store purchases, and other
financial transactions would be denominated in the American
greenback.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the currencies trade on a 1-to-1 parity, and many
financial transactions already are made with dollars instead of
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has urged Argentina's government to
move cautiously, and only in consultation with U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the hobbling of economic growth in Argentina
and other countries, the dreaded economic meltdown has failed to
materialize in much of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, has demonstrated a better-than-expected
ability to weather the crisis. About 75 percent of that country's
trade is with the United States so as long as the U.S. economy
shows growth, so will Mexico's.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn against overall complacency.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that the worst part of the region's crisis may be
over, but that doesn't mean developing countries will be wildly
healthy any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank reported earlier this month that it expects
average growth rates in developing countries to fall to just 1.5
percent in 1999, the lowest growth rate since 1982, before
ratcheting back up in 2000 to 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's still below the average rate of 4.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Latin countries could suffer if the U.S. economy
stops being so robust, or if the high-flying U.S. stock market
finally stops defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a quick return to the heyday of the mid-1990s
is relatively slim,'' Goodman said. ``But things are sure better
than they were, and we are starting to see a recovery.''

WOMEN, HOUSE CLEANING AND GUILT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday April 22)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is common male resistance to asking a stranger for
directions, the female version is asking a stranger to clean her
house.
</P>
<P>
   The guilt. You can't clean that little house yourself? You have
money to spare, you should give it to the poor. Or save it for your
old age.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a frugal streak? Is it fear of appearing pretentious? Or
is it even sicker, like I want the world to think I can do it all,
including wax my own floors?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. I am one generation removed from smiling women in soap
ads wearing shirtdresses and rubber gloves and while there might be
a descendant some day who will find satisfaction in clean cupboards
it will not be my legacy.
</P>
<P>
   I love the house and I love creating the mess and I understand
the need for order and sanitary conditions, but I don't want to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   So, this spring, or any season thereafter, I will not be doing
my own spring cleaning (like she ever knew the concept, some might
observe) but have acquired the services of a professional.
</P>
<P>
   My house deserves this. The people whom I invite to use my
bathtub deserve this.
</P>
<P>
   A friend absolved me by saying that she gives herself two
things, no matter the cost, to ensure her safety and happiness - a
car that runs and a clean house. That got me thinking. We don't
even try to do our own 80,000 mile overhaul, why should we clean
the house?
</P>
<P>
   In the same way I don't cut my own hair or give myself a
massage, fix my own computer or haul my own garbage to the dump.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be an embarrassing luxury. Some people pay as
much for a bottle of wine as I pay for a clean house.
</P>
<P>
   So, I drive off to the office, not trying to imagine her looking
around and thinking, ``My god, they live like pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of it. We think everyone but us is working
undercover for public health. We suspect we've got more mold and
fuzz than anyone else even though we bathe every day and change our
sheets once a week. Anyone who's been to a garage sale knows that
most kitchens produce the same cookie pans encrusted with black
gunk. My plumber says what lives under our sink is no more shocking
than others he's seen. And I'm told the spider webs that hang in
sticky loops and regenerate nightly are found in some of the best
homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are spotless houses, where you want to show up
unexpectedly just to see where they normally stack their New
Yorkers. The houses where you leave, asking each other, ``Where do
they keep the dog hair?''
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that there are intensely clean people, the
average person is kind of a slob. But a well-meaning slob. We might
try but we can't possibly hold to the standards of a trained
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen what this woman can do in a few focused hours. She's a
marvel. She has sandblasted the shower walls cleaner than they were
before we bought the house. The tea kettle gleams as much as the
windows. I've always said that if you keep the lamps low, light
candles and put flowers around no one will notice the wine stain
under the coffee table, but I'm so relieved that she is taking us
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those issues that came up in the earlier days of
feminism. We were not going to let a clean house be the measure of
a woman. We had careers to manage, children to nurture, more
essential ways to prove ourselves than whether the guests could see
their reflection in the dining room table. Worrying over the house
didn't fit our new freewheeling image. We would be known for our
wit, not our stain-free stovetops.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we asked, if someone really appreciated the real you,
would they even notice your clutter?
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the answer was yes, and to them you can say,
``You're right. We're hiring someone.''

CHILDREN AND ROTOVIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday April 22)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have one wish for all families of small children this spring,
when nature's using every crayon in the box for red cardinals
streaking across treetops and yellow buds popping up on fresh-cut
green lawns and blue cloudless skies.
</P>
<P>
   And that wish is ... may rotavirus never descend upon your
family as it has ours.
</P>
<P>
   There it is in my ``Portable Pediatrician,'' a small, seemingly
innocuous entry: ``This is the most common cause of wintertime
diarrhea in young children in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Also called ``the daycare virus,'' it targets the small
intestine and usually lasts from three to eight days. Some children
are quite ill and run a fever. Other children, and most adults who
become reinfected with the virus, have no symptoms at all.
</P>
<P>
   You never realize how long eight days can be. Or how lucky those
``other children, and most adults'' are to be asymptomatic to the
plague that is rotavirus.
</P>
<P>
   Spring break started on a high note. We had an Easter egg hunt,
ate the lion's share of the chocolate, stuffed swimsuits, shorts
and sandals into suitcases, packed up the minivan and set off from
Atlanta to Florida for a week of Adventure Island and Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   We got as far as Macon before my 2-year-old threw up all over
the van, and her brother.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at a motel, since my early, optimistic interpretation
was this: Too much Easter candy, resume trip tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   By 6:30 a.m., however, we were headed back to our house, armed
with Gatorade and soda crackers.
</P>
<P>
   By the next day, we were at the doctor's office (not to be
confused with Disney World) and he was nodding sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's lost two pounds, which is 5 percent of her body weight.
If it goes up to 10 percent, we're looking at getting her to an
emergency room to start on an IV. We'll know in the next day or
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah laid her head listlessly on my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doctor can treat rotavirus,'' he said, patting her back.
``We can just offer support to the parents, and hope dehydration
doesn't set in.'' He said it was one of the most contagious of all
viruses, and can live outside the body for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, Sarah's illness followed its insidious
course, with false improvements and rapid relapses. Luckily, my
8-year-old was outside the target age. (``By 4, most persons have
been infected with the rotavirus and acquire long-term immunity.'')
</P>
<P>
   So while dad stayed with Sarah for an afternoon, Adam invited a
friend to come to Stone Mountain with us.
</P>
<P>
   After the ferry ride, we had cherry icees. Adam had two sips
before announcing, ``I think I'm seasick.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   From the rotavirus fact sheet: ``The incubation period is
usually two days. One-third of children infected with the virus
will become ill. Improvements in sanitation and hygiene do not seem
to affect the spread.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, another eight days began.
</P>
<P>
   To all of the 3.5 million families a year who have experienced
the dreaded rotavirus, my sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart: several Internet entries list rotavirus under
``new up and coming vaccinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's to cheerier springs ahead.

   ABORTION (Albany, N.Y.) _ Days before one of the largest
national anti-abortion protests of the year begins on Sunday, a
federal judge here has ruled that buffer zones around reproductive
services clinics in western New York should be expanded, holding
back potentially hostile demonstrators by up to 60 feet. By LARA
JAKES.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE (San Francisco) _ With a serendipitous combination of
mild weather and a tradition of spurning tradition, the San
Francisco Bay area has given rise to inventions and discoveries
that have shaken the world _ sometimes literally. Accomplishments
of the last 99 years have allowed humanity to transcend time, space
and conventional human limits in once-unimagined ways. By KEAY
DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   PRESS-KOSOVO (San Francisco) _ President Clinton noted in a
speech to newspaper editors here the ``stark contrast between a
free society with a free press and a closed society where the press
is used to manipulate people by suppressing or distorting the
truth.'' But while U.S. journalists are not being found shot dead,
some of America's most prominent opinion-makers are accusing the
Pentagon of kidnapping the facts on the war in Kosovo. By ROBERT
SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   OLMOS-EDITORS (San Francisco) _ Edward James Olmos, the
52-year-old actor, producer and community activist, took on yet
another challenge this week as he charmed, goaded and provoked the
country's newspaper editors meeting in San Francisco, urging them
to wake up and see the diversity that is changing the world around
them. By ANNIE NAKAO.
</P>
<P>
   1906-QUAKE-RECALLED (San Francisco) _ Survivors of the April 18,
1906, earthquake might be the rarest people around San Francisco
and Ernest Latapie is the rarest of the rare: Not only was he alive
when the city collapsed and burned, but he remembers vividly the
horror of the moment. By MICHAEL DOUGAN.
</P>
<P>
   RADIOACTIVE-AMMO (San Francisco) _ Ask Dr. Michael Kilpatrick, a
top Pentagon doctor, about a new study that says radioactive
ammunition used during the Persian Gulf War isn't likely to cause
lung cancer or other health problems, and he says: ``It's very
reassuring.'' But an internationally known radiation expert
compared the new Pentagon-sponsored study with reports on nicotine
from the tobacco industry. By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.
</P>
<P>
   BENEFITS-IMMIGRANTS (San Francisco) _ California Gov. Gray
Davis' decision to ask a federal appeals court to mediate the legal
battle over Proposition 187, the voter-approved initiative limiting
benefits to illegal immigrants, has met with skepticism from all
sides, casting doubt on whether a settlement can be reached. By
JULIE CHAO.

</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-PAY (Albany, N.Y.) _ A lack of pay parity for women in the
workplace remains a societal problem, says Ida L. Castro, head of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When women are
underpaid, children and their husbands suffer economic hardship,
Castro says. By JO-ANN JOHNSTON.

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Reviews of the new Palm Pilot V and
Compaq Aero 2100 hand-held computers. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.

</P>
<P>
   WHEELED-BOOK-BAGS (Albany, N.Y.) _ In the old days, kids carried
their books to school by hand. Then came canvas sacks _ or for
nerdy students, briefcases. By the 1970s, students were toting
books in canvas military surplus bags. Since the 1980s, bright
nylon backpacks held sway. Now, the most fashion-forward students
are going mobile, using backpacks or small suitcases with wheels to
cart their books around. It's just starting, but the wheeled book
bag may be the next Big Thing for kids. By RICK KARLIN.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-TURNOFF (Albany, N.Y.) _ Every April brings the same thing:
the baseball season, taxes and children are urged to turn off their
television sets for a week. I have no problem with temporary
abstinence from TV. But turning it off completely denies children
and adults a window to the world. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   DC-TALK (Houston) _ dc Talk is all about making good God music.

ensconced in the Top 10 on Billboard's contemporary Christian music
chart. By RICHARD VARA.

<P>
   CELINE (Houston) _ Celine Dion is no ordinary diva. She proved
it before a Houston audience this week. By JOEY GUERRA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-MOONWALK (Undated) _ In case you miss the metaphor
crashing into your head like a block of concrete, ``A Walk on the
Moon'' is about discovery. It's set in the summer of '69, which
means we get Neil Armstrong's ``giant step for mankind'' along with
Woodstock revelers in various states of nudity. Astronautical
discovery, sexual discovery. Get it? By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-LIFE (Undated) _ ``Life'' has every reason to be
funny. It stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, two very amusing
guys. Its plot is a comic rehash of ``The Shawshank Redemption.''
And it has the absolute goodwill of the audience, who want it to be
a laff riot. And it is. Sometimes. A little bit. Off and on. By AMY
BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   DeBARTOLO (San Francisco) _ After months of silence and
inaction, San Francisco 49ers' co-owner Eddie DeBartolo has gone on
the offense, filing a $150 million federal lawsuit against his
estranged sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and vowing to regain
control of his beloved football team in less than a year. By SCOTT
WINOCUR.

</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ President Clinton, who redefined
the meaning of sex and the word ``is,'' now is degrading other
parts of the language, including the word ``degrade.'' The man who
dodged the draft has drafted ``degrade'' to replace ``destroy,''
which sounds too brutal in the modern American world of politically
correct warfare. By ROB MORSE.

around the church-state issue of posting the Ten Commandments in
courthouses and schools. (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for
Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ It is not with just mild interest when I note
that the high school art teacher for Kurt Cobain retained some of
his paintings and sketches. Cobain, of course, is the rocker who
became near-deified after his suicide. Not only did the teacher
have the foresight to know that Cobain would turn into a cult
personality (rockers who either commit suicide or die from drug
overdoses have that effect on young people) but he also thought he
could fetch a pretty good buck for the stuff through a Christie's
auction. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.)

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ A reader sent me an e-mail the
other day telling me that I had a ``hidden'' agenda. He was being
too kind, and I mean that sincerely. If only he knew the whole
truth it might make him shudder. No, for a fact, I once hid my
agenda but, like everything else, I forgot where I put the dang
thing. My agenda isn't hidden, it is lost. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the hazards of
extended international travel is jet lag. Symptoms are numbness
below the waist, swollen feet, difficulty in arm movements,
inability to focus eyes and a persistent dull headache. The good
news is that you eventually recover. (Jim Minter is a former editor

   SMALLTOWN-DOC _ ARLINGTON, Ga. _ Dr. Robert E. Jennings took
care of the folks in this one-redlight South Georgia town of
Arlington for 39 years, delivering their babies, sewing up their
chainsaw wounds and even treating the occasional snakebit dog. When
his patients needed help after 5 p.m., they'd call him up at home.
Or drop by. ``People didn't go to the emergency room,'' says his
daughter Felicia Alexander. ``They'd just knock on the back door.''
For years the tall, broad-shouldered physician and his family lived
in a yellow-brick ranch house across the street from the hospital,
so finding the doctor was easy. Finding a replacement won't be.
Jennings died last fall at age 65, leaving the 1,200 residents of
Arlington in shock. Now they're naming Main Street after him, in an
attempt to make sure he's never forgotten. (Emerson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS. For Sunday, April 18.

   JAZZFESTIVAL _ NEW ORLEANS _ ``When we first started,''
remembers Qunit Davis, director of the New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage
Festival, ``there were a lot of reasons people thought this thing
was a hopeless failure. They said, `You can't mix all these people
_ old people, young people, white people, black people, rich
people, poor people.' '' In 1970, the South had only been
integrated for a few years. Having black and white musicians play
for black and white audiences in the same location was still novel.
``But we had a theory,'' Davis said, ``that if you show people what
each other eats and what each other dances to, it'd be all right.
We were right, it works.'' (Konigsmark, Atlanta
Journal-Consitution). WITH PHOTO. For Sunday, April 18.

   SPOLETO-MAMBA _ NEW YORK _ Spoleto preview. Feature on ``Mamba's
Daughters,'' one of the major theater productions at Spoleto this
year. The play by DuBose Heyward (author of ``Porgy'') is set in
Gullah South Carolina and deals with the taboo subject of suicide
in the African-American community. Focusing on actress Heather
Gillespie; also talking to director David Herskovits about his
revival of a play that first opened in 1939 with Ethel Waters and
Alberta Hunter. The ravishingly beautiful, velvet-voiced Gilliespie
had barely arrived from her home in London before she picked up an
Obie Award and got a rave review in the New York Times. We take her
to dinner at the Southern restaurant Jezebel, then go to see
Matthew Bourne's ``Swan Lake'' on Broadway. Play, which is being
seen in Charleston for the first time, runs the entire fest, May
28-June 11. (Brock, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35. WITH PHOTO

 &HT;    At long last I'm revealing my hidden agenda
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ A reader sent me an e-mail the other day
telling me that I had a ``hidden'' agenda. He was being too kind,
and I mean that sincerely. If only he knew the whole truth it might
make him shudder.
</P>
<P>
   No, for a fact, I once hid my agenda but, like everything else,
I forgot where I put the dang thing. My agenda isn't hidden, it is
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Next time I make an agenda _ and I'm not planning on doing this
anytime soon _ I'm going to put a Clapper(TM) by Ronco on it. That
way, when I forget where it is, I can just clap my hands a couple
of times, it will start beeping and the sound will lead me right to
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw my agenda, it was lying under a stack of
yellowing newspapers that we were saving to help house-train the
dog. It seemed like all we did was train the dog not to use the
bathroom on newspapers. So, we
</P>
<P>
   gave up and just put the dog outside before I uncovered the
agenda. Come to think of it, though, I don't think ``house-train
the dog'' was ever on my agenda.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I could say that the dog ate my agenda, but, when I used
that excuse in grade school, it got me whacked on the rear. Of
course, the dog eating my agenda could explain why it hasn't been
feeling all that well lately. An agenda like mine could give even a
dog a nasty case of indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   Even when my agenda was under the newspapers, it was not so much
hidden as just lying there waiting to be picked up. Of course, with
four children, it could be said that everything that enters my
house, including living things, is eventually ``hidden'' under
something. Why should an agenda be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, try as I might, I cannot remember what was on my
agenda or even what I might have been hoping to accomplish when I
set it forth. You'll understand just how embarrassing it is not to
know your own agenda, all the more true when it is a hidden agenda
that you've forgotten to memorize.
</P>
<P>
   I'm pretty sure that it started out with a prayer _ all my
agendas, hidden or otherwise, start out that way. On the other
hand, I'm not sure my agenda called anything to order, or perhaps I
just hadn't made it that far down the list before I ``hid'' it
forever.
</P>
<P>
   I can't even remember what was Number One on my agenda. You
always hear people talking about Number One on their agendas, but
it beats me what was Number One on my agenda, or Number Five or
even if there was a Number Five.
</P>
<P>
   I am pretty sure that my agenda did not include promoting gun
control, rampant pornography or abortions on demand. Likewise, my
agenda almost certainly did not have items for saving whales, seals
or spotted owls.
</P>
<P>
   It is far more likely that my 11-point agenda went something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   1. Sit in recliner.
</P>
<P>
   2. Eat a Ding Dong.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sit back in recliner.
</P>
<P>
   4. Nap.
</P>
<P>
   5. Eat lunch.
</P>
<P>
   6. Sit back in recliner.
</P>
<P>
   7. Exercise by walking upstairs to bed.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nap.
</P>
<P>
   9. Think about hunting for that hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   10. Eat a Ding Dong.
</P>
<P>
   11. Start back at Number One.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, why worry about finding my hidden agenda anyway? The
one I just wrote is probably better than what I had before, anyway.
No more hidden agendas for me, even if they get eaten by the dog.

 &HT;    Jet lag's strange effects can take time to heal
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One of the hazards of extended
international travel is jet lag. Symptoms are numbness below the
waist, swollen feet, difficulty in arm movements, inability to
focus eyes and a persistent dull headache. The good news is that
you eventually recover.
</P>
<P>
   My Athens friend Dan Magill called to say he is nearly back to
normal after three weeks in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's encouraging,'' I told him. ``Exactly when were you in
China?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1983,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to physical effects, your mind goes away for at
least a couple of months. Acute jet lag was to blame last week when
I got the Southside Clack boys and their wives reversed. Jerry is
married to Barbara. His older brother Jim is married to Jeannette.
I wrote it the other way around and hereby offer a retraction and
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Such errors can be excused due to the extra burden I carried
through Australia, New Zealand and the Fiji Islands. In addition to
hauling my Marco Polo-related wife's bags laden with goods
sufficient to stock a medium-size department store and a couple of
souvenir shops, I had to keep an eye on Bobby Mobley, who, among
other mishaps, managed to get nipped on his rear by a camel.
</P>
<P>
   After saying goodbye to the world's largest crocodile and
purchasing a busload of native goods and trinkets mostly made in
China, we said goodbye to Australia and headed for New Zealand,
which has 3 1/2 million people, 85 million sheep and, according to
Furman Bisher, about that many golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in New Zealand is either hang-gliding, bungee-jumping
or taking an afternoon stroll on a glacier. At my age, I was happy
enough to settle for watching a sheep shearer shear a sheep. (Try
to read that sentence while suffering from jet lag.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in touring Australia and New Zealand,
compared to Europe, is you don't have to visit two dozen castles
and cathedrals built 400 years ago. Australia and New Zealand are
younger than Fayette County and apparently have only a couple of
churches between them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Australia was settled by criminals shipped out from
England, you don't expect it to be an overly religious country, and
you don't brag about having relatives living there. I checked the
local telephone books hoping not to find any Minters. I discovered
Sydney full of Minters, likely descended from criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji was different. Methodist missionaries got a foothold about
the time our great-grandpas were fighting Yankees in Virginia.
Natives, who 150 years ago dined on each other, greet tourists with
a cry of ``Boula! Boula!'' I thought we'd run into a bunch of South
Pacific Yalies, until our local guide told us that ``Boula'' means
welcome, have a good day, and a lot of other nice things.
Everywhere we went we got boulaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably means `sucker' in Fiji language,'' Bobby suggested.
For a good ol' boy from Palmetto, he catches on fast.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Fayette County, we decided to have our family to
Sunday dinner. Since the cupboard was bare, my traveling companion
had to make a late Saturday trip to the grocery store. Then, punchy
with jet lag, we staggered to bed. We overslept.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, rushing to fix lunch and get off to church, I
offered to help. ``I'll put on the roast,'' I volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   I've been well-trained in roast preparation. First you put the
roast in a paper sack, add flour, pepper and salt, and shake. When
the roast is covered with flour, you pour several tablespoons of
vegetable oil into a Dutch oven, turn the eye to high, sear the
roast on all sides, add an onion and a cup of water, and pop in the
oven at 350. Simple.
</P>
<P>
   She had set the roast out on a counter. Beside the roast was a
plastic bottle with clear lemon-colored liquid inside, freshly
purchased on her shopping trip. I opened the bottle, poured some
into the Dutch oven and turned the eye to high. When I began to
sear the roast it didn't sear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need more cooking oil,'' she advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hand me the bottle,'' I said, reaching over to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you read?'' she exclaimed. ``This isn't cooking oil!
It's Pine Sol! For cleaning the bathroom!''
</P>
<P>
   It was not my fault, even considering the effects of acute jet
lag. Any reasonable person would assume that if she put the roast
on the counter she also put cooking oil on the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was good to be back home for Sunday lunch with the
family. Turpentine-flavored pot roast isn't all that bad.

   SMALLTOWN-DOC _ ARLINGTON, Ga. _ Dr. Robert E. Jennings took
care of the folks in this one-redlight South Georgia town of
Arlington for 39 years, delivering their babies, sewing up their
chainsaw wounds and even treating the occasional snakebit dog. When
his patients needed help after 5 p.m., they'd call him up at home.
Or drop by. ``People didn't go to the emergency room,'' says his
daughter Felicia Alexander. ``They'd just knock on the back door.''
For years the tall, broad-shouldered physician and his family lived
in a yellow-brick ranch house across the street from the hospital,
so finding the doctor was easy. Finding a replacement won't be.
Jennings died last fall at age 65, leaving the 1,200 residents of
Arlington in shock. Now they're naming Main Street after him, in an
attempt to make sure he's never forgotten. (Emerson, Atlanta

   JAZZFESTIVAL _ NEW ORLEANS _ ``When we first started,''
remembers Qunit Davis, director of the New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage
Festival, ``there were a lot of reasons people thought this thing
was a hopeless failure. They said, `You can't mix all these people
_ old people, young people, white people, black people, rich
people, poor people.' '' In 1970, the South had only been
integrated for a few years. Having black and white musicians play
for black and white audiences in the same location was still novel.
``But we had a theory,'' Davis said, ``that if you show people what
each other eats and what each other dances to, it'd be all right.
We were right, it works.'' (Konigsmark, Atlanta

 &HT;    Tool choice is all about how you want to handle it
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Offcuts from good old rec.woodworking on the Internet:
``Anybody have a source for light blue wood?'' asks a turner who
wants to make ``Kentucky Wildcat'' pens.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my best friends are, unaccountably, Kentucky alumni, and
I consulted them on this matter. While neither woodworkers nor
arborists, they were of the general opinion that since God had made
both the Wildcats and the grass blue, He must have made a tree to
match.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I believe the pen maker will do better to use
aniline dye on a white or neutral-colored wood like maple or birch.
</P>
<P>
   Another woodworker asks if he would be better off with a
Japanese dozuki saw or a European back saw for cutting dovetails.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a question impossible to answer. One can
only tell him what works best for oneself. The two saws are as
different as day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference, of course, is that the back saw is
heavy-bladed, with a brass stiffener on its back, and it cuts on
the forward stroke. The dozuki is thin, whippy, and cuts on the
pull stroke.
</P>
<P>
   If one is accustomed to using larger saws that cut on the push
stroke, then one is likely to be more comfortable with the back
saw. However, if the buyer is a novice and has no commitment to
either technique, then I recommend trying the dozuki.
</P>
<P>
   As with all Japanese tools, one can pay $25-$30 for a perfectly
useful dozuki with a replaceable blade, or one can pay several
hundred dollars for one with ineffable mystique and a
nonreplaceable blade. Since mystique, effable or otherwise, doesn't
cut wood, the cheaper tool will satisfy most of us.
</P>
<P>
   The back saw has to be stiff and heavy, or the blade would bend
and cramp on the push stroke. The dozuki, however, can be so thin
as to cut a hairline kerf because the act of pulling the blade
through the wood serves to tension it. It will cut almost
effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, it's really a matter of taste, like the
never-ending argument over whether to cut the pins or the tails
first.
</P>
<P>
   My pleasure in Japanese saws does not extend to Japanese planes,
except for specialty types like the ones meant for working concave
surfaces. Their planes, not surprisingly, are built to be pulled
rather than pushed, too. Pulling a saw blade is a natural enough
motion, since the stroke is more or less the same for any cut.
Pulling a plane isn't unnatural either, if you're working on a
piece of wood only a couple of feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But on a long plank, it requires not just pulling, but backing
up your whole body. With western planes, one strides forward to
accomplish this. I would much rather take a step or two forward
than move the same distance backward and blind.
</P>

 &HT;    MOST MEDICARE PATIENTS DON'T GET NECESSARY PREVENTIVE CARE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    For release Tuesday, April 20.

   WASHINGTON _ Most elderly Americans do not receive important
preventive health care services paid for by Medicare, according to
a report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1999 also found wide
variations in the levels of Medicare services provided from one
geographic region to another.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked primarily at the impact of Medicare's
fee-for-service program on the 27.7 million elderly enrolled in
1996. It generally did not count those enrolled in Medicare managed
care plans or the nearly 4 million disabled in the Medicare
program, which covers about 38 million Americans. And it did not
analyze the reasons behind the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report looked at medical resources -- such as the number of
hospital beds, doctors and nurses -- as well as medical conditions
and the range of care provided to patients.
</P>
<P>
   One area where better quality can be achieved -- and Medicare
patients' health improved -- is in preventive services. The report
found fewer than one out of three women aged 65 to 69 received a
mammogram during 1995-96, and in some parts of the country the
ratio was one out of eight women.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one out of eight Medicare beneficiaries received a
colorectal examination for cancer and fewer than half were given an
eye examination to detect the onslaught of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors recommend that the elderly receive a pneumonia
vaccination at least every 10 years, meaning 10 percent of the
elderly should receive the shot each year. The study found that
only 4.3 percent of beneficiaries were vaccinated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be striving for close to 100 percent use of these
specific preventive services considering what we know about
prevention and detection,'' said Dr. John E. Wennberg, director of
the Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth
Medical School and the Atlas' principal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonathan T. Lord, chief operating officer at the American
Hospital Association, said ``physicians and other providers should
see these data as an opportunity to make improvements and to work
together with their patients to make sure everyone is receiving
what are often life-saving preventive services.''
</P>
<P>
   The AHA subsidiary Health Forum publishes the Atlas, which
showed residents of some areas were 10 times more likely to undergo
certain surgical procedures than people elsewhere with the same
illness. For example, surgery to remove the prostate was nearly 10
times more likely in Baton Rouge, La., than in Binghamton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences do not reflect illness rates, the study
concluded. ``Variations in the rates of the use of these procedures
reflect variations in practice style and in how physicians diagnose
and treat common clinical conditions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-life treatment patterns also varied widely. In some
places, such as Miami, Fla., more than one-third of the Medicare
patients saw 10 or more doctors during their last six months of
life. In Bloomington, Ill., 1.3 percent of patients saw 10 or more
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital and medical resources also varied nationwide -- and so
did costs.
</P>
<P>
   In nine regions of the country, there were more than 4.5
hospital beds per 1,000 residents -- Minot, N.D., was highest with
5.1 -- while 11 regions had 1.7 or fewer beds per 1,000, with
Everett, Wash., lowest at 1.4.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas, had two registered nurses per 1,000 residents --
eighth lowest -- while Chicago, Ill, had five nurses per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, Ohio, had about 148 doctors per 100,000 residents -- the
fifth lowest in the nation -- while White Plains, N.Y., had the
most with 333 per 100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   How much Medicare spent in each region also varied. While the
national average was $4,993 per patient, costs ranged from $9,033
in McAllen, Texas, to $3,074 in Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cost was $4,890 in Atlanta, $4,053 in Grand Junction, $4,761
in Greenville, N.C., $4,597 in Dayton and $5,146 in Austin.

 By ADAM THOMSON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BOGOTA, Colombia _ ``As the sun set, Carlos Andres Perez
descended from the plane that had brought him from Davos,
Switzerland and was surprised to see on the platform General
Fernando Ochoa Antich, his minister of defense. ``What's
happening?'' he asked, intrigued. The minister reassured him with
reasoning so believable that the president did not go to the
Miraflores Palace, but instead to the presidential residence, La
Casona. He was starting to fall asleep when the defense minister's
phone call woke him to report a military uprising in Maracay. He
had only just entered Miraflores when the first artillery shells
exploded.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    This was the opening paragraph to a profile of Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez that appeared recently in Colombia's Cambio
magazine. It assumes knowledge of what Perez was thinking and
feeling, gratuitously mentions Davos, Switzerland, and doesn't say
anything about Chavez, the subject of the story. Would you as
editor call the reporter's attention to these details? What if the
reporter was named Gabriel Garcia Marquez?
 &HT;    This is not surrealism. The Nobel Prize-winning author, at age
72, is back in the newsroom as star reporter, an editor, and part
owner of Colombia's No. 2 newsmagazine, Cambio. The writer is
apparently convinced that there is a market for more thoughtful
journalism, and, at least for now, he appears to be right.
 &HT;    Since Garcia Marquez, known here simply as ``Gabo,'' relaunched
Cambio earlier this year, subscriptions have grown 20 percent to
65,000 and advertising is up fivefold, according to the
publication. With a total unaudited circulation of about 100,000,
Cambio, even by its own generous count, is still a far cry from its
older and more established rival Semana, with an audited
circulation of just over 171,000.
 &HT;    Gabo's niche. After winning the Nobel for literature in 1982,
Garcia Marquez has said on numerous occasions that he wanted to
return to his roots, reporting. But he claimed no one would hire
him. Now, three decades after writing Cien Anos de Soledad (One
Hundred Years of Solitude), he is literally paying to be published.
 &HT;    Proyectos y Finanzas, a local investment bank, identified a
niche opportunity in Colombia's magazine sector for Garcia Marquez.
Acting on the idea, he and six top Colombian journalists studied
the possibility of buying shares in Semana, the nation's top
newsweekly. The magazine's owners were expanding into
telecommunications and there seemed to be a possibility that at
least a portion of the magazine might be sold to help fund the
expansion.
 &HT;    When the owners of Semana turned down the offer, Gabo and the
six journalists began conversations with Cambio owner Patricia
Lara. A deal was sealed in November of last year for an undisclosed
amount and the first edition under the Nobel laureate's stewardship
was published at the beginning of January 1999.
 &HT;    Garcia Marquez's purchase of Cambio comes at an important
juncture in the five-year history of the magazine. Since it was
founded by businessman Juan Tomas de Salas as an offshoot of the
Spanish-based Cambio 16 Espana, the magazine has suffered severe
marketing and debt problems. In its first three years, Cambio lost
approximately $3 million. Since then, however, it has clawed back
some market share from Semana and has begun to break even
operationally.
 &HT;    Gabo's presence will clearly solve the magazine's marketing
problems. While he is normally very press shy, he gave an exclusive
to The New York Times recently to discuss Cambio. The magazine is
also gaining international exposure because Garcia Marquez's
stories are resold to publications abroad. Finally, he can provide
exclusives that few star reporters can. Journalists struggle to get
an interview with President Bill Clinton, for example, while Gabo
has enjoyed a private dinner with him.
 &HT;    The biggest challenge at Cambio may be to avoid becoming too
dependent on Garcia Marquez. Pilar Calderon, the magazine's
associate director, says that the staff is focusing on what Gabo is
good at, not the man himself. She says that the team is
concentrating on storytelling.
 &HT;    ``Colombian journalism has become too caught up in reporting and
has forgotten all about writing,'' explains Calderon. ``Our aim at
Cambio is to recover that lost element so that people will begin
reading again instead of just watching television.''
 &HT;    Readers have already noticed the new tack, but most frequently
associate it with stories written by Garcia Marquez, such as a
special feature he wrote on the country's peace process in his
first edition as part owner. ``Without doubt, the magazine is
already showing signs of better and deeper investigation,'' says
Armando Montenegro, president of the country's National Association
of Financial Institutions and an avid reader of the magazine. He
notes that if the magazine wants to close the gap with rival
Semana, it will need a redesign to reflect its new ideas and
ownership.
 &HT;    But for now, the Nobel laureate has no immediate plans to change
the magazine's format, nor is he terribly concerned about playing
too big a role in the publication's recent success. Instead, armed
with a reporter's notepad and pencil, he is simply enjoying
journalism once again.
 &HT;    And how do co-workers feel about the challenge of editing his
copy? ``The prospect of working with Gabo was terrifying at
first,'' recalls Calderon, a former editor at the country's second
daily newspaper, El Espectador. ``But he has the gift of creating a
warmth of atmosphere around him which is very conducive to
working.''

THE MAN WHO REDEFINED `IS' GIVES `WAR' NEW MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The man who redefined the meaning of sex and the
word ``is'' now is degrading other parts of the language, including
the word ``degrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Degradation in the old sense is hardly possible after the events
of the past year. But President Clinton and the military have
drafted ``degrade'' to replace ``destroy,'' which sounds too brutal
in the modern American world of politically correct warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Make that politically acceptable warfare, where public opinion
polls have replaced strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``end game'' has replaced that gory, old-fashioned word
``victory,'' and the phrase ``acceptable casualties'' means no
American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian casualties, on the other hand, are ``unfortunate'' but
``unavoidable.'' Enemy troops aren't killed but have their
capabilities ``diminished'' by planes that fly too high for their
video cameras to record blood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who knows the history of air war from the
Battle of Britain to Vietnam knows that bombings mainly harden
resistance, and even the most technologically miraculous planes get
shot down.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editors should do a little editing, and stop repeating
Pentagonese outside of direct quotations. They also could provide a
Berlitz of blitz so readers can translate the utterances of
generals and White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers also could stop using the word ``stealthy'' when
referring to the F-117, one of which got shot down. They could
continue calling it the $45 million F-117, because it sure looks
like a big financial blip on the screen at tax time.
</P>
<P>
   The press must take some responsibility for the way America
fights war nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   When the president launches cruise missiles and aircraft to send
messages _ a heck of an expensive form of e-mail _ we play into the
American myth of air power. We print drawings, bomb loads and
ranges of the cruise missiles and aircraft, and only when it's too
late do we mention the fact that no war has ever been won by air
power alone.
</P>
<P>
   When the first pilot is shot down, or the first three soldiers
are captured, we go into deep yellow-ribbon schizophrenia. We
simultaneously beat the patriotic drum, while asking ``Why are we
there?''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that shooting off pilotless cruise missiles is
Clinton's favorite way of sending a message, not counting wearing
special ties. Now he's just about run out of cruise missiles and
options.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been manipulating symbols, watching the polls
and playing Western Union with laser-guided bombs, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has been playing for keeps. Now it
looks like we have to send in troops _ not a pleasant prospect in
the Balkans _ and we are unprepared to do so. Clinton didn't have
them ready to go in case Milosevic didn't fold after the first two
nights of bombing. The president wasn't ready to fight a war, just
a degradation.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja dodging all over again. I don't mean draft dodging but
responsibility dodging. Many commentators in the press have noted
the ``irony'' of the draft-avoider president getting caught
committing escalatio on a small country, as some wag once said of
President Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The president rightly inveighs against Serbian genocide and
ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians, but he hasn't cared enough to
send them the very best, the Marine Corps, the airborne and the
armored divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been neither here nor there. He's tried to be
neither here nor there in fighting Milosevic, just as he was
neither here nor there during the Vietnam War. He didn't enlist and
he didn't get very involved in the anti-war movement, except in
Britain, where no one liked the war anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped the draft by signing up for ROTC, but when the draft
lottery saved him from the draft he wheedled his way out of ROTC
with a whiny, self-pitying, self-promoting letter.
</P>
<P>
   This week it is interesting to examine the key run-on sentence
in young Clinton's letter to Col. Eugene Holmes, director of ROTC
at the University of Arkansas: ``I am writing too in the hope that
my telling this one story (about supposedly writing a letter
volunteering to be drafted) will help you to understand more
clearly how so many fine people have come to find themselves still
loving their country but loathing the military, to which you and
other good men have devoted years, lifetimes, of the best service
you could.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who once held the armed forces in contempt now loves
them to death.
</P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BOGOTA _ ``Carlos Andres Perez descendio al atardecer del avion
que lo llevo de Davos, Suiza, y se sorprendio de ver en la
plataforma al General Fernando Ochoa Antich, su ministro de
Defensa.'' Que pasa?,'' le pregunto intrigado. El ministro lo
tranquilizo, con razones tan confiables, que el Presidente no fue
al Palacio de Miraflores sino a la residencia presidencial de La
Casona. Empezaba a dormirse cuando el mismo ministro de Defensa lo
desperto por telefono para informarle de un levantamiento militar
en Maracay. Habia entrado apenas en Miraflores cuando estallaron
las primeras cargas de artilleria.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ese fue el parrafo inicial de un perfil del presidente de
Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, que aparecio recientemente en la revista
colombiana Cambio. El parrafo indica que el periodista sabia lo que
Perez pensaba y sentia, menciona gratuitamente a Davos, en Suiza, y
no dice nada de Chavez, que es el sujeto del articulo. Si usted
fuera editor, le senalaria estos detalles al reportero? Y si el
reportero se llama Gabriel Garcia Marquez?
 &HT;    No es surrealismo. A sus 72 anos, el escritor laureado con el
premio Nobel ha regresado a la sala de redaccion como reportero
estrella, director y dueno de parte de la revista noticiosa numero
dos de Colombia, Cambio. El novelista esta convencido de que hay un
mercado para un periodismo mas reflexivo, y, al menos de momento,
parece tener razon.
 &HT;    Desde que Garcia Marquez, conocido en Colombia simplemente como
``Gabo,'' relanzo Cambio a principios de este ano, las
suscripciones han crecido el 20 por ciento, a 65.000, y la
publicidad ha crecido cinco veces, segun la cuenta de la
publicacion. Pero con una circulacion total no auditada de unos
100.000 ejemplares, Cambio, aun de acuerdo con sus cifras
generosas, todavia esta muy lejos de su rival Semana, mas antigua y
mas establecida, y que tiene una circulacion auditada de poco mas
de 171.000 ejemplares.
 &HT;    El nicho de Gabo. Despues de ganar el Nobel de Literatura en
1982, Garcia Marquez dijo en numerosas ocasiones que queria volver
a sus raices: el periodismo. Pero decia que nadie lo iba a
contratar. Ahora, tres decadas despues de escribir Cien anos de
soledad, paga literalmente para que lo publiquen.
 &HT;    Proyectos y Finanzas, un banco de inversiones de Ecuador,
descubrio una oportunidad en el sector de las revistas para Garcia
Marquez, quien, con otros seis destacados periodistas colombianos,
estudio entonces la posibilidad de comprar acciones en Semana, el
semanario noticioso mas importante del pais. Los duenos de la
revista se extendian hacia las telecomunicaciones y parecia posible
que al menos una parte de la revista se pusiera en venta para
costear la expansion.
 &HT;    Cuando los duenos de Semana rechazaron la oferta, Gabo y los
seis periodistas se dirigieron a Patricia Lara, propietaria de
Cambio. En noviembre del ano pasado se sello un convenio por una
suma no revelada y el primer numero bajo la direccion del novelista
se publico a principios de enero de 1999.
 &HT;    La participacion de Garcia Marquez en Cambio se produce en una
importante coyuntura en la historia de cinco anos de la revista.
Desde que el empresario Juan Tomas de Salas la fundo como vastago
de Cambio 16, de Espana, la revista ha sufrido problemas de
mercadeo y deuda. En sus tres primeros anos, Cambio perdio
aproximadamente US$3 millones. Pero desde entonces le ha quitado
cierta participacion de mercado a Semana y ya cubre sus gastos
operativos.
 &HT;    La presencia de Gabo, evidentemente, resolvera los problemas de
mercadeo de la revista. Aunque no concede muchas entrevistas,
recientemente le dio una exclusiva a The New York Times para hablar
sobre Cambio. La revista tambien gana una presencia internacional
porque los articulos de Garcia Marquez se venden a publicaciones
extranjeras. Por ultimo, el autor puede conseguir exclusivas que
pocos reporteros estrella logran obtener. Los periodistas se
esfuerzan inutilmente por que el presidente Bill Clinton, por
ejemplo, les de una entrevista, mientras Gabo tuvo una cena privada
con el mandatario.
 &HT;    El mayor reto de Cambio puede ser no depender demasiado de
Garcia Marquez. Pilar Calderon, subdirectora de la revista, dice
que el personal se concentra en las cosas en las que Gabo se
destaca, no en Gabo en si. Dice que el equipo se concentra en
relatar historias.
 &HT;    ``El periodismo colombiano se ha enfocado demasiado en la labor
reporteril y se ha olvidado de escribir,'' explica Calderon. ``En
Cambio, nuestra meta es recuperar ese elemento perdido para que el
publico vuelva a leer en vez de limitarse a ver television.''
 &HT;    Los lectores ya han advertido la nueva estrategia, pero la
asocian mas frecuentemente con los articulos escritos por Garcia
Marquez, como el reportaje especial que escribio sobre el proceso
de paz en Colombia en su primer numero como dueno parcial de la
publicacion. ``Sin duda, la revista ya da senales de una
investigacion mejor y mas profunda,'' dice Armando Montenegro,
presidente de la Asociacion Nacional de Instituciones Financieras
de Colombia y avido lector de la revista. Montenegro senala que si
la revista quiere salvar la distancia que la separa de Semana,
tendra que cambiar el diseno para reflejar sus nuevas ideas y a sus
nuevos duenos.
 &HT;    Pero por ahora, Garcia Marquez no tiene planes inmediatos de
cambiar el formato de la revista, ni le preocupa desempenar un
papel de gran peso en su reciente exito. Lo que hace, armado con un
cuaderno de reportero y un lapiz, es disfrutar el periodismo una
vez mas.
 &HT;    Y como ven sus companeros de trabajo el reto de revisar lo que
escribe Garcia Marquez? ``Al principio, la idea de trabajar con
Gabo daba miedo,'' recuerda Calderon, ex directora del segundo
diario del pais, El Espectador. ``Pero Gabo tiene el don de crear
un ambiente calido a su alrededor, muy favorable para el trabajo.''

TV: THE BOX WE LOVE TO HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Every April means the same thing: the baseball
season starts, we freak over our taxes, and parents and children
are urged to turn off their televisions for a week.
</P>
<P>
   This week, school kids in Bethlehem, N.Y., were told to ``break
free from television.'' School districts across the country do the
same thing around this time, soliciting pledges from students to
abstain from the tube.
</P>
<P>
   I have no problem with the temporary abstinence, especially if a
student or adult discovers something new to do with the free time.
But I think a better exercise would be to resume your normal
viewing habits, but chart what you do watch. The results may be
even more startling.
</P>
<P>
   Because the key question a parent or any viewer must ask is not
how much television they watch, but what they watch. Television is
not inherently evil, as is the implication. What is wrong is how we
sometimes use it.
</P>
<P>
   The hammer is a wonderful tool. A hammer can also bruise a
thumb, or, wielded murderously, crack a skull. In short, it is a
tool that is predominantly good and useful that can also inflict
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Long before I became a television critic, I had heard friends
and acquaintances state with pride and/or indignation: ``I never
watch television,'' or ``I would never let my child watch the idiot
box.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, I think the intentions of these people are noble.
</P>
<P>
   And also misguided. Television is a tool, a wonderful tool if
used properly.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the first television picture was transmitted into a
home _ and that was 71 years ago in Schenectady, N.Y. _ culture has
been irrevocably changed. By the late 1940s and into the 1950s,
television became a common denominator. With the explosion of
cable, it branched out into niches that can satisfy the most
curious or prurient.
</P>
<P>
   Like anything broad and expansive, television became a
collection of the good and bad, the instructional and destructive.
Some people, fed up with the offensive and banal of the medium,
opted out entirely: No more, not in my house. After a few episodes
of ``Love Boat: The Next Wave,'' I certainly understand the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is short-sighted if taken to the extreme of
banishment. Television allows us to visit places we will never see,
hear people we will never meet, learn things we would otherwise
never have known. With no offense to my professors, I learn more
from ``Bill Nye the Science Guy'' in a half hour than I did in a
semester of earth science.
</P>
<P>
   If you are spending three or four hours a day watching reruns
and sitcoms, yes, you are probably wasting your time. But if much
of that time, not necessarily four hours, is filled with fare like
the Discovery Channel, History Channel, PBS, specials like Peter
Jennings' ``The Century'' or even some of the quality dramas in
addition to the eye candy, I can argue that it is time well spent.
</P>
<P>
   Is there more bad television on today than ever before?
Absolutely. But is there also more quality programming for children
as well as adults on than ever before? No question. We now have
70-plus stations and thousands of programming hours to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Is there too much violence on television? Of course there is.
And too much of sex, drugs, sports, music videos, news magazines
and sitcom yuppies making $25,000 a year but living in
$5,000-a-month New York City apartments. Too much, that is, if you
are trying to consume it all.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point. Moderation and selectivity should be the
guides in your household. It is for my child, if not for me.
</P>
<P>
   For adults, I say this: If there is a show you don't like or
offends your sensibilities, shop around. If you are totally fed up,
there is a simple solution at the tip of your thumb, that little
red button that says Power. It is an apt double-entendre: You are
the ultimate programmer, empowered as much by what you don't watch
as what you do.
</P>
<P>
   As for parents, I share your concerns. There is a lot in the
airwaves that is wholly unsuitable for children. Should these shows
be prohibited? No.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am not going to relinquish my parental
responsibility to a network executive or governmental entity. We
parents have the job to screen what our children watch and also
know what they are watching. You must be pro-active to make sure
what that sponge of a child you have is absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   And so much of it is good, from ``Sesame Street'' to ``Arthur''
to ``Blues Clues'' to, yes, I'm afraid, ``Barney.'' Used right,
selectively and in moderation, television is a wonderful, wonderful
tool.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't even leave bruises.
</P>

REGULATOR LIKES TO TALK ABOUT WAGE GAP FOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A lack of pay parity for women in the workplace
remains a persistent problem in American society, according to the
head of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A problem for everyone, not just women, EEOC chairwoman Ida L.
Castro said during a visit to the State University of New York at
Albany. When they are underpaid, women suffer economic hardship,
their mates are penalized monetarily, and their children may have
to endure whatever day care the family can afford, instead of
quality care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights officer said she wanted to practice preventive
civil rights in the workplace, rather than just relying on lawsuits
to redress wrongs. So Castro uses every opportunity to talk about
ways to address the wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather that employees, and of course, the employer,
work together to resolve these concerns,'' Castro, 46, said
Wednesday during the university's Distinguished Women Speaker
series.
</P>
<P>
   People have to realize that wage discrimination still exists,
whether employers' actions are knowing or not, she said. Women, she
said, think: ```It's 1999. Who would do that?' Well, a lot of
people do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay studies still routinely show bottom-line pay discrepancies
``that cannot be explained in any other way other than gender,''
she said. Part of the problem is that individuals and companies
often lack the data that would point to inequities. Women who work
in unionized workplaces are often better off, she said, because
unions typically negotiate wage scales.
</P>
<P>
   But workers in some non-union settings can be fired for
discussing compensation, Castro said. In the best of situations,
she said, an employer will review pay data to see if there are
existing wage discrepancies and then cooperate with employees to
correct shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   That recently happened at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. But employers may fear that if they do an internal
review and then detect problems, that the review may be used to
punish them, she said. Accordingly, she said she would like EEOC to
devise a management or accounting tool that companies, especially
smaller ones, can use for a ``self audit.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro was sworn in as chairwoman of the EEOC, a $125,000-a
year-job, last October. She has worked in other government jobs in
the employment field, including acting director of the Women's
Bureau at the U.S. Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, some critics said that the EEOC was too slow in
getting to complaints. Castro has said in other interviews she
wants to use more mediation services and concentrate legal actions
on companies that refuse to comply with the law and on cases that
would clarify employment law.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM ISRAEL: JUST WHAT TIME IS IT? HARD TO TELL IN
JERUSALEM
 &HT;    With Photo mug of Kaplow.
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Long divided over how to share their small land, the
rift between Jews and Arabs has recently jumped dimensions -- from
space to time.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, clocks in the Jewish homes of Jerusalem have been
an hour ahead of clocks, just yards away in some cases, in Arab
homes. Palestinians at work have been an hour ahead of their
children's classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For foreigners, the time warp has posed some problems of
protocol. One European diplomat took to wearing two watches as a
light-hearted gesture to both ``Israeli time'' and ``Palestinian
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy began when Israel went on daylight savings time,
but the Palestinian National Authority, which governs parts of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, decided to stick with the old hour for a
couple more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In solidarity with their neighbors, most Palestinians in
Jerusalem also stuck to the old time, even though the city is
governed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the authority was formed in 1996, Israelis and
Palestinians have been choosing different dates to spring forward.
Palestinian clocks finally caught up Thursday night (local time).
But, for two weeks, the close proximity of those on different
clocks bordered on the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Daylight savings time is based on the earth's general
orientation toward the sun. You would not expect different time
zones for Jerusalem's Jews and Arabs, who live in adjacent, though
segregated, neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But, it figures. Their schedules have always differed according
to their religions, cultures and, as with daylight savings time,
their political allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends, for example, have never coincided. Palestinians take
their day off Fridays, when Muslims are expected to attend their
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   As Palestinians start the work week on Saturday, Jews are off
for their Sabbath. The minority of Christians rest on Sunday, when
everyone else is working.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sad fact that the time difference did not cause as much
confusion as you might expect. Unfortunately, Jews and Arabs in
Jerusalem have little direct contact. They share very few schools
and aren't likely to take a lunch together. The majority likely did
not even know that they have been on different times for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were affected, like Palestinians whose children go
to public schools run by the Israeli government, they have
straddled the two time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Palestinians with jobs in Israeli businesses spent
two weeks crossing a time line between home and work.
</P>
<P>
   Appointments had to be clarified -- ``Do you mean 1 p.m.
Palestinian time or Israeli time?'' -- and a lot of meetings have
started late. Several donors arrived an hour early for a recent
meeting at the World Bank, which was on Palestinian time.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, everybody's watches are now synchronized. At least
until the fall, when Jews and Arabs are asked what time it is, they
can agree.

   The International Space Station will be so noisy that astronauts
may struggle to communicate, suffer poor health and even miss
crucial warning tones that signal an emergency. According to
documents obtained by New Scientist under the U.S. Freedom of
Information Act, the constant clatter of equipment aboard
Russian-built station modules could disrupt work and sleep _ and
perhaps even damage astronauts' hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The first element of the station, known as Zarya, was launched
last November. Yet as long ago as September 1997, the Khrunichev
State Research and Production Space Center in Moscow warned that
noise generated by fans, air filters, dust collectors and pumps
would result in a ``probable worsening of the health of cosmonauts
and in unintelligibility of voice communications.''
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Zarya, astronauts could be subjected to a perceived
noise level of 72.5 decibels (dBA). That's louder than an air
conditioner in a closed room, says Robert Lilkendey of Jaffe Holden
Scarbrough Acoustics in Norwalk, Conn. ``It's not something that's
intolerable, but you've got to raise your voice.'' Even the
quietest parts of Zarya exceed the space station's design
requirements of 50 to 55 dBA.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, these noise levels are too low to
cause hearing damage, but experience with long, constant exposures
in Russia's Mir station _ which is of similar design to Zarya _
worries NASA engineers. ``There's an indication that a significant
number of astronauts have lost hearing in Mir,'' says Jerry
Goodman, who works on the acoustics of the space station. Goodman
declines to give further details, citing medical confidentiality,
but says that the astronauts later recovered a percentage of their
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Even if astronauts' hearing is not damaged, noise could have
other undesirable effects. ``Crew ability to sleep, work and
communicate will be impaired,'' warns one NASA document, dated July
1998. Another document, dated November 1998, notes that the warning
tones that signal an emergency would be ``minimally audible'' in
Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Patrican, a NASA official responsible for safety aboard the
space station, says that the launch of Zarya went ahead despite the
problem because foam covers and other devices would be installed
later to dampen the noise. ``It will be under control,'' he says.
But other NASA documents predict that the installation of acoustic
mufflers will be ``minimally effective,'' reducing the noise by
only a few decibels. And Goodman admits he can't be sure the
mufflers will work.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month before Zarya's launch, the Russians and
Americans were still arguing about the solution to the noise
problem. In October 1998, a team from Khrunichev suggested that
astronauts spend no more than four hours a day in Zarya and no more
than two hours a day in the noisiest segments. They also suggested
wearing earplugs. However, documents from the Johnson Space Center
in Houston brand the time restrictions ``unacceptable,'' and say
that earplugs should be prohibited because they would interfere
with astronauts' ability to hear warning signals.
</P>
<P>
   With Zarya already in orbit, the focus of the arguments has now
shifted to the Russian service module, currently scheduled for
launch in September, which will serve as the astronauts' living
quarters during much of the station's construction. At a meeting in
January this year, Russian officials announced that noise levels in
the service module will be as high as 74 dBA. This did not include
the added rumbles of refrigerators and other equipment. Goodman
says that NASA is now paying additional attention to the acoustics
within its station modules, to provide astronauts with quiet
havens. ``When you're locked up in a spacecraft, you can't get away
from the noise unless you have a good sleep station,'' he says. &QL;

   It's official: sex is good for you, at least in moderation.
Psychologists in Pennsylvania have shown that people who have sex
once or twice a week get a boost to their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can evaluate how robust our immune systems are by
measuring levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antigen found in
saliva and mucosal linings. ``IgA is the first line of defense
against colds and flu,'' says Carl Charnetski of Wilkes University
in Wilkes-Barre. IgA binds to pathogens at all the points of entry
to the body, then calls on the immune system to destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if sex can alter IgA levels, Charnetski and his
colleague Frank Brennan asked 111 Wilkes undergraduates, aged 16 to
23, how frequently they'd had sex over the previous month. They
also measured levels of IgA in the volunteers' saliva.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that participants who had sex less than once
a week had a tiny increase in IgA over those who abstained
completely. Those who had one or two sexual encounters each week
had a 30 percent rise in levels of the antigen. But people who had
very frequent sex _three times a week or more _ had lower IgA
levels than the abstainers. The researchers presented the results
this week at a meeting of the Eastern Psychological Association in
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Lowell, an immunologist at the University of California
at San Francisco, thinks the high levels of IgA in volunteers who
had moderately frequent sex are easy to understand. ``Sexually
active people may be exposed to many more infectious agents than
sexually non-active people,'' Lowell says. ``The immune system
would respond to these foreign antigens by producing and releasing
more IgA.'' This could give them better protection against colds
and flu.
</P>
<P>
   Why there was no IgA rise in the most sexually active group is
less clear. ``My feeling is that the people in the
very-frequent-sex group may be in obsessive or poor relationships
that are causing them a lot of anxiety,'' speculates Charnetski.
``We know that stress and anxiety make IgA go down.''

   Have you ever felt like a bruised pincushion after a doctor has
tried to take a blood sample, but couldn't find a vein? Help may be
at hand in the shape of a robotic blood taker, say engineers at
Imperial College in London.
</P>
<P>
   While you might prefer to put your trust in the haphazard jabs
of a medical student than a blood-sucking machine, the researchers
at Imperial insist that their robot is far more reliable than a
human. Besides hitting the vein the first time, every time _ a
track record few human blood takers can match _ the robot won't
overshoot the vein. This is a common problem for some patients that
can cause painful bruising.
</P>
<P>
   To find the vein, the robot uses a primitive sense of touch.
Gently prodding the different parts of the arm, it records the
force of the probe bouncing off the tissue to determine what lies
underneath the skin with an accuracy of one millimeter. ``The force
depends upon the elasticity of the skin underneath,'' says Alex
Zivanovic, a mechanical engineer working on the project. Muscle is
hard and fat is soft, he explains, while veins have a unique feel
to them, ``like an underinflated balloon.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the location of the veins has been displayed on a screen,
the operator can choose the best one and instruct the robot to
proceed. As the needle penetrates the skin, the robot uses strain
gauges to monitor the force exerted on it by the tissue. The moment
the wall of the vein is breached, the robot stops, ensuring that
the needle doesn't overshoot.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is particularly flexible, says Tony Firth, an
anatomist at Imperial, because it doesn't assume that everybody's
veins are all the same size or at the same depth. This makes it
useful for finding veins in small children or obese people.
</P>
<P>
   David Keeling, a consultant hematologist at the Oxford
Hemophilia Center, says it can also be extremely difficult to find
veins in patients after a lifetime of treatment. ``If you are
sticking a needle into the same veins, you can get inflammation,
thrombosis and the vein can become occluded,'' he says.
Essentially, patients run out of veins to use and in some cases
permanent catheters must be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   But Keeling wonders how easy it would be to get a small child to
keep still _ even when strapped into the device. And Zivanovic
admits that many people he has talked to were none too enthusiastic
about a robot wielding a needle. Nevertheless, he hopes that
drawing people's attention to the robot's safety features, such as
its limited field of motion, will persuade the faint-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   The system is semi-autonomous. It suggests the most appropriate
area to pierce, but leaves it up to the operator to make the final
decision. Eventually Zivanovic would like to build a fully
autonomous robot that would choose the most suitable vein.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zivanovic has only tested his device on artificial limbs
designed as practice tools for medical students. These contain
various layers of gels, tubes and latex membranes, and even
artificial blood, which Zivanovic says gushes out into the needle
when the vein is penetrated.

AN EXTINCT FLY'S EYE MAY IMPROVE SOLAR POWER

<P>
   Solar panels could be improved by mimicking the design of the
eyes of a fly that lived 45 million years ago. A pattern of ridges
found on the surface of the fly's eyes could reduce reflection and
so allow panels to capture light arriving at very oblique angles.
</P>
<P>
   The idea comes from Andrew Parker, a zoologist at the Australian
Museum in Sydney. While visiting the Museum of the Earth in Warsaw,
Poland, he noticed some electron micrographs of a fly from the
family Dolichopodidae, preserved in amber during the Eocene epoch.
On the surface of the sections that make up the fly's compound eye,
Parker noticed gratings consisting of a series of parallel ridges
145 nanometers high and 240 nanometers apart.
</P>
<P>
   Parker suspected that the fly's eye structure could capture
light arriving at up to 72 degrees from the perpendicular. The
distance between the ridges is about half the wavelength of light,
which greatly reduces the amount of light that they reflect. Parker
believes that the ridges were probably an adaptation to allow the
fly to see better at night.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Exeter, led by Roy Sambles, an
expert in photonics, have now confirmed Parker's hunch by embossing
the same pattern onto a film of light-sensitive emulsion. They
fired laser beams of different wavelengths at the material from a
variety of angles and measured how much light was reflected. ``It
turned out we had a really good antireflector over a whole range of
angles,'' says Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with these results, materials scientist Geoff Smith and
his colleagues at the University of Technology, Sydney, have
calculated that the fly's eye pattern could boost the energy
generated by a solar panel over the course of a typical day by 10
per cent. ``It does almost as well with the Sun way over near the
horizon as it does at midday,'' says Smith.
</P>
<P>
   This might eliminate the need for the expensive and cumbersome
tracking systems currently required to keep solar panels pointing
at the Sun as it moves across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, Patrick Campbell of the
photovoltaics research group at the University of New South Wales
in Sydney will attempt to etch the extinct fly's eye pattern
directly onto the glass of a solar panel.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy in
Freiburg, Germany, have independently been working on films
embossed with similar patterns and have reported increases in the
amount of energy they absorb of about 3 percent.

STUDENTS ARE ON A ROLL, BOOKS AND ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the old days, children carried their books to
school by hand, or tied them with a piece of rope or an old belt.
</P>
<P>
   Then came canvas sacks _ or for nerdy students, briefcases. By
the 1970s, students were toting their books in canvas military
surplus bags. From the 1980s until today, bright nylon backpacks
held sway.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the most fashion-forward students are going mobile, using
backpacks or small suitcases with wheels to cart their books
around.
</P>
<P>
   It's just starting, but the wheeled book bag may be the next Big
Thing that students feel compelled to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had one show up,'' Doug Parker, head of the middle
school at Albany Academy, said of the devices, which are like those
favored by airline pilots and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell if these conveyances become fashion fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not it's a trend for your average kids, it's hard
to say,'' said David Teufel, spokesman for L.L. Bean, the Maine
catalog retailer that plans to roll out its own wheeled pack in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers say they've seen a slow but steady stream of
young customers seeking the packs, which cost $70 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they really are bringing home a lot of books. Maybe
they are getting more homework,'' said Gwen Hook, a saleswoman at
Tri City Luggage in the Albany suburb of Colonie.
</P>
<P>
   She's right. For several years now, parents and some physicians
have been concerned about the size and weight of backpacks that
pupils are carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is due to heavier homework loads, and part is due to
the sheer time pressures that students face. A recent survey from
the University at Michigan showed that students aged 6 to 8 saw
their nightly homework load rise from an average of 9 minutes to 25
minutes between 1981 and 1997. That's a lot more books to drag

   ``Kids in many situations can't go back to their lockers. They
are on the go from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.,'' said Lauren Osterweil, a
spokeswoman for Eastpak, a Lowell, Mass.-based backpack maker.

   Children were carrying so much weight through the halls of
Albany Academy, Parker said, that school officials recently cracked
down on heavy packs, wheeled or otherwise. One teacher uses a scale
to enforce a 25 pound weight limit.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one school has banned the wheeled bags for fear of
collisions and other hallway mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had that and we said no to it,' said Nancy Chase,
superintendent at the Hoosick Falls school system in upstate New
York. That decision came after one student was using his wheeled
suitcase to bash other students in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was rolling it down the hall wildly and knocking it in to
people. We decided it wasn't such a good idea,'' Chase said.

A `MOON' FULL OF DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you miss the metaphor crashing into your head like a
block of concrete, ``A Walk on the Moon'' is about discovery. It's
set in the summer of '69, which means we get Neil Armstrong's
``giant step for mankind'' along with Woodstock revelers in various
states of nudity. Astronautical discovery, sexual discovery. Get
it?
</P>
<P>
   Sure you do. First-time director Tony Goldwyn (best known for
his acting roles, notably the skanky-yuppie killer in ``Ghost'')
has made a winsome film out of a few stultifying cliches, not an
easy trick. The worst you can say about it is that 70 percent of
the time you know exactly what's going to happen. The best you can
say is that 30 percent of the time, you don't. And in that 30
percent lurk enough lovely surprises to redeem (almost) the
ham-handed clunkiness in the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of ``A Walk on the Moon'' is Pearl Kantrowitz
(Diane Lane), a distracted Jewish mom with a swell husband (Liev
Schreiber), a twitchy teen-age daughter (Anna Paquin) and a young
son (Bobby Boriello). She also has needs that hubby apparently has
not met. In June of '69 they fill their car to bursting and drive
up to a Borscht Belt resort in the Catskills, where the kids cavort
on the beach while Mom hobnobs with the ladies over mah-jongg.
</P>
<P>
   She also spends time buying shirts from a traveling blouse
salesman, a hunky bohemian (Viggo Mortenson) with major sideburns.
The salesman flirts openly with his customers, Pearl included. And
when Pearl's husband drives back to his job in New York, leaving
Pearl to her sublimated yearnings, she makes a hasty beeline for
the Blouse Man.
</P>
<P>
   Why she does this is never fully explained; we know that Pearl
married young, that her husband won't ``experiment'' in bed
(though, give the guy credit, he does wear toy gats and a cowboy
hat) and that her face assumes a mien of tragic resignation while
she's chopping celery in the kitchen. ``Do you ever feel trapped by
life, Norma?'' she asks a friend, a rhetorical question if there
ever was one. The answer, which we are duly given, is: Yes, But
That's The Way It Is.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl doesn't buy this. Instead she sneaks off with the Blouse
Man to engage in trippy antics at Woodstock while Pearl's daughter,
who has snuck off to Woodstock with her boyfriend, observes them
through binoculars. And you ask yourself: Weren't there more than
400,000 people at Woodstock? And: Where'd she get those expensive
binoculars, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, not all of this is cliched. Pamela Gray's
screenplay may trade on stereotypes (see ``A Price Above Rubies''
for yet another film about sexual doldrums in a Jewish marriage),
but it takes a few unexpected, emotionally honest turns that keep
things interesting until the end. Goldwyn directs with compassion,
drawing a mature, carefully ruled performance out of Schreiber and
a crisp character turn from Tovah Feldshuh as Pearl's
mother-in-law. Paquin is intentionally annoying it's her job but
Lane, taking on her beefiest role in years, can't get much beyond a
basic mope. When Paquin screams ``I'm the teen-ager!'' at her
muddle-headed mom, she's voicing irritation for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of the dialogue is marvelous. When Pearl scolds the
Blouse Man for giving candy to her children, she snaps, ``Just keep
your licorice sticks to yourself!'' (Here's an adolescent girl,
discussing her parents' rules on dating and diet: ``Guys I can
kiss. Bacon is another story.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' works well, too, as nostalgic
slice-of-life; among its brightest details are Julie Kavner's
deadpan loudspeaker announcements (``Attention: The Knish Man is on
the premises'') and its brief scenes of rapt resort-dwellers
watching Apollo XI on television. Cloddish metaphor or no cloddish
metaphor, the movie neatly captures that first moonwalk, the
suspense that led up to it and the popular exhilaration that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it gets a few things right.

QUALIFYING TIMES, FASTER FIELDS, SEPARATE BOSTON FROM OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As the oldest continuous race of its kind in the
world, the Boston Marathon has long been accustomed to its unique
identity. In its 103 years, the footrace has been a bastion of
tradition, alternately rakish, reviled, romanticized, respected,
and revered, and darned proud of it all. Boston is Boston: Take it
or leave it, run it or not. If you want to be challenged on the
course's terms, not catered to on your own, Boston is for you.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you want to leave your hotel 10 minutes
before the race starts to alternately jog and walk in a flat circle
for nine hours of nonstop music and entertainment, the Boston
Athletic Association suggests, albeit graciously, that you go
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what this race is all about,'' said race director
Guy Morse. ``This race is an athletic event first. That's as true
today as it was in any year you can name.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Boston decides to eliminate its qualifying standards _
Morse's best guess on that is ``no chance'' _ it is not likely to
lose its hallowed stature anytime soon. On the contrary, as
different as Boston is now from the 350 or so marathons run in the
US last year, trends throughout the sport indicate it is on the
threshold of even further separating itself from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Why? See the description in Paragraph 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vive la separation, that's all I can say,'' said Dr. David
Martin, a Georgia State University physiologist and noted marathon
guru. ``Some race needs to be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is that race. Marathoners who want to traverse the
distance from Hopkinton to Boylston Street face qualifying
standards (they have to run fast somewhere else even to get the
chance to run fast here), a Heartbreaker of an uphill-downhill
combo at 20 miles (they could save a lot of trouble by just staying
home and bashing the fronts of their thighs with a hammer for the
same effect), and the overwhelming sense that crossing the finish
line will weave them into the fabric of a history that began
generations ago.
</P>
<P>
   Marathoners elsewhere don't, and while many take their racing as
seriously as any Boston competitor, overall the face of marathoning
in America is changing to the point where the very definition of
the event is being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest factor is the relatively new idea that
covering 26.2 miles can be healthy and even fun. Grueling?
Competitive? Who says?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late '70s, you ran a marathon for only one reason,''
said Amby Burfoot, the executive editor of Runner's World magazine
who won here in 1968 but now frequently leads pacing groups for
marathoners wanting to break four hours. ``You wanted to qualify
for Boston. Now, it's to raise money for charity, a one-time goal
for yourself, to lose 50 pounds, to honor my mother who died of
breast cancer a year ago. Twenty years ago, we didn't have any of
those (reasons).''
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have Oprah Winfrey, either, at least not running 26
miles 385 yards. Just as the famed Chicago talk-show host can
catapult a book to No. 1 on the bestseller list by selecting it for
her book club, Winfrey motivated untold thousands by completing the
Marine Corps Marathon in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Several months afterward, Runner's World hit the newsstands with
the cover line ``Oprah Did It, So Can You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by far the best-selling cover in the last 15 years,''
said Burfoot. ``Everyone felt that she was the last person who
could ever finish a marathon. Oprah running the marathon is a very
simple, very powerful thought-image capable of lingering in
people's minds for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That it took her 4 hours 29 minutes 20 seconds to do so _ a time
at which a 70-year-old woman would still fall 9 minutes 20 seconds
short of qualifying for Boston _ mattered little. Rather, it was
the whole point: For Winfrey, running a marathon was more a
lifestyle event than an athletic event.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, that is what it has become. Twenty years ago,
120,000 people finished marathons in the United States. By 1990,
the number had risen to 260,000, and in the last eight years it has
skyrocketed to 419,000. Demand for entry into some races is
becoming fierce: In 1997, the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington,
D.C., held each October, filled up for the first time ever when it
reached its cap of 16,000 in late summer. In 1998, entries closed
in June. This year, the field was locked up on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a lot of pride in our name, if you will, as the
People's Marathon,'' said Major David Fadden, the officer in charge
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, finishing times are getting slower; in some races, a
lot slower. In a sample of 16 US marathons, the USA Track &AMP; Field
Road Racing Information Center recently found what it termed a
significant slowing of the median time in most events between 1995
and 1998, ranging from nine minutes for the City of Los Angeles
Marathon (4:50:30 in 1995 to 4:59:55 in 1998) to 25 minutes in the
San Diego Marathon (3:56:06 to 4:20:55). Only the Boston, Big Sur,
and Cleveland Revco marathons saw faster median finishing times, by
about two minutes, while New York stayed about the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the median finishing time _ meaning half of the runners
finished earlier and half later _ at Boston was 3:37:46, about 16
minutes faster than Cleveland, its closest rival in the sample. The
slowest median was LA's 4:59:55, with the last finisher coming in
just one second shy of 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased that it has begun to attract top athletes the
past few years, with Simon Bor of Kenya winning in 2:09:25 last
month, folks at the helm of the Los Angeles Marathon don't mind how
long it takes everyone else to finish, and even encourage walkers
to join in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's about a race, and I know it's about those guys
winning all the cash, but it's also for the citizens of the city,''
said Bill Burke, race president. ``When Pheidippides (the Greek
warrior who dashed to Athens with news of the Battle of Marathon in
490 B.C.) ran, did anybody ask him what his time was? The challenge
is the distance, and if you don't believe that I think you've got a
screw loose. The idea here is to test the human spirit. The test is
not the time; the test is the 26.2 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no, says Tom Derderian, author of ``Boston Marathon: The
History of the World's Premier Running Event'' and a coach of the
Greater Boston Track Club. ``Other marathons have strayed from the
idea of being a supreme test of a person's endurance,'' argued
Derderian, who has run Boston 14 times and finished 18th, in
2:19:04, in 1975. People, he said, have begun to look at finishing
a marathon in 2 1/2 or 6 hours ``as if it's the same. There isn't
the sense that it's a race. That's why I'm against the marathon
getting dumbed down, that everybody is a winner. That's telling
young people it's not worth trying, that you won't get the respect
for your extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major purpose of a race,'' said Derderian, ``is to see
who's the fastest, and the second fastest, and the third fastest,
and so on. When it gets to the point that a lot of people in the
race don't care who's fastest and just want to finish, then it
ceases to be a race.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, assumes the marathon is, and should be, a race
for everyone in it, not just for the elite athletes chasing prize
money or the age-group aces going after trophies. But for many
newcomers these days, the marathon is an event, one to be
legitimately savored as the culmination of a fitness or
fund-raising campaign. At the Suzuki Rock 'n' Roll Marathon that
debuted last year in San Diego, almost one third of the 19,978
entrants were raising money for the Leukemia Society, which took in
$15.6 million in a single day. The median finishing time was second
slowest in the sample.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon also was more
than half female. The rise in the number of women running marathons
_ in 1995, 23 percent of finishers were women; by 1998, that figure
had jumped to 30.5 percent _ is likely contributing at least
slightly to an overall slowing of times.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor some see as slowing marathon times is a system of
``walk breaks'' popularized by Jeff Galloway, an Atlanta author and
member of the 1972 Olympic team at 10,000 meters who conducts
clinics around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Designed as brief respites to keep a marathoner's legs fresh
late into the race so he or she can actually end up running faster
than usual, ``Gallowalking,'' say some skeptics, has given
premeditated walking too much of a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Newfound runners think ``what the hell, you can always walk,''
said Martin. ``Then you find people who walk longer than they run.
I guess it's human nature: Give someone an inch and they'll take a
mile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Galloway sees his program as a way to get _ and keep _
people exercising and feeling good about it. ``You get a tremendous
feeling of accomplishment regardless of the speed,'' he said. ``In
most cases, these folks do a marathon and they feel when they
finish they are just as good as the winner of the race. Not as
fast, but just as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they're realistic. ``A great percentage in that first
running boom (in the late 1970s, during Bill Rodgers's heyday) set
qualifying for Boston as a goal, when they didn't it was a major
blow. This is a different generation; whereas they'd love to do it,
life goes on. Almost all of them stay into exercise because they go
into it for the right reasons. They're not trying to get a time
goal, which can create burnout and disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a concession that typifies the complex debate, Martin praises
Galloway as someone who ``has probably done more to help the common
person make running a lifestyle than anyone around. He correctly
emphasizes that unless you're trying to be a competitive athlete,
look at your marathon as an experiment in fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Boston. Although the BAA in 1994 began
granting some bib numbers to charities in a program that has grown
to about 1,000 runners for 15 organizations, the overall spirit of
the race remains just that: a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's needed,'' said Don Kardong, who placed fourth in
the 1976 Olympic marathon and is president of the Road Runners Club
of America. ``People in the sport look to Boston for some special
qualities. My perception is that Boston still has a very strong
identity, and it's the right one based on its history. I don't
think it's wrong for the sport's most famous event to have
requirements to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kardong _ who ran a 2:14:07 here in 1978 but
won't be approaching that on Monday when he'll be running with a
cellular telephone to take calls from Runner's World readers _
believes ``it's also been good on the other end to make the
marathon accessible to people who don't think of themselves as
marathoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Burfoot put it: ``I continue to believe the road is wide
enough and long enough for everyone.''

MOST RUNNERS ACCEPT THE NEED TO QUALIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- These are the times that try men's soles.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours 10 minutes. Three hours 15 minutes. Three hours 20
minutes. And on. And on.
</P>
<P>
   And these are the times that try women's soles.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours 40 minutes. Three hours 45 minutes. And so forth.
</P>
<P>
   They are numbers and times that many runners live by. Times that
are posted on bulletin boards. Entered in notebooks. Etched in
memories.
</P>
<P>
   They are earn-a-number numbers. Qualifying times. Finish a
sanctioned marathon in the approved time for your age group and
you, too, can run the Boston Marathon with an official number.
</P>
<P>
   You're a 45-year-old male? Better be able to cover the 26.2
miles in 3 hours 25 minutes. You're a female, age 53? Four hours,
even, is the target time.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying times, unique to Boston, have served the Marathon
well for nearly three decades now. Since 1990 they have remained
unchanged _ starting with 3 hours 10 minutes for men ages 18 to 34
and 3 hours 40 minutes for women in the same age group _ and should
stay the same through at least next year, said race director Guy
Morse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will continue to be the standard. We have no plans to
change the qualifying times, especially for the year 2000,'' Morse
said. ``They'll stay the same. We haven't looked beyond that, nor
do I believe we will. We get a fair amount of feedback all over the
board. Some people can't attain them and think they're too strict.
Others can, and think they should be tighter. By and large, people
are happy. It's a standard they're able to aspire to. It's a
barometer, a good way to test yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner's World magazine ran an on-line poll on Boston Marathon
qualifying standards in February and received 650 responses. Of
those, 270, or 41.5 percent, voted to leave them where they are.
Another 131, 20.2 percent, wanted to make the standards tougher.
And only 28, or 4.3 percent, wanted to make them easier. Other
options listed were to eliminate charity and club entries (17.5
percent), first-come, first-serve entry (8.3), and bring back the
lottery for additional entries (8.2).
</P>
<P>
   The consensus: Keep the times. ``The opinion you hear most often
is they have a standard that is attainable, but not easy,'' said
Parker Morse, on-line editor at Runner's World and no relation to
the race director. ``It actually makes the event something bigger.
It's not like a race where you drop an entry check in the mail and
line up. It means something to do the race. I think a lot of
runners see it that way. For a lot of people, this is their
Olympics. They go through the trials at whatever race they choose
to qualify in, and then Boston is their big show.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker Morse is shooting for The Show. New to marathoning, he
tried to qualify twice last fall. He didn't finish the first race
after becoming dehydrated. In the second, he was 11 1/2 minutes off
his qualifying mark of 3 hours 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 23 miles, I was figuring out there was no way I was
going to make the qualifying standard,'' Morse said. ``I was also
thinking, about five seconds later, `Why would I want to do this
again?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is thinking he will try again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like by getting a qualifying time, I'll be valid,''
Morse said. ``It's almost like a validation that you're actually
capable of doing a marathon well. There is a lot of pride to it.
But then you start throwing in that there are a lot of people who
probably aren't ever going to qualify. It's like you're closing the
door on half the congregation and saying this is one service you
just can't attend. That's a hard thing to do, especially with a
sport as inclusive as running is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what bothers Dave Sargent of Hollis, N.H., a four-time
qualifier and longtime member of the Gate City Striders running
club. ``Before I was able to qualify, I thought, `Gee, it was
something special,' '' said Sargent, who figures he may have run
Boston for the last time. ``Now that I've done it four times, I see
people who want to run it and have never run a marathon before and
it changes their perspective. It becomes all-encompassing. Some
feel like they haven't become a runner unless they qualify for
Boston, and that can set people back. If they don't make it, it's
like they failed. That's not what running is all about in my book.
In my book, running is about a lot of accomplishments and not about
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Raiche of Nashua, N.H., is a runner who believes in the
standards, though he is excited about running Boston Monday and has
never run a marathon and thus never qualified. He received one of
the 10 Boston numbers handed out to the Gate City Striders for his
work with the club. ``It's part of the tradition with Boston,'' he
said of qualifying. ``It's been one of their rules for a long time
and they've held on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Athletic Association initiated qualifying rules in
1970 to help control the size of the field. ``A runner must submit
the certification of either the Long Distance Running chairman of
the AAU of this district or his college coach that he has trained
sufficiently to finish the course in less than four hours: This is
not a jogging race,'' read the official entry form for the 1970
Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '70s and '80s, qualifying standards changed every
few years until the current numbers were settled upon in 1990. The
race field has grown in recent years, and this year 1,200 more
runners are expected than a year ago, pushing the field to about
12,700, expected to be the second-biggest field behind the 38,708
that ran the 100th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve, 13, or 14 thousand is very manageable,'' Guy Morse
said. ``We know we can do it; we did the 38,000 and more in the
100th. We're not looking to do that again, at least in my lifetime,
but it's certainly something we proved we can do. Anything in the
mid-teens is exactly where this race should be.''

INDIANOPLIS THROWS A KINK INTO THE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One dumb trade changed my plans. I was prepared to gloat this
morning. I was going to remind you that my status as king of the
cosmos allows me to see the sports future. Many skeptics doubt me.
But thousands of the Dalai Lama's fans refer to me as the Holley
Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't we been over this before? I can see the unseen. Two
months ago, I told you that this was Edgerrin James's weekend to
become a Patriot. And the Pats might have acquired the University
of Miami running back if stupidity hadn't struck in the Midwest
Thursday. You know, it's hard to make a living seeing the future
when the Indianapolis Colts are a part of your present.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL draft is Saturday and the Pats need a running back.
Perfect. James would have been the man for them. He is 20 years
old. He ran the ball well at a school that is known for great
passers. At one point, he could have matched Ricky Williams in the
categories of quickness and dreadlocks. The test-happy NFL types
have said that James scored below average on their intelligence
tests. But since when did a football field become the 100-Yard
Think Tank? If he can answer two questions, he's all right with me:
</P>
<P>
   Can you locate the first-down marker in this picture?
</P>
<P>
   Can you find a hole when Max Lane and Todd Rucci don't always
produce one?
</P>
<P>
   But that's nearly moot. The Colts made it that way by throwing a
smoke bomb into the draft's top five, sending a few teams
scattering.
</P>
<P>
   How did they do that? They gave a Pro Bowl running back to the
St. Louis Rams. Dick Vermeil must have felt as if he were in the
NFL's version of Filene's Basement Thursday. The coach dangled a
second- and fifth-round draft pick to the Colts and they gave him
Marshall Faulk. For the fashion heads among us, this is akin to
giving someone a pair of dusty Lee jeans in exchange for a stack of
new Maurice Malones.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Faulk who rushed for 1,319 yards, caught 86
passes for nearly 1,000 more and scored 10 times last season. The
Rams began the day with June Henley (313 yards last season) as
their starter and ended it by adding 1,000 yards and the
26-year-old Faulk. I think someone should introduce the Rams to
Maria Grasso, who recently went from babysitter to multimillionaire
in a couple minutes. Did the Colts, holding the No. 4 pick in the
draft, even ask for the Rams' first-rounder (No. 6)?
</P>
<P>
   As you might have guessed, none of this is good for the Pats.
That's because the Colts now have a jones for Williams and the
surprising whispers are that the Eagles do, too. The Eagles pick
second. So let's say the Colts can't move up in the draft and the
Eagles select Williams. You know what that means, right? The Colts,
with a hole in their backfield, would have to take James. In that
case, not only would the Pats' trade talks with the Redskins
(picking fifth) lose a little energy, the team would have to see
James in its own division.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you are angry and confused. The Holley Lama is here to
soothe your pain. I will give you a free counseling session and
tell you whom to blame for all this: The Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Colts owner Jim Irsay said in a statement
Thursday, ``the Colts have decided to take a different direction as
preparations continue for the 1999 season.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Irsay been spending too much time around his PlayStation
console? That's the only time you see trades like this. Now, just
think if you could do brain swaps. If you could place the brain of
the Colts into the cranium of the Redskins, you might be able to
order your own Pats ``JAMES'' jersey as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their repulsive nickname (I can see that column in my
sports future), the Redskins are smart. The Pats called them last
week and asked about the No. 5 pick. Some people have speculated
that the Washingtonians asked for safety Lawyer Milloy. They
didn't. At least not at first. They first inquired about Ty Law.
Then they asked about Terry Glenn. The Pats politely declined. The
sides were able to resume discussions this week _ with Law and
Glenn not included _ but a chance of making a deal is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, I was convinced that Bobby Grier and
Pete Carroll were exaggerating their interest in moving up in the
draft. Since this is the time of year when NFL types lie the most,
I thought they were talking about moving up simply to excite their
fans. But they were serious about James. And Williams, too.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Hardy, Williams's agent, says he has been in touch with
New England representatives. But Hardy still believes his client is
going to the Browns, who pick first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Browns owner) Al Lerner is in the credit-card
business, so I know he knows about risk minimization,'' Hardy said
Wednesday night. ``And it would seem to me that the ultimate
low-risk choice is to take the single most productive player in the
draft. A man who did the job for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said he was not concerned about the typical draft
questions. They emerge at this time each year. Someone is not smart
enough, big enough, or quick enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this age of Starr-esque investigations,'' Hardy said,
``that's par for the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone should investigate the Colts. Their questionable
intellect makes it difficult to see the sports future. I am tempted
to tell you that the Pats will not draft Boston College's Damien
Woody in the first round. I am tempted to add that they may
surprise everyone at No. 20 and select Tulane's Shaun King to back
up quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts have stripped me of my confidence. Now I have to
wait for the draft in suspense, just like everyone else.

WITH A LITTLE EFFORT, `LIFE' IS FUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Life'' has every reason to be funny. It stars Eddie Murphy and
Martin Lawrence, two very amusing guys. Its plot is a comic rehash
of ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' which seems a little weird at
first, but hey, we're game. And it's charmed by the absolute
goodwill of the audience, who want a movie starring Eddie Murphy
and Martin Lawrence to be _ what's the expression? _ a laff riot.
</P>
<P>
   And it is. Sometimes. A little bit. Off and on. If you're in a
terrific mood, if you're washing down Goobers with two quarts of
caffeinated fizz, if you're not paying a baby sitter five bucks an
hour, and if you try really, really hard. Then it's hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' was directed by Ted Demme, whose last two feature films
were deadly serious (``Monument Ave.'') and half-serious
(``Beautiful Girls''). You have to go back five years, to ``The
Ref,'' to find another Demme comedy _ about bickering yuppies and
the exhausted cat burglar who holds them hostage. It was obnoxious
but entertaining, working hit-or-miss humor out of a nasty
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' is similarly uneven: It's flat at the start, dour in
the middle, funny in bursts throughout. But it leaves a sweet taste
in the mouth, and if the Murphy-Lawrence pairing never ignites in a
blaze of comic genius, at least they make a darn cute couple. You
couldn't find two more adorable life inmates of a Mississippi state
prison. (You couldn't find a more adorable prison.) And by story's
end, when Murphy and Lawrence are teetering oldsters with heroic
makeup jobs, the film has morphed from a lame buddy caper into an
endearing little portrait of cantankerous friends.
</P>
<P>
   The tale begins in 1932, in a Harlem speakeasy. In walk two
guys: One, Ray (Murphy), is a two-bit criminal; the other, Claude
(Lawrence), is a young dweeb with a new bank job. Fate throws them
together when they can't pay their bills _ and Ray promises a goon
named Spanky (Rick James) that a quick moonshine run to Mississippi
should settle the matter. So down they go. And there they bump up
against bad luck, getting arrested, convicted and thrown in the pen
for a murder they didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' wastes 36 soporific minutes before sending its stars to
prison; once they get there, the film wakes up. Not surprisingly,
Ray and Claude encounter a full complement of stock prison
characters: the gruff-but-good-egg sergeant (Nick Cassavetes, who
directed ``She's So Lovely''), the enormous bully (Michael ``Bear''
Taliferro), the bemused observer (Obba Babatunde), the bespectacled
kid (Guy Torry).
</P>
<P>
   The movie also throws in an athletically gifted mute (Bokeem
Woodbine) and a bandana-capped cross-dresser (Miguel A. Nunez Jr.),
just for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   None of what happens is particularly surprising _ the
screenplay, by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, follows a well-trod
course _ but the leads bungle their way through prison life with
charming wrong-headedness. Murphy goes on a few brilliant comic
tangents, one of them involving a pocket watch, one a slice of
cornbread (``I'm from New York City, dammit! Nobody takes no
cornbread from me!''). And Lawrence makes a disarming nerd.
</P>
<P>
   Demme's film is spotty. It's unimaginative. It brazenly rips off
``The Shawshank Redemption,'' ``The Bad News Bears'' and
``Spartacus.'' It uses way too much profanity for a film set
(partly) in 1932. It's ridiculous, weepy, cliched, manipulative and
rude. Then again, that's life.

SAND OR BLEACH RUST FROM CORIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have an antique house which is beautiful, but the bathroom
sink is Corian, and the rust in the water has stained the bowl a
dark beige color. How can I remove those stains?
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE MURRAY, Mendon, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try a little bleach. Put liquid chlorine bleach on a small
spot to see if it works; if it does, then do the whole sink. Or,
sand the stains off; that is the standard way to remove stains on
Corian. Use the finest sandpaper you can find, and wet the surface
first. Or use water and emery cloth. The fineness of the sandpaper
or emery will keep scratches to a minimum, the water is a lubricant
to help prevent scratching.
</P>
<P>
   Or, instead of sandpaper or emery, you can use a coarse Scotch
pad; it will take longer to reduce the stain but will scratch less.
</P>
<P>
   A final possibility is an old remedy to get stains out of cast
iron and fiberglass bathtubs. Wet the sink with hydrogen peroxide,
sprinkle a goodly amount of cream of tartar on that, leave for an
hour, then scrub and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Corian, we received a friendly but firm rebuttal of
our recent claim that Corian is good for kitchen counters, that
stains are easily sanded off, and that it is just wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Jenny Luongo of Acton, Mass.: ``I just read your answer to
a couple wanting to know if Corian is a good material for the
kitchen. It is not. In this house we specialize in ``research''
(never really accomplishing anything major but looking into
everything so thoroughly that we know exactly what we would have
done if we ever did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband . . . installed a slab of Corian next to the stove
and I use it as one of my main cooking countertops. I cook a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corian stains badly and scratches easily. Sure you can bleach
the stain and sure you can sand the shallow scratches, but then the
sanding marks show. So you sand the whole thing and change the
surface of the entire piece. The shine/smoothness is gone. And I
bet a bacteriologist would have a field day identifying everything
that could happily reside in microscopic sandpaper scratches on
Corian.
</P>
<P>
   ``And price: You can do two changes of Formica for the price of
one Corian. Bathrooms OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! says the handyman, and thanks; it adds to the handyman's
vast info file.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Luongo has some good points, and missed one: Corian is
sensitive to heat. However, the finer the sandpaper or Scotch pads,
the fewer scratches and the more shine, I think. And even burn
marks can be sanded.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what makes the ball game It is called communication
and is much appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a half-inch space between my new gutters and the edge
of the roof. I am afraid that bugs will get into the attic, and
possibly wind-blown rain. What can I do about them?
</P>
<P>
   M.J., Winthrop, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The half-inch space between your new gutters and the edge of
the roof may have been created deliberately to ventilate the attic
at the eaves, or perhaps to add ventilation, which is a good idea
if there was no ventilation orignally. If so the space should be
screened to keep out insects. If the gutters are not overflowing
and are draining properly, there should be no problem, even with
blowing rain and snow, particularly if the roof overhangs the wall.
</P>
<P>
   If the attic floor is insulated, which is should be, then this
additional ventilation will cause no problem; the attic should be
cold. After all, the vents on the roof are already making the attic
cold.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't need the ventilation, and if the space was left
there accidentally, it had nothing to do with the dimension of the
lumber; a properly-sized board could have been cut to fit the
opening. If the space was left accidentally, the carpenter was
incompetent, and should make the proper repairs. A half-inch-wide
board can be inserted in that space and the eaves will be as good
as original.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My old Victorian has some fine old metal tiles 4 1/4 inches
square. Some of them have been ruined. I have called many places
without luck in trying to locate some for replacement. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN NATALE, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Possibly. Try one of these: The Restoration Resources Store,
offering authentic and reproduction restoration items, 200 A
Webster St. Hanover, MA 02339; telephone 781-878-3794.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Boston Marathon does business on a first-name
basis.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Moses and Joseph and John and Juma and Ibrahim and
Cosmas and Gelindo and Uta and Elana and Tegla and Fatuma have
ensured Boston showcases the top marathoners from around the world.
Year after year, spectators who line the 26.2 miles from Hopkinton
to Copley Square watch the most competitive marathon fields.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time in the history of the sport, three
men broke the 2:08 barrier in the same race. Winner Moses Tanui
finished in 2:07:34, and fellow Kenyan Joseph Chebet crossed the
line three seconds later. South African Gert Thys placed third in
2:07:52.
</P>
<P>
   In return for such history-making performances, sponsor John
Hancock provides the elite runners with an unmatched reception that
extends from arrival at the Athletes' Village to race day and
beyond. The Boston Marathon's commitment to bringing in the best
regardless of nationality makes the race unique. But its commitment
to the athlete as an individual truly sets the event apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know who these athletes are when they come here,'' said
Mark Wetmore, managing director of Global Athletics and Marketing
and agent for three-time men's champion Cosmas Ndeti and two-time
defending women's champion Fatuma Roba. ``They have a lot of
respect for the athletes. I don't know if it's because Boston is a
rich sports town or because the Marathon is so big, but they know
who the elites are as they run by. In New York, they clap and say
great job whoever you are, but in Boston they knew who Juma was,
they know Cosmas, Ibrahim, Moses. They know all these guys and
that's something you don't see at a lot of other places. They cheer
for them by name and the athletes can hear that along the course.''
</P>
<P>
   But the support isn't exclusive to race day. During their stay
in Boston, the top runners are treated like celebrities with a
staff of volunteers ready to take care of their every need,
allowing the athletes to focus on the race. Schoolchildren in
Hopkinton squeal with delight on Kenyan Day when they are
introduced to each elite runner from the East African nation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Ndeti was greeted by a two-minute standing ovation when
he celebrated his victory by attending a Celtics game. The public
address announcer did not need to identify Ndeti as the reigning
Marathon champion and course record-holder. The crowd knew and
Ndeti's bald head was instantly recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Ndeti and his countrymen have won the past eight Boston
Marathons. In 1998, they took three of the top five places. In
1997, Kenyans captured five of the top seven spots. And in 1996,
Kenyans swept the top five places and seven of the top eight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, nine Kenyans will compete for the men's title, and
Catherine Ndereba hopes to bring home the country's first title in
the women's race.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan dominance of Boston during the 1990s has not sparked
concern on the part of Hancock officials and race organizers, but
has been warmly welcomed as the byproduct of an ultra-competitive
field.
</P>
<P>
   However, other American races have tried to limit the number of
Kenyan participants. Last year, the Bolder Boulder race in Colorado
drew criticism for its attempt to limit Kenyan entrants to three
with a team format. Other races have awarded prize money only to
Americans or no prize money at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some races are attempting to encourage American runners by
increasing prize money for US athletes, and using team formats that
restrict entrants by nationality while granting exemptions to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Some who finance US races do not want to provide Kenyan athletes
with tens of thousands of dollars while shortchanging Americans who
can't keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   Some sponsors want to stop the Kenyan dominance with new rules,
not competition. The perception is that American spectators have
trouble identifying with and relating to foreign athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to events and hear people talking that sponsors don't
want to see runners all from one country win races,'' said agent
Luis Posso, who heads Posso International Promotions and represents
elite distance runners from 30 countries. ``I don't think races
bring out the personalities in all these runners. There are a lot
of good stories behind every runner. The Boston Marathon is
different. John Hancock gets runners involved in the community.
They have a program for runners. They educate people about the
runners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Marathon has proved to be the exception, inviting the
world's best regardless of nationality. And John Hancock breaks
down the perceived monolith by emphasizing and promoting the
individual through clinics and exposure the week prior to the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is a very old marathon and most of the people in Boston
know about sports and how to organize athletes,'' Tanui said.
``This is one of the most important things (the organization). For
example, when I am running (spectators) call my name all along the
course. It's a wonderful marathon to go to. Everybody knows almost
all the runners when they pass by. Everybody likes to help the
athletes and this is different from other marathons. With John
Hancock you feel like you are at home and you can concentrate on
the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember last year they were talking about only three or
four Kenyans in some American races. But John Hancock decided to
run an international race. In an international race, it doesn't
matter where you come from so long as you are the best. I think
this has made Boston stronger. They have decided to take the
athletes that are stronger. To compete with three is not a
competition. This is also making Boston unique, inviting all the
athletes no matter where they come from.''
</P>
<P>
   And the big names keep coming.

2 CLOSE RACES EXPECTED IN WHEELCHAIR BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Franz Nietlispach has won the Boston Marathon men's
wheelchair division the last two years. The Swiss racer could very
well make it three straight on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franz is a great marathon racer, and I understand he's in good
shape,'' said Belmont's Bob Hall, the pioneer of Boston's
wheelchair divisions. ``When he comes to race, he's the factor to
beat. But you have to respect Krige Schabort, who was second last
year, and Saul Mendoza, who was third.''
</P>
<P>
   Schabort does an excellent job climbing the many hills along the
Boston course. And Mendoza has been hot _ he's won every major race
since Boston last year. Mendoza raised more than a few eyebrows
when he won at Los Angeles, beating world record-holder Heinz Frei.
(Frei isn't racing Boston, even though this is where he set his
mark of 1:21:23 in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   In last year's race, Nietlispach won in 1:21:52, a personal
best. Schabort also recorded a personal best (1:26:37), as did
Mendoza (1:26:38).
</P>
<P>
   Said Hall, who in 1975 became the first wheelchair athlete to
officially race at Boston: ``It couldn't be closer among the
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of the women's division, which shapes up
as a potential duel between two-time defending champion Louise
Sauvage of Australia and Jean Driscoll of Champaign, Ill., who won
seven straight from 1990-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise and Jean are excellent,'' said Hall, ``but also keep an
eye on Edith Hunkeler of Switzerland and Chantal Petitclerc from
Quebec. These ladies are good. After our marathon last spring, all
four of them raced in a marathon in Switzerland and were only two
seconds apart at the finish. So anything can happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32, Driscoll is the eldest of the quartet, with Sauvage 25,
Hunkeler 26, and Petitclerc 29. But she doesn't think age will be a
factor. ``I think some parts of my body slowed down a bit since the
early '90s,'' she said, ``but nothing to bother me as a racer.''
</P>
<P>
   A local woman could end up in the mix. Rose Winand, a
39-year-old Bostonian, will make her sixth straight start here and
eighth overall. She was third in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECOND STRAIGHT START FOR SUCH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Such has a special feeling about competing in the Boston
Marathon, he says, because spectators look at him as an athlete
first and a person in a wheelchair second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston fans are educated about athletes in wheelchairs,
and I'm very comfortable there,'' says the native of Puerto Rico,
who lives in Wilkes Barre, Pa. ``People don't look at you and think
you're different. They just accept you for what you are, and I
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Such will make his second straight Boston start, and
he's hoping for improvement on last year's ninth-place finish. One
impediment: ``The field is terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the competition, Such believes that the Marathon's
wheelchair divisions serve a greater good. ``Think of the many kids
with various disablities who are in wheelchairs today,'' says the
25-year-old. ``They really can't relate to athletes like Michael
Jordan or Mark McGwire. But they see great athletes in wheelchairs
like Jean Driscoll and Louise Sauvage and Franz Nietlispach, and
they can give a message to kids.''

NAM MAKING A NAME FOR HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Her show music is apt. ``It's `Getting to Know You'
from `The King and I,' '' she says. We got a brief and brilliant
introduction to Naomi Nari Nam in February when she zipped across
the TV screen from the US figure skating championships in Salt Lake
City during Saturday prime time and left commentator Dick Button
nearly speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my heavens, isn't that stupendous?'', he marveled, as Nam
was taking Rachmaninoff to middle school and teaching him a layback
spin. ``What a moment!''
</P>
<P>
   Then Nam collected her unexpected silver medal, gave victor
Michelle Kwan a hug on the podium _ and was gone before we really
got to know her.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Nam has made sure that her website is filled with
stuff that America might want to find out. That she was born in
Anaheim, not far from Disneyland. That she has a younger sister
named Naomi Nami Nam (`My father liked the name Naomi,' she says)
and that they go by their middle names. That her favorite actor is
Leonardo DiCaprio, her favorite color is periwinkle blue, her
favorite animal the snow tiger. That she collects Beanie Babies.
That her grandfather, who used to skate to school in North Korea,
took her to the Ice Chalet when she was five and nobody could get
her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   We might have known all that sooner if Nam had been able to take
on the Russians at last month's world championships in Helsinki.
But she was too young to go and she'll still be too young next year
(the minimum age is 15) unless she can squeeze through the loophole
by winning a world junior medal.
</P>
<P>
   Nam is so young that her King and I is a movie cartoon. ``She
hasn't seen Yul Brynner yet,'' says coach John Nicks.
</P>
<P>
   But she isn't too young to hit the exhibition circuit _ she'll
be performing in Ice Chips in Boston through Saturday. She isn't
too young to have a fan club, or to have every rink denizen from
Chatham to Costa Mesa already labeling her ``can't miss'' for the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   All Nam has to do is get her triple lutz down cold and polish
her artistry and find a way to get herself in front of
Olympic-level judges the way Sarah Hughes, her 13-year-old friend
and rival, did.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes would have been too young for the world championships,
too, but she got to go because she was a junior medalist. Nam, who
had finished two places ahead of Hughes in Salt Lake, got to watch
on TV as Hughes finished a startling seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I was rooting for her,'' Nam says. ``She did very
well. Sometimes you think, ohhh, I wish I was at Worlds. But Sarah
and I are really good friends and I'm so happy for her that she
could do all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nam says, she knew she couldn't go to Helsinki, even
though she thinks the rule is ``weird.'' This was a bonus year for
her, anyway. Nam moved up to seniors only because the Olympics are
just three years away and it made no sense to spin her wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I thought I should move up sooner and experience the senior
level earlier,'' Nam says, ``instead of staying back in juniors
waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam has never been much for waiting. She dashed up skating's
stair steps _ juvenile, intermediate, novice, junior, senior _ in
five years. She had the spins, she had the jumps. Why not? But
moving up to seniors wasn't so much a technical question as it was
artistic, and Nam knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to tell the judges that I'm not a little 13-year-old,
that I'm a senior lady,'' she says. ``So I wanted to go out there
and perform like a senior lady. I had to have mature music and
simple and elegant costumes. And I had to work more on presenting
to the audience and not looking down.''
</P>
<P>
   So Nam went with something sprightly (Cirque du Soleil) and
something sophisticated (Rachmaninoff piano concertos) and made a
stunning debut in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   After crashing on her combination jump (``Well, it was supposed
to be a combination jump'') in the short program and whacking her
head on the ice, Nam shook it off and finished up. ``I was a little
confused,'' she confesses. ``I was wondering if I should go on or
go to the referee and stop. But I thought it was a really good
choice to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nam stole the show in the long program, then burst into tears
when she realized what she'd done. Just competing against Kwan was
a thrill, she said. Standing next to her on the podium was ``a
dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two months have passed in a blur. Nam skated in South
Korea, where her parents were born. She explained the Naomi-Naomi
sibling thing to Jay Leno on the ``Tonight'' show. She performed on
the Rockefeller Center rink and signed on with the Champions on Ice
tour for its West Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a relaxed year with nothing much happening,''
muses her coach. ``It didn't quite work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nari Nam is zipping through town this weekend, but she'll
be back for the US championships at the FleetCenter in 2001. By
then, a few hundred million people will have gotten to know her.
And she'll have seen the Yul Brynner version.

GUY MORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE PACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- On the morning of April 15, 1996, a division-sized
throng of runners boarded 654 buses on Boston Common for the
26-mile ride to Hopkinton High School whence at high noon they ran
back _ 38,708 strong _ down a major commuter highway right into the
heart of a major city.
</P>
<P>
   That the 100th anniversary of the Boston Marathon, whose field
had swelled to three times normal size _ straining every system
needed to handle such a human tide of runners and spectators _ came
off with relative ease may not be attributable to just one man. But
few observers who were around in the decade before, when the
world's most famous footrace was in sad decline, believe that
without the steady hand of director Guy Morse at the helm, Boston
could have come through the centennial so well and be standing at
its current pinnacle of organization and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Even Johnny ``The Elder'' Kelley, whose involvement with Boston
stretches back eight decades, declared: ``It's better today. With
women runners and sponsorship money, it's much better today.''
</P>
<P>
   Few veterans would have argued such a thing in the '80s, when,
as Marathon historian Tom Derderian observed: ``Of all the
vicissitudes the Boston Marathon had survived since 1897, including
two world wars, two lesser wars, and a major economic depression,
it was the 1980s, peace, and money that nearly killed it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, most other major marathons offered prize money
to attract the elite runners while Boston kept its blue nose
resolutely in the air. What about _ Gasp! _ amateur purity?
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the world's top runners, who once had competed for
a trophy and a laurel wreath, now followed the big-time marathon
circuit that made them, for the first time, a legion of pro
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest insult to the old way of doing things came
in 1984 when Geoff Smith, the only runner in his class, won the
race, literally walking across the finish line as if to say, ``So
where's the competition?''
</P>
<P>
   The decade that began with the infamy of Rosie Ruiz and a phoned
death threat on Bill Rodgers seemed destined to dump the Boston
Marathon into the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the worst insult of all was that New York, so
detested in the sports eyes of Bostonians, now bragged that the Big
Apple hosted the premiere marathon of the East.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, behind the scenes, a disastrous attempt to
remedy the problem was being worked out. The Boston Athletic
Association's Will Cloney, who was eventually forced out as race
director, signed a quiet deal with Boston lawyer Marshall Medoff,
giving him sole rights to the sponsorship of the race, which Medoff
proceded to turn into a profit-making venture.
</P>
<P>
   As howls of protest arose, it was clear that a new direction was
necessary, and in 1983 Guy Morse was bought in as an interim
administrator. He was made full-time race director in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   His first years, says Morse, were devoted to turning the race
from an amateur to professional event with structure and funding to
befit the race's stature as an annual institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got to my office, I had a staff of one, one
office in the Boston Garden, one rotary phone on the floor,'' said
Morse, a 1974 Northeastern graduate who lives in Centerville on
Cape Cod with wife, Nancy, and four children. ``Over the last 15
years we've become a viable, first-class organization. It's a
year-round effort now. I have surrounded myself with the best
people in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a full-time staff of 15 and offices in Boston and
Hopkinton, Morse sticks to what he considers his most important
article of faith: ``You're only as good as the people around you.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an organizing committee of about 60 volunteers
works throughout the year seeing to the kinds of details _ from a
medical team to security forces _ that are easy to take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still fundamentally _ as all great events are _ a
volunteer operation. A lot of the people here predate me. The
amount of experience is just incredible, and it makes my life
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock was the first and is still the major sponsor of the
race. There are now 17 corporate sponsors, which help raise the $5
million budget the Marathon needs yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it takes to present the event at the level we like
to keep it,'' said Morse. ``We try to keep the marathon as
noncommercial as we can. That's part of the charm and the value of
the event.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big part of the job is organization within the eight
cities and towns that the race passes through. The race, he says,
is as much regional as it is historic, and all the towns have an
equal share.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the years, Boston's dreaded sports foe, New York,
has claimed its superiority over Boston. But, says Morse, this is
true in size only. New York has more than 30,000 running annually,
almost three times the size of Boston's numbered runners, who must
qualify. New York runners do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be less of that attitude now,'' said Morse, who
has studied marathon presentations all over the world. ``New York
is run on a Sunday, so there's a (TV) network associated with it,
and of course the Boston tradition is that it's run on Patriots'
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, with cable being so strong, we provide Boston to a
nationwide audience. But our race is more manageable, and the
quality of the runners is much higher here because of those
qualifying standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of spectator coverage, there are more spectators here
and we have a much more knowledgeable crowd by virtue of the
generations of people who have been watching this event. And we get
1,400 credentialed press members from around the world, much
greater than New York or anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, added Morse, after the Super Bowl, in terms of press
coverage the Boston Marathon is the next largest single-day
sporting event in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key decision was to offer prize money,'' said Morse.
``That set the marathon on a new course. But the biggest challenge
is to maintain the delicate balance between the prestige and
tradition of the old marathon and the forces of change. It takes
constant vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it no longer was a question of whether to offer prize
money, the real question we always deal with is how much bigger
does it get, how much more commercial? That's where the pressure is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many longtime marathon fans remember wistfully the years when
the two John Kelleys starred in the race, when Maine's Joan Benoit
and Boston's own Billy Rodgers were the marquee names, and the BAA
had several runners among the top finishers.
</P>
<P>
   Now (and seemingly for the forseeable future) the elite spots
belong to foreign runners, with the Kenyan men dominating this
decade, while the women winners have come from Europe and Africa.
The price of prize money, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morse says, other races in this country have been hurt
more by foreign dominance than Boston. ``We have always been an
international event,'' he said. ``We had years when the Finns or
the Japanese dominated. There have been many years when the
Americans were not the top finishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think over several years that will change. American athletes
are learning from the Kenyans now. And to a large extent, our race
has so much prestige that the Kenyans who have been winning lately
become honorary Bostonians. They have become our biggest goodwill
ambassadors all over the world where they race. Boston is always
the premiere marathon.''

SOME SEE BARGAIN IN SECURITY DYNAMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some value-oriented investors think they may have spotted a
bargain in Security Dynamics Technologies, a small company in
Bedford, Mass. For those who think value is an outdated concept on
Wall Street, it should be pointed out that there is also an
Internet angle to this story, so pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Security Dynamics makes computer security software, presumably a
good business to be in at a time when people are using their
computers more and worrying whether the information they are
storing and sending is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Security Dynamics owns 2.6 million shares of VeriSign, an
Internet start-up that is also in the security business. VeriSign's
stock has climbed from 28 in October to 156, largely on the
strength of Internet fever.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Thursday's big Internet sell-off, Security Dynamics'
stake in VeriSign was worth about $400 million. On top of that,
Security Dynamics has about $200 million in cash. If you are doing
the arithmetic that is $600 million worth of assets _ less if you
take out the taxes Security Dynamics would have to pay if it sold
VeriSign.
</P>
<P>
   The total market value of Security Dynamics is about $650
million, which means the stock market is placing precious little
value on the rest of the company's business, which is both growing
and profitable. ``The market isn't doing the math,'' complains Nick
Moore, a money manager with Jurika &AMP; Boyles in California. ``There
is value here staring you right in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is Wall Street so indifferent to Security Dynamics? And why
doesn't the company get much credit for its Internet link?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say part of the problem is that Security Dynamics is
not a pure Internet play. If you are excited about VeriSign, why
not just buy VeriSign, they say. And then there is Security
Dynamics' credibility problem. In January the company reported
earnings that came in well short of Wall Street's expectations. The
stock dropped 25 percent in a day and hasn't recovered since. ``The
earnings shortfall was a significant blemish,'' says Paul Saunders,
an analyst with SoundView Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
   Management described the problem as a one-time goof. To speed
entry into new markets, the company offered generous incentives to
its sales force. The incentives worked too well. Sales went up but
commissions owed salespeople rose even faster. Security Dynamics'
executives say they have since made adjustments to the incentive
formula.
</P>
<P>
   They may be right. Security Dynamics Thursday reported
first-quarter earnings after the market closed. The numbers met
Wall Street expectations. Excluding special items, the company
earned $5.1 million, or 12 cents per share, compared to $5.7
million, or 14 cents per share, in the first quarter a year ago.
Revenue rose 21 percent to $48.7 million. Security Dynamics stock
closed at 16 1/2, down 2 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives and some money managers are bullish about the
firm's longer-term prospects. Security Dynamics is a leader in two
different kinds of computer security. One set of its products
handles authentication, computerese for how you prove you are who
you say you are when you log on to your computer. Another set of
products does encryption, the scrambling of data so outsiders can't
see what you have written.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this quarter, Security Dynamics will roll out a new
product line based on VeriSign technology. The new gear is aimed
directly at the electronic commerce market. It is widely agreed
that with better security, especially for financial information,
business on the Internet can grow even faster than it already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is right in the wheelhouse of the electronic
commerce phenomenon,'' says Brian Stack, manager of Massachusetts
Financial Services' New Discovery fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Stack and others still have plenty of questions about
Security Dynamics. Will the company be able to handle the
transition from the old generation of products to the new ones?
Will management be able to avoid the kind of screw-ups that popped
up in the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to show that we can deliver,'' concedes Arthur
Coviello, president of Security Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, of course, can't answer that question. But the value
players on Wall Street like the fact that there is so much value on
the company's balance sheet. ``To some degree it insulates you from
downside risk,'' says money manager Nick Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, it means there is some security for those
willing to buy stock in Security Dynamics.

   Japan and its potential as a market for mutual fund companies
was the subject of a Boston conference Thursday sponsored by the
National Investment Company Service Association and the Japan
Society of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Recent regulatory changes have made it easier for the Japanese
to put their money into different investment vehicles. By year's
end, the Japanese government is expected to legalize defined
contribution plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Japanese savers have $7 trillion socked away in cash. If just a
sliver of that money finds its way into mutual funds, the
opportunity for Boston-based firms could be enormous, the audience
was told. Fidelity Investments and State Street Corp. are among the
local players with operations in Japan.

KITARO REACHES AROUND DIFFERENT WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kitaro is the world-music star who combines serenely ambient
synthesizer journeys with sometimes wild bashings on ancient
Japanese drums, topped by a trippy light show worthy of Pink Floyd.
Some observers are still trying to figure him out, but meanwhile,
he's sold millions of albums around the world and been nominated
for six Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He has recorded with Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart and
Yes vocalist Jon Anderson. He led 450 taiko drummers in the closing
ceremonies at last year's Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan _ near a
house he owns when he's not living on his 150-acre spread in
Colorado. He recorded the soundtrack for Oliver Stone's ``Heaven
and Earth'' and the music for the touring circus Cirque Ingenieux.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point of view is just to keep going and follow my mission
to get as many different sounds as I can,'' says Kitaro, who
headlines Symphony Hall on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   For his new tour, besides playing drums and analog synthesizers
(which he prefers to digital synths because of their ``warmth''),
Kitaro is playing wooden flute, hammer dulcimer, and a
``waterphone.'' As he explains: ``The waterphone was created by a
California guy. It's a metal pot and you put water in the pot and
around the pot you have strings. And when you hit the strings, the
sound makes a kind of wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitaro has been making other kinds of waves with some of his
projects. One was the soundtrack to the Chinese film ``Soong
Siters,'' which is included on his new double CD, ``Best of Kitaro,
Volume II,'' on Domo Records. He recorded the orchestral soundtrack
two years ago for the movie (never shown in the United States),
which is a true story of two Shanghai daughters married to Chinese
political figures.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtrack won a Taiwan Film Award for best original
soundtrack, but Kitaro says, ``The Chinese government checked the
movie and cut some of it because of political reasons. All of a
sudden, that meant some of my soundtrack was gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitaro is renowned for the visual impact of his music _ and he's
carrying that one step further by compiling a book of his
photographs (taken at his 10,000-foot-high Colorado property) that
will be out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he's on the road with a new band. While he has
performed with musicians from all over the world on past tours,
he's honoring his Japanese roots by using an all-Japanese group for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' he says. ``I wanted to take out these
Japanese musicians because they don't have experience performing in
other countries. They're mostly 25- to 27-year-old young people.
But everybody is educated and trained in classical music. I also
have one female violin player, a female percussionist, and a female
keyboardist.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also performing four or five songs on tour from a new CD
that no one has heard yet. It's called ``The Thinking of You,'' and
he wrote it on Valentine's Day. It has ``a little romantic theme
song that I'm looking to get on a soundtrack,'' says Kitaro, whose
list of projects never ends.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Getting Godsmacked: Local rockers Godsmack have made national
headway and been added to the Ozz Fest this summer, but they've
also had to fight for their right to party. Singer Sully Erna
recently jumped offstage and crowd-surfed at the ``X Fest'' in Fort
Myers, Fla. He crawled back up, but a security guard mistook him
for a fan and tried to boot him out. Erna threw a punch and knocked
the guard unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was surreal,'' says Lee Daniels, program director for
WJBX-FM, the Florida station that put on the show. ``Everyone's
collective jaw dropped as the security guard tackled the lead
singer. But I'll tell you, the band didn't miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Godsmack news: Its major-label debut album, ``Godsmack,''
just went gold, signifying sales of more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Boston Music Awards: The Kahlua Boston Music Awards, set for
Thursday at the Orpheum Theatre, include a fresh, engaging list of
performances this year by Joey McIntyre, Godsmack, Jo Dee Messina,
Susan Tedeschi, Big Wreck, Jonatha Brooke, Buffalo Tom, Melissa
Ferrick, Martin Sexton, and Jude. Several have been hot on the
charts, especially Messina, the country singer who is the first
woman to ever score three consecutive, multiple-week No. 1 hits in
that field. (Some tickets still available for the show.)

   Gathering of the Vibes: Neo-hippie nirvana is forecast for the
Gathering of the Vibes Festival in Seaside Memorial Park in
Bridgeport, Conn., June 18-20. Camping is available on the 370-acre
site, which can accommodate 10,000 fans. The band lineup boasts
Gov't Mule, moe, John Scofield, Strangefolk, Deep Banana Blackout,
and Percy Hill. The event was booked by Terrapin Presents Inc., and
has run annually since the death of Jerry Garcia in hopes of
keeping the Deadhead community together. Tickets begin at $55 for
the three days, including camping. For more info, check the Web
site www.ttapes.com/vibes99 or call Terrapin at 800-677-8650.

BOSTON FIRM GETS GO-AHEAD TO SELL OAKLAND TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Oakland and Alameda County officials have
given a sports investment company authorization to sell the Oakland
Athletics if a qualified bidder emerges.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland-Alameda County Joint Powers Authority on Thursday
moved to allow Boston-based Game Plan LLC to evaluate any qualified
bids for the team, said Game Plan President Randy Vataha.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here have until Wednesday to find a buyer or
face the prospect of losing the baseball team to another city after
the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   A qualified bidder must agree to provide a $12 million down
payment and pay at least $122.4 million for the team. The winning
bidder must also agree to keep the team in the Oakland Coliseum
through at least 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups are expected to meet the criteria, Vataha said.
</P>
<P>
   One is a seven- to 10-member group led by former A's executive
Andy Dolich that includes clothier George Zimmer, San Francisco
advertising executive Jeff Goodby, Oakland restaurateur Raymond
Gallagher, the Oakland Tribune and Modesto grocery mogul Robert
Piccinini.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a three-man group that includes San Francisco
lawyer and former bank executive Michael Lazarus, Arizona banker
Lyle Campbell and former Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are both legitimate buyers,'' Vataha said. ``They're
both interested. They both have attorneys working around the clock
to put together bids. If somebody puts up the money, this is
definitely going to go forward in a sale.''
</P>
<P>
   If no bids are received, however, the current A's owners _ Steve
Schott and Ken Hoffman _ would be free to move the team to a new
stadium after 2001. Schott said recently that he hoped to move the
team to a new state-of-the-art stadium in Santa Clara or San Jose
if there is not bid for the Oakland team.
</P>
<P>
   But Vataha said he was reasonably sure that at least one of the
two potential buyers would put their bids in before the deadline.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FRIDAYS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed? How there were fewer cars on the road this
morning? How clogged the airports are on Thursday night? How not
exactly everybody shows up for work on Friday? For white-collar
drones, Friday _ just recently set aside for casual dressing _ now
seems reserved for casual attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, this is not a subject that personnel managers
are anxious to discuss. But it is a subject that America's leading
workplace authority, ``Dilbert'' creator Scott Adams, will talk
about. ``It is a badge of shame if you can't think of a way to
avoid work on Friday,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for this trend? Theories abound. It's true that
more mothers with children have entered the work force, and some
arrange four 10-hour workdays to maximize their time at home. More
readily than private companies, government bureaucracies have been
experimenting with flexible hours. Millions of Americans use their
computers to ``telecommute'' to the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But don't you think a lot of people are just plain goofing off?
</P>
<P>
   Logan airport tracks passenger traffic, and ``Thursday night is
known as the busiest night,'' says a spokesman, Jeremy Crockford.
``Everybody who's gone away on a business trip tries to get home by
Thursday, and we doubt they go to work on Friday.'' Cartoonist
Adams agrees. ``Work avoidance is more pronounced on Fridays than
Mondays, partly because so many people are gone on Friday that no
one is there to notice that you are gone too. No one wants to narc
anyone else out about Friday absenteeism because everyone covets
the same crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger-car statistics also indicate that the traditional
Friday ``slide'' has migrated Thursday-ward. Just two years ago,
Friday was the peak call day for Cambridge's SmartRoute Systems,
which dispenses traffic information to customers by phone. Now
Thursday is the peak day, with Friday and Tuesday tied for second
place. SmartRoute manager Jeff Larson attributes the shift to
changing work habits: ``A lot of people in corporate America tend
to schedule their meetings around their personal convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just in the workplace. Over the years, Friday night
_ ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' ``Burke's Law,'' ``Dallas'' _ was
appointment television night, when the networks could rely on
finding the nuclear family relaxed and at home. Now it's Thursday.
Two academics recently told me that students had gently warned them
that should they choose to teach on Fridays, their classes will be
lightly attended.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, we are moving in the right direction. In
so-called civilized society, the weekend consisted of just one day
_ Sunday, the Sabbath _ from the Dark Ages through the 18th
century. If anyone had an extra day off, it was Monday, generally
reserved for fairs, festivals, and sleeping off hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy their leisurely country weekends, the British
aristocracy pioneered the ``long'' weekend, leaving London on
Friday and returning on Monday. The working class wasn't so lucky.
Until the 20th century, workers had to content themselves with a
half-day holiday on Saturday, plus Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Witold Rybczynski's book, ``Waiting for the
Weekend,'' the first American factory to adopt the five-day work
week was a New England spinning mill, which wanted to free both its
Jewish and its Christian employees to observe their holy days, in
1908. The five-day week is now set in stone, and _ de facto or de
jure _ the four-day week is rapidly encroaching.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, two New Hampshire-based high-tech
companies, Kollman Inc. and Sanders, instituted ``9/80'' work
weeks, meaning that employees would work 80 hours in nine working
days, rather than 10, with every other Friday off. More recently,
Illinois-based software purveyor HighTower Inc. started offering an
8/80 option, meaning employees had to work only four days each
week.
</P>
<P>
   HighTower's president Jeff Rosengarden says he has children the
age of his youngest employees, and he knows what they want: ``They
would rather have more time off than have extra money.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart kids. Let's follow their example. I'll be available to
write the ``Thank God It's Thursday'' column any time.

SELLING CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All politicians are in the heat transfer business. They take
heat, they give heat. Their success and longevity depends on how
they handle the heat.
</P>
<P>
   America's president, Bill Clinton, the fellow with the asbestos
underwear, has a PhD in heat-taking. Old Bill _ He's aged some in
the job, hasn't he? _ can calibrate the political BTUs better than
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the president pulled the plug on the Chinese
government's 13-year push for entry into the World Trade
Organization. This is something that, on balance, should happen,
and the sooner the better, not only for China, but for the United
States and for the rest of Asia's struggling economies.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton couldn't stand the heat for giving China a big
prize. Clinton has a war going on in the Balkans. He's just off
impeachment. There was the flap over Chinese spying on our
missilery stockpile, and those embarrassing contributions to the
Democratic presidential campaign from shadowy Sino-sources, and the
predictable harrumping from the anti-China lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders of Chinese dissidents, Tibet, Taiwan, and other
causes were lining the streets to demonstrate aqgainst the
just-completed nine-day tour of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
Clinton, with that gigantic mainframe of a political calculator
that he has inside his brain, or his gut, decided at the last
minute to stiff Zhu on the WTO business. Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   There's the mysterious phone call Tuesday  &UR; afternoon &LR;  from
Clinton to Zhu. It seems the American businessmen who want to open
up the fabulous 1.2 billion-person Chinese market got to Bill. For
20 minutes Clinton yakked with Zhu, and Zhu told media moguls in
New York City the deal was ``99 percent complete.'' US Commerce
Secretary Bill Daley said China's admission to the Big Boys club of
the WTO ``is not a question of `if' but of `when.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hostile burping of the backbenchers in the
Republican-controlled Congress delayed the deal, it appears.
Clinton is trying to come out of impeachment, run the Kosovo war,
keep the rest of the world at bay, and he apparently concluded he
couldn't take on the Republicans over Chinese spying, campaign
contributions, and sins in Tibet and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   To the US political spin-cycle in which 24 hours can be a
lifetime, Zhu brought the perspective of 5,000 years of trying to
govern the world's biggest population. ``No big deal,'' he cracked
on more than one occasion, when fielding questions about the
perennial sticking points like China's trade deficit, copyright
infringement (that means theft) of intellectual property rights,
clapping dissidents into the calaboose, grinding Tibetans down.
</P>
<P>
   We're getting there, he kept telling American audiences. Give us
time, we have a different society and different problems than
yours, lighten up, trade more, give us a crack at your computers
and communications gear, and we'll get more modern more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu has three things going for him which made him a far more
successful visiting fireman than previous Chinese top dogs. First,
he's an electrical engineer, who at age 68 has witnessed firsthand
the way technology yanked China from its medieval ways to the
present. Second, he was mayor of Shanghai, that rock-'em-sock-'em
piratical city where the timid or the foolish do not long survive.
Like the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Lushkov, who may become Boris
Yeltsin's successor in Russia, a savvy mayor who understands how
things really work can go a long way in a country desperate to
modernize.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Zhu has a combination of sly wit and willingness to be
blunt that goes a long way to persuading American audiences that he
knows what's up. In grad school back home, he told a friendly MIT
crowd, some of his texts were photocopies; ``Whether they were
pirated or not I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   He made wordplay about secrets and the espionage game, even
played the droll straight man, saying that when Clinton told him
China has only a few dozen nuclear warheads, ``I don't know how he
knew that.'' Inviting American accounting types to apply for some
Chinese job openings, he poked America's reputation for materialism
right in the ribs: ``I will pay what you are paid here.'' Asked
about imprisoned dissident Xu Wenli, Zhu said he'd been asked so
often about human rights, ``I practically have blisters on my
lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu went a long way in persuading Americans that, as in Margaret
Thatcher's appraisal of Gorbachev, ``he is a man we can do business
with.'' Clinton should damn the anti-China torpedoes and go full
speed ahead for WTO recognition. That's where we should end up. It
helps end Asia's economic swoon, helps American business, and opens
China to western values. So stop screwing around. Ignore those
isolationist birdbrains in Congress. It's time to get from ``no big
deal'' to ``get real,'' and bring China in from the cold.

I LOVE YOU, MARIA GRASSO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a confession to make to you, Maria Grasso, one that will
undoubtedly surprise and delight you so very, very much. I love
you. I really do. I love you from the core of my heart and with
every fiber of my otherwise worthless soul in a way I've never
loved anyone before.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, consider me a helpless, hopeless puppy, wagging
my pathetic little tail every time you deign to look my way. For
that reason, consider this space today an ode to your essence.
Consider every thought I think, every action I take, every word I
write and speak for the rest of my life to be a tribute to an
intangible beauty that is uniquely and unquestionably yours.
</P>
<P>
   What is it I love about you? Wow. Well, there you go. That's
just one thing: Your modesty. But what else? My God, so many
millions of reasons that I'm not quite sure where to begin.
</P>
<P>
   But here goes. I love that exotic Chilean accent of yours, the
way the words roll off your tongue like a hand-polished Bentley
gliding down a winding country highway.
</P>
<P>
   Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   I love the way the klieg lights sparkled in your eyes Wednesday
as you stood on stage at Lottery headquarters in Braintree and
accepted a destiny that is so exquisitely ours. In retrospect, I
can't pinpoint exactly why, but just watching you on television in
that gorgeous, gold-flecked, navy blue dress, your dark hair so
perfectly coiffed, I felt a bond that has given significance to my
previously insignificant life.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, seeing that delighted look on your face, I knew
then that you were thinking of me as I was thinking of you. It was
a moment of unparalleled magic. And just as you spent a sleepless
night with your lottery ticket by your bed, I spent a sleepless
night with your photograph by mine.
</P>
<P>
   Now steel yourself, my dearest, for there are cynics among us
who will suspect vice in our communion where we only seek virtue.
They are everywhere, these naysayers, always pointing out the worst
while we search for each other's best.
</P>
<P>
   They will no doubt notice our age difference. Yes, I know you
are 54, 17 years more experienced than myself. They will whisper
about our varying backgrounds, you harking from that wondrously
beautiful nation of Chile, me coming from right here in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   They may note the curious timing of our relationship, coming as
it does amid all this publicity. And they even may make mention of
the inconvenient fact that you and I have never actually met.
</P>
<P>
   But ours is a love that bridges, not divides, an almost cosmic
marriage of emotion and attraction that is so much larger than the
both of us combined. We must face one crucial fact, my princess:
This is a love we may never fully understand, so it's probably best
we not even try.
</P>
<P>
   Me? You want to know about me? I'm so flattered, I can barely
think. Well, I happen to be the founder of the recently formed
National Commission to Preserve the Chilean Sea Bass. By some
measure of coincidence, I am the president of the Committee for the
Best Possible Treatment of South American Nannies. I heard you say
Wednesday that you'll continue to care for those with special
needs. I can't believe this coincidence. People tell me all the
time that I always think my own needs are so special.
</P>
<P>
   I will shout our love to the angels from the highest rooftops of
our real estate portfolio. I will whisper our love to the lilies in
the man-made pond of our Tuscan manor. I will skip down Mount
Vernon Street, kiss ducks and bunnies on the forehead, release
bright pink balloons to the heavens in the name of our lifetime
together.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I want us to share every part of each other's lives. I
insist. I would be willing to leave my job to spend more time with
you. I would accompany you on a round-the-world cruise on the Queen
Elizabeth II, if that's what it takes. I really would. I would
hurtle across time zones on the Concorde to meet you in Paris. I
would leave my home to live in yours. I would do anything _
absolutely anything _ for you.
</P>
<P>
   So let's meet. Let's meet at noon today at what will always be
our special place _ the service desk at the Fenway Star Market.
You'll be the woman of unimaginable beauty, hopefully _ wink, wink
_ unaccompanied. I'll be the guy with the collection of American
Tourister luggage, and the note from my mother saying, ``Don't wake
while sleepwalking.'' I can almost hear you say, ``Brian, I am
yours and you are mine.'' I can feel our hands clasp. I will tell
you that our love will be strong, now and always, forever and ever.
Mi bella Maria.

LURID ZEST FADES IN `GOODBYE LOVER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GOODBYE LOVER 
Directed by: Roland Joffe 
Screenplay by: Ron Peer, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow 
Starring: Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney, Ellen DeGeneres,
Mary-Louise Parker, Don Johnson, Ray McKinnon 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality, language and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Lover'' is almost the edgy scheme-fest it wants to be.
Certainly it achieves the dark, slick, malignant look it's after.
Venal characters slink through it, putting a high gloss on their
double-crosses. But while the betrayals pile up energetically, they
reach a point of diminishing returns about halfway through. Even
though the precise alignments of the treacheries will keep you
guessing, they stop seeming to matter on even the most superficial
stylistic level, stranding the actors and forfeiting anything like
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because the actors show up ready to work and director
Roland Joffe, in his first foray into comedy, has a feel for spiky
comedic jabs as the film begins in a surge of sexual heat that
quickly is revealed to be little more than sexual smoke. And
mirrors. ``Goodbye Lover'' is big on mirrors, especially when
Patricia Arquette's temptress, Sandra, passes in front of them and
can't resist inspecting her combat-readiness. She doesn't need much
to tempt Don Johnson's libidinous ad exec named Ben into steamy sex
in dangerous locations, where the prospect of getting caught
presumably adds to the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcheting up the ante is the fact that she's married to her
lover's younger brother, Dermot Mulroney's Jake. He also works at
the ad agency, drinks too much, and is only kept on the payroll
because of Ben's intervention. When Jake learns what's going on, he
predictably explodes. A confrontation between Jake and Ben ends
especially badly for one of them. But that's only the first stop in
a maze of amoral plotting and alliances. Mary-Louise Parker, an ad
agency careerist who had her eye on Ben and plays an ace nobody
knew she had, deals herself in too, with results she never foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   They're all crooked. And as the bodies pile up, they try to
dodge the gimlet eye of Ellen DeGeneres's experienced, world-weary
cop, whose effectiveness is lessened by forced comic routines with
a doltish partner. The film has its moments. I laughed at the
playing of Arquette's cheerful amorality against bits of her
favorite musical, ``The Sound of Music,'' a trademark even funnier
than her stiletto heels. But ``Goodbye Lover'' can't sustain its
loopy outrage, and its lurid zest drains away as it becomes too
silly to be funny.

MERLE HAGGARD STILL CALLS THE TUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Merle Haggard released ``Okie from Muskogee'' 30 years ago,
the song made him a right-wing hero. Issued at the height of the
Vietnam War protests, it won him praise from conservatives for the
line ``We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee / We don't take our
trips on LSD.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard always said the hoopla was overplayed, claiming he
intended the song as a kind of jest. And, today, this country
legend cum rugged individualist says that conservatives _
especially the anti-marijuana forces _ have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has sure gone to some sort of a police state in the
last 10 years,'' says Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't played in New England since 1990, mainly because the
region used to serve as a connecting stop for his tours of Canada,
which he has cut out. He says he's sick of the ``zero tolerance''
laws, which make re-entering the States an indignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they find a seed of marijuana in your car of bus, they'll
run it all over the news,'' says Haggard, speaking from his home in
northern California. ``I've got 30 people working for me. There is
liable to be a seed of marijuana, so it makes it very uninviting to
go into Canada, knowing that the United States is going to harass
you coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They snatched some buses from people I won't name, and buses
are not cheap,'' he adds, referring to the US customs officials.
``It costs us seven or eight years of our lives to pay for these
buses, and they just take 'em. Like I say, you can't personally
shake people down that work for you. I'm not going to do that. You
don't know who's doing what and who isn't, but (the police) come on
and this `zero tolerance' thing they've got going is really
amazing. They've got private enterprise building prisons now. It's
scary. It's overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Haggard could do a solo acoustic ``unplugged'' tour
instead, it is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad idea. Yeah, they won't have nothin' to
search,'' snaps Haggard, a grizzled 61-year-old (alias ``The Hag'')
who is loaded with strong opinions and enjoys being cast as a
proverbial outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Take his feelings toward the Nashville establishment: Been
there, done that. To put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved to Nashville for two years _ in 1976 and '77 _ and my
record sales went down to about half what they had been,'' says
Haggard, who emerged from the same Bakersfield, Calif., scene that
spawned Buck Owens. ``So I got the hell out of there and my record
sales went right back up. It was like living in the middle of a
carnival. Hey, I don't mind coming to work and running the Ferris
wheel once in a while, but I don't want to live right there. That's
kind of the way it is down there. Your work becomes your entirety.
I've never given my full entire self to this business. I give about
half my time. And I'm not going to give any more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Hag is branded a classic loner _ an image the
public has embraced during a career that has seen an astonishing 63
of his songs in the Top Ten of the country charts. Among his
signature, baritone-rich tunes: ``Mama Tried,'' ``Workin' Man
Blues,'' ``Sing Me Back Home,'' ``Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down,''
and ``Today I Started Loving You Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what the public likes more than anything. It's
the most rare commodity in the world _ honesty. You just have to be
honest with them and say, `Hey, I don't want to live in Nashville.'
It's a nice city and has paid tribute to me and I owe it a lot. But
I don't want to live there . . . I want to make my music on the
West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard is almost a Paul Bunyan figure in country lore. He was
born in Bakersfield and lived in a boxcar where his father, a
railroad worker, resided. His father died when Haggard was 9,
starting a downhill spiral that led to a crime-dotted youth,
including a three-year stint in San Quentin for armed robbery. He
was released in the early '60s and eventually was given a full
pardon by Governor Ronald Reagan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Haggard has been on the road for 38 years with his band, the
Strangers, of which only three early members are left: Don Martin,
horn, steel player and band leader, Norman Hamlett; and harmony
singer, Bonnie Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rest of the band is new,'' he says, ``and everybody's
younger than me, but that wouldn't be saying much.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard has fought many battles in his life, but one that stands
out is his fight to use the Strangers in the studio. He stuck with
them even though the Nashville way was to make solo acts use
so-called ``A team'' studio players to get a homogenized sound
suitable for many radio programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an Elvis Presley out there today, we wouldn't even
know it. He wouldn't get a chance to use his own band. They'd run
that same damned band in on him,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Today's new artists are also ``not getting to put out the songs
that are the best. The songs have to be of a nature that doesn't
cause someone to look up from their computer, otherwise they won't
be played. So (the music) is being strained and refined and
perfected _ and there's nothing more boring than perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard is likewise angry at the industry's prejudice against
older artists, who are routinely denied airplay. ``I think if we
had this mentality in charge in the last 100 years, we would have
missed some of the greatest performers in the world. What if they
did that in classical music? What would we do _ make Pavarotti go
home?''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard's son, Noel, is another Nashville refugee. ``He went
down there . . . but they wouldn't let him insert an idea of his
own at all. He got disgusted and came home. He's working here at
the ranch,'' he says, referring to his citrus ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Noel is going to do music or not. He's 35
years old and, of course, he's going to be over the age curve soon.
He'll be too damned old! And that's silly. I didn't even grow up
until I was 40 years old. And I surely didn't mature musically
until about that period. It's a shame that the public is denied
mature music.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard puts the blame on spineless producers and program
directors ``who know absolutely zero about music . . . It's time to
turn the body and fender work back over to the body and fender
people.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Haggard is still plugging on. He survived heart
surgery two years ago, altered his diet, and feels better than
ever. He now has six children, including two (ages 6 and 9) from
his current marriage. ``It's just the greatest thing I've ever been
involved with in my life,'' he says. ``They say you'll enjoy kids
more when you're older, and I certainly do.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this could be one of his busiest career years. He
is preparing a boxed set of the gospel music he's done through the
years. He also has a pay-per-view concert in October timed to
coincide with the release of a double CD of 61 of his best-known
songs he's now rerecording for RCA. And he has an autobiography
(tentatively titled ``The Running Kind'') due this fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be hearing a lot about me in the next few months,''
says Haggard, laughing. And you can bet that whatever you hear will
bear the same candor that has always marked his work. He knows no
other way.

FORMER BC STAR CLOUD HOPES TO LAND WITH PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The question of Mike Cloud getting selected in
Saturday's NFL draft ceases to be a matter of if, but where and by
whom. Cloud, the All-America running back from Boston College who
ranked as the Big East's leading rusher and No. 3 in the nation,
will be drafted. That much is certain.
</P>
<P>
   What is not, however, is Cloud's ultimate NFL destination.
</P>
<P>
   And that has Ethel Cloud worried.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, only natural for a mother to worry about her
child's future. But Mrs. Cloud would love to know where the
youngest of her three sons will be going off to work. While she
says she is not a big sports fan, what little she knows about the
NFL draft is that her son will not have any control in deciding
what team he plays for, unlike college, where Mike had his pick of
schools from BC, Syracuse, and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   That will be up to men hunkered down in NFL draft war rooms from
Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Miami, and, Mrs. Cloud is fervently hoping,
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I've got a bad back and I can't stand the
cold,'' Mrs. Cloud said, stating the reasons why she has not
watched any of her son's games in person. ``And I'm too darned
nervous to sit still and watch the games. When I see them hit him,
I get too, too nervous because of what happened to Kevin . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin is her second-oldest son. A running back with great
college prospects, Kevin Cloud suffered a serious neck injury
during a scrimmage in his junior year at Portsmouth High. He
suffered a cervical fracture that shattered his dreams of playing
in college and very nearly ended his younger brother's budding
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I don't like to watch it,'' Mrs. Cloud said. ``I
just sit here and say my prayers. A lot of times, I'd go to his BC
games and I'd watch the game from his dorm room. But I've never
flown on a plane and I'm not looking forward to it in the near
future, either.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Mike Cloud, like his mother, is hoping the Patriots
call his number on draft day..
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be somewhere close,'' said Cloud, who honored his
brother Kevin by wearing the same No. 21 in high school and
college. ``My mom doesn't like to fly. She's never flown on a plane
and never wants to. It's kinda like the old show the `A-Team,' when
they had to knock out B.A. Baracus to get him into a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we'll probably have to do with my mom,'' he
added, with a laugh. ``She refuses to get into an airplane, so if I
end up somewhere far away, it's going to be tough for her to watch
me if the games aren't on TV. It's not going to be like an hour
ride from Rhode Island to BC, how it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, Cloud lands with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a perfect situation for me, being local all
these years and having my career end up in New England,'' Cloud
said. ``It's something at this point that's a little far-fetched,
because on draft day decisions could change within minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a slight chance he could wind up with the
Patriots, but that is very slight. The Patriots have stated their
intention to move up in the draft by packaging their two
first-round picks (20th and 28th overall) in an attempt to land
either Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of Texas or Miami's
Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the pro days I've done, I think that was the best
one as far as my performance,'' said Cloud, referring to his
workout for the Patriots in Foxborough. ``I did real well there. I
think it was because I just felt more relaxed being around the
coaches from New England. Just because they always had great things
to say about me, and just because I knew some of the coaching staff
from meeting them at the Senior Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   After rushing 308 times for 1,726 yards and 14 touchdowns in his
senior year at BC, Cloud backed it up with a strong performance in
the Senior Bowl, where rushed 12 times for 117 yards, good enough
to earn MVP honors and the long-distance award for a 55-yard run.
``It's tough in the Senior Bowl with four or five running backs all
sharing time,'' Cloud said. ``I think I only played a quarter and a
half and had 12 carries, but I took every play like it was going to
be my last play, because you never knew when they were going to
switch running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his MVP performance, scouts still had lingering
questions about Cloud, a 5-foot-10-inch, 202-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the major workout day we had here (March 15), the one
question they kept asking was: `Is he tough enough? Can he run
inside with the ball?' '' said BC coach Tom O'Brien. ``That was one
of the things that they asked. As I said to them, he carried it
during the middle drill two days a week for us, going up in there
against the defense, and he never had a problem that way. So I
don't see (that) that would be a problem for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I told the scouts, `We gave him the ball enough
times; you guys can't figure it out watching tape.' '' O'Brien
added. ``He didn't take a lot of plays off. I mean, look at the
Pittsburgh game. He only got the ball about 10 times on the last
drive _ and they were all runs inside the tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud went to the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis and,
unlike some of the other highly-touted backs, was one of the few
who didn't balk at going through all the rigors. He ran a 4.47 in
the 40-yard dash, but at a pro workout day at BC last month lowered
that time to 4.31.
</P>
<P>
   ``To not work out didn't make any sense to me,'' he said. ``A
lot of guys who didn't work out, in my opinion, were guys who had a
lot of hype on them and maybe they couldn't live up to it on that
particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard that he could be drafted anywhere from the mid to
late second round. But by whom? That is a question that won't be
answered until draft day. ``If I could choose, yeah, definitely it
would be New England,'' Cloud said. ``That would be so much easier.
The transition would be so much easier being close to home, being
local. In a perfect world, this was where I'd love to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So would his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She actually called my agent and was like, `Why are the
Patriots trading their first-round draft pick?' Like she has any
idea what that means or anything,'' Cloud said, chuckling. ``My
agent called me back, cracking up laughing. But she's a great woman
and she just wants the best for me.''

DEFENSIVE LINE: NO RUSH FOR A SURE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The need for defensive line talent around the NFL seems to far
exceed this group's abilities, but with that said, somebody has to
eventually replace the Reggie Whites and Bruce Smiths, and the
class of 1999 has a player or two with the potential to at least
make a run at that.
</P>
<P>
   The best could be multitalented Jevon Kearse of Florida but most
people consider him a linebacker masquerading as a defensive end,
so for the purposes of this discussion, we'll leave him standing
upright and move on to the true defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   To show you how difficult it is to find a defensive lineman who
might have an impact in the league, 56 such players were drafted in
the first round of the nine drafts this decade and nearly half (22)
were taken in the top 10. Few went on to become stars and this year
it's unlikely any will go in the top 10 (excluding Kearse), yet at
least four and perhaps five will be included in the first round in
the hope they hit (quarterbacks in particular).
</P>
<P>
   The top spot has been debated for sometime between LSU's run-
stuffing defensive tackle Anthony McFarland and still developing
defensive ends Ebenezer Ekuban of North Carolina, Patrick Kerney of
Virginia and Lamar King of Saginaw Valley State College (honest).
That debate will continue right into Saturday afternoon but
McFarland seems likely to go first because, while he is not a great
pass rusher, what he can do is obvious _ stuff the inside run _ and
teams will pay someone well for that.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban, Kerney, and King are three of the more interesting
players at this position because all are projections more than
proven commodities, with big upside potential but accompanying
question marks.
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban moved to the United States from Ghana as a kid and didn't
play football until his junior year of high school. He has great
size and exceptional quickness, which most coaches consider the key
to pass rushing, but seems to lack some of the basic instincts that
come from playing a sport all your life.
</P>
<P>
   Kerney is a lacrosse and hockey player turned quarterback chaser
who was a walk-on to Virginia's football team and became a guy that
walked over ACC offensive linemen, making 23 sacks the last two
seasons. He's worked hard to develop himself against long odds but
is what scouts call ``a light load of poles,'' meaning he's not as
strong as they'd like.
</P>
<P>
   In high school Kerney was 6 feet 3 inches, 160 pounds, during
his early hockey days and was cut from the varsity football team
his first season only to be brought back after his first game on
the JV. Virginia didn't want him anywhere but on the lacrosse field
at first, either, but he's a weight room warrior who built himself
into an All-ACC performer. A full-time weight program and his work
ethic all but guarantee that Kerney will become stronger still in
the NFL, but will he retain his quickness and continue improving?
Some team will seek to answer that question with a first-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   King may be the biggest gamble among the top-rated linemen
because he did big things in a very small place. Nebraska was hot
after him but academic problems precluded his going to Lincoln so
he ended up at tiny Saginaw State, where he was a giant both in the
weight room and on the field. As one would expect, King dominated
at that level but can he do the same thing when the competition
becomes much stiffer?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the questions scouts and personnel gurus will face
this weekend when they survey this group. Likely to be among those
asking such questions is New England's vice president for personnel
Bobby Grier, who may well have Ekuban, King, and the likes of
Florida defensive tackle Reggie McGrew and Florida State defensive
end Tony Bryant to pick from when the 20th selection of the first
round comes his way. If coach Pete Carroll controlled the situation
he'd grab someone like Ekuban and worry about a second-tier running
back or a tackle to groom as Bruce Armstrong's eventual replacement
eight picks later, when the Patriots make the 28th pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Grier calls the shots in the draft room so the decision _
and the responsibility _ will fall to him.

SPONSORS ENJOY MARATHON SHOWCASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Businesses say they like to sponsor the Boston
Marathon because, for them, the race is like a big commercial
show-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing the chance to link their brand name
with a prestigious athletic event, the traditional use of sports as
a marketing tool, sponsors say the Marathon provides an unusual
opportunity to demonstrate how their products and services work.
</P>
<P>
   For that forum this year, Boston Marathon officials say,
sponsors will pay a total of about $3 million, financing 75 percent
of the $4 million cost of staging the race. The rest of the
operating budget is financed by the participants' $75 fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running events are unique among sports in that it isn't the
exposure of signage or being able to use the name of the event in
their advertising that really attracts the sponsors,'' said Lance
Helgeson, senior editor of the Chicago-based IEG Sponsorship
Report. ``It's more the opportunity of getting their products out
there, being used, and demonstrating their potential in a real-life
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What adds to that is that the Boston Marathon really has more
cache than even the New York Marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just Gatorade and Ronzoni Pastas _ whose products
are clearly useful for the field of dehydrated, carbo-starved
runners _ that pitch the usefulness of their products. Companies
such as Boston Gas, DaimlerChrysler and some specializing in
Internet and wireless communications tout the Marathon as a
valuable showcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen those shots of the lead runners and
wondered how they could run all that distance behind some
diesel-belching truck?'' asked Michael Connors, a spokesman for
Boston Gas. ``Well, there are no fumes, because the vehicles are
running on natural gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy source, for both vehicles and power plants, is one of
Boston Gas's major initiatives, Connors said. ``So, as a sponsor,
what's important to us is supplying two natural gas vehicles for
camera crews and officials at the front of the race. It keeps us
coming back every year.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will provide 75 to 85 vehicles, several of which
will accompany the race leaders in prominent positions throughout
the course.
</P>
<P>
   But for sponsors who produce refreshments and food, the
marketing opportunities are even more obvious and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be providing the Boston Marathon with about
60,000 gallons of water or, another way of thinking of it is
750,000 to 1 million cups of water,'' said Jack Sullivan, sales
center manager for Belmont Springs, which has sponsored the
Marathon since 1981. ``It's great for us, especially because we are
a local company. We're proud to contribute to a successful event
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatorade will provide 640,000 servings of the drink to the
15,000 runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Gatorade, this is a great opportunity, at the nation's
premier marathon, to express the functional benefits of our
product,'' said spokeswoman P.J. Sinopoli.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Communications, of McLean, Va., will provide 325 digital
wireless phones for the staff and volunteers who help to supervise
the race. Nextel touts its wireless phones, which with the flip of
a switch function as two-way radios, as the ideal communications
link along the 26.2-mile course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's walkie-talkies, wireless phones and beepers all in one
hand-held set,'' said John Redman, director of marketing in New
England. ``The Marathon is perfect for us. It draws our potential
customer base and the network of communications is similar to any
major construction site or emergency services network, and those
are the primary areas of use for our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Nextel will make a special display of the communications network
this year by enchancing the Boston Athletic Association's tracking
of individual participants _ especially the elite women _
throughout the race, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And Kyvex.com, a Bethesda, Md., supplier of Internet-based
products and services to the business community, will show off its
high-speed Internet access by updating the progress of the race and
positions of the runners every three to five minutes. In the past,
according to Mitch Romm, president of Kyvex.com, the results were
updated on the Boston Athletic Association's Website only every 20
to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The show-and-tell approach to corporate sponsorships at the
Boston Marathon works well for race organizers, too. Race director
Guy Morse of the Boston Athletic Association said that the
``in-kind services'' are often as important as the sponsors'
contribution to financing the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really allows us to present the event in a world-class
way,'' Morse said. ``If they did not contribute those goods and
services, we'd have to buy them, or do without.
</P>
<P>
   ``And because of the opportunities it provides for the sponsors,
they come back to the Marathon every year,'' Morse said. ``The fact
that many of our sponsors have been with us for eight and 10 years
and longer provides us with a lot of stability. And our
relationship with them is something we spend a lot of time,
throughout the year, nurturing.''

ESPN WELCOMES THE DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Chris Berman tells the story, a lot of people thought
televising the NFL draft was about as interesting as reading the
Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   They were probably right. When ESPN started its daylong coverage
in 1980, the draft was the only link the cable sports network had
with the NFL. Berman recalled his first year as host in 1981 when
he worked out of an Italian restaurant in New York City. The draft
was held on Tuesday mornings then and Berman, a diehard New York
Jets fan, learned that his team had made a foolish pick.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Berman started railing against the Jets, the power blew
out. ``It was as if my yelling overloaded the circuits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN won't have any similar technology problems this year. ESPN
and ESPN2 have 17 hours of coverage, starting Saturday at noon.
ESPN has live coverage from the headquarters of 27 NFL teams. The
network's usual suspects will be on hand to report the news and
give instant analysis. Berman, Mike Tirico, and Mel Kiper Jr. will
be stationed at Madison Square Garden. Joe Theisman, Chris
Mortensen, Jim Kelly, Boomer Esiason, and Marty Schottenheimer will
also be in New York. Solomon Wilcots will report from Foxborough.
ESPN also has a ``war room'' cam to watch Patriots coaches make
their first-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best parts about ESPN's coverage is the crawl
appearing at the bottom of screens, which detail the latest draft
selections.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the 15-minute periods that teams have to pick.
ESPN has plenty of graphics, features, and talking heads to fill
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The network also has prepared notable draft moments, including
the 1983 draft when John Elway refused to play in Baltimore and was
subsequently traded to Denver; the 1988 draft when ESPN spent the
day with Oklahoma State running back Thurman Thomas, who fell
asleep during the telecast awaiting the call from Buffalo late in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first five minutes are scripted,'' said ESPN producer Jay
Rothman. ``The rest of the time we are flying by the seat of our
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   The news dictates the themes of coverage. With all the talk
about quarterbacks, ESPN has put together a feature on the Class of
'83, the year six signal-callers were selected in the first round _
Elway, Todd Blackledge, Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien, and Dan
Marino. ESPN also will have a feature on Peyton Manning and Ryan
Leaf, the top quarterbacks drafted last year.

   ``This is a sexy draft,'' Berman said. ``By that I mean there
are a lot of skilled players with the biggest names in this year's
draft. So one of the stories will be whether any of these
quarterbacks can turn things around on a bad team. Another story
will be whether Mike Ditka trades his entire draft to get Ricky
Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has come a long way from its first draft day coverage. It
was lucky to even get to do that. In 1979, the NFL owners voted
against ESPN televising the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to get back into football before we dive
headlong into baseball,'' Berman said. ``The draft involves every
NFL team and is a way for college football fans to find out where
their favorite player will be going in the pros. It's a lot of fun.
It's exciting, and it's a lot of work.''

UNIQUE COURSE RECOGNIZABLE TO ALL BUT RECORD KEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's not going to happen, but let's say defending
champion Moses Tanui runs the marathon of his life Monday and
cracks the two-hour barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Fatuma Roba leaves the field in her wake and becomes the
first woman to break 2:20.
</P>
<P>
   Those would become Boston Marathon records, to be sure, but
would USA Track &AMP; Field recognize them?
</P>
<P>
   No, no, a thousand times no.
</P>
<P>
   There, the times would be a ``noteworthy performance set on a
technically aided course.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Boston Marathon isn't special in the eyes of USATF,
it's just that the course, famed as it is, doesn't fall within the
parameters of record standards.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because the course begins at an elevation of 490 feet
(149 meters) in Hopkinton and drops to 10 feet (3 meters) at the
finish in Boston for a net elevation drop of 480 feet (146 meters).
</P>
<P>
   ``If the finish was no more than 42 meters below the start, then
we would recognize it,'' said Basil Honikman, managing trustee of
road running information and chairman of the USATF records
committee. ``Boston far exceeds that. It drops 3.22 meters for
every kilometer run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This in no way reduces the tremendous respect that USA Track &AMP;
Field has for the Boston Marathon, which, in many ways is the
flagship event of American and maybe even world marathons. And it
shouldn't in any way reduce the importance or prestige of the
event. It's just one characteristic.''
</P>
<P>
   Honikman noted that Boston isn't the only marathon course that
fails to meet record standards. Others that don't are Minnesota and
Utah; some that do are Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a controversial issue, and I know that a lot of people
in Boston are upset and I can understand that,'' said Honikman,
``but rules are a matter of opinion and votes. Science, for all
intents and purposes, backs up the fact that running downhill does
give you an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGillivray, marathon technical director, said he
understands the USATF point of view, but that doesn't mean he
agrees with it. ``From a personal perspective, I've run 102
marathons coast to coast and abroad, so I think I've experienced
the full gamut of what's out there,'' said McGillivray. ``I haven't
run every course, but enough to have an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is unique in that in order to run it well, you have to
know it. Instead of challenging, I look at it as strategic. It has
a lot of character by virtue of its topography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's point-to-point, and it's true that the elevation drop
could be more of a benefit than a negative, but in a marathon _ and
some people may be calling this a stretch _ I don't agree. The
damage one does to the body during the first 10 miles far outweighs
what advantage someone on the outside looking in might perceive
that you would get. It (the course) really beats you up. By the
time you get to the fire station in Newton (17.5 miles), the body
has been punished.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something McGillivray feels the USATF should take
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the rules and know they have to be imposed in
order to validate and qualify records,'' he said, ``but
unfortunately sometimes the rules don't address individual or
specific circumstances. I think Boston could be an exception, but I
know it can't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run 27 Bostons and ran my personal best (2:29:58) in my
10th one. I don't put an asterisk on that, and I don't think anyone
else does, either. If someone runs a time faster than the
recognized record, I think the populace will recognize it as
such.''
</P>
<P>
   BAA director of media operations Jack Fleming summed things up
nicely. ``Boston is Boston,'' he said, ``and one of the few things
that makes it so special is the course. The Boston Marathon's been
around since 1897, long before the USATF or any other governing
body was in existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that in 1897, when John Graham set out to plot a
point-to-point course similar to the fabled Marathon-to-Athens
route run by Pheidippides in 490 B.C., this was the furthest thing
from his mind.''

COUPLE'S FUND PICKINGS LACK IN DIVERSITY DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are a couple, both 39, and we would like to retire at age
59. We feel we have made a good start at saving for this, but don't
feel our distribution is very well balanced. We currently have an
income of $120,000 a year; 10 percent of this goes into 401(k)
plans, and our employers match the contributions of 5 percent of
our salary. The savings are invested in Vanguard funds, with
$25,000 in Wellington, $165,000 in Windsor II, $5,000 in
International Growth, and $20,000 in Prime money market. Other
offerings available are the Total Bond Market Index fund and
Primecap. What would you suggest for an aggressive, more balanced
distribution? Second, what kind of yearly distributions might we
expect from our accounts once we reach age 59?
</P>
<P>
   P.P., Lunenburg, mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I agree you're pretty heavily committed to large-cap
domestic stocks, but adding Primecap to the lineup wouldn't help
much _ it's a large-cap fund with a portfolio representing a blend
of growth and value issues, so it would be a little relief from the
value oriented large-cap portfolios of both Windsor II and the
stock side of Wellington. What you really want is offerings such as
Vanguard Mid-Cap and Small-Cap Index funds, or its Extended Market
Index.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would I suggest at your age that you move any substantial
amount of money into Vanguard's Total Bond Market Index _ not
because the fund doesn't do a good job, but because any significant
concentration in bonds will drag the portfolio over the long haul.
If it were my account, I would move from the money market fund to
Primecap, but if you insist that your portfolio have a fallback
position that's invested conservatively, you could move from the
money market to Bond Market Index.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important thing for you to do at this time is to
lobby your employer (or employers) for a broader menu of funds. You
could point out the substantial duplication of large-cap
investments in Windsor II, Primecap and the stock portfolio of
Wellington, and point out that offering a money market, one bond
fund and one international fund simply isn't sufficient to allow
you to build a well-balanced portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   As for where you should be in 20 years, if we presume 10 percent
average annual growth and ongoing contributions of $18,000 a year
between yourselves and your employers, the total would be
$2,524,465. The income stream you might generate from this would
depend on how you had it invested. My feeling is that for somebody
retiring early, there should be a very substantial amount of money
left in growth accounts after retirement, to provide capital to
help you cope with the effects on inflation in the later years of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If you achieved an average 6.5 percent yield on the fixed-income
side, that would mean a $97,500 income stream. That likely won't
seem so tidy in 20 years as it does now, given what inflation is
likely to do to the buying power of money. But on the other hand,
if you (and your employers) continue to put a set percentage of
your salaries into your 401(k)s, the affect of every raise you get
during the next 20 years will be to build the savings pool larger.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A professional has recommended that I sell my holdings in
AARP GNMA and US Treasury and T. Rowe Price International Stock
funds. She says both have underperformed their peers. Do you agree,
and what would you buy to replace them? Would I increase risk
dramatically by buying a corporate bond fund with proceeds of the
AARP fund?
</P>
<P>
   C.K., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, they say the Devil was trained as a statistician. But I
can't find any set of figures which prove the claim that either of
these funds have significantly underperformed their peers.
</P>
<P>
   AARP GNMA and US Treasury fund has year-to-date, 12-month, and
3-year average annual returns of 1.1 percent, 6.61 and 7.1 percent.
In comparison, its peer group of short-term government securities
showed a median return of 0.8 percent, 5.5 percent, and 6.1 percent
respectively for the same time periods. If it wouldn't show a
cynical streak in me, I'd wonder aloud whether somebody was trying
to sell you some mutual funds. The AARP fund, rated above average
by Morningstar Mutual Funds, is a solid if unspectacular offering,
and if its investment category remains the right place for you to
be, I see no reason to change.
</P>
<P>
   You might make a slightly better argument that the T. Rowe Price
fund has underperformed its peers, but I think it's pretty thin.
Entering this week, the fund had a year-to-date total return of 3.7
percent, trailing the median 4.7 percent for its world stock peers.
But over a year the Price fund's 3.4 percent compares nicely to its
peer group median of 1.1 percent, and its average annual return of
10.6 percent trails its peer group median of 10.7 percent only very
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   I see no reason to buy anything from the person who has been
advising you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 50 and have no debts. I am looking to retire at age 65.
I recently got a government job and will soon begin to build a
403(b) account with Vanguard, to which I am able to contribute $500
a month. I also have a 401(k) from a previous employer amounting to
$80,000. Of this, 20 percent is in common stock, 28 percent in
Fidelity Contrafund, and the rest is divided evenly among Fidelity
Magellan, Fidelity Equity-Income, and Janus Worldwide. I also have
an IRA of $38,000, with the money evenly divided among Fidelity's
Contrafund, Value, Blue Chip and Low-Priced stock funds. Finally, I
have $10,000 in a money market fund and a similar amount in a
taxable account with Fidelity Value fund, and I add $100 a month to
each of these accounts. Is the distribution of my money
appropriate? How should I allocate money at Vanguard?
</P>
<P>
   (Anonymous)
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, since I tally that more than 85 percent of your money
is basically invested in domestic large-cap stocks, I do think some
further diversification is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Within the old IRA, I would move the Fidelity Blue Chip holding
to Fidelity Select Health Care and the Fidelity Value position to
Fidelity Puritan, a fund into which I suggest you start filtering
increasing amounts of money when you get to be about five or six
years away from expected retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Within the old 401(k), I would swap the Janus Worldwide position
for one in a fund entirely devoted to foreign stock (as opposed to
world stock) investments, such as Vanguard International Stock or
Fidelity Overseas. And in this account, I'd move half of the funds
now in Fidelity Contrafund to Fidelity Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new account with Vanguard, I'd suggest you use your
investments to continue broadening your diversification, with an
eventual target of getting to no more than 50 to 60 percent in the
large-caps. Good funds to take you in that direction would be
Vanguard's Extended Market and its Mid-Cap and Small-Cap index
funds.

ANDREW CUNANAN'S TWISTED TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THREE MONTH FEVER 
The Andrew Cunanan Story 
By Gary Indiana 
Cliff Street Books/HarperCollins, 254 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
VULGAR FAVORS 
Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in
U.S.  History 
By Maureen Orth 
Delacorte Press, 452 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a few weeks in 1997 Andrew Cunanan commanded the attention
of the media, but it wasn't until after he gunned down the fashion
designer Gianni Versace, his fifth victim, that Cunanan became the
celebrity he'd wanted to be all his life. He had probably never
thought of himself as the kind of celebrity the media labeled him:
a sociopath, a serial killer, a high-priced male prostitute, among
other things. Cunanan's mainstream celebrity lasted a scant eight
days, until, trapped, he lay down on the black satin sheets in a
tacky houseboat and shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cunanan might be pleased to know that he enjoys a measure of
posthumous fame, as two complementary books about him appear
simultaneously: ``Vulgar Favors,'' by Maureen Orth, a reporter for
Cunanan's favorite magazine, Vanity Fair; and ``Three Month
Fever,'' by the essayist and novelist Gary Indiana. He would not,
however, be pleased by his characterization in either book, or by
the things his friends have said about him. At least in hindsight,
the grandiose edifice of lies he built on the level foundation of
his life never fooled anyone. One friend did say something
perceptive to Indiana, however, observing that Cunanan's tragedy
was not that he was a congenital liar, but that no one around him
ever told him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Both books have a polemical edge. The subtitle of Orth's
``Vulgar Favors'' points to part of her mission, to expose the
overlaps, and gaps, in this country's jurisdictional systems. The
wonder is not that the manhunt for Cunanan failed, but that any
manhunt could ever succeed, given the turf wars, the political
pressures, the egos, the colossal unwieldiness of the system, and
the incompetence of individuals within it _ it is a sorry story
that Orth tells, pointing out that better mechanisms exist for
tracing a missing vehicle than for tracking a missing person or a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, a renegade essayist and author of ``Resentment,'' a
hilarious and disturbing novel about the trial of the Menendez
brothers, finds Cunanan's story ``somewhat poignant and depressing
but fairly ordinary.'' What scares Indiana is not Cunanan, but the
force of the unleashed media, the willingness of people to sell
themselves to the media, and the willingness of the public to buy
into the process. Most of the coverage of the manhunt and the case
was lurid and homophobic because Cunanan represented everything the
heterosexual public loves to hate about gay people. Indiana, who
delights in paradox, argues that the glittering, money-fueled
fashion-and-media world of Versace is every bit as sociopathic as
everyone said Cunanan was.
</P>
<P>
   Orth is an indefatigable reporter who apparently thinks that the
indiscriminate piling up of detail will suggest verisimilitude
rather than bad writing and inadequate editing; almost every page
presents a litter of detail that needs hoovering. Orth is a tourist
in many of the worlds Andrew Cunanan called home. This means that
she can sometimes be fresh and even fearless: ``In Gay America, men
treat each other as objects in a manner that most women today would
consider blatantly sexist.'' She insists that Versace was
HIV-positive (the only major figure in Cunanan's saga who was),
despite the strenuous objections and denials of the Versace family.
</P>
<P>
   More often, when Orth aspires to the Vanity Fair smirk, the tone
of the knowing insider, she comes out sounding gaga, clueless, or
even prejudicial. Twice she may have been telephoned by Cunanan _
the giveaway, to her, was his ``gay voice,'' whatever that might be
(Liberace? Randolph Scott?). When it comes to explaining the
unexplainable, she resorts to psychobabble about the interaction of
drugs and pornography on Cunanan's unbalanced mind. Her book is
badly organized, repetitious, and much too given to the
portentously pat summary (``The unraveling had begun'').
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's effort is riskier and more successful. Much of the
book is narrated from inside Cunanan's mind; the rest is interview
material, Indiana's own assessments, or police and FBI material,
printed without comment, though never without effect. Indiana also
incorporates far more of Cunanan's sophomorically clever writing
than Orth does (Cunanan's postcards reveal more than they intended
to). For the rest, Indiana uses his experience and a novelist's
imagination to fill in the gaps in a way that almost always seems
persuasive and plausible.
</P>
<P>
   He is by no means a tourist in Cunanan's world and takes much
for granted that makes Orth gasp. His eye and ear are alert, and so
is his evaluating brain. Of Norman Blachford, who kept Cunanan for
a year, Indiana writes, ``His statements to police and FBI suggest
a serene detachment from the case, as if an appliance he had once
leased were now suspected of causing a warehouse fire.'' He
incorporates many of the same facts or factoids that appear in
Orth's narrative and appears to have interviewed many of the same
people; but many of his facts are different ones, or contradict
Orth's discoveries, or come with his own spin on them. ``What isn't
plausible,'' Indiana writes, ``is that Andrew sunned himself on the
Riviera and regularly fleeced little fortunes out of lonely
millionaires while managing a drugstore and living with his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Orth's book comes without illustrations, though there are
photographs of Cuananan's victims on the dust jacket and a wanted
poster on the frontispiece; Indiana has 16 pages of black-and-white
pictures, including a police photo of the dead killer. Both books
were completed in great haste, which sometimes shows; both writers
have paradoxically become subject to the same media pressures they
attack. Orth's Cunanan ends up as a cliche, a drug-crazed monster;
Indiana argues that the the media needed Cunanan to be a monster
and therefore made him one. The real monster slouching through our
society is something else.

MURPHY'S LATEST COULD USE MORE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LIFE 
Directed by: Ted Demme 
Screenplay by: Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Nick Cassevetes, Obba
Babatunde, Ned Beatty, Bernie Mac, Miguel A. Nunez, Jr. Calrence
Williams III, Bokeem Woodbine 
Running Time: 109 min. 
Rated: R (strong language, some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy's on a roll _ straight downhill, on a crash course
with a legacy of comedic mediocrity. The opening scene of Murphy's
new film, ``Life,'' is set in a prison cemetery, as two inmates
shovel earth onto a grave. It's a fitting entree into a film that
feels like one more heap of dirt on Murphy's once-bright career,
which has been in an artistic free-fall for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of things wrong with ``Life,'' beginning
with its aspiration to be equal parts comedy and drama. Racial
bigotry and wrongful imprisonment make a dicey foundation for
humor, especially in a mainstream vehicle for a broad-brush actor
like Eddie Murphy. Maybe this is Murphy's stab at distancing
himself from the bloated, arrogant persona he's cultivated since
his early '80s heyday. But if the shift is well-intentioned, it's
still a move in the wrong direction _ away from the edgy wiseguy
that made Murphy a star and toward a more layered concept that he
simply isn't dimensional enough to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Life,'' Murphy stars as Ray Gibson, a small-time New York
hustler in the '30s whose destiny becomes entwined with that of
aspiring bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) when he lifts
Banks's wallet in a swank Harlem nightclub. Both wind up owing
money to Spanky, the club owner, who lets the pair pay off their
respective debts by going on a bootlegging run to Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   While there, the two are framed by a white sheriff for murder
and are sentenced to life in a Southern plantation-style prison.
Following a bit of ditch-digging, however, Ray, Claude, and the
predictable crew of fun-loving criminals seem to spend most of
their time playing baseball, hosting barbeques for the locals, and
growing older _ 60 years older, in fact, during which time Ray and
Claude develop an ``Odd-Couple''-style friendship chock full of
cranky confrontations and old-biddy bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant work of famed Hollywood makeup artist Rick Baker
(the latex-wielding craftsman behind Murphy's ``The Nutty
Professor'') is the most believable feature of this lifelong
relationship, which strains unsuccessfully to expand beyond the
confines of tired jail-cell jokes and botched escape schemes. As
the film leaps decades in a single bound _ spanning 1932 to the
present via newsreels and hairstyles _ Ray and Claude are
transformed with phenomenal detail and clarity from young adulthood
to midlife to old age. But the pair's physical transformation isn't
matched on an emotional level. Which would be just fine, if
``Life'' wasn't striving to be something deeper than a kooky buddy
film. Murphy, however is utterly incapable of conveying the subtly
drawn tenderness that would have animated Ray's long and
complicated bond with Claude. One wonders why Lawrence's Claude _
who has the advantage of being able to react, in contrast to
Murphy, whose delivery is exclusively in-your-face _ even bothers
to maintain this friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the human drama that ``Life'' aims to capture between
gags is supplied in fits and starts by the supporting cast: Bokeem
Woodbine as Can't Get Right, a young inmate who is unable to speak
and fathers a child with the superintendent's daughter; Miguel A.
Nunez Jr. as Biscuit, a gay prisoner who can't face his family upon
release; and Ned Beatty as the sympathetic prison superintendent.
And the whole motley crew does, over the years, become something
like one big, strange happy family.
</P>
<P>
   Something as simple as funnier jokes (how many times are we
expected to laugh at the burly lifer awkwardly coming on to the new
kid on the cell block?), or a glimmer of poignancy to mark decades
surviving a cruel fate, might have breathed some life into this
film. As it is, ``Life'' is DOA.

DID YOUR WIDDLE COMPUTER GO BOOM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I recently had my computer upgraded to Windows
98. Since that time I frequently experience a situation that
results in my machine stopping completely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going Nowhere Fast
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOWHERE: We computer professionals refer to that situation
as ``another satisfied Microsoft customer.'' It generally occurs
when Windows thinks it knows more about your hardware than you do.
</P>
<P>
   During installation, Win98 scans your computer, decides how
stuff should be set up, tweaks itself, then forwards all your
personal information, bank account numbers, shoe size and your
permanent record from high school to Microsoft. Well, maybe I
exaggerate a bit, but the point is that the upgrade program can
occasionally mess up no matter what all the hype out of Redmond
says. And I was never tardy as much as they said.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have at least 32MB of memory, no matter what the
smiling salesman tells you. Assuming your hardware is adequate _
oh, get your mind out of the gutter _ you now need to deconstruct
your computer. Remove all the peripherals and unload their driver
programs until all you have left are the drives, motherboard,
monitor and mouse. Now start adding things back in one at a time,
making sure each thing functions the way it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   If something hangs up during this, you have some sort of
hardware conflict. Right-click on My Computer, then select
Properties, then Device Manager. Check the properties of each
peripheral, and if you find a conflict, try setting the resources
manually.
</P>
<P>
   If none of that works, hit Control-Alt-Delete, which should
bring up a list of all the stuff in the background. I know it looks
like the software engineers just combined random letters to make
obscure, noninformative program names in an underhanded attempt to
scare you out of shutting one down, but don't be afraid. The worst
that can happen if you select one and click on End Task is that
you'll crash, and you're already doing that. Most systems can get
by just running Explorer and Systray.
</P>
<P>
   If you think one of the background programs is the culprit, run
Msconfig.exe, which will let you selectively remove all things from
the start-up process. Gee, see how much faster Windows loads now?
</P>
<P>
   In the event all that doesn't make a difference, it's time to
nuke the machine and start from scratch. Or try the ``uncrashable''
freebie operating system Linux, as if anybody could actually
install it without an engineering degree from the Institute of
Applied Dweebology.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm looking for a site where I can put in a
phone number and find out who it belongs to. I swear I'm not some
neurotic homemaker trying to find out who that bimbo is who keeps
calling my husband and hanging up whenever I answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrong Number
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NUM: Please don't call my editor a bimbo. Her love life is
just a little confused right now. You can find her name and address
by going to www.reversephonedirectory.com and trying one of several
lookup services. One of them also identifies her neighbors, but
please don't start calling them and telling them what a trampy
little home wrecker she is.
</P>
<P>

above trick to harass anyone unless the hussy really deserved it.

NAMESAKE SHOW STRIKES A CHORD IN PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Everywhere Melina Kanakaredes turned,
residents of this smitten city reached out for her, eager for a
word, a smile, a wave, as if Kanakaredes were more than just the
star of a television program, as if she were a civic heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in a way, she is, especially at a cultural moment when
identification with a hit TV show or movie can reshape a
community's image (how many ``Cheers''-watchers still think of
Boston as a friendly place ``where everybody knows your name''?)
</P>
<P>
   This uncut gem of a city has long believed _ with ample
justification _ that the wider world tends to look down on or
ignore Providence. That got harder to do as Providence poured
nearly $2 billion into an urban revival featuring a waterfront
park, a new convention center with an attached hotel, and a massive
shopping mall now nearing completion downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Condescending to Rhode Island's capital has gotten even harder
since NBC's ``Providence'' emerged as the hottest new network drama
of the season. Every Friday night, more than 13 million viewers
across the country see the city of Providence bathed in a golden
light as a locale of romance and drama. Of course, the Providence
of ``Providence'' has its share of social problems, but that only
makes life more dramatically challenging for Dr. Sydney Hansen
(Kanakaredes), a plastic surgeon who has forsaken the glamour of
life in the Hollywood fast lane to return, as the character says,
``back where I never thought I'd be, in Providence, my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cast and crew of ``Providence'' returned to the show's
namesake for the first time since it began airing in January,
Daniel Frageorgia Jr. felt he had to be there. ``This show is
what's putting Providence on the map,'' exulted Frageorgia, a
35-year-old chef who was among hundreds of onlookers watching
``Providence'' film scenes Wednesday on the banks of the Providence
River.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Frageorgia believes the show is perfectly
timed because it spotlights Providence just as the city is in the
middle of a renaissance. ``Ten or 15 years ago, you didn't want to
come to Providence,'' he said. ``But now is the time to do this
show. It's making Providence a tourist attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Briggs, a 64-year-old retiree who lives in the city,
hastened to Waterplace Park with her friend Nancy DeAngelis as soon
as she heard the show was in town. ``I've watched every episode
from the very start,'' said Briggs, as DeAngelis gave a me-too nod.
``It shows the best of Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the cast and crew of ``Providence'' were here, to
shoot the pilot show in October, the Akron, Ohio-born Kanakaredes
was a little-known actress from the daytime soap opera, ``The
Guiding Light.'' But on Wednesday, as a newly minted prime-time
star of a family drama that consistently ranks among the top
20-rated network programs each week, her every move was avidly
watched by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   And Kanakaredes was looking right back at Providence _ and
marveling at the swiftly changing face of the city that has
embraced her show as a symbol of its revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that sense, when you come here, that it's coming into
its rebirth,'' she said during a break in filming. Kanakaredes
pointed across the street at Providence Place, a 150-store shopping
mall slated to open in August, and remarked ``That was just being
talked about the first time we were here. Now, look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' (which airs locally at 8 p.m. on WHDH-Ch. 7) has
been embraced by the city's colorful mayor, Vincent (Buddy) Cianci,
who recently appeared on the show, and who hosted a party for the
cast on Monday night. ``The mayor tells us about the city, and he
tells us about the people,'' said actress Concetta Tomei, who plays
Sydney's mother on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Cianci gleefully recounted a
conversation he had two weeks ago with Baltimore Mayor Kurt L.
Schmoke. According to Cianci, Schmoke praised ``Providence'' thusly
to his fellow mayor: ``Boy, the skyline looks terrific, with a good
storyline about a woman coming home, helping her family,
contributing to the community.'' The way Cianci tells it, Schmoke
then added, presumably with a touch of rueful envy: ``I've got a
show too on television. It's called `Homicide.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That story was already making the rounds among onlookers at
Wednesday's filming. After feeling like underdogs for so long,
Rhode Islanders are clearly savoring the heady feeling of being in,
of being hot. With pleasure, they recall that it was Providence,
not Boston, that was chosen by the National Football League as the
host city for the AFC Conference Championship Game in 1997.
Moreover, the entertainment industry has discovered Little Rhody in
a big way. In the past few years, movies ranging from ``Amistad''
to ``True Lies'' to ``There's Something About Mary'' have been
partly shot in Rhode Island. Movie star Jim Carrey will be coming
to the state soon to film ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' the latest
effort by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the native Rhode Islanders
behind ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's no business like show business. ``Does it bring
in money? Absolutely,'' said Cianci. ``Does it bring in
construction work? Yes.'' For instance, the mayor said Teamsters
union members logged an estimated 138,000 hours of work last year
on TV and film work in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   But Providence the city has embraced ``Providence'' the TV show
for reasons that go beyond jobs and money. Residents appear
grateful that a national audience is being told something they
already know, that this is a nice place to live and work, and that
the show reflects the tight family bonds on which Rhode Islanders
pride themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those skyline shots. ``I told the mayor that
we were going to shoot postcards of the city, make it as beautiful
as possible,'' said ``Providence'' creator and executive producer
John Masius as he watched the set-up for one shot. ``The fact is it
is a beautiful city.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Sydney turns her back on a successful plastic
surgery practice in Los Angeles and returns to Providence, where
she goes to work at a health clinic serving mostly poor patients.
Her love life is a complicated one, as is her family life. She
becomes a kind of caretaker for her veterinarian father, who
connects better with animals than humans; her sister Joanie, who is
coping with being an unwed mother; a ne'er-do-well brother, Robbie;
and a mother who, though she died at Joanie's (canceled) wedding,
keeps reappearing in dream sequences, where she is every bit as
commanding and difficult as she was in life.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other character: Providence. ``The city is one of
the characters of the show,'' said Masius, in a theme immediately
picked up by the show's co-executive producer, Bob DeLaurentis.
``We love this city,'' said DeLaurentis. ``It stands for that
semimythical place we all feel we miss, where families are still
close and people still look out for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that the city bears such an evocative name, one
whose meaning is not lost on the actors or producers involved in a
show that revolves around themes of second chances and finding
meaning in your own life by helping others.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes shot Wednesday will air during the May ratings
``sweeps'' period. On hand for the filming were Tomei; Paula Cale,
who plays Joanie; Seth Peterson, who plays Robbie; and Tom Verica,
who plays Kyle, Sydney's love interest. (None of the scenes
involved Mike Farrell of ``MASH'' fame, who plays the father, so he
wasn't present.)
</P>
<P>
   The actors cheerfully signed autographs and posed for pictures
with their arms draped around fans. ``I feel like we're the
Beatles,'' remarked Cale, looking at the crowds gathered on stone
steps at Waterplace Park. Tomei, whose character chain-smokes on
the show, chatted with a youngster, emphasizing that she doesn't
smoke in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers got a glimpse at the tedium and repetitiveness
involved in making a TV show, but were on balance patient and
good-humored, and most obediently fell silent when crew members
shushed them before each take. Most, but not all: ``Kyle? Oh my
God!'' screamed one young woman just as cameras began to roll for a
scene involving Sydney delivering some dismaying news to Kyle on a
park bench.
</P>
<P>
   For a day, the banks of the Providence River became a movie set,
with klieg lights, crane-operated cameras, and scores of crew
members. A dozen extras clustered hopefully on the grass, hoping
for a walk-on role. Meanwhile, the city of Providence played its
own part, complete with the sound effects of a booming city: the
steady rat-a-tat-tat of building construction.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't appear to bother Kanakaredes. ``There is something
quite divine about Providence,'' she said.

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Serb government is happy to publicize these
atrocities _ just as NATO is ready and willing to report every
atrocity committed by Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's new ground rules are playing into Serbian hands. For
it is becoming ever clearer that somewhere _ in Washington,
perhaps, or Brussels or the Aviano air base in Italy _ someone has
decided that Serb civilians must suffer for their country's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Or that their lives can now be regarded as forfeit if they live
near a barracks or an airfield or happen to be travelling on a
passenger train.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb authorities _ who denied the stories told by thousands
of Albanian refugees of ``ethnic cleansing'' at the hands of Serb
forces _ were quite specific in their description of the slaughter
of as many as 75 Albanian refugees by NATO aircraft Wednesday,
first near the village of Medjan, at 1:30 in the afternoon, then at
Bistrazin at 3:0 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanians were travelling in cars and tractors,
``escorted'' by at least three Serb policemen. The three cops were
also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Did NATO believe these were Serbs driving down the roads of
southern Kosovo? Or did they see military traffic and decide _ as
they did when they bombed a barracks 50 meters (165 feet) from a
Belgrade hospital on Tuesday _ that the risk of harming civilians
was worth taking anyway? For that now seems to be NATO's policy in
its bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark _ the general who thought he could fight a war
without ground troops _ gave a deeply unsettling performance when
he tried to explain the train massacre this week.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot only saw the train enter his bomb frame at the last
second, he said. But then _ incredibly, knowing the train was there
_ he returned to fire two more missiles at the railway bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even to attack a railway bridge _ in daylight _ when NATO knew
that it carried scheduled passenger services, begs a thousand moral
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded passengers from the train have all described how the
NATO jet hovered in the air for several seconds before making its
second bombing run on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Was it an RAF Harrier? The Yugoslav military believe a British
aircraft bombed Aleksinac. A ``technical malfunction,'' NATO said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Serb government is happy to publicize these
atrocities _ just as NATO is ready and willing to report every
atrocity committed by Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's new ground rules are playing into Serbian hands. For
it is becoming ever clearer that somewhere _ in Washington,
perhaps, or Brussels or the Aviano air base in Italy _ someone has
decided that Serb civilians must suffer for their country's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Or that their lives can now be regarded as forfeit if they live
near a barracks or an airfield or happen to be travelling on a
passenger train.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb authorities _ who denied the stories told by thousands
of Albanian refugees of ``ethnic cleansing'' at the hands of Serb
forces _ were quite specific in their description of the slaughter
of as many as 75 Albanian refugees by NATO aircraft Wednesday,
first near the village of Medjan, at 1:30 in the afternoon, then at
Bistrazin at 3:0 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanians were travelling in cars and tractors,
``escorted'' by at least three Serb policemen. The three cops were
also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Did NATO believe these were Serbs driving down the roads of
southern Kosovo? Or did they see military traffic and decide _ as
they did when they bombed a barracks 50 meters (165 feet) from a
Belgrade hospital on Tuesday _ that the risk of harming civilians
was worth taking anyway? For that now seems to be NATO's policy in
its bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark _ the general who thought he could fight a war
without ground troops _ gave a deeply unsettling performance when
he tried to explain the train massacre this week.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot only saw the train enter his bomb frame at the last
second, he said. But then _ incredibly, knowing the train was there
_ he returned to fire two more missiles at the railway bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even to attack a railway bridge _ in daylight _ when NATO knew
that it carried scheduled passenger services, begs a thousand moral
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded passengers from the train have all described how the
NATO jet hovered in the air for several seconds before making its
second bombing run on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Was it an RAF Harrier? The Yugoslav military believe a British
aircraft bombed Aleksinac. A ``technical malfunction,'' NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ after the Serbs have repeatedly claimed (in an attempt
to cover up their own war crimes) that Albanians are in fear of
NATO bombs, NATO kills dozens of them in an air raid.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's no doubt that the greatest victims of this
catastrophe are the dispossessed Kosovo Albanians. And there are
war criminals among the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger
of looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with.
</P>
<P>
   Convince the public the cause is just, liken the enemy to
Hitler, sanitize every nastiness perpetrated by your side, and
claim you are firmly on the way to victory _ these are the rules of
the game. Both sides have been faithfully playing them. Until the
train on the bridge at Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   The affair could have been a PR disaster, proof of how the
allies _ in their frustration at their failure to land a knockout
blow to the Milosevic military machine _ were sinking to terror
bombing of helpless civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Prevarication, or pretending the train was a legitimate military
target, would have made matters even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we witnessed a rare and deliberate show of honesty. It
was an ``unfortunate accident...we are all very sorry for it,''
Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander said as the press was shown
a full cockpit video of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, it transpired, had fired not one bomb, but two; the
second after he knew he had hit a train.
</P>
<P>
   Quite why that second attack happened is unclear. But we
basically know what happened, and few more questions need to be
asked. Had Richard Nixon followed a similar course in Watergate,
history might have been rather different.
</P>
<P>
   Now that allied planes have claimed culpability for the deadly
hit on the refugee convoy near Djakovica, we must brace for a far
more harrowing mea culpa from NATO _ and conceivably a sea change
in public attitudes to the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, Belgrade's forays into the propaganda war have been
more comic than threatening: ``88 NATO men dead and 32 planes
lost,'' ran a front-page headline last week in the Greek daily,
Athinaiki, gleefully reported by the official Yugoslav news agency,
Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
   News indeed to warm Serb hearts, but somewhat at variance with
the one verified loss of an F-117. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed two mysteries of this strangest of wars are the tiny
scale of NATO losses (one aircraft and, as far as can be
ascertained, not a single human life, astonishing given the advance
publicity about Serb air defense capabilities) and the small
civilian death toll in Serbia directly caused by the bombing _
until Wednesday at least, under 100. Had there been more, we would
most certainly have known.
</P>
<P>
   Then there have been the tales put out by the Serbian
Information Ministry of ``columns'' of deserters from the NATO
force stationed in Yugoslavia, donning civilian clothes and
streaming into Greece and Bulgaria, and of conscience-stricken
Norwegian pilots who refused to take part in the air attack, and
returned home to the cheers of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   For those who dare criticize, there is the fate of Slavko
Curuvija, the anti-Milosevic independent newspaper owner shot dead
outside his Belgrade apartment on Sunday. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO of course propagates its own brand of wishful thinking.
Early on, we were told of Kosovo Albanian leaders who had been
murdered. It transpired they had not, and NATO, admittedly
retracted the claim.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, its spokesmen were claiming to detect fissures in the
Yugoslav army's high command over President Slobodan Milosevic's
policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, despite every sign that the war is solidifying
support for Milosevic, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
was virtually predicting a coup. If only...
</P>
<P>
   But these are small errors, set against the giant shadow cast
over everything the allies say by the miscalculation with which the
war started. A few days, they assured, no ground troops and just a
handful of judiciously aimed Cruise missiles, before the evil
dictator came to his senses.
</P>
<P>
   The music has now changed. ``We always knew this would be a long
haul,'' NATO now insists. If so, then everything it implied, if not
said out loud, before March 24 was nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ever so. Did not World War I begin with the blithe
conviction the boys would be home for Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Western public opinion doubts about the air war
strategy have been submerged by the flood of horror stories of
pillage, rape and murder committed by the Serbs against ethnic
Albanians. But these stories too could in their turn be submerged
by the horror of what apparently happened near the southern Kosovo
town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the refugees were being used as human shields is almost
irrelevant. For the Serbs the carnage was a propaganda coup: a
``crime against humanity'' according to the Foreign Ministry in
Belgrade _ exactly the language used by NATO leaders to describe
Milosevic's tactics in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack strikes at the heart of the weakness of NATO's
presentation of the war _ not lies over daily events, but the fog
of confusion and contradictions surrounding the war's ends.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Kosovo is acquiring the reek of Vietnam, and the line
then that encapsulated the failure of the Pentagon's policy: for
villages to be saved, they sometimes had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win the war,'' say Tony Blair, Bill Clinton et al, day
after successive day of bombing of targets which never seem to get
destroyed the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the bombing is working, they insist, only to order up
another 300 aircraft to finish the job _ and risk more disasters
like Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
   Defying if not the truth, at least elementary common sense, they
cling to the Rambouillet formula that Kosovo remains part of
Yugoslavia even after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Do they really think it can? Do they really believe that having
uprooted more than one million Kosovo Albanians, and having sent
500,000 of them fleeing the country in terror, Milosevic will
meekly admit the folly of his ways and let them back in? Do they
think they will ever come back while Yugoslavia retains a shred of
authority over the province?
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is already asking these questions. Sooner or
later, the gap between the demonization of Milosevic as a
latter-day Hitler, and the refusal to send in a single ground
soldier after him, will become too wide for the most artful
propagandist to bridge. &QL;

   The most ominous development of the war in Kosovo has come with
the news that the Serb forces in the province are shelling Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The great danger now is that the war will spill over into
Macedonia and the Yugoslav province of Montenegro, leading to more
burned villages, dispersed families and an acceleration of the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO talks about ``tightening the screws'' on Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, his army is continuing to
ignore NATO bombs and wage the war on its own terms by shelling the
towns of Tropoja and Padesh in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly surprising given that Albania has recently handed
over control of its airspace and ports to NATO. Albania is now the
base from which NATO has decided to land its punches on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic is thus justified to regard his regime at
war with Albania. While this now forces NATO to protect Albania,
NATO must ensure that the fighting does not to spread to Macedonia
and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that this does not happen, NATO needs to hold fast to
its political objectives. At Wednesday's meeting in Brussels, the
19 NATO members pledged to attack President Milosevic until he
``accedes to the demands of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important of these demands is that the Yugoslav regime
allows Kosovars to return to their homeland and live there in
tranquillity. This will be impossible without an army to keep the
ethnic Albanians and Serbs from each others' throats.
</P>
<P>
   There will have to be a NATO element in that force if the ethnic
Albanians are to accept it. The establishment of a protectorate
will be difficult enough without having to cope with an all-out
Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   The Western governments are tortuously maneuvering towards
accepting the inevitability of using ground troops through double
negatives and what they leave unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is carefully leaving open the opportunity to
authorize a land invasion. The Pentagon has admitted that there are
plans for an invasion. And despite the politicians' platitudes that
invading Kosovo will be dangerous, NATO will win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to the successful prosecution of an invasion
is doubt in the minds of Kosovo's neighbors about NATO's aims.
</P>
<P>
   The support or at least the acquiescence of Greece, Macedonia
and Montenegro are all important to the success of a limited war.
The swiftest way to provoke their hostility is to instill the
suspicion that the NATO protectorate in Kosovo will lead to the
creation of a greater Albanian state.
</P>
<P>
   The Western governments must announce that the external borders
of Yugoslavia are not in question. The West must ensure that the
war is being fought to defend the Kosovar people and will be ended
only with the use of infantry. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   With her neck and shoulder swaddled in bandages, she looked up
at us Tuesday from her bed, a pretty dark-haired woman of 23 who
was as angry as she was in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which hurts more _ my stomach, my shoulder or my
heart,'' she told us. ``It was the third bomb that broke the window
and did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. On a lower floor, 74-year-old
Radisav Milosavljevic _ already suffering a serious heart problem _
lay curled up like a giant fetus, bandages covering half his head
and face, his heart monitor racing on a small screen to the left of
his bed.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs had vibrated through the entire Military Medical
Academy, shaking the bed of 14-year old Ivan Labovic, fatally
wounded during a NATO bomb attack on Pristina on March 30 and now
dying _ heavily drugged but still conscious _ in the intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wounded near his home in the back, the abdomen,
stomach, liver and spleen,'' Doctor Nenad Markovic said. ``He has
had major surgery four times already but the wall of his stomach is
missing. I don't think we can save him.''
</P>
<P>
   Six other patients lay beside Ivan, one of them a soldier, the
rest civilians, all dying like the 14-year old, all in a coma, all
on respirators.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were brain-dead _ most were hit by falling masonry
during air raids _ and a young doctor was using a tube to suck
saliva from the throat of a young man gravely wounded in the NATO
bombing of Aleksinac 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will die _ I'm afraid they are all going to die,'' Dr.
Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   Half its 1,000 patients are civilians and the other half both
soldiers and members of army families _ non-military personnel can
buy their way into the hospital's care with medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical center is located in a suburb teeming with
barrack buildings, parade grounds and army compounds. Most of them
are deserted and NATO was evidently not aiming at the hospital. But
it knew the risk it was taking when it bombed the army garages
behind the hospital's teaching center. And it wounded Dragana
Krstic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution with General Aco Jovicic as its head. True, there are
soldiers as well as civilians among the patients.
</P>
<P>
   But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed to be safe
from attack under the rules of war, as well as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   What if the NATO bombs had deviated just a few meters, as they
had at Aleksinac where 24 people are known to have been killed? Did
Dragana Krstic and old Radisav Milosavljevic have to be lacerated
by glass for a row of empty barrack buildings? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a communist's preference for rhetoric rather than argument
_ and an ability to destroy any arguments with exaggeration on an
epic scale _ Gen. Jovicic loudly denounced the damage to his
hospital as a ``war crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, he told us, was fighting in ``a dance against
Satan'' and ``only the crimes of Ghengis Khan'' could compare to
the NATO attacks on Serbia. The Americans were ``psychopaths
realizing their frustrations in death and destruction all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   We wanted him to stop, to let facts speak for themselves, to end
this genuinely angry but nonsensical tirade.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, walking the wards of the Belgrade Military
Medical Academy, I remembered another hospital I walked through
seven years ago, in Sarajevo, deliberately shelled for months by
Bosnian Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought of those thousands of Kosovo Albanians,
dispossesed, in despair, the victims of Serb special police, who
desperately need the care and compassion that these Serb doctors
demonstrate each day in this Belgrade hospital. But victims cannot
be balanced against each other. &QL;

   NATO's spokesman, James Shea, says the alliance goes to
``extraordinary lengths'' to avoid civilian casualties. But this is
totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NATO planes destroyed a passenger train in
southeastern Serbia while bombing a bridge that it called ``a
military supply line.'' In other words, it was prepared to target a
railway track in mid-morning _ in full knowledge that the railway
carried scheduled passenger trains _ in order to blow up a bridge.

   The same applied in Banjica Tuesday. NATO bombed a barracks and
wounded hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   By a terrible irony, we found Mira Drijaca waiting outside the
medical center to visit her wounded brother, Mica. Mira is a
pediatric doctor. Mica is a surgeon. He was wounded while tending
to patients at a clinic more than a week ago _ in another NATO
bombing attack, this time on a nearby military airport outside
Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to Belgrade with his legs covered in burns. Mira
carried a plastic bag of homemade cakes and easter eggs for her
doctor-brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing wrong to the pilot of the plane that wounded
him,'' she said. ``I don't think the pilot knows why he bombed. He
was ordered to do it.'' As for her brother, ``I tell him to
endure.''
</P>
<P>
   In her bed, Dragana Kristic is less forgiving in her pain. ``If
I met the pilot that did this,'' she said, touching the bandages at
her neck, ``I could only wish for his child to have a day like I
had.''  &LR;  &QL;

   LONDON _ NATO's bomb hit a farm compound. But why were the
refugees in a walled ``compound'' to start with?
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians have always lived in farms with high walls and
large wooden gates, sealed off from the outside world. When you
travelled across Kosovo you could often tell the nationality of the
owner by whether the house was open or shut off.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for these huge medieval-looking stockades is that
rural Albanians live in extended families, so they need a lot of
space. Another is Muslim conservatism; rural Kosovars do not like
their wives and daughters to be seen by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Again, for Kosovo Albanians, the outside world in the form of
the Serbian police and authorities has always been a hostile force,
so the Kosovars feel safer behind their high walls.
</P>
<P>
   Have Albanians always lived in Kosovo? Serbs and Albanians argue
over which community first settled Kosovo, but there is no doubt
that it was mainly Serb in the Middle Ages when their princes built
many monastaries there.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians became the majority under the five-century-long
rule of the Ottomans, which lasted until 1912, when Serbia retook
the province in the First Balkan War.
</P>
<P>
   From then until the 1930s the Serbs tried to resettle the
province but the experiment collapsed in the Second World War and
Marshal Tito, Yugoslavia's leader, forbade the prewar colonists to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Albanians settled in Kosovo from Albania proper
after the war, the real reason for the steep rise in the Albanian
population was their birthrate, the highest in Europe. &QL;

49ERS OWNER FIRES BACK AT SISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco 49ers' co-owner Edward DeBartolo
Jr. has gone on offensive, filing a $150 million federal lawsuit
against his estranged sister, Denise DeBartolo York, and vowing to
regain control of the football team.
</P>
<P>
   But what DeBartolo failed to say Thursday _ surrounded by his
family and 49er greats Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Roger Craig _
might make people in San Francisco wonder if he was intentionally
omitting a crucial play from his game plan.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, 52, continued to remain silent on the question of his
1997 promise to build a $200 million shopping mall adjacent to a
new football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the issue, a spokesman for DeBartolo from the Arthur
Andersen consulting company refused to engage in what he called
``speculation'' about the commercial center, which, like the
stadium, is on hold. City officials say the mall must be built if
the club is to receive $100 million in public financing authorized
by voters nearly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was extremely telling that Mr. DeBartolo did not
deal with any of the key issues ... which would lead one to believe
he doesn't have the answers to some very good questions,'' said
York's spokesman, Sam Singer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Singer, York and her husband, 49ers vice president
John York, are committed to ``finding an economically sensible way
to build a stadium-mall project in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Mayor Willie Brown, who
rallied support for some public financing for the stadium and
commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League spokesman Greg Aiello said the league
would not comment on the latest legal development in the running
dispute between DeBartolo and York.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a week of furious activity that included futile attempts
to resolve their differences at a meeting Tuesday in Youngstown,
Ohio, DeBartolo announced through spokesman Rick Rice that the
16-page lawsuit had been filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused York of repudiating two agreements giving
her brother control of the club, including an Aug. 14, 1998,
written pact to move ahead with a tax-free spinoff of the 49ers to
DeBartolo as part of a separation of their financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, in return, was to give up all his shares in the
family company. The agreement would have required the approval of
the Internal Revenue Service and the NFL. For the purposes of the
spinoff, the club was to be valued at $350 million _ $333 million
more than it cost DeBartolo in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo claimed, however, that York and one of her attorneys
changed their minds in the wake of other football deals that
followed in which franchises were sold or offered for much greater
sums.
</P>
<P>
   He also alleged that York was concerned with a significant
devaluation of her immense assets in the Simon Property Group, the
nation's largest commercial property company, in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, DeBartolo claimed that, after years of having no
interest in the club, York was increasingly eager to hold on to it
because of a ``lucrative financing plan'' offered by the NFL to
owners who wished to build or renovate their stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all this, DeBartolo alleged, York had come to regret
her agreement to sell. ``She wanted to find a way out,'' the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo also alleged in the lawsuit that he continued to have
``total and complete power to make all decisions'' affecting the
franchise under terms of a 1986 agreement with the family company,
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, that agreement transferred ownership
of the club to a subsidiary of the company in order to ``make
profitable use of tax losses from the team,'' which was running
``substantial deficits.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit came on the heels of a lawsuit against
DeBartolo filed in San Francisco Superior Court last week by the
DeBartolo Corp., which DeBartolo and York co-own, but which York
controls. The $3 billion company _ named for their late father, one
of the nation's leading builders of shopping malls _ owns 90
percent of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   That lawsuit accused DeBartolo of reneging on a $94 million debt
and cutting a shady side deal with the likely developer of the
proposed mall. It called on him to repay the money and abandon any
financial interest in the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Thursday's federal lawsuit against her, York said
in a statement that her own lawsuit ``was necessary to maintain the
stability of the company my father created.'' She also said her
brother's lawsuit had ignored ``key facts,'' including his
indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo has not been in an official club management post since
1997, when he voluntarily stepped down from positions in the
corporation and the club, following disclosure of his role in a
gambling-and-bribery case in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In March, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue fined DeBartolo $1
million and continued his suspension through the end of the
1999-2000 football season.

   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But we saw other dark and terrible things on the road between
Djakovica and Prizren Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of terrified Kosovo Albanians, women and children and
old men, peering from behind black curtains as they were driven
east; row after row of burned out houses, some of them still
burning, a few just set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   And several of the dead along the road appeared to have been
attacked by machine-gun fire. Is NATO strafing the roads of
southern Kosovo as well as bombing them?
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say that 74 Albanian refugees were massacred on this
road on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I counted 20 corpses _ or parts of bodies in three bombing
locations along a 12-mile stretch of highway and in the mortuary at
Prizren where a half-naked woman and a tiny girl covered in blood
lay on the floor partly covered in shrouds.
</P>
<P>
   Esmet Sulja, whose sister-in-law was in the mortuary, told
journalists brought here by Serb officials that he came from the
Kosovo village of Malitce and was told to move ``for his own
safety'' three weeks ago to Dobros.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he says he was driving his tractor containing 35
people in the trailer from Djakovica to Prizren when planes began
dropping bombs around him. The 46-year-old man, who had lacerations
on his face as he lay in a hospital bed, told us five of the
passengers had been killed in the trailer .
</P>
<P>
   There were terrible scenes along the road, for the Serbs had
left many of the bodies where they were found.
</P>
<P>
   A grey-haired old man lay cut in half in a tree, six corpses
including that of a very young woman lay in brightly colored
clothes in a field where they had been dragged after the air raid.
</P>
<P>
   I found a human head 50 meters (165 feet) away and skeletons
burned out in the back of another trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The munitions parked along the road bore several American
markings. &QL;

very moment is scripting a movie about her life, Grasso says she
will never work at hard physical labor again. But it is clear she
wants to work small miracles on behalf of others. Grasso said she
will fund programs for people with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to be low, down-key, and I'm going to continue
that way,'' Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a genuine individual case of blessed are the meek,
but it does not change the fact that most of the meek shall not
inherit the earth through the lottery. It is not only to Grasso's
benefit that she already is coming off like a philanthropist. The
greater benefit goes to the lottery itself.
</P>
<P>
   It could have not have dreamed up a more disarming poster child
to distract us from its regressive underbelly. To make one humble
woman rich, the lottery first had to rob the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a Globe series on gambling found that residents
in working-class and low-income towns spent far more of their
disposable income on the lottery than people in wealthy suburbs.
While people in Weston bet a mere $63 per capita on the lottery, no
doubt because they are cleaning up in the stock market, people in
Chelsea spent $915 a year on the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   For Weston residents, the amount spent on the lottery was less
than two-tenths of 1 percent of income. For residents of Chelsea,
the amount was 8 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   The same Massachusetts that preaches personal responsibility and
hard work in slashing welfare is also the pusher preying on their
meager wages, blitzing every possible bodega, liquor store,
check-cashing joint, gas station and restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in the rest of the nation. Heavy players in
Virginia spend an average of $1,200 a year on the lottery, even
though one in six players had household incomes of less than
$15,000. In Maryland, heavy players (who spend at least $10 a week)
were heavily skewed toward high school dropouts and those making
less than $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, people in poor areas pay four times as much of the
earnings on the lottery than people in wealthy areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the 32 counties that spend the most per capita on
the lottery are all below the per capita average for state income.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, the three most impovershed counties are in the
top 10 for per-capita lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a 1995 study of data by Newsday found that people
in the poorest census tracts spent eight times more money on the
lottery than people in the highest income tracts.
</P>
<P>
   In that study, Robert Goodman, a professor at Hampshire College
in Amherst who studies gambling said, ``As you go down the income
scale, people perceive it as a form of investment. As you go up the
income scale, people do it as a form of entertainment. Government
is promoting an activity that is essentially a poor form of
investment for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that in 1996, the lottery took in $35 billion
from 38 states, and when you are reminded that nationally, only 34
cents per each dollar spent actually comes back to the people in
the form of public services _ a return that would never be
acceptable in the world of mutual funds _ that is an incredibly
wasted ``investment.'' It is a tax.
</P>
<P>
   The $35 billion would place the lotteries at No. 20 in the
Fortune 500, between Merrill Lynch and Prudential. But while
Merrill Lynch's bull rampages through Wall Street, creating untold
wealth for the top 5 percent of Americans, all you see from the
typical player of the lottery is a scratch, a sigh and a toss of a
worthless card into the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   There never has been a good reason for the state to push
gambling, and it is even more insidious in an era when politicians
are otherwise so mean to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The good fortune of Grasso does not change that one bit. It will
be nice if she gives some of her money to charity, but that is not
the way to spread the wealth. She is one beaming, highly publicized
woman who struck it rich. However, most players of the lottery,
when you catch them at the bodega counter, will readily tell you
they never expect to inherit the earth through their scratch
tickets. In fact, the state disinherits them every day.

   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the world exploded in
front of him and Asmani's family disappeared before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there was a big blast, and I started running,'' said
Asmani, leaning on his walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, `my God, NATO is bombing us.' I ran
through the field like a mouse. I'm ashamed, but I'm too old to lie
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What is without doubt is that NATO planes bombed the very
refugees they were trying to help _ people like Asmani. NATO called
it a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy began just after midday on Wednesday when an attack
team of American F-16 strike aircraft, armed with laser-guided
bombs, took off from their base at Aviano, in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to fly over southwest Kosovo, specifically
over towns where Serb MUP (interior ministry) police _ those
responsible for the past month's ethnic cleansing _ had been
spotted, and over areas known to be ``strategic supply routes'' for
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at 15,000 ft. _ out of reach of antiaircraft artillery
and handheld surface-to-air missiles _ the pilot in the lead
aircraft was passing over open country between the village of
Decani and the town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of the single-seater aircraft the ground
beneath him was dotted with villages that had been set on fire.
Three, four, he counted, all recently set alight and still burning
and all, he presumed, the work of the MUP.
</P>
<P>
   Then, passing over a dirt road that linked the two settlements,
he saw movement on the ground. Looking closer he saw what he
thought was a 60-vehicle convoy of vehicles. At the front of the
convoy were three green trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I saw) three uniformly shaped dark green vehicles, look(ed)
like deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot
recalled, speaking on a tape played to reporters Thursday by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come (sic) to a stop at the next house down the road. I
am convinced now that that's (army and police) forces working their
way down toward Djakovica.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that he had identified the same forces who had been
setting fire to the villages, the pilot decided to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go (sic) in, put my system on the lead vehicle and execute a
laser-guided bomb attack on that vehicle, destroying the lead
vehicle,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that he was running low of fuel, the pilot and his
wingman _ the second pilot in the flight, who was marking the
target with a laser for the bomber _ pulled away. He passed on the
map coordinates of the target to the next ``flight,'' or squad, of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In turn this next flight spotted another three vehicles in a
compound beside the dirt track. Using the same laser-guided
weapons, this team then moved in to destroy these targets, dropping
three bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon another team of F-16 bombers attacked a
separate military convoy. These were spotted on a road bridge east
of Djakovica. There was no information about civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This is NATO's account of events. But Belgrade's version of
events is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the Serbs say there was no military convoy in the
area around Djakovica on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what NATO took to be military targets were two convoys
of refugees, separated by around 15 miles. And they were not
heading towards Albania, but were travelling back into Kosovo from
the border crossings at Cafta Prusit and Vrbnica.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs claim the first convoy to be hit was a procession of
1,000 people and 100 vehicles _ tractors and private cars _ struck
by three bombs as it passed the village of Maja, close to
Djakovica. They say 64 people were killed and another 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, they say NATO aircraft struck a second convoy, this
one a line of 600 people travelling on the same road but in the
village of Zrze, 15 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   While this may have been the second of NATO's targets, Belgrade
insists there were no military vehicles, just refugees' tractors
and trailers. They said another 44 people were killed at Zrze and
dozens more injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This was) a horrendous massacre'' claimed the Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic. ``This cannot be explained as an error
when the columns of refugees were bombed four times _ this was done
deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a massacre of Albanian refugees who were returning to
their homes in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   What can we know for sure? We know that innocent refugees were
killed on Wednesday by bombs dropped from NATO planes. We know that
they were desperate, exhausted people who had probably been on the
move for weeks, their only possessions the little they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   We can presume that they were not deliberately targeted by NATO
_ the political fallout from this ``accident'' will be bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   We must question Pentagon and NATO suggestions that Yugoslav MiG
fighters attacked the columns. Experts point out that NATO would
have spotted and shot down any Serb planes.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the refugees themselves would not have been able to
identify whether they were Serb or NATO planes. They simply talk of
being attacked from the air, of the ground exploding in front of
them, and of shattered bodies and twisted machinery.
</P>
<P>
   They talk of a horror that has become ingrained on their
memories. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.

   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.

   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.

   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.

   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly

in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. The bombs had vibrated through the
entire Military Medical Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Nenad Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution. True, there are soldiers as well as civilians among
the patients. But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed
to be safe from attack under the rules of war, as well as
civilians... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene...
</P>
<P>
   Unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger of
looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety. Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the
world exploded in front of him and Asmani's family disappeared
before his eyes.

   ``All I could think was, `my God, NATO is bombing us.' I ran

<P>
   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged... &QL;

<P>
   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But we saw other dark and terrible things on the road between
Djakovica and Prizren Thursday afternoon... &QL;

<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. The bombs had vibrated through the
entire Military Medical Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Nenad Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution. True, there are soldiers as well as civilians among
the patients. But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed
to be safe from attack under the rules of war, as well as
civilians... &QL;

   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the world exploded in
front of him and Asmani's family disappeared before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there was a big blast, and I started running,'' said
Asmani, leaning on his walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, `my God, NATO is bombing us.' I ran
through the field like a mouse. I'm ashamed, but I'm too old to lie
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What is without doubt is that NATO planes bombed the very
refugees they were trying to help _ people like Asmani. NATO called
it a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy began just after midday on Wednesday when an attack
team of American F-16 strike aircraft, armed with laser-guided
bombs, took off from their base at Aviano, in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to fly over southwest Kosovo, specifically
over towns where Serb MUP (interior ministry) police _ those
responsible for the past month's ethnic cleansing _ had been
spotted, and over areas known to be ``strategic supply routes'' for
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at 15,000 ft. _ out of reach of antiaircraft artillery
and handheld surface-to-air missiles _ the pilot in the lead
aircraft was passing over open country between the village of
Decani and the town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of the single-seater aircraft the ground
beneath him was dotted with villages that had been set on fire.
Three, four, he counted, all recently set alight and still burning
and all, he presumed, the work of the MUP.
</P>
<P>
   Then, passing over a dirt road that linked the two settlements,
he saw movement on the ground. Looking closer he saw what he
thought was a 60-vehicle convoy of vehicles. At the front of the
convoy were three green trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I saw) three uniformly shaped dark green vehicles, look(ed)
like deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot
recalled, speaking on a tape played to reporters Thursday by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come (sic) to a stop at the next house down the road. I
am convinced now that that's (army and police) forces working their
way down toward Djakovica.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that he had identified the same forces who had been
setting fire to the villages, the pilot decided to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go (sic) in, put my system on the lead vehicle and execute a
laser-guided bomb attack on that vehicle, destroying the lead
vehicle,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that he was running low of fuel, the pilot and his
wingman _ the second pilot in the flight, who was marking the
target with a laser for the bomber _ pulled away. He passed on the
map coordinates of the target to the next ``flight,'' or squad, of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In turn this next flight spotted another three vehicles in a
compound beside the dirt track. Using the same laser-guided
weapons, this team then moved in to destroy these targets, dropping
three bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon another team of F-16 bombers attacked a
separate military convoy. These were spotted on a road bridge east
of Djakovica. There was no information about civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This is NATO's account of events. But Belgrade's version of
events is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the Serbs say there was no military convoy in the
area around Djakovica on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what NATO took to be military targets were two convoys
of refugees, separated by around 15 miles. And they were not
heading towards Albania, but were travelling back into Kosovo from
the border crossings at Cafta Prusit and Vrbnica.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs claim the first convoy to be hit was a procession of
1,000 people and 100 vehicles _ tractors and private cars _ struck
by three bombs as it passed the village of Maja, close to
Djakovica. They say 64 people were killed and another 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, they say NATO aircraft struck a second convoy, this
one a line of 600 people travelling on the same road but in the
village of Zrze, 15 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   While this may have been the second of NATO's targets, Belgrade
insists there were no military vehicles, just refugees' tractors
and trailers. They said another 44 people were killed at Zrze and
dozens more injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This was) a horrendous massacre'' claimed the Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic. ``This cannot be explained as an error
when the columns of refugees were bombed four times _ this was done
deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a massacre of Albanian refugees who were returning to
their homes in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   What can we know for sure? We know that innocent refugees were
killed on Wednesday by bombs dropped from NATO planes. We know that
they were desperate, exhausted people who had probably been on the
move for weeks, their only possessions the little they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   We can presume that they were not deliberately targeted by NATO
_ the political fallout from this ``accident'' will be bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   We must question Pentagon and NATO suggestions that Yugoslav MiG
fighters attacked the columns. Experts point out that NATO would
have spotted and shot down any Serb planes.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the refugees themselves would not have been able to
identify whether they were Serb or NATO planes. They simply talk of
being attacked from the air, of the ground exploding in front of
them, and of shattered bodies and twisted machinery.
</P>
<P>
   They talk of a horror that has become ingrained on their
memories. &QL;

PATIENTS STILL HOLD ON TO HOPE FOR A CURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Barbara Brogna, a 44-year-old banker with breast
cancer, had a bone marrow transplant two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When it didn't work, she was devastated. But she'd have another
if she had to, she says, her cheeks rosy and her face alight
despite ongoing chemotherapy: ``I am determined I will live with
this disease, not die from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Foster, a 57-year old dental receptionist, was in the
same clincal study as Brogna, but was randomly assigned to two
years of chemotherapy instead of a transplant. She's in remission:
``I go to bed praying and wake up praying.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brogan and Foster chatted the other day, Diane Zaniboni, 38,
listened, her eyes glued to their faces. She hasn't had to make a
decision yet about a transplant, but she may. ``There is a part of
me,'' she says, ``that will do whatever it takes to survive so I
can live to see my 8-year old daughter grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogna, Foster and Zaniboni are but three of the thousands of
women every year who agonize over whether to have a bone marrow
transplant for spreading breast cancer. Since the mid-1980s, in
fact, 12,000 breast cancer patients have had the transplants,
despite a dearth of evidence that the procedures would help.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the agony of their dilemma was intensified with
publication of five new studies that, overall, showed no clear
benefit of the transplants. The results were posted on the net
(www.asco.org) by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
</P>
<P>
   In a bone marrow transplant, and a similar procedure called stem
cell transplant, patients are given near-lethal doses of
chemotherapy and radiation and then ``rescued'' by reinfusion of
their own immune cells taken from the blood or bone marrow. The
treatment not only causes symptoms like severe nausea and diarrhea
but puts the patient at considerable risk of infection until the
bone marrow regenerates.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that high blast of cancer-killing therapy should be
more effective than lower dose therapy. But in four of the five new
studies, ``investigators found no statistically significant
difference in survival between patients receiving'' high dose
chemotherapy/bone marrow transplants ``and those receiving
lower-dose chemotherapy without transplants,'' said the National
Cancer Institute in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth study, from South Africa, there was a significant
difference in favor of transplanation. But overall, these
relatively-short term studies show that the higher-dose treatment
is not clearly superior to lower-dose therapy.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the decision to have a transplant becomes a
``very personal one for each woman to make,'' says Zaniboni, a
lawyer and legal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, while taking a shower, she found a ``humongous'' lump in
her breast. After surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, she's in
remission. If she needs a transplant, she'll go for it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's chilling to realize the transplants may not, as so many
women and their doctors had hoped, be the last, best hope _ and to
listen to other women for whom it hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lurking in the back of my mind is the experience of a close
friend of mine who underwent a stem cell transplant last April,''
she says. ``It was unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   But knowing of _ or even having had _ an unsuccessful transplant
should not be an automatic deterrent, says Brogna.
</P>
<P>
   When Brogna was diagnosed in 1993, her prognosis looked good.
She had six months of chemotherapy and was fine until 1996, when
she discovered the cancer had spread to her bones. She had six more
months of chemotherapy. Even so, the cancer spread to her liver.
</P>
<P>
   When her oncologist, Dr. John Erban, chief of hematology and
oncology at NEMC, where all three were treated, suggested that
Brogna join a study there comparing bone marrow transplants to two
years of chemotherapy, she was scared that she'd be randomized to a
transplant and die from it.
</P>
<P>
   Many other women in similar straits feared just the opposite _
that if they joined a randomized study, they might not get a
transplant. In fact, it's because of this fear that dissuaded so
many women from joining studies that it has taken years to get
much-needed data on the efficacy, or lack of it, for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But Erban eased Brogna's fears and she joined, figuring it was
her ``only hope for a cure.'' She sailed through the transplant in
1996. But six months later, the cancer was still in her liver and
bones and she's been on chemotherapy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is upbeat. ``I would recommend a transplant because I
know two other women for whom it left them cancer free. I'm
determined that we are going to beat this. The next two years in
breast cancer treatment are going to be pretty exciting and
encouraging. I look forward to that.''

STATESIDE GIS SAY THEY'RE READY FOR THE REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LAWTON, Okla. _ They have played the war games, pretended they
were hunkered down in the darkness of Kosovo. They've fired
missiles at Serb soldiers, although both the missiles and the
soldiers were pretend, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when they joined the US Army straight out of high school
three years ago, the three young soldiers never expected this: real
war, real blood, and the real possibility that they would be
shipped overseas to fight for reasons they can't quite comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trained to fight, but we're just kids,'' said Spec.
Miguel Angel Nieves, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Added his breakfast companion, Spec. Ronald Fayson, 23, ``I
wasn't thinking about war when I signed up. It was just something
to improve myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said they are ready and willing to do the job they
are paid $1,209 a month to do, even if that's too little money for
extras, even if their equally young wives are already afraid.
Mostly, they want to see the job done right, done fast, and they
say that means sending in ground troops made up of novice soldiers
such as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their unit at Fort Sill, located on the outskirts of this flat,
wind-swept city in southwestern Oklahoma, has been told to be
ready, although others are expected to go first. For now, though,
the military build-up in the Balkans has consisted only of Air
Force aircraft and personnel, including a recent deployment from
the base in nearby Altus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very articulate man,'' said Nieves, originally from
Panama and married five years now. ``But we either go over and kick
their (expletive) or we should stay the hell out. We go in, we go
in all the way, you see what I'm saying. You can't go in halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three, who met in Lawton 3 1/2 years ago after basic
training, is itching to go, although Spec. Philip Morgan said he
does feel the tug when he sees the destruction on TV. They see the
war in human terms, from the ethnic Albanian refugees streaming out
of Kosovo to the friends they hear are being sent over from the US
base in Germany. The politics _ who's killing who and why _ is
harder to grasp, especially in a city of 100,000 where
international news is scarce for those who can't afford the cable
TV bill.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves, the talker of the trio, walked the table through the
history of the conflict as he understands it. He knows it goes back
500 years. He knows the people in some Yugoslavian provinces abhor
the people in others. But what he knows best _ and what he fears
most _ is what he has heard is a system of Serbian underground
bunkers where entire armies can hide out. Serbia is well-bunkered,
but with little to do but wait, the mythology has grown among the
young men and women walking around Lawton in green Army fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter your opinion is how we look at it,'' said
Morgan, 21, and from California, ``You could totally disagree with
it, and nobody wants to kill anyone and definitely nobody wants to
be killed, but if you're told to go, you go. You do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nieves, whose father served in Vietnam, ``We still believe
in our country and freedom for all. . .What my wife thinks, though,
is that it's not our business, it's not our problem. We're giving
up American lives and the European community doesn't give a damn
when it's in their own backyard. At least that's the way she sees
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Fayson, whose family is in Florida, ``It's always
America. NATO. We need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   If the friends are sent to Kosovo from Fort Sill, where about
20,000 soldiers are stationed, each will have a job distinct from
the others. Fort Sill is the field artillery center, and Morgan
works with the multi-launch rocket system, or MLRS, that the base
is know for worldwide. Fayson, a personnel clerk, expects to work
the radios. Nieves is a chaplain's assistant, and his primary job
would be to guard the chaplain, forbidden under the Geneva
Convention from carrying a weapon himself for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job would be to improve morale, however you do that in a
war,'' Nieves said. ``I'd be there to comfort the dead and the
dying. But my main job would be to be the chaplain's bullet-proof
vest.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, an elderly woman stopped by the table, laden with
eggs and pancakes, sausage and grits, to wish ``our boys'' well.
They listened politely, nodding throughout, as she blasted
President Clinton, blasted Congress, for putting a single US
soldier in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton or Congress had to go, if the jokers who declare
war have to go, we'd never have one, I tell you,'' she said,
declining to introduce herself by name after mentioning that her
husband served in both World War II and Korea. ``They're just
leading our boys to the slaughter. We've got a bunch of jokers who
never served and don't know nothing about running a war.''
</P>
<P>
   At another table at the International House of Pancakes, packed
with soldiers allowed to leave their stations after the wind
knocked out some power lines, three artillery officers were more
stoic about the situation. Older, in the Army longer, and able to
explain Balkan politics with ease, they said they don't bother to
worry about what they can't control. None has heard a frightened
word from a solder under his command either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go in every day and don't think about it,'' said one,
a captain from New Jersey who declined to be identified by name
without official Army clearance. ``It's not our place to say one
way or the other whether it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another captain, ``What I'm thinking about is an
omelette.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger soldiers say they are trying to turn their thoughts
to other things, too. They try to keep their wives from worrying,
since, as Morgan put it, ``mine would be upset if she knew I was
probably going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision to send in ground troops is some time off,
if it comes at all _ leaving Nieves, Morgan and Fayson with a sense
of ambivalence that they know would evaporate the minute they
landed in a land that continues to confuse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been setting up real-world scenarios so we'll know what
we're in for, mapping it out, like we're in Kosovo,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Fayson, ``We've dug fighting positions, done gas attacks,
all of it. But it definitely can't compare with the real thing.''

AUTHOR TAKES ISSUE WITH END-OF-THE-WORLD THEOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace Halsell took chemicals to darken her skin to do research
for her book ``Soul Sister.'' She swam the Rio Grande to cross into
the United States in gathering inside knowledge for another
bestseller, ``The Illegals.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she has plunged herself into end-of-the-world biblical
prophecy in researching her latest book, ``Armageddon:
Understanding God's End Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the Armageddon mind-set very dangerous,'' said Halsell,
who was in Fort Worth to receive a media ethics award from Texas
Christian University's department of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell, a native of Lubbock who now resides in Washington,
D.C., lived in Fort Worth for a time and was the first female
police reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I left to write my way around the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She toured the British Isles on a bicycle, did free-lance
writing in Lima, Peru, where she visited the Incan ruins of Machu
Picchu, and wrote for newspapers in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Later, she
was a speech writer for President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest book, which is to be released this year, expresses
her fears about the end-times theology of many Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Exponents of Bible prophecy believe that a powerful and gifted
leader, known as the Antichrist, will lead a world coalition in the
battle of Armageddon. The Antichrist will be defeated as Christ
returns with the armies of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians, particularly those in more liberal mainline
churches, see Armageddon as merely a symbolic battle between good
and evil on Judgment Day. But many other believers see it as an
actual event that will take place in a valley near Megiddo in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Halsell's books, ``Prophecy and Politics: the Secret
Alliance Between Israel and the U.S. Christian Right,'' published
in 1989, also explores her concerns about Armageddon theology.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eve of the year 2000, she wanted to look again at
what it means to be a Christian, and why some Christians, such as
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, look toward a violent end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must we totally destroy this world in order to usher in a `new
heaven and a new earth?''' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell draws on experiences in 1983 and 1985, when she traveled
to Israel on tours led by Falwell. She encountered many on the trip
who are convinced the world will end in a bloody battle on the
plains of Megiddo.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon theology is preached by much-admired evangelists,
such as Billy Graham and Luis Palau. But as the year 2000
approaches, Halsell said she is alarmed by end-of-the-world
comments being made by many, particularly Falwell and Pat
Robertson, president of the Christian Broadcasting Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their sermons are filled with scary stuff,'' Halsell said.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell and Robertson are among those who believe that biblical
signs are in place _ such as the emergence of Israel as a nation,
widespread immorality, numerous earthquakes, floods and other
disasters _ to indicate that the end of the world as we know it is
near.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, Halsell explains many end-times theories, such
as ``the Rapture,'' a belief that true Christians will be caught up
into heaven by Jesus before the final tribulation, which includes
the Battle of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel a need for certitude, and they like the idea of
being saved from all this tribulation by the `Rapture,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell bases her views solely on her own research and
experiences as a professing Christian and not on any credentials as
a biblical scholar. She argues that those who preach Armageddon
theology replace Christ's teachings about universal love with a God
of war.
</P>
<P>
   They portray Jesus ``as a five-star general, astride a horse,
leading all the armies of the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to usher in ``a new heaven and a new earth,'' she
said, is to focus on revolutionary philosophies taught by Jesus,
such as loving one's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell also finds it paradoxical that many Christian leaders,
such as Falwell and Robertson, are so cheerful even though they
preach that a terrible Battle of Armageddon is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is coming to an end and they are still smiling,''
she said.

TAKE STARR'S ADVICE: LET THIS LAW DIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Ken Starr and the multitudes who love to hate
him were bound to agree on something. Here it is: Starr and many of
his most vociferous detractors have concluded _ without mutual
consultation, we might assume _ that the federal law authorizing
appointment of independent counsels needs to be retired.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Starr, the man who made ``independent counsel'' a
household term, believes that the era of independent counsels has
run its course.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? It's entirely possible that Starr's wish will
soon be reality. The independent counsel statute is scheduled to
expire June 30 _ and it will expire unless Congress decides to
renew it, revamp it or replace it with some new legislative
concoction that is guaranteed to create more havoc than it combats.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Wednesday before the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, Starr said that the independent counsel law promises
more than it delivers and ``more than it can deliver under our
constitutional system.''
</P>
<P>
   The law ``tries to cram a fourth branch of government into our
three-branch system,'' Starr said, ``but invariably this new entity
lacks ... the constitutional means to resist encroachments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is structurally unsound, constitutionally dubious
and, in overstating the degree of institutional independence,
disingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a mouthful. But even the nonlawyers out here in the
hinterlands get the drift: The independent counsel law is a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The law was universally applauded when it was conceived way back
in the wake of Watergate to minimize politicization of the legal
process. But it is apparent to most objective observers that the
law has exacerbated _ perhaps even institutionalized _ the problem
it was supposed to alleviate.
</P>
<P>
   In today's political climate, Starr said, independent counsels
are vulnerable to partisan attack, and their investigations are
``likely to be seen as political.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If politicization and the loss of public confidence are
inevitable,'' he said, ``then we should leave the full
responsibility where our laws and traditions place it _ on the
attorney general, or her appointee as special counsel, and on
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's critics might differ with him when it comes to the
question of who's to blame for the politicization of the
independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's defenders are convinced that Starr's $45
million investigation of matters ranging from an Arkansas land deal
to an Oval Office romance was driven entirely by partisan politics
and Starr's obsessive quest to ``get'' the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, on the other hand, believes that Clinton and his
partisans set out to divert attention from the president's
wrongdoing by launching unfair and unjustified political attacks
against the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens who don't have much use for Clinton or Starr might say
that both sides discredited themselves with their crass
politicization of the investigation and related controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Which most certainly buttresses Starr's case against the
independent counsel law, if not his case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be any clearer that many Americans _ most Americans,
according to public-opinion polls _ tuned out Starr's investigation
of the presidential sex-and-lies scandal early in the process. The
reason is equally clear: Most people saw Starr's investigation and
the ensuing impeachment proceedings as a political process rather
than a weighty matter of legal and/or constitutional significance.
</P>
<P>
   If such an investigation is ``likely to be seen as political,''
as Starr said, then it is political. Perception in such matters is
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law seemed like a good idea, once upon a
time, when the nation had fresh memories of President Nixon firing
a special prosecutor in hopes of short-circuiting his investigation
of the Watergate scandal. But the law has outlived its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should take Starr's advice: Let this useless law fade
away.

COUNTING THE COST OF JOURNALISTIC INDEPENDENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slavko Curuvija died Sunday on the streets of Belgrade, a
casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullets that ended the 51-year-old's life weren't fired
by NATO forces, or from a Kalashnikov rifle carried in the hands of
a Kosovar rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija was gunned down because he was a journalist who dared
speak the truth about Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists in too many places around the globe are warriors in
the same battle that took Curuvija's life _ the struggle to provide
independent news reports about official corruption, repression and
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, we value the concept that the truth shall
set you free. In places like the Congo, Afghanistan and Colombia,
the truth can get you killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Curuvija was publisher of the Dnevni Telegraf, the
first private daily newspaper in Serbia. In a country where the
government controls the majority of the media _ state-run
newspapers and radio and TV stations _ stepping out as an
independent voice draws attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the old saying goes, the nail with its head sticking up is
the one that gets hit.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony at a December congressional committee hearing
in Washington, Curuvija told lawmakers that questioning Milosevic's
rule was tantamount to treason. Just days after a pro-government
newspaper accused Curuvija of supporting NATO bombing, the
publisher was fatally shot _ on a public street at 4:40 in the
afternoon _ outside of his Belgrade apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija's name will be among those that appear on the 1999 list
compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists to account how
press freedom is faring around the world. The sad reality is that
the prominent publisher will no doubt have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 1998 report, released last month, documented the
slayings of 24 journalists who were killed because of their work.
Another 12 journalists died under circumstances that the CPJ was
unable to confirm as being directly related to their work. And on
New Year's Eve 1998, 118 journalists were known to be imprisoned
for trying to disseminate information that the powers that be in
various nations found unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey _ a NATO ally that apparently doesn't embrace the same
democratic ideas about free speech as the United States does _ held
the largest number at 27. China and Ethiopia each held 12
journalists prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   CPJ's report included an accounting of the grisly statistics for
the past 10 years. From 1989 though 1998, 471 journalists were
confirmed killed in the line of duty. The most dangerous countries
for working journalists were Algeria, Colombia, Russia, Tajikistan,
Croatia, India, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, Rwanda, Peru and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not absent from the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the widely publicized 1976 murder of Arizona Republic
reporter Don Bolles, at least 11 other journalists have been
murdered in the United States because of their work,'' the report
said. ``In all but one case, the victims were immigrant journalists
working in languages other than English. Seven of those 11
homicides remain unsolved.''
</P>
<P>
   American journalists become those immigrant reporters when
working in foreign countries. Philip True, the Mexico City
correspondent for the San Antonio Express-News, was found dead in

on the courage that it takes to air such unpopular opinions. Yeah,
right.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take courage for an opinion writer to speak out in a
country that values a free press right up there with freedom to
worship as one pleases. It doesn't take courage when the law of the
land guarantees one's right to speak the truth _ or even to speak
just shades of the truth.
</P>
<P>
   True courage can be found in the pages of the CPJ report, where
men and women risked harassment, imprisonment, torture and death in
the effort to bring unfettered and unadulterated information to the
people.

COUNTING THE COST OF JOURNALISTIC INDEPENDENCE

<P>
   Slavko Curuvija died Sunday on the streets of Belgrade, a
casualty of war.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullets that ended the 51-year-old's life weren't fired
by NATO forces, or from a Kalashnikov rifle carried in the hands of
a Kosovar rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija was gunned down because he was a journalist who dared
speak the truth about Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists in too many places around the globe are warriors in
the same battle that took Curuvija's life _ the struggle to provide
independent news reports about official corruption, repression and
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, we value the concept that the truth shall
set you free. In places like the Congo, Afghanistan and Colombia,
the truth can get you killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Curuvija was publisher of the Dnevni Telegraf, the
first private daily newspaper in Serbia. In a country where the
government controls the majority of the media _ state-run
newspapers and radio and TV stations _ stepping out as an
independent voice draws attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the old saying goes, the nail with its head sticking up is
the one that gets hit.
</P>
<P>
   During testimony at a December congressional committee hearing
in Washington, Curuvija told lawmakers that questioning Milosevic's
rule was tantamount to treason. Just days after a pro-government
newspaper accused Curuvija of supporting NATO bombing, the
publisher was fatally shot _ on a public street at 4:40 in the
afternoon _ outside of his Belgrade apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija's name will be among those that appear on the 1999 list
compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists to account how
press freedom is faring around the world. The sad reality is that
the prominent publisher will no doubt have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 1998 report, released last month, documented the
slayings of 24 journalists who were killed because of their work.
Another 12 journalists died under circumstances that the CPJ was
unable to confirm as being directly related to their work. And on
New Year's Eve 1998, 118 journalists were known to be imprisoned
for trying to disseminate information that the powers that be in
various nations found unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey _ a NATO ally that apparently doesn't embrace the same
democratic ideas about free speech as the United States does _ held
the largest number at 27. China and Ethiopia each held 12
journalists prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   CPJ's report included an accounting of the grisly statistics for
the past 10 years. From 1989 though 1998, 471 journalists were
confirmed killed in the line of duty. The most dangerous countries
for working journalists were Algeria, Colombia, Russia, Tajikistan,
Croatia, India, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, Rwanda, Peru and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not absent from the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the widely publicized 1976 murder of Arizona Republic

CELINE DION IS NO ORDINARY DIVA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Celine Dion wouldn't have to do much to keep an
audience entertained. She has a substantial repertoire of appealing
love songs, and her big-screen connection with a certain sunken
ship has made her one of the best-selling female artists of all
time. One sigh, one sultry look, one clenched fist in the air would
be enough to satisfy fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Dion is no ordinary diva. For almost two hours Sunday night
at Compaq Center, the irrepressible entertainer talked, joked and
danced amid the music. ``I love to sing, but I love to talk, too,
man,'' Dion said to the sold-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dion laced the show with funny anecdotes and conversational
chatter, and it often seemed more like she was shooting the breeze
with friends than commanding a stage in front of ecstatic fans. She
would scrunch her face up when introducing a song with a corny
joke, and she would point to faces in the crowd when stressing a
point. It all came across as accessible and charming.
</P>
<P>
   Dion connects just as skillfully with the often dramatic nature
of her music. Dressed in an elegant gray gown, she rose from the
bottom of a heart-shaped stage to sing ``Let's Talk About Love,''
the title track off her latest album. Halfway through the song,
Dion was joined onstage by members of the Houston Children's
Chorus, who formed a circle around the singer as she led them
through the words.
</P>
<P>
   Things kicked into high gear with ``Declaration of Love,'' an
uplifting number that was a cue for Dion to remove a skirt covering
a pair of glittering pants and begin to shimmy around the stage.
The in-the-round setting proved perfect for Dion's infectious
energy, and she played to every side of the arena throughout the
evening's fast-paced numbers. The reggae-tinged ``Treat Her Like a
Lady'' found her trading slick moves and high-fives with a pair of
energetic backup singers.
</P>
<P>
   Between songs, a number of fans rushed the stage with gifts
ranging from flowers and teddy bears to golf balls, which Dion
seemed to especially enjoy. (She said she picked up golf during a
trip to Hawaii.)
</P>
<P>
   Dion was also showered with get-well cards and wishes for her
husband and manager, Rene Angelil, who was recently diagnosed with
a form of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rene's doing fine,'' Dion said. ``Your support means
everything to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dwelling on her personal troubles, however, she
channeled her passion into her songs. She earned a standing ovation
for a show-stopping rendition of ``The Power of Love,'' and her
delivery was exquisite on ``S'il Suffisait D'Aimer, (If Only Love
Could Be Enough),'' the restrained title track off her latest
French album.
</P>
<P>
   Dion showed her real strength during ``The Reason,'' a swelling
power ballad; ``It's All Coming Back to Me Now,'' an epic tale of
lost love; and ``To Love You More,'' a lush, romantic moment. They
proved a potent trio of flawless pop drama and moved a number of
fans to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Dion is not afraid to follow her music gloriously over the top.
Often, she would stand center stage, close her eyes and thrust her
head back furiously, inciting screams and cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The show's extravagant trappings were pared down during a
section of the show dedicated to Dion's favorite songs by other
artists, including Eric Clapton, the Beatles and Frank Sinatra. The
best was a hushed, nuanced version of Roberta Flack's ``The First
Time Ever I Saw Your Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion shared vocals with Barbra Streisand _ via video _ for the
diva-duet ``Tell Him.'' She employed similar tactics for
Immortality, a collaboration with the Bee Gees, after heating
things up during a disco segment that found her in a white suit
boogieing under a glitterball to ``Stayin' Alive'' and ``You Should
Be Dancin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Every element was in place when Dion's Titanic love theme, ``My
Heart Will Go On,'' docked onstage during the evening's only
encore. Dion stood onstage in a flowing red dress as a replica of
the ship's rail appeared and movie scenes flashed on the video
screen. The music swelled, the lights flashed, and Dion raced to
the edge of the rail, just in time to hit her high note. It
probably shouldn't have worked, but Dion made it seem completely
spontaneous and genuinely exciting.

DC TALK ROOTED IN FAITH, FRIENDS 

</HEADLINE>
 TALK-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ dc Talk is all about making good God music.
</P>
<P>
   The talented trio _ Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait and Kevin Max _
is ensconced in the Top 10 on Billboard's contemporary Christian
music chart with its edgy, alternative rock album,
``Supernatural,'' which has sold more than 500,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   The group broke into the Christian youth scene 10 years ago with
rap and hip-hop appeal mixed with good looks and slick shows that
attracted more than religious kids. They have won shelf-loads of
Dove Awards, three Grammys and have had two platinum albums and one
gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernatural'' dropped a few jaws when it debuted at No. 4 in
the Billboard Top 200 hits last year, a sure sign of crossover
appeal. dc Talk is also distributed by Virgin, a major player in
the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``dc Talk has always wanted to make music for the masses,''
McKeehan said in a phone interview. ``We never wanted to restrict
ourselves to making music just for people who believe the way we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the songs on `Supernatural' are about human
relationships, about the things we are going through with other
people,'' McKeehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Killing Me,'' for example, is about breaking away from a
self-destructive friend while ``Wanna Be Loved'' is exactly that _
seeking love and meaning in life.
</P>
<P>
   While the trio, who composed the album, wants mass appeal, they
don't want it at the cost of their spiritual messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are three guys pursuing our faith,'' McKeehan said. ``We
want to cause people to think about spiritual things.''
</P>
<P>
   Their faith is not just hype. The group has a ``road pastor''
who tends to their spiritual life on tour and at their Nashville
home base. They spend an hour prior to performances reflecting and
sharing thoughts and experiences based on Bible readings.
</P>
<P>
   A top Christian group faces the same temptations that any pop
group faces, including greed, sex, drugs and other snares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just standing in the spotlight all the time, you get used to
people serving and working for you,'' he said. ``It is important
that we remain servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio holds one another accountable spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one guy forgets his roots, the other guy is there to
remind him of it,'' McKeehan said. Spiritual principles and
friendship is what makes dc Talk go. ``We didn't come together
based on some recording company's marketing scheme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three met in the mid-1980s at Liberty University, founded by
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, in Virginia. ``We met just hanging around
and became friends,'' McKeehan said. The three played in different
bands before deciding to blend their talents. Although McKeehan and
Tait are from the Washington, D.C., area, the ``dc'' in their name
stands for ``Decent Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   They began to compose the popular beats and lyrical verses that
first appealed to teen-agers. But dc Talk grew along with their
audience and now can attract not only youth but their parents. They
appeal to sacred-minded listeners and secular audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of their tracks get some play on alternative rock
stations,'' said Doug Hannah, program director for KSBJ, a
Christian FM station with a contemporary adult format. ``Their
(1995 `Jesus Freak') album had a few tracks we were able to play on
our station, and we are very adult in our music mix focus.''
</P>
<P>
   While the group has moved beyond the rap and hip-hop that put
them on the Christian music map, McKeehan said, dc Talk has not
forgotten its roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still a lover of hip-hop,'' McKeehan said. ``I still
start most songs with a `loop' when I produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tour also features a DJ who plays a mix of the rap
and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   McKeehan is surprised that the fans have stayed loyal to the
group even though they have moved to contemporary rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think that people have stuck with us, it is amazing to
me,'' he said. ``They have been loyal not to Toby, Michael and
Kevin, but to what we are about _ our faith in God and to the fact
that we are honest about our struggles with faith in God.''

raid on Japan on April 18, 1942. This will be their 57th reunion. A
media availability is scheduled for Friday at the Doolittle
Raiders' B-25 exhibit in the museum. Today (Saturday) they will
hold a memorial service at the museum that will be open to the
public and will include a a flyover by the restored B-25 ``Old
Glory.'' Press release will be in tickler. (Ali, Dayton Daily

   URBAN-WARGAMES _ The black helicopters, and the
specially-trained U.S. Army troops they dropped across South Texas
for 10 days in February, are gone now. In their wake, they left a
trail of tales that will be told, retold, and embellished for years
_ the soldiers rappeling into cities, the explosions, the
accidental fire, the satchel full of cash to pay for damages. And
they ignited a new round of buzz among those who consider the
helicopters symbols of government oppression or a coming one-world
order. The training exercises by the Army's Special Operations
Command, dubbed Operation Last Dance, were the latest in a 10-year
effort to give America's elite troops real-world experience in
different urban environments. And in town after town, local leaders
remain divided over whether they would invite the soldiers back for
an encore. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman).

   POWERPOINT-IDEAS (Undated) _ ``Good Morning. The title of
today's presentation is: `The Effect of Presentation Software on
Rhetorical Thinking,' or `Is Microsoft Powerpoint Taking Over Our
Minds?' I will begin by making a joke. Then I will take you through
each of my points in a linear fashion. Then I will sum up again at
the end. Unfortunately, due to the unique format of this particular
presentation, we will not be able to entertain questions.'' Many
people believe that the ubiquity of prepackaged computer software,
which helps users prepare such presentations, has not only taken
much of the life out of public speaking by homogenizing it at a low
level, but has led to a kind of ersatz thought that is devoid of
original ideas. By Laurence Zuckerman. (1800 words)

   LA-INTELLECTUALS (Los Angeles) _ Intellectual life in Los
Angeles may sound like an oxymoron. After all, the notion that Los
Angeles has no brain is about as old as the city itself. Yet with
the city's public and private universities, a slate of Nobel Prize
winners, some of the country's most creative artistic talent, a
reservoir of scientific expertise at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and the California Institute of Technology, these stereotypes were
always more alive in the imagination, particularly on the East
Coast, than in real life. Writers and scholars are now saying that
a new influx of institutions and art museums has helped make
intellectual life more vital than in any other period in this
city's history. By David Hay. (1400 words)

SIZING UP PALM V, AERO 2100 PALMTOPS &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   (Undated) Folks who like to use handheld computers _ a k a
palmtops or personal digital assistants _ are downright religious
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can the devices help simplify and organize a hectic
life, but a user looks so darned cool when whipping one out.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the ugly truth about palmtops _ most of them end up
occupying space in sock drawers. While a lot of tech-savvy types
like the idea of organizing their contacts, appointments, notes and
even e-mail in a machine you can fit in a jacket pocket, usually
they are more trouble than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed leader of this genre is Palm Computing's line of
Palm organizers, which has won the passion of handheld users in a
way that was once the purview of the now-defunct Apple Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm line is being challenged by a slew of devices that use
Microsoft's Windows CE operating system. But Palm is standing firm,
with well over 70 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the latest, thinnest Palm organizer, and a
colorful challenger from Houston's Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   __ Palm V _ $449, 3Com/Palm Computing. The emphasis with Palm's
devices has always been on simplicity. From the earliest model, the
Palm Pilot, up to this slick, sleek entry, the focus has been on
making its use easy and intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Palm V, it's stylish, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V is about half the thickness of the Palm IIIx, an
updated version of the Palm III, the company's mainstream product.
It's encased in a brushed metal case and sports a super-clear new
display with a higher resolution than past models.
</P>
<P>
   There are many nifty touches to its design, which is aimed at
style-conscious executives who are willing to pay for a digital
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are grooves on the left and right edges of
the Palm V. You can place a stylus in one groove, and the spine of
a leather cover in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are interchangeable, the Palm V can be configured
for either right- or left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are used to using Palm devices will be most struck by
the display, which is a dramatic improvement. Text and graphics are
crisper in plain light.
</P>
<P>
   But the handheld's backlight _ which renders everything a fuzzy
green _ still leaves a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V has 2 megabytes of memory, which sounds small but can
hold a lot _ 3,000 appointments, 6,000 addresses or 200 e-mail
messages. An optional 2-MB upgrade can boost the Palm V up to the 4
MB level of the Palm IIIx.
</P>
<P>
   One handy option is a modem designed just for the Palm V that
snaps onto the back of it. It makes the Palm V about the same size
as the Palm III series, and enables you to get your e-mail
wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   There is excellent software that lets you enter information via
your PC, then synchronize it to the Palm device. A new feature that
comes with the software for the Palm V provides a direct
connection, or ``conduit,'' to Microsoft's Outlook contact manager.
</P>
<P>
   There are two big drawbacks to the Palm V. First is its reliance
on handwriting recognition. Palm uses a program called Graffitti,
first found on the Newton, that requires users to learn a
simplified set of letters.
</P>
<P>
   Although it improves handwriting recognition in general, it
still will frustrate those whose handwriting is less than
letter-perfect _ like mine.
</P>
<P>
   An onscreen keyboard is available, but it also can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Aero 2100 _ $449 and up, Compaq Computer Corp. The Aero
resurrects the name of a subnotebook computer that Compaq peddled
in the 486 processor era.
</P>
<P>
   Beset with problems, the original Aero died a deserved death
when the Pentium processor began migrating into notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 uses the Windows CE operating system, which uses a
stripped-down version of the Windows 95/98 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero also has an interesting active-matrix color screen,
which sets it apart from most other Windows CE color handhelds,
which use less-clear passive-matrix displays. The screen is
viewable even outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 is a bulky thing, certainly larger than the Palm V
and even bigger than the older Palm III design. It felt comfortable
in my hand, which is relatively large, but probably would feel
oversized in smaller paws.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its size into account, the Aero's designers have added a
rocker switch on its side that lets you scroll through lists by
moving it up or down. This makes it easy to get through data using
just one hand, such as when you're talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   There are several models, with either 8 or 16 MB of memory, and
it can hold up to 24 MB.
</P>
<P>
   It also has many more bells and whistles than the Palm line _
and you can take that literally. It comes with a built-in voice
recorder for making quick audio notes, and can work with audio
files downloaded from the Audible.com Web site at www.audible.com.
</P>
<P>
   The color, audio and other nifty features account for the
weight. And they also extract a price in battery life.
</P>
<P>
   While the Palm V can last for more than a week on a charge, the
Aero will give you about 10 hours of service.

PROGRAMS PROVIDE LOTS OF OPTIONS TO CREATE YOUR OWN SCREEN SAVERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like to know how to create screen savers that change
as the day goes on _ maybe at regular intervals. I am a teacher and
thought the kids would think it was cool if their pictures came up
as screen savers. I have multiple students using the same computer
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are quite a few shareware programs that will let you do
this, and you can find many of them at the Winfiles.com site. Look
at this specific page: www.winfiles.com/apps/98/savers-tools.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is a slick little commercial program called
Create Screen Savers Quick &AMP; Easy, from Individual Software. This
$20 program lets you create slide-show style screen savers with
some interesting effects. Just drag and drop the images you want
into place, tell the program how you want them to be displayed and
presto! It generates a Windows .SCR screen-saver file. And, it
works on Windows 3.1 systems, as well as Windows 95/98.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm having a very strange problem with the fonts in some of
my programs. Some of the words in various windows are overlapping
each other, they've been put down on top of the other words. In
America Online, I can only see the first few sentences in
paragraphs on some of its opening screens. Some of the title bars
on top of the windows have strange characters where letters should
be. I've fiddled with settings until I'm blue in the face. What's
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. Windows 95/98 likes to fool you into thinking you've got more
choices for system font sizes than you really do. When you take the
bait, problems such as this can occur.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you have decided to go with a custom font size for
your system fonts. These are the typefaces Windows uses for basic
text display, such as the names under icons or for the titles of
windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite your having the ability to change the font
sizes, doing so is not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   To fix this, right-click on the Windows desktop, choose
Properties, then Settings. Click the Advanced tab. You'll see a
dialog box that includes an item called Font Sizes. I suspect it's
set at ``Other,'' which means you've got a custom font size.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, some programs don't know what to do with a
custom font size. They want one of the two generic options _ Large
or Small. Change the setting to one of those, and your problem
should go away.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Right now I am using a Voodoo2 card (a Diamond Monster II)
for playing games. I've been reading about the Voodoo3 that's
coming out that is just one card _ you don't need an add-on. But I
also have been reading about new 3-D graphics chips from ATI
Technologies, Matrox and nVidia. Is it worth upgrading?
</P>
<P>
   A. The next few months are going to be a 3-D gamers' dream. Or,
if you're an indecisive 3-D gamer, it might be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Next-generation 3-D cards are already starting to appear,
ranging from the 3dfx Voodoo3, to cards built around nVidia's
UltraTNT2 chips, to ATI's new line of Rage 128 cards, to Matrox's
G400, to S3's Savage 4 ... and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   All these cards are very fast, can utilize the slick graphics
available through either OpenGL or Microsoft's DirectX, and will be
reasonably priced, coming in well under $200.
</P>
<P>
   Each has its own benefits and shortcomings. For example, the
Voodoo3 is wickedly fast, but it can only display colors in 16 bits
in 3-D mode _ most of the other next-generation cards can use
32-bit color.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to wait until the full crop is out, probably
around fall, and then start reading reviews and scanning Internet
discussion forums to see how things are shaking out. Personally, I
think you should pay particular attention to the Voodoo3 and the
nVidia cards _ early reports on both look very good.

GOVERNOR UNDER FIRE FOR SEEKING MIDDLE GROUND ON IMMIGRATION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California Gov. Gray Davis' decision to ask a
federal appeals court to mediate the legal battle over Proposition
187, the voter-approved initiative limiting benefits to illegal
immigrants, has met with skepticism from all sides, casting doubt
on whether a settlement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Neither opponents nor proponents of the measure saw any room for
compromise, while Hispanic and immigrant groups, who had pressed
Davis to let the issue die, expressed outrage at Thursday's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis opposes the initiative, approved by 59 percent of
voters in 1994 and strongly backed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, he
said he had no authority to decide on its constitutionality nor
could he go against the will of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the provisions of the disputed law, which include
denying education and health care to illegal immigrants and their
children, have been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, could have sought to appeal that decision or
drop the issue. Instead, he took the middle road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's both the wormiest and the most brilliant thing he
could've done at the same time,'' said Gregory Rodriguez, research
scholar at Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Los Angeles
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize it's really politically tricky for him. But there's
nothing that doesn't say a very popularly elected governor could
not persuade the California electorate of the wrongness of this
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said going to the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals' mediation panel was a way to build consensus and
avoid costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has always believed that reasonable people should
sit down at a table and find a way to resolve conflicts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the parties involved saw no possibility of finding any
middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see where there's any area for compromise,'' said John
Findley, a lawyer for the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento,
which is representing Proposition 187's sponsor. ``Either the
initiative is constitutional or it's not. It's an all-or-nothing
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Saenz, regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Education Fund, the group leading the effort to strike
down the initiative, said he saw no reason to make any concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are negotiating from a complete position of strength,'' he
said. ``If we were to continue with this appeal, despite the
tremendous cost in time and money, we would prevail. I'm not
prepared to offer up anything at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Saenz added that he would not negotiate with the Pacific Legal
Foundation since the 9th Circuit has ruled it has no legal standing
to intervene in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to sit in any mediation with any party who is
not a part of the case,'' he said. ``If the governor wants to
consult with anybody, he's free to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said participation from the Pacific Legal Foundation
was necessary to reach any settlement. He hoped it would take no
more than four months to complete negotiations.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 187 has become one of the most significant issues of
Davis' administration as he tries to balance the views of the
growing Hispanic electorate with those of the conservative
Democrats and independent voters who supported him.
</P>
<P>
   Anamaria Loya, executive director of La Raza Centro Legale, a
San Francisco public interest law firm, said, ``It's completely
backtracking and denigrates the values of a community to say that
we're willing to negotiate away their human rights. I think he's
going to hear from Latino voters in the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was she persuaded by Davis' desire to respect the will of
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is immoral,'' she said. ``To me, it does not matter
that it's anyone's will. At some point, Jim Crow laws and slavery
were the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Wang of Chinese for Affirmative Action in San Francisco also
was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity for Governor Davis to show that he's
different from Pete Wilson,'' Wang said, referring to the
Republican governor who preceded Davis. Instead, ``he's just
exacerbating the racial tensions and some of the anti-immigrant
bashing that occurred under the Wilson administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark Kelso, a professor at the University of Pacific's
McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said he saw some possibility
of a compromise since Proposition 187 has so many provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's an all or nothing,'' he said.

JUDGE EXPANDS BUFFERS TO PROTECT ABORTION CLINICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Days before one of the largest national
anti-abortion protests of the year, a federal judge ruled that the
buffer zones around reproductive services clinics in western New
York should be expanded, holding back demonstrators by up to 60
feet.
</P>
<P>
   A top national anti-abortion advocate said the ruling, a major
victory for groups that favor abortion rights, was a ``ludicrous,
Draconian decision'' and an assault on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the weeklong ``Operation Save America''
demonstration that begins Sunday in Buffalo and Rochester, Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer recently filed an injunction to expand the
15-foot no-protest zones around 13 area clinics. On Thursday, U.S.
District Court Judge Richard J. Arcara granted the request, which
requires federal marshals to be posted at clinics during protests
and allows for up to four escorts to help patients enter and exit
the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of abortion rights ``have shown by a preponderance of
the evidence that they will suffer irreparable harm if injunctive
relief is not immediately granted,'' Arcara wrote in the 18-page
decision. ``Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit
defendants and those acting in concert with them from exercising
their legitimate rights under the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court case stacked up Spitzer and five abortion-rights
groups against dozens of religious organizations and abortion
opponents. Protest organizers have said they expect 60,000 people
at the weeklong event, held six months after the fatal shooting of
abortion docto Barnett Slepian at his Buffalo-area home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention in seeking this action is to ensure that law and
order is maintained during the ... protests,'' Spitzer said
Thursday. ``We have been working with the law enforcement community
to enforce the law and ensure public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But abortion opponents said the ruling violates their rights to
free speech by not allowing them to talk, or give information, to
clinic patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is blocking the access of women seeking reproductive health
information that might enable them to choose life,'' the Rev.
Philip L. ``Flip'' Benham said of Spitzer. Benham is the national
director of the Dallas-based Operation Rescue National, which is
organizing the New York demonstrations. ``The only ones who can
give information to women now are on the pro-abortion side. This is
a ludicrous, Draconian decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would try to diffuse any violence growing out of the
demonstrations, Benham said: ``There's violence there every day _
they kill children.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights groups also are planning to attend the
demonstrations in order to lend support to clinics, their staff and
patients, said Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New York
chapter of the National Abortion Rights and Reproductive League.
She also called Thursday for the state's passage of a clinic-access
law, which would increase penalties against people who intimidate,
harass or hurt those seeking or administering reproductive
services.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki and the state Assembly support such
legislation, which needs Senate approval to become law.

   LA-INTELLECTUALS (Los Angeles) _ Intellectual life in Los
Angeles may sound like an oxymoron. After all, the notion that Los

the city's public and private universities, a slate of Nobel Prize
winners, some of the country's most creative artistic talent, a
reservoir of scientific expertise at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and the California Institute of Technology, these stereotypes were
always more alive in the imagination, particularly on the East
Coast, than in real life. Writers and scholars are now saying that
a new influx of institutions and art museums has helped make
intellectual life more vital than in any other period in this

EVERY GOOD MARIGOLD DESERVES FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., April 18)  
(jt) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adjectivally speaking, the most coveted garden flowers tend to
be choice, delicate, exquisite or elegant, and preferably also
fragrant. Roses, in other words, or lilies or lilacs or masses of
sky-blue flax on gracefully nodding stems, but definitely not
marigolds.
</P>
<P>
   Not many would describe the fat, heavy flower of a marigold,
jammed so full of petals that it looks more like a Koosh ball than
a blossom, as delicate or elegant. Odoriferous comes to mind, but
not fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are other attributes worth considering in a garden
flower. Colorful, easy, reliable and pest-free are not bad
adjectives, and if the marigold is more often thought of as common
than as choice, those qualities may explain why.
</P>
<P>
   There is much good to say about a flower with a sunny
disposition and a desire to please. In August, when most perennials
are in their summer sulk and the annual flower garden looks a bit
ratty, marigolds can be counted on to look presentable. The season
is long, and fidelity in a flower is as praiseworthy as
flamboyance.
</P>
<P>
   They don't look any different than they did in late June _
mounds of roly-poly flowers in shades of orange, yellow and sort-of
red _ but marigolds look good when their neighbors are starting to
fade. Indeed, it would be nice to be an iris in one's youth and a
marigold in middle age.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that a large bed of one variety of marigold can be a
bit boring. The plants are so uniform that a mass looks stiff and
soldierly. They look better planted in clumps among other annuals
or in drifts in front of evergreens or shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many varieties of marigold that it would be fun
to plant a marigold library, the way some botanical gardens plant
libraries of daffodils and roses.
</P>
<P>
   There could be tall African marigolds, rising to three feet or
more, and sprightly dwarf French marigolds, some only six inches
tall. Giant-flowered hybrid marigolds, with their impossibly huge,
puffy flowers, could contrast with signet marigolds and their
dime-size blooms. There could be quite an array of flower shapes,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Not all marigolds have the carnation form, which is the term
used to describe those petal-jammed flowers. There are many
varieties of single-flowered marigolds, which have a single rim of
petals and look like gaily colored daisies.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly interesting one is Striped Marvel, which has a
single tier of thin petals, red on one half and yellow on the
other. It makes a bushy two-foot plant, but most single-flowered
marigolds are dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties that grow no more than
a foot tall. Disco is one of the best, and it comes in a mixture
that includes a delightful array of yellow, orange and bicolored
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Marigolds in the Sophia class fall somewhere between the
single-flowered and carnation-flowered types _ they have a double
rim of petals, russet-red or orange edged with gold.
</P>
<P>
   The marigold color range is limited to oranges, yellows,
near-reds and combinations of those colors, although breeders have
come up with several varieties so pale yellow that they appear
ivory or white. White marigolds have less of the characteristic
scent, making them nice for gardeners who don't grow marigolds
because they object to the smell.
</P>
<P>
   To my nose, the scent of marigolds is much nicer than that of
some salvias, which smell like a used litter box, but olfactory
preferences vary.
</P>
<P>
   The scent is probably why marigolds, which make fine cut
flowers, do not get used in floral arrangements more often. Most of
the smell, however, is concentrated in the foliage. The flowers
themselves are almost odorless. If you strip off the foliage, the
scent of marigolds won't permeate the house.
</P>
<P>
   You can also grow marigolds that don't have the characteristic
scent. Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia), also called gem
marigolds, have citrus-scented foliage that is lacier than standard
marigold foliage and a lighter shade of green. The blossoms are
small and dainty, with a single rim of petals. Mexican mint
marigold (T. lucida), also called Mexican tarragon marigold, has
the scent of anise and can be used in cooking as a substitute for
tarragon.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners plant marigolds as a companion to vegetable
crops, assuming the scent is a pest repellent. It's true that some
marigolds can help control certain species of destructive
nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms, but it's a chemical in the
marigold roots, not the odor of the foliage, that does the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Only French marigolds (T. patula) are effective in controlling
nematodes. African marigolds (T. erecta) and other varieties,
including hybrids, won't work. You also won't see any benefits
until the year after the marigolds are grown, because the chemical
is released from the roots as they break down in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   If nematodes are a problem in your garden, rotating the
vegetable patch with a bed of French marigolds may help. Simply
planting marigolds among the tomatoes and peppers probably won't do
much, although it will certainly look nice.
</P>
<P>
   Marigolds like full sun and soil that is decent but not too
rich. To keep them blooming steadily, snap off the spent flower
heads occasionally. There are some sterile varieties, called
triploids, that do not set seed and will keep blooming even if the
dead flowers are not removed, but even those will look better if
they're cleaned up periodically.
</P>
<P>
   If marigolds can't be elegant or exquisite, they can at least be
immaculate. &QL;

   America has no quarrel with the Serb people, we're repeatedly
told during televised war briefings. It's their leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, whom NATO is punishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb people just happen to have the misfortune of being in
the place where we happen to be bombing.
</P>
<P>
   One day, it's an errant missile taking out a passenger train.
The next day, our planes mistakenly bomb a convoy of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   I'm at the point where I hate to open the newspaper or turn on
the TV news, for fear of learning the latest results from this
one-sided war we're waging.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems that if we bring enough destruction to Serbia,
then Milosevic will have no choice but to capitulate, if for no
other reason than to save his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Not gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic is a no-good, rotten Slobodan Milosevic. He's
a tinhorn Hitler, the poster boy of everything that is evil among
the struggle of the Balkan people.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler never gave in, and neither will Milosevic. Meanwhile, in
the process of destroying the Serbian army's capacity to make war,
we're also destroying the Serbian people's homes and places of
work, their transportation system and their industry, their very
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Better we should kill Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Forget bombing their cities. Simply assassinate their leader.
</P>
<P>
   If that strikes you as immoral, take another look at the results
of some of our bomb strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has the ways and means of assassination. What they lack
is the directive.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when foreign killings were a matter of routine policy
as a part of our cloak-and-dagger capability.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven knows how they tried to take out Castro, even entering
into a hit contract with the Mafia to do the job. Neither their
gang nor ours, as it turned out, could shoot straight.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe the Kennedy assassination was in
retaliation for what we were trying to do in Cuba. Of course, there
are those, too, who speculate that JFK may have been killed by a
jealous husband.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms changed all that, following the expose' of CIA outrages,
Watergate and such. Congress made it a law: The CIA shall not
assassinate.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to change the law back.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better on everybody. One bad guy, one bullet. And
let that be a lesson to others, that we're making a list and
checking it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who visited Belgrade
this past week in support of Milosevic, comes to mind. He's the
last of the old Stalinists, a terrorist against his own people, an
enemy of human rights. The tyranny in Belarus is perhaps second
only to that of China, but, then, we do a lot of business with
China.
</P>
<P>
   What's the worst thing that could happen?
</P>
<P>
   Well, our enemies could respond in kind, targeting our own
president. That, of course, would be a terrible, terrible thing for
America.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't be as terrible as having our cities bombed.

MILLENNIUM A GO-GO: FRUGGING TO 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest Gap ads, which had their premieres during last
month's Academy Awards telecast, have taken something far out and
made it totally in. Hold on to your feather boas, pop culture is
going ``a go-go.'' Again.
</P>
<P>
   Gap, the ubiquitous San Francisco-based retailer, whose ``Khakis
Swing'' ad last year helped to make the 1940s dance revival cool,
has now unleashed 15 sexy dancers who do the frug, the pony and the
jerk in a '60s-inspired spot called ``Khaki a Go-Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Choreographed by Marguerite Derricks, who gave Mike Myers his
groovy moves in ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,''
these 30 seconds of rotating wrists and whirling ponytails manage
to make even the most humdrum pair of Gap chinos seem somehow
``shagadelic,'' as Powers would say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MAC, the Canadian cosmetics company known as much for
employing offbeat spokesmodels like RuPaul and K.D. Lang as for its
durable lipstick, is celebrating the opening of each new MAC
counter this year with department store parties called MAC a Go-Go.
These main-floor shindigs come complete with dancing girls in
bubblegum-colored feather bikinis, and go-go boys in hot pink
pailletted square-cut trunks and Lycra crop-tops. Talk about a
hullabaloo!
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more. On Broadway, ``Fosse'' features muscled
dancers doing the ``Rich Man's Frug,'' a 1966 show-stopper from
``Sweet Charity.'' Their clenched fists and knocked knees make this
go-go-inspired number one of the legendary choreographer's most
exciting dances. Retro but modern, the routine inhales the smoke of
a vintage Tiparillo and exhales the haughtiness of high fashion at
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   At home, a fellow can now practice his cool jerk to a new
British CD compilation called ``Land of 1,000 Dances,'' which
repackages the ``Hippy Hippy Shake'' and ``Monkey Time'' for a new
generation. If not that, he can tune in to the USA Network's new
Saturday night variety series ``Happy Hour,'' where the Bombshells,
a dance troupe modeled after Dean Martin's Gold Diggers, make its
hosts, Dweezil and Ahmet Zappa, look that much hipper. And coming
soon to a multiplex near you is ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me,'' a sequel teaming Myers' secret agent with Heather
Graham. If it's a hit _ and even a ``Phantom Menace'' is no reason
to believe this latest James Bond spoof won't be big, baby _
there's no telling how far this '60s fascination could go-go.
</P>
<P>
   But why go-go now? Rebecca Weill, a Gap spokeswoman, says they
came up with ``Khaki a Go-Go'' after a lot of research, listening
to music and poring over magazines and movies, to see what struck a
chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juxtaposition of old and new makes for a combination
that's very appealing to a lot of people,'' she said. These ads,
like the MAC promotion, offer more than cute dancers and fun music,
they mine a universal nostalgia that many young consumers feel.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Playboy mansion is once again the vortex of
Hollywood hip, it's only natural to revive the bunny esthetic. But
what seems odd is that such kooky-sexy playfulness resonates most
strongly among those who either don't remember the originals or
who, like me, were in the earliest years of primary school when the
``Laugh-In'' cocktail party was the place to be every Monday night.
A go-go revival fills a longing to have been a part of things back
then. Maybe we are all destined to like best the era into which
we're born.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be something else entirely. It may just be, as some
contend, that the '60s were simply the most interesting decade of
the 20th century. Period. Andy Warhol used to wonder if more things
happened in the '60s because people were on drugs, or if people
took drugs in the '60s just to keep up with all that was going on.
I don't know the answer to the Prince of Pop's conundrum, but I am
inclined to believe that the flavors and fads of that decade will
delight audiences well into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the '70s revival gives way to a neo-'80s renaissance,
and the '40s swing craze dies, the '60s will be an era that forever
draws us back.
</P>
<P>
   A decade in which desire for social change and hopes for the
future ran as high as micro-mini hemlines is always worth reviving.
At least that's the way it seems today, as we appropriate '60s
styles without any of the political or contextual baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us remember the go-go boots more clearly than the Tet
offensive. In fact, designs of the '60s, from fashion to home
furnishings, are beginning to be considered American classics.
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest disappointments today is that the world at
the dawn of the 21st century doesn't look '60s enough. It doesn't
look as fabulously futuristic as it did in ``Barbarella.'' As it
turns out, we won't all be wearing Rudi Gernreich in the year 2000;
we'll be wearing khakis. But at least we'll be doing the frug.

STATESIDE GIS SAY THEY'RE READY FOR THE REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWTON, Okla. _ They have played the war games, pretended they
were hunkered down in the darkness of Kosovo. They've fired
missiles at Serb soldiers, although both the missiles and the
soldiers were pretend, too.
</P>
<P>
   But when they joined the US Army straight out of high school
three years ago, the three young soldiers never expected this: real
war, real blood, and the real possibility that they would be
shipped overseas to fight for reasons they can't quite comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trained to fight, but we're just kids,'' said Spec.
Miguel Angel Nieves, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Added his breakfast companion, Spec. Ronald Fayson, 23, ``I
wasn't thinking about war when I signed up. It was just something
to improve myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said they are ready and willing to do the job they
are paid $1,209 a month to do, even if that's too little money for
extras, even if their equally young wives are already afraid.
Mostly, they want to see the job done right, done fast, and they
say that means sending in ground troops made up of novice soldiers
such as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their unit at Fort Sill, located on the outskirts of this flat,
wind-swept city in southwestern Oklahoma, has been told to be
ready, although others are expected to go first. For now, though,
the military build-up in the Balkans has consisted only of Air
Force aircraft and personnel, including a recent deployment from
the base in nearby Altus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very articulate man,'' said Nieves, originally from
Panama and married five years now. ``But we either go over and kick
their (expletive) or we should stay the hell out. We go in, we go
in all the way, you see what I'm saying. You can't go in halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three, who met in Lawton 3 1/2 years ago after basic
training, is itching to go, although Spec. Philip Morgan said he
does feel the tug when he sees the destruction on TV. They see the
war in human terms, from the ethnic Albanian refugees streaming out
of Kosovo to the friends they hear are being sent over from the US
base in Germany. The politics _ who's killing who and why _ is
harder to grasp, especially in a city of 100,000 where
international news is scarce for those who can't afford the cable
TV bill.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves, the talker of the trio, walked the table through the
history of the conflict as he understands it. He knows it goes back
500 years. He knows the people in some Yugoslavian provinces abhor
the people in others. But what he knows best _ and what he fears
most _ is what he has heard is a system of Serbian underground
bunkers where entire armies can hide out. Serbia is well-bunkered,
but with little to do but wait, the mythology has grown among the
young men and women walking around Lawton in green Army fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter your opinion is how we look at it,'' said
Morgan, 21, and from California, ``You could totally disagree with
it, and nobody wants to kill anyone and definitely nobody wants to
be killed, but if you're told to go, you go. You do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nieves, whose father served in Vietnam, ``We still believe
in our country and freedom for all. . .What my wife thinks, though,
is that it's not our business, it's not our problem. We're giving
up American lives and the European community doesn't give a damn
when it's in their own backyard. At least that's the way she sees
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Fayson, whose family is in Florida, ``It's always
America. NATO. We need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   If the friends are sent to Kosovo from Fort Sill, where about
20,000 soldiers are stationed, each will have a job distinct from
the others. Fort Sill is the field artillery center, and Morgan
works with the multi-launch rocket system, or MLRS, that the base
is know for worldwide. Fayson, a personnel clerk, expects to work
the radios. Nieves is a chaplain's assistant, and his primary job
would be to guard the chaplain, forbidden under the Geneva
Convention from carrying a weapon himself for protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job would be to improve morale, however you do that in a
war,'' Nieves said. ``I'd be there to comfort the dead and the
dying. But my main job would be to be the chaplain's bullet-proof
vest.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, an elderly woman stopped by the table, laden with
eggs and pancakes, sausage and grits, to wish ``our boys'' well.
They listened politely, nodding throughout, as she blasted
President Clinton, blasted Congress, for putting a single US
soldier in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton or Congress had to go, if the jokers who declare
war have to go, we'd never have one, I tell you,'' she said,
declining to introduce herself by name after mentioning that her
husband served in both World War II and Korea. ``They're just
leading our boys to the slaughter. We've got a bunch of jokers who
never served and don't know nothing about running a war.''
</P>
<P>
   At another table at the International House of Pancakes, packed
with soldiers allowed to leave their stations after the wind
knocked out some power lines, three artillery officers were more
stoic about the situation. Older, in the Army longer, and able to
explain Balkan politics with ease, they said they don't bother to
worry about what they can't control. None has heard a frightened
word from a solder under his command either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go in every day and don't think about it,'' said one,
a captain from New Jersey who declined to be identified by name
without official Army clearance. ``It's not our place to say one
way or the other whether it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another captain, ``What I'm thinking about is an
omelette.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger soldiers say they are trying to turn their thoughts
to other things, too. They try to keep their wives from worrying,
since, as Morgan put it, ``mine would be upset if she knew I was
probably going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision to send in ground troops is some time off,
if it comes at all _ leaving Nieves, Morgan and Fayson with a sense
of ambivalence that they know would evaporate the minute they
landed in a land that continues to confuse them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been setting up real-world scenarios so we'll know what
we're in for, mapping it out, like we're in Kosovo,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Fayson, ``We've dug fighting positions, done gas attacks,
all of it. But it definitely can't compare with the real thing.''

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Everywhere Melina Kanakaredes turned,
residents of this smitten city reached out for her, eager for a
word, a smile, a wave, as if Kanakaredes were more than just the
star of a television program, as if she were a civic heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in a way, she is, especially at a cultural moment when
identification with a hit TV show or movie can reshape a
community's image (how many ``Cheers''-watchers still think of
Boston as a friendly place ``where everybody knows your name''?)
</P>
<P>
   This uncut gem of a city has long believed _ with ample
justification _ that the wider world tends to look down on or
ignore Providence. That got harder to do as Providence poured
nearly $2 billion into an urban revival featuring a waterfront
park, a new convention center with an attached hotel, and a massive
shopping mall now nearing completion downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Condescending to Rhode Island's capital has gotten even harder
since NBC's ``Providence'' emerged as the hottest new network drama
of the season. Every Friday night, more than 13 million viewers
across the country see the city of Providence bathed in a golden
light as a locale of romance and drama. Of course, the Providence
of ``Providence'' has its share of social problems, but that only
makes life more dramatically challenging for Dr. Sydney Hansen
(Kanakaredes), a plastic surgeon who has forsaken the glamour of
life in the Hollywood fast lane to return, as the character says,
``back where I never thought I'd be, in Providence, my hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cast and crew of ``Providence'' returned to the show's
namesake for the first time since it began airing in January,
Daniel Frageorgia Jr. felt he had to be there. ``This show is
what's putting Providence on the map,'' exulted Frageorgia, a
35-year-old chef who was among hundreds of onlookers watching
``Providence'' film scenes Wednesday on the banks of the Providence
River.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Frageorgia believes the show is perfectly
timed because it spotlights Providence just as the city is in the
middle of a renaissance. ``Ten or 15 years ago, you didn't want to
come to Providence,'' he said. ``But now is the time to do this
show. It's making Providence a tourist attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Briggs, a 64-year-old retiree who lives in the city,
hastened to Waterplace Park with her friend Nancy DeAngelis as soon
as she heard the show was in town. ``I've watched every episode
from the very start,'' said Briggs, as DeAngelis gave a me-too nod.
``It shows the best of Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the cast and crew of ``Providence'' were here, to
shoot the pilot show in October, the Akron, Ohio-born Kanakaredes
was a little-known actress from the daytime soap opera, ``The
Guiding Light.'' But on Wednesday, as a newly minted prime-time
star of a family drama that consistently ranks among the top
20-rated network programs each week, her every move was avidly
watched by the show's fans.
</P>
<P>
   And Kanakaredes was looking right back at Providence _ and
marveling at the swiftly changing face of the city that has
embraced her show as a symbol of its revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that sense, when you come here, that it's coming into
its rebirth,'' she said during a break in filming. Kanakaredes
pointed across the street at Providence Place, a 150-store shopping
mall slated to open in August, and remarked ``That was just being
talked about the first time we were here. Now, look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' (which airs locally at 8 p.m. on WHDH-Ch. 7) has
been embraced by the city's colorful mayor, Vincent (Buddy) Cianci,
who recently appeared on the show, and who hosted a party for the
cast on Monday night. ``The mayor tells us about the city, and he
tells us about the people,'' said actress Concetta Tomei, who plays
Sydney's mother on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Cianci gleefully recounted a
conversation he had two weeks ago with Baltimore Mayor Kurt L.
Schmoke. According to Cianci, Schmoke praised ``Providence'' thusly
to his fellow mayor: ``Boy, the skyline looks terrific, with a good
storyline about a woman coming home, helping her family,
contributing to the community.'' The way Cianci tells it, Schmoke
then added, presumably with a touch of rueful envy: ``I've got a
show too on television. It's called `Homicide.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That story was already making the rounds among onlookers at
Wednesday's filming. After feeling like underdogs for so long,
Rhode Islanders are clearly savoring the heady feeling of being in,
of being hot. With pleasure, they recall that it was Providence,
not Boston, that was chosen by the National Football League as the
host city for the AFC Conference Championship Game in 1997.
Moreover, the entertainment industry has discovered Little Rhody in
a big way. In the past few years, movies ranging from ``Amistad''
to ``True Lies'' to ``There's Something About Mary'' have been
partly shot in Rhode Island. Movie star Jim Carrey will be coming
to the state soon to film ``Me, Myself and Irene,'' the latest
effort by Peter and Bobby Farrelly, the native Rhode Islanders
behind ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's no business like show business. ``Does it bring
in money? Absolutely,'' said Cianci. ``Does it bring in
construction work? Yes.'' For instance, the mayor said Teamsters
union members logged an estimated 138,000 hours of work last year
on TV and film work in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   But Providence the city has embraced ``Providence'' the TV show
for reasons that go beyond jobs and money. Residents appear
grateful that a national audience is being told something they
already know, that this is a nice place to live and work, and that
the show reflects the tight family bonds on which Rhode Islanders
pride themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those skyline shots. ``I told the mayor that
we were going to shoot postcards of the city, make it as beautiful
as possible,'' said ``Providence'' creator and executive producer
John Masius as he watched the set-up for one shot. ``The fact is it
is a beautiful city.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Sydney turns her back on a successful plastic
surgery practice in Los Angeles and returns to Providence, where
she goes to work at a health clinic serving mostly poor patients.
Her love life is a complicated one, as is her family life. She
becomes a kind of caretaker for her veterinarian father, who
connects better with animals than humans; her sister Joanie, who is
coping with being an unwed mother; a ne'er-do-well brother, Robbie;
and a mother who, though she died at Joanie's (canceled) wedding,
keeps reappearing in dream sequences, where she is every bit as
commanding and difficult as she was in life.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other character: Providence. ``The city is one of
the characters of the show,'' said Masius, in a theme immediately
picked up by the show's co-executive producer, Bob DeLaurentis.
``We love this city,'' said DeLaurentis. ``It stands for that
semimythical place we all feel we miss, where families are still
close and people still look out for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that the city bears such an evocative name, one
whose meaning is not lost on the actors or producers involved in a
show that revolves around themes of second chances and finding
meaning in your own life by helping others.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes shot Wednesday will air during the May ratings
``sweeps'' period. On hand for the filming were Tomei; Paula Cale,
who plays Joanie; Seth Peterson, who plays Robbie; and Tom Verica,
who plays Kyle, Sydney's love interest. (None of the scenes
involved Mike Farrell of ``MASH'' fame, who plays the father, so he
wasn't present.)
</P>
<P>
   The actors cheerfully signed autographs and posed for pictures
with their arms draped around fans. ``I feel like we're the
Beatles,'' remarked Cale, looking at the crowds gathered on stone
steps at Waterplace Park. Tomei, whose character chain-smokes on
the show, chatted with a youngster, emphasizing that she doesn't
smoke in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers got a glimpse at the tedium and repetitiveness
involved in making a TV show, but were on balance patient and
good-humored, and most obediently fell silent when crew members
shushed them before each take. Most, but not all: ``Kyle? Oh my
God!'' screamed one young woman just as cameras began to roll for a
scene involving Sydney delivering some dismaying news to Kyle on a
park bench.
</P>
<P>
   For a day, the banks of the Providence River became a movie set,
with klieg lights, crane-operated cameras, and scores of crew
members. A dozen extras clustered hopefully on the grass, hoping
for a walk-on role. Meanwhile, the city of Providence played its
own part, complete with the sound effects of a booming city: the
steady rat-a-tat-tat of building construction.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't appear to bother Kanakaredes. ``There is something
quite divine about Providence,'' she said.

WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SEN BUD
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 54 to 44, the final version of
the $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2000. The package, a
compromise between previously passed House and Senate bills, lays
out a blueprint for cutting taxes over the next ten years, uses the
projected Social Security surplus to either pay down the national
debt or reform Social Security and Medicare and increases spending
for defense and education. Supporters said the tremendous
non-Social Security budget surplus should be returned to the
taxpayers through the tax cuts rather than used for new social
programs, as proposed by President Clinton. Opponents said the
budget does not do enough to save Social Security and Medicare and
that there should be more spending on social programs instead of
tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 223-206, the Local Census
Quality Control Act, which would allow cities and towns to
challenge Census Bureau data and demand a recount of contested
areas before the final numbers are released. Supporters said the
plan would provide a more accurate population count. Opponents said
the Census Bureau lacks the resources to investigate what may be
tens of thousands of likely challenges by local governments. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 &HT;    EX-TEXAS COP-TURNED-MEXICAN DRUG TRAFFICKER COULD REVEAL
CORRUPTION SECRETS
 &HT;    With Photo of Salinas.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., April 17 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYNOSA, Mexico _ It is, by now, a familiar tale in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A small-town boy becomes police officer and quickly succumbs to
the temptations of lucrative drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time is the former cop is an American
citizen named Gilbert Salinas, a Donna, Texas native who is wanted
in Houston and Atlanta, and is in jail in Mexico on charges of
smuggling tons of Colombian cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities say Salinas, 41, is a ``key member'' of the
Juarez-Cancun drug cartel, a criminal ring that has relied on
extensive support from Mexican police -- and the former governor of
Quintana Roo state -- to smuggle cocaine from Mexico into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department has requested Salinas' extradition
to face marijuana-trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Salinas is a very valuable catch because he could
reveal explosive secrets detailing how corrupt law-enforcement
officials on both sides of the border are helping smuggle cocaine
up the Gulf Coast, through U.S. checkpoints along the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas is said to be the architect of the cartel's Gulf
smuggling routes into the United States, which were based on trails
he blazed as a marijuana smuggler in his native Rio Grande Valley.
Under his guidance, cocaine was allegedly delivered to this Mexican
border city and shipped across the Rio Grande to McAllen, Texas,
before being moved to Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very significant dope trafficker,'' said one U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He'd be like the
vice president for transportation, if you wanted to structure it
out like a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas is also believed to be a critical witness who has
already named high-ranking officials under investigation for
trafficking, including the former governor of Quintana Roo, Mexican
highway police and judicial police.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his knowledge, Salinas is ``in a very precarious
position,'' the U.S. official said. ``The Colombians will do
anything possible to get him out (of jail). And when they find out
they can't they'll do anything they can to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than to confirm Salinas' role in the cartel, spokesmen
from the Mexican Attorney General's office declined to discuss
Salinas, who some Mexican newspaper accounts claim is a protected
witness in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   John Trevino, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in
Texas, said, ``I guess he's Mr. Big now.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' brief career as a South Texas police officer ended when
he was arrested in 1982 at a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint with a
load of marijuana. He was convicted, did some time in jail and was
convicted again in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, while out of jail on bond, he disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Trevino said, Salinas was moving thousands of
pounds of pot from Mexico into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He was indicted in Atlanta in 1990 for conspiracy to traffic
marijuana and in 1993 in Houston on continuing criminal enterprise
charges, which can carry a life sentence without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Trevino said authorities in McAllen would also like to question
Salinas about the unsolved 1996 killing of a doctor in that city.
</P>
<P>
   On March 11 of this year, the Mexican Embassy in Washington
issued a statement that Salinas would have to be tried in Mexico
before authorities could hand him over to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While underground for almost a decade, Salinas used various
aliases, including Gilberto Garza Garcia, Gilberto Salinas Doria
and the nickname, ``El Guero Gil,'' or ``White Gil.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was arrested in October 1998 by Mexican authorities, who
believed he was Mexican-born Gilberto Garza Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken soon after his arrest to the resort city of Cancun
as part of an probe into the Juarez-Cancun cartel. United States
sources believe he escaped shortly afterward because he paid a
large bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The trafficker was recaptured after he was found in a luxury
resort on a Venezuelan island in January and deported to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He was identified as Salinas in February, only after the FBI and
other U.S. law enforcement officers matched his picture and
fingerprints with records at the Donna and Weslaco police
departments in South Texas, where Salinas worked in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   According to three Mexican newspapers, Salinas described some of
the cartel's inner-workings to Mexican authorities in an affidavit
taken Oct. 8, 1998, after his first arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was leaked to El Manana newspaper in Reynosa, and
Mexico City's La Jornada and El Universal newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Salinas is said to have described how the
Juarez-Cancun cartel paid off certain Mexican highway police to
protect cocaine shipments being trucked through Veracruz, Tampico
and Tamaulipas states along the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   He said a highway police commander in Reynosa was paid $50,000
per shipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing. (The commander) must have been down at the
bottom of the food chain,'' said a U.S. official, who confirmed
suspicions in press reports here that Mexico's federal highway
police are under investigation for protecting drug deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that October affidavit that Salinas is said to have
also implicated the former governor of Quintana Roo state, Mario
Villanueva, along with a former judicial police commander.
</P>
<P>
   In March, just as a Mexican Attorney General's investigation
into Villanueva was heating up, the governor disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva became a fugitive on April 5, when the attorney
general issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the
Juarez-Cancun cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel, originally based in Ciudad Juarez, had moved much of
its operation to Cancun during Villanueva's term as governor,
according to Mexican authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas is also said to have sketched out the cartel's shipping
methods in his October statement. Some of these methods have been
confirmed by Mexican law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The trafficker said boats drop cocaine along the Belize coast,
which borders Quintana Roo. Once in Veracruz state, the drugs are
shipped through the Gulf Coast states in trucks fitted with tubes
to haul liquids.
</P>
<P>
   In Reynosa, Salinas said, cocaine is put in 30-pound sacks and
loaded onto trucks. He implicated an unnamed McAllen transportation
company and alleged that U.S. law enforcement agents have also
helped smuggle the drugs over the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, complicity in drug smuggling among U.S.
law-enforcement agents is in the spotlight right now.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, the General Accounting Office released a report
detailing corruption among U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) and U.S. Customs Service agents stationed along the
border, from the Rio Grande Valley to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, 28 employees were convicted for helping
traffickers, who often relied on bribes and longtime friendships
with U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   Two immigration inspectors based in Hidalgo, a port of entry
adjacent to McAllen, were convicted of allowing marijuana and
cocaine shipments over the bridge into the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   An INS employee in Los Fresnos, also in the Rio Grande Valley,
conspired with two colleagues and a former colleague to transport
drug shipments past Border Patrol checkpoints in official INS
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Another INS employee who was helping move drug shipments from
the Rio Grande Valley to Chicago recruited a longtime friend and
Border Patrol agent to wave shipments through a Falfurrias, Texas,
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In Donna, Salinas' home town, five former law enforcement
officers, including two former police chiefs, were arrested in 1997
for taking bribes to allow marijuana shipments to be driven through
town.
</P>
<P>
   Donna, a mostly Mexican-American community of 13,000, is about
nine miles from the Mexican border and 12 miles east of McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Salinas' family still lives in Donna, Texas, where the
story of how he evolved from cop to trafficker -- and now potential
star witness -- has piqued the interest of people who remember him
as an ordinary kid.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas joined the Donna police force in 1979. He was hired as a
patrolman in Weslaco, an adjacent town of about 40,000 in May 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired from the Weslaco job after an internal
investigation led to his arrest for trafficking marijuana, said
police spokesman David Molina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a decent family,'' said childhood friend Alfonso
Avila, a lieutenant in the Donna Police Force. ``I guess the
temptation was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Avila said Salinas' father, a house mover, was strict and
well-known in town for his involvement in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Salinas' family is a distinguished military man and
Donna residents named a school after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying in Spanish, 'A family is like a hand. All the
fingers are different,''' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Donna say the accused trafficker lived in Reynosa while
he was a fugitive, and that he slipped back into Donna dressed as a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gilbert was here he wasn't all that important,'' said Joe
Perez, a Donna barber who was listening to Mexican ballads, or
corridos, while he trimmed customers' hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't written a corrido for him yet,'' Perez said.

WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''

   1) BILL NUMBER: SEN BUD
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 54 to 44, the final version of
the $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal year 2000. The package, a
compromise between previously passed House and Senate bills, lays
out a blueprint for cutting taxes over the next ten years, uses the
projected Social Security surplus to either pay down the national
debt or reform Social Security and Medicare and increases spending
for defense and education. Supporters said the tremendous
non-Social Security budget surplus should be returned to the
taxpayers through the tax cuts rather than used for new social
programs, as proposed by President Clinton. Opponents said the
budget does not do enough to save Social Security and Medicare and
that there should be more spending on social programs instead of
tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 UNDATED: looking sexy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The display of glamour and sex appeal seems for some artists to
be an exuberant expression of hard-won gains by earlier feminist
artists. For years, women, with few exceptions, tended to posture
like Jackson Pollock in gritty jeans, paint-smeared T-shirt and
cigarette dangling from their lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, it was so hard for young women,'' said Paula
Cooper, who opened her first gallery, on Prince Street, in 1968.
``All the guys were the serious artists. To be taken seriously,
women had to be grungy. They couldn't be gorgeous, glamorous and
feminine. There was no room for anything other than the macho
ideal. Now, women have been accepted. Some of the strongest artists
of the '80s and '90s have been women, so they're freer to do what
they please.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Romantic period, the male artist perpetuated the myth
of the grubby creative genius, so preoccupied with the lofty ideals
of his art that he was unaware of the holes in his shoes. Yes,
there were exceptions like Barnett Newman, impeccably dressed in a
suit and gold watch chain, or Andy Warhol, in his platinum wig.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the '80s, when the art market exploded and
artists' wallets began to fatten, that male artists seriously began
to abandon the boho ideal. Jean-Michel Basquiat had a soft spot for
Armani suits. Julian Schnabel developed the habit of painting and
partying in silk pajamas. David Salle, who may be the snappiest
dresser of them all, has been known to wear Richard James suits
tailored on Savile Row with a Gilligan's Island fishing hat and
J.P. Tod's loafers.
</P>
<P>
   While the myth of the tortured genius still shadows these men _
at times they have been criticized for placing style over substance
_ they have had it easy compared to female artists with designer
inclinations. To be taken seriously, women had to appear as if they
did not care about their looks, and they also had to play down
their femininity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, as a woman photographer, if you took pictures of a
nude woman, it was looked down upon,'' said Ms. Feinstein, the
sculptor who wore the see-through skirt for her Yale interview. She
said the efforts of earlier feminist artists freed her generation
to make what she calls ``girlie art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these '70s feminist artists had to break through this
territory in a violent way,'' she said. ``Now we can make stuff
about femininity and fashion.'' Ms. Feinstein, whose work is on
view at White Columns, constructs hokey-looking stage sets in candy
colors that recall Disney heroines _ Cinderella, Snow White,
Sleeping Beauty. In her personal style she is equally kittenish,
given to frilly frocks and a long, Rapunzel fall of blond hair. Her
seeming nonchalance about the reactions to her vixenish pose _ and
the nonchalance of others like her _ disturbs some members of the
art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money and fashion have entered the picture,'' said Robert
Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New York University who has
written about contemporary art since the 1950s. ``The financial
success of modern art can be read in terms of the way artists are
dressing. Now young artists have to dress right if they want to be
successful. They all look hip and expensive in their studios for
publicity photos. If they don't look rich, people aren't going to
pay a lot of money for their work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of irritates me that these women are promoted just
because they look like fashion models,'' he said. ``Often, the p.r.
has to do with photographs of them and not their work. Women
artists used to have to look anguished, bohemian. The last thing
they looked like was Vogue models.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the current trend traces to Cindy Sherman, 45,
best known for her photographic self-portraits in which she
parodies Hollywood's bimbos and vixens. Ms. Sherman was one of the
first to take for her subject matter pop culture's images of
glamour, and many of today's fashion-mad artists look up to her.
From the moment she walked into ``Another Girl, Another Planet,''
she was a center of attention. But she is disturbed by the trend
among young women, who, she contends, are exploiting their sex
appeal without questioning feminine stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something uninformed about it that is creepy and scary
to me,'' she said. ``Young women who haven't learned they can have
intellectual power know they can open their shirt and attract 20
guys. It's enormous power. If I had a lithe young body, I would
dress like that. But I think you can play into the game and twist
it to educate the guy, who will see the real whore on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The love affair between the worlds of art and fashion has been
consummated over the last several years. ``In the mid-'90s, artists
began working directly with the subject of high fashion,'' said
Bankowsky of Artforum. ``We all suddenly knew the names of the
supermodels; fashion became part of public consciousness because of
TV. Previously, it had been a rarefied world.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Sylvie Fleury, who has created installations out of
Chanel shopping bags, designer shoe boxes and the glossy covers of
fashion magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And Janine Antoni has made paintings by batting her mascara-ed
eyelashes against paper and by dipping her long hair in dye and
sweeping it across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Craig-Martin, 35, may be the symbolic love child of the
union of art and fashion. As a paparazzo, she chronicles celebrity
fetes, gallery openings and film festivals. Her pictures frequently
appear in Vogue. But right now, at the Maureen Paley Gallery in
London, Ms. Craig-Martin is exhibiting work meant to reveal a
darker side of the glittery world she circulates in.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the details of clothing or body language at a party,
frequently cropping out the faces of her subjects, Ms. Craig-Martin
aims to capture the pathos of trying to fit into glitzy company.
``One is never so naked as when dressed for a party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, Ms. Craig-Martin says her Prada and Gucci
uniforms are a ``means of subterfuge,'' allowing her to pass for a
party guest and to cross the velvet ropes, gliding by the waiting
horde of jostling paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Being celebrity-gorgeous may be the new condition for survival,
or rather success, of the art world's fittest. But the trend
carries many risks. Not every creative person is born with the
genes of a fashion model, or a shopaholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what the art world expects of a woman artist,'' lamented
Ana Kustera, whose gallery is on Wooster Street. ``It doesn't hurt
to be attractive, and the work should not be politically motivated;
it should be influenced by the fashion world, it doesn't offend,
and it should represent the perfected image of what beautiful is. I
want women artists to be taken more seriously, but if they make
more serious work, it will be overlooked.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an early spring night. The air was chilly and
damp, but in the art gallery on 57th Street the scene was so steamy
all coats had been shed. Amid the crowd of 500 who flocked to the
opening of ``Another Girl, Another Planet,'' an exhibition of
photographs by and about young women, the dozen artists in the show
were as easy to spot as fireflies at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Like young starlets at a trendy Hollywood boite, the artists
displayed the casually glamorous style of women who are used to
being in the limelight, even though none are marquee names in the
art world. With their tousled hair, bare legs, colorful stilettos,
sexy leather pants, Tracy Feith slip dresses and beaded vintage
handbags, they looked as if they had stepped out of the fashion
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them had. For the past two months, Vogue has featured
artists-about-town in ``Talking Fashion,'' its photo feature about
high-fashion trends _ long the exclusive terrain of celebrities and
socialites. ``These artists have great style,'' said Alexandra
Kotur, a senior editor for special projects. ``They look as great
as actresses at a premiere.''
</P>
<P>
   James Reginato, the features director of W magazine, who
attended the opening, which was at Lawrence Rubin-Greenberg Van
Doren Fine Art, said: ``I definitely see women artists cropping up
on our pages more. Everybody looks like they're in a Prada or
Helmut Lang ad these days. It's OK to be glamorous. Suffering for
your art is passe.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of young artists, it appears, would rather be seen in
nail polish than with paint beneath their nails, not to mention
spattered on their jeans. For some it is a declaration of power and
self-confidence. For others, exuding glamour or sexuality is an
extension of the themes in their work, the '90s being in a decade
when many artists have made images of high fashion their point of
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Today, women who might once have felt obliged to masquerade as
scruffy, macho types in order to be taken seriously in an art world
dominated by men, now flaunt the feminine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious women artists are presenting themselves as
conventionally fashionable in a way that they wouldn't have in the
past,'' said Jack Bankowsky, the editor of Artforum magazine.
``Women have begun to have parity in society and now feel
comfortable playing with the codes and conventions of fashion,
whereas previously enlightened women wouldn't want to buy into the
sexist biases that come along with fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is not merely about a generation of artists that has
found its way to Barneys. The development says much about the
self-image of artists in society, about the appeal of postfeminism
to a younger generation, and about the role of money in an art
market that, after a long dry spell, has heated up in Dow-fueled
Manhattan. And dressing like a seductress or fashion model arouses
plenty of controversy in the high-minded art world where it is
often assumed that there must be more to images than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Rachel Feinstein, a sculptor who is now
27, went to Yale for a graduate school interview, she wore leg
warmers with garters and a see-through plastic miniskirt, which
revealed lacy underwear. She was surprised when the head of the
sculpture department, a conceptual artist, was offended. ``He
attacked me verbally,'' Ms. Feinstein said. ``He accused me of
being a third-wave feminist. He said I was a woman who forces her
sexuality on men. He thought I was doing this for theoretical
reasons, that I was trying to affront him with my girlhood. He
tried to get me to defend myself. Needless to say, I didn't go to
Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feinstein insists she intended no statement, political,
feminist or otherwise, by her outfit. And many other artists of a
similar mind-set defend their right not to be judged by traditional
notions of female artists.
</P>
<P>
   Cecily Brown, 29, a painter who wears makeup when she works and
has her hair blown straight at a SoHo salon before going out at
night, said: ``It's important not to feel bullied into dressing
down. It's the Madonna school of feminism. My generation was born
feminists. We don't have to keep proving it. I couldn't care less
if it seems shallow to care about my appearance. My work is taken
seriously regardless of how I look.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's paintings _ vibrant Expressionist images of male and
female figures depicted in orgiastic abandon _ have been snapped up
by the blue-chip Gagosian Gallery, which is planning a show at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Emin, 36, whose best-known work is a tent inscribed with
the names of all the people she has slept with, extends the
provocative themes of her art to her wardrobe. ``When I go out, I
show an amazing amount of cleavage because I've got really nice
breasts, and it makes me feel glamorous,'' Ms. Emin said. A
resident of London, she will have a show at the Lehmann Maupin
Gallery in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, as she worked in her studio on a tapestry
emblazoned with the words ``Psycho Slut,'' she was dressed in a
low-cut lingerie top beneath an open red cardigan.``If I was in
denial about my sexuality, I'd be in denial about aspects of my
work, which deals with personal revelations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Preening in daring decolletage, Ms. Emin may be one of the more
uninhibited of today's young artists. But others are also creating
sexually provocative, or insistently feminine, work that they say
reflects their personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Gage, 30, a former assistant to an editor at Vogue, wore
an Ann Demeulemeester skirt with Gucci bag to the opening of
``Another Girl,'' where her photographs are on view. In her work,
she depicts the stereotypical popular girl in high school _
beautiful, mysterious, full of potential, slightly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Grannan, 29, another artist in the show, pays young women
$50 to pose any way they like. The majority chose a state of
undress, which Ms. Grannan attributes to a confidence in their
sexuality, rather than any misguided sense of exhibitionism. ``Like
strippers, they're making money and know what they're doing,'' she
said. ``Women today are much smarter. We get pleasure from looking
sexy.''

OLMOS URGES THE NATION'S EDITORS TO LOOK AT DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Edward James Olmos, the 52-year-old actor,
producer and community activist, urged the nation's newspaper
editors meeting here this week to wake up and see the diversity
that is changing the world around them.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the country is facing the 21st century
ill-prepared to understand its own cultural diversity, Olmos told a
gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Thursday
that ``what makes this country strong is not economic might, not
military might.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. What makes it strong is that all these beautiful,
wonderful cultures live here. And what are we doing? Heading into
the 21st century with English only.''
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel ballroom where President Clinton had just discussed
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Olmos said the United States needs
to address its own ethnic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos maintained that these problems are part of the larger
culture that newspapers and their predominantly white editors
operate in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so `not in tune' with cultural diversity ... that
you're going to consider me a racist for the next statement I make:
This country still believes, still believes, that Jesus Christ has
blond hair and blue eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Emmy-winning actor, director and filmmaker who was nominated
for an Academy Award for his role in ``Stand and Deliver,'' Olmos
grew up in East Los Angeles in a diverse neighborhood of Latinos,
Asians and Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Those roots have infused his work in film and theater, from his
role in Luis Valdez's musical, ``Zoot Suit,'' to ``American Me,'' a
movie that Olmos directed and starred in and made to deter Latino
youngsters from joining gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in East L.A., he said, taught him to believe that the
world is not a melting pot but ``a beautiful, beautiful salad bowl
... the lettuce stayed the lettuce and the onion stayed the onion.
It was all tossed and it was gorgeous and would taste real good.''
</P>
<P>
   But he later found that wasn't true in all parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In West Los Angeles, the olive was still the olive and the
onion was still the onion, but they were all in separate parts of
the plate,'' Olmos said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 riot that followed the acquittal of white police
officers in the beating of black motorist Rodney King changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in 1999 in Los Angeles, the salad is tossed, and we're
having one hell of a time trying to cope with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opening his speech with a few words of Spanish, Olmos drew
laughs when he told the audience, ``For those of you that are
Spanish impaired, welcome to California's English only.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he challenged the audience to come up with one American
hero of Asian ancestry. Only one name came up, that of Sen. Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii _ although most of the audience didn't agree he
was a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos said that perception is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one person of color ever elevated to that (hero)
status,'' he said. ``If it weren't for Martin Luther King, there
would be no one ... and then we wonder why we're in the shape we're
in.''

THIN IN A DEN OF FAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., April 18) 
(jt) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I feel testosterone surging through my veins,''
said Susan Sistrom, a doll-size woman engulfed in a swelling pool
of portly men at Sparks Steak House in midtown on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the Yankees are going to show up,'' said Patricia
Marx, also a pretty, tiny person.
</P>
<P>
   The two were waiting to be seated with six other small women at
this temple of beef _ where both portions and patrons tend to be
oversize _ for, of all things, a ``skinny dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sistrom and Ms. Marx, writers for The New Yorker (Ms.
Sistrom under the name Susan Orlean), conduct ``skinny'' meals with
groups of weight-savvy wits who gorge on bons mots, not bonbons, to
siphon their secrets for staying thin. A series of ``skinny
lunches'' are the basis of their new book, ``The Skinny'' (Dell,
$9.95), a guide to help women stay thin whatever their genetic
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   After 200 pages, their astonishing conclusion: eat less. Even if
that means Diet Cokes and cigarettes for the first 10 hours of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   At the table, the thunder of boisterous men and knives scraping
against plates was tuned out. Girl talk was tuned in. ``I'm
starving, may I be so bold to say?'' said Sara Nelson, an editor at
Self. As she nibbled on a roll, her face pinkened with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marx and Ms. Sistrom baited their guests with topics of
obsessiveness, from the merits of predawn workouts to food
poisoning: good or bad? No weight issue was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed pregnancy. ``You want to wear a sign that says,
`Pregnant, not fat,''' Ms. Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   And how Frenchwomen stay thin. ``Cigarettes, small portions and
a lot of sex,'' Ms. Sistrom said. Ms. Marx added, ``Instead of
eating, they're putting expensive skin products on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the unsavory subject of sticking your finger down your
throat. ``Since when did that become diagnosed as illness?'' asked
Cynthia Kling, a contributing editor at Harper's Bazaar, who had
oatmeal for breakfast and a sinus pill for lunch. ``We worship
you,'' Ms. Marx said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the women, in a room renowned for its salty
sirloins, had to order dinner. Ms. Sistrom asked for broiled shrimp
and lobster without the butter sauce. ``I can do it for you, but no
taste,'' the waiter said. They compromised on a dab of butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juice is stupid,'' said Irene Sax, a restaurant reviewer for
The Daily News. To which Ms. Kling added, ``You know, fat people
drink juice.''
</P>
<P>
   After a round of dry salads and asparagus, the main courses
arrived. Atop the white tablecloths and white plates was a lot of
white and green food: Chilean sea bass, trout and broccoli. Ms.
Sistrom eyed the steamed broccoli and spinach before Wendy
Sarasohn, a realty executive. ``I didn't know it was a la carte,''
she said. ``I'm feeling competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the women cleaned their plates, the confessions became more
difficult to digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm thin,'' said Ms. Sistrom, who stood up and modeled
her baggy blue schoolgirl Romeo Gigli dress, ``it makes me feel
powerful and strong and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should carry a gun,'' Ms. Marx suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful, skinny types do not linger. By 11 p.m., the women were
filing out.
</P>
<P>
   The waiter, seeming distressed, called out, ``The next time you
come, order dessert, ladies, and don't talk so much of fat.'' No
one flinched.
</P>
<P>
   Parting, Muffin Humes, an editor at Conde Nast Traveler,
complained to Ms. Sistrom that she hadn't had a chance to talk to
her. ``You were so thin you were invisible,'' she said to Ms.
Sistrom, who glowed.

CASH TRIBUTE SHOWS US THE MAN INSIDE THE ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
``ALL STAR TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY CASH'' 
On: TNT 
Time: Sunday, 8 and 10 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Cash, known to millions as the Man in Black, has scored a
unique triple crown. The twangy, socially-conscious singer is the
only artist to have been inducted into the Country Music Hall of
Fame, the Rock Hall of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that ``All Star Tribute to Johnny
Cash'' on TNT draws acts from many corners of the music industry.
Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Dave Matthews, Emmylou Harris, Willie
Nelson, Wyclef Jean, and Cash's old running mate, Kris
Kristofferson were some of the performers who traveled to New York
City for the live concert tribute.
</P>
<P>
   From his breakthrough rockabilly days in Memphis in the '50s, to
his daring covers of songs by Springsteen and Soundgarden in later
years, Cash, now 67, has never stood still. As Springsteen tells
him: ``You took the social consciousness from folk music, the
gravity and humor from country music, and the rebellion from rock
'n' roll, and taught all of us young guys that not only was it all
right to tear up these lines and boundaries, but it was important,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The program was taped April 6 at the Hammerstein Ballroom _ an
ornate setting and staging for a simple, down-home legend like
Cash, but the performances are generally magical. After the stars
are through singing his songs, Cash appears for his first public
performance in 19 months since a spokesman revealed that he has
Parkinson's disease, a chronic progressive disease that affects the
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, I'm Johnny Cash,'' says the legend himself, then he's
off and running with remarkable poise through his famed ``Folsom
Prison Blues'' and ``I Walk the Line,'' for which he's joined by
the entire cast. He personally walks around and greets each and
every one in a heartfelt gesture that speaks volumes. Cash then
tells them that he's ``astonished by the stretch of the lyrics''
and the great arrangements that these artists have given his songs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he's right. The show is a winner from the start when
Sheryl Crow and Nelson rock through ``Jackson,'' then are followed
by Chris Isaak doing early Cash nuggets ``I Guess Things Just
Happen That Way'' and ``Get Rhythm.'' The backing band throughout
is the Mavericks, and if you love country music, that should tell
you everything right there. Cash's songs are given the bite that
they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   MC Jon Voight looks out of place in a tuxedo and scarf, but he
skillfully introduces performers on a night that builds to a
festive celebration. Taped segments are sent from U2 (a performance
of ``Don't Take Your Guns to Town'' in a Dublin studio), Dylan
(``Train of Love''), and a solo acoustic Springsteen (an
awe-inspiring ``Give My Love to Rose'').
</P>
<P>
   In-house highlights are a Matthews/Harris duet on ``Long Black
Veil'' (not written by Cash, but often identified with him), Lyle
Lovett on the bluegrassy ``Tennessee Flattop Box,'' Wyclef Jean
with an edgy, hip-hop/country version of the dark ``Delia's Gone,''
and Kristofferson on ``The Ballad of Ira Hayes,'' about the
mistreatment of the Native American who helped raise the flag at
Iwo Jima.
</P>
<P>
   The song confirms Cash's social conscience, as does documentary
footage showing his support of battered women's shelters, a home
for autistic children, and a burns research center. (Luther
Perkins, Cash's original guitarist, died from burns received from a
fire in 1958.) So we see Cash the artist, but we also see Cash the
man _ and there's no hall of fame big enough to contain this side
of him.

WESTERN `THE JACK BULL' FINDS A HOME ON THE HBO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Tonight refers to Saturday, April 17)  
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Except for when Clint Eastwood turns his attention
to the genre, as he did in the Oscar-winning ``Unforgiven,'' it
seems that westerns _ good ones, that is _ &UR;  &LR; have hightailed it to
cable. A while back we had the clever ``Purgatory'' on TNT, and
tonight we have the morality tale ``The Jack Bull'' on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack as horse dealer Myrl Redding, ``The Jack
Bull'' is the story of a man obsessed with extracting what he sees
as the justice due him when he is wronged _ and the consequences he
pays for it.
</P>
<P>
   Redding has run afoul of Henry Ballard (L.Q. Jones), the local
cattle baron who has been buying up property in the area fearing
that the Wyoming Territory's bid in the 1880s for statehood will
interfere with his commerce. Redding, who sees statehood as
inevitable, is indifferent at first, but when challenged by
Ballard, sides with those for statehood. This marks him in
Ballard's eyes, and later when Redding is taking his animals to
market, Ballard imposes a fee to cross his newly acquired land,
which is the shortest route.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking funds, Redding is forced to leave two of his beloved
stallions as collateral. When he returns to reclaim his horses,
Redding finds that they have been abused and that his Indian ranch
hand has been beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   After confronting Ballard, he refuses to take the horses back
until the animals are returned to their former healthy state. He
files a petition with the local judge about his case, but the
justice, who is in the pocket of Ballard, won't hear it. Like a
bull, Redding continues charging, until tragedy results and events
take on a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The handsomely filmed ``The Jack Bull'' was written by Cusack's
father, Dick Cusack, and is based on the German writer Heinrich Von
Kleist's novel ``Michael Kohlhass,'' which was originally a Saxon
legend. By setting ``The Jack Bull'' in a Wyoming on the verge of
statehood, political considerations come into play. Statehood
advocates such as the governor see the Ballard-Redding dispute as
an embarrassment, showing that Wyoming is not ready to join the
Union. Justice, eventually, is tinged with expediency.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Badham (``Point of No Return''), ``The Jack
Bull'' is a finely crafted, entertaining film with a strong cast.
Cusack is an actor who projects a likability with an edginess that
serves him well as Redding, an easygoing, honest man with a dark
intensity. And John Goodman is particularly notable as Judge
Tolliver, who eventually is given the case and tries to make
Solomonic sense of what has become a twisted affair.

MICROSOFT BECOMES THE LATEST PLAYER IN WIDE-OPEN FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trust me, it only seems like every technology
company in America has come out recently with its own proposed
software to allow you to buy, rent and download music (and
ultimately video) from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T owns a2b. IBM just announced the Madison Project. Apple is
coming out with QuickTime 4.0. RealNetworks came out with its
next-generation G2 media player. The Recording Industry Association
of America has been pursuing its one-size-fits-all Secure Digital
Music Initiative. And don't forget Liquid Audio, Net fave MP-3
format, and a raft of lesser-known companies with their own
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   All this interest suggests that someone thinks there's a market
here to be tapped. That usually means one thing: Microsoft wants to
control it.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the Big Byte in Redmond, Wash., jumped back into
the fray with the release of the latest ``beta'' version of its
multimedia software, now rather grandly called Windows Media
Technologies 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   To show it off, the company held a big bash _ fittingly on the
Sunset Strip in the heart of the entertainment capital of the
universe _ at the House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft poobah Bill Gates addressed the mostly full house by
video while Will Poole, marketing head of the company's new
streaming technologies group, and senior vice president Bill
Allchin did live comparisons of the player, more or less helped by
slightly woozy rock drummer Mick Fleetwood.
</P>
<P>
   To inject some real entertainment into the evening, bluesman
Buddy Guy delivered a typically knockout show afterward, all of it
being videotaped and Netcast using the player.
</P>
<P>
   The technology itself holds much promise because it tries to be
a can opener of digital media, handling virtually everything audio
and video, whether it is streamed stuff like Internet ``radio'' and
video, or downloadable files such as songs and programs you would
keep on your computer hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has added ``digital rights management,'' which
allows musicians and producers to control who uses their online
material and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical area our customers have been asking for,''
Allchin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tied to that is a new system to allow online pay-per-view
events, such as those by Titan Sports' World Wrestling Federation,
which has been selling events online for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Allchin also claimed that the new player offers ``unmatched
video'' at any download speed from less than a 28.8 kbps modem on
up. In other words, the player scales nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our pay-per-view buyers are 28.8 (kbps modem users),''
said Titan's senior vice president of new media, Bob Mitchell.
``With the new release, they can expect to see a much better
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: pretty good so far, though you should never
completely trust demos from a company caught red-handed faking
video evidence in its antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   But its downloadable files sound as good as MP-3s while taking
up about half as much room. And with streaming technology, it
sounds much fuller and richer than the RealNetworks G2 player at
the same streaming rates, and much closer to the original
.wav-formatted file taken from a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Creating media with the player is still a pain for producers,
however, said David Hutchinson, senior manager and director of
operations for CityInteractive, a Toronto-based music, fashion and
culture site that is a content partner with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a programming perspective, the G2 has intelligent
streaming'' that figures out the best level of compression to use
when sending a browser some content, Hutchinson said. ``You still
have to encode on three or four different streams with the MSN
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The player will have plenty of competition. But unlike all those
other formats, this player has one big advantage: It's going to be
part of the basic operating system for the dominant computer
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's from the maker of Windows, it won't work for Mac,
Unix and Linux users (while the G2 does). But all those Windows
users out there can add it to their system with a quick pair of
70-kilobyte downloads from Microsoft's home site.
</P>
<P>
   The fat lady may not be singing online yet, but she's definitely
warming up just offstage. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bonjour, Mademoiselle
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of parties on the Sunset Strip, women's magazine
Mademoiselle showcased itself Wednesday night at post-modern
ironist hotel the Standard as the journal continues to evolve a
reformed look that explicitly connects its readers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As of February's issue, every feature now has a little
``mlle.link'' at the bottom of the page that provides other
information, a different viewpoint, a playful tangent or some other
connection to the story at hand, said editor in chief Elizabeth
Crow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was spending a lot of time on the Web and it occurred to me
that any magazine that tried to be the only magazine or source of
information for a reader was digging its own grave,'' said Crow.
``To expect anyone to get all her information from my magazine was
unrealistic. The Internet is a perfect complement to what we do,
however.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow will accelerate her approach in the June issue, when not
only every feature, but every page of the magazine will have a
mlle.link sending readers onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can send the reader anywhere,'' Crow said of the links.
``The idea is to add depth and richness to a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the links send readers to sites run by
Mademoiselle's own site, or those of parent company Conde' Nast,
such as Epicurious, Phys and Swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most are actually refreshingly offbeat and oblique in their
selections, such as the one for a piece about Keri Russell of the
TV show ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mlle.link points out, felicity means happiness, and if
you're interested in pursuing it, go to www.happyplace.com. Others
are somewhat more straightforward, like a piece about votive
candles with a link to a make-your-own-candles site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful way of flipping in more information,'' said
Crow. &QL;

SPECIALIST DOUBTS REPORT ON RADIOACTIVE AMMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ask Dr. Michael Kilpatrick, a top Pentagon
doctor, about a new study that says radioactive ammunition used
during the Gulf War isn't likely to cause lung cancer or other
health problems, and he says: ``It's very reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   But an internationally known radiation specialist compared the
Pentagon-sponsored study, released Thursday, to reports on nicotine
from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the reports that came out of the tobacco companies
_ and are still coming out _ that say nobody has ever proven
tobacco is harmful,'' said Rosalie Bertell, president of the
International Institute of Concern for Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Pentagon treats depleted uranium the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to use the stuff and they don't want people saying
it's hazardous,'' Bertell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ammunition containing depleted uranium was used for the first
time in combat in the 1991 Gulf War. It was fired by U.S. Air Force
jets and Army tanks, but the Pentagon did not warn American
soldiers that its dust and debris were radioactive and chemically
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the process of enriching
uranium for use in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Depleted uranium ammunition is made from a radioactive and toxic
metal that is twice as dense as lead. It rips through tanks, the
Pentagon says, ``like a hot knife through butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Many veterans worry that the illnesses that plague them today
may be linked to combat exposure to depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The new 120-page report by the Rand Corp., an independent think
tank, said health studies on depleted uranium are ``scarce,'' and
called for more research.
</P>
<P>
   But the report says Gulf War veterans have little reason for
concern about inhaling depleted uranium dust, because there is no
evidence that uranium industry workers contract lung cancer or
suffer from any other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If radiation exposure is not a problem with natural uranium,
it's not going to be a problem with depleted uranium, which is 40
percent less radioactive,'' said C. Ross Anthony, one of five
authors of the Rand report.
</P>
<P>
   The group based its findings on reviews of 215 documents,
including military reports, industrial medicine journals and
conference proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said the risks posed by depleted uranium's chemical
toxicity _ it is nearly twice as dense as lead _ are identical to
the hazards posed by uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the body is ``amazingly efficient at clearing
alien substances,'' such as depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   After an individual inhales depleted uranium dust, 75 percent of
the substance is exhaled, the report said. Of the 25 percent
retained in the lungs, most is cleared by the upper respiratory
system or excreted through the gastrointestinal tract.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction enters the bloodstream, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The body's ability to expel depleted uranium was one of the
reasons why Kilpatrick called the report reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   But Bertell said health studies on uranium exposure aren't
relevant to a discussion of the risks of depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon has created a new toxic material,'' Bertell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depleted uranium dust is not the same as uranium dust. It
becomes a ceramic _ like a little piece of glass _ when it is fired
on the battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertell said a British study showed that depleted uranium is
retained in the lungs for two years _ twice as long as uranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also stored in the lymph nodes, the liver, the kidneys,
the muscle and the bone,'' she said. ``It's radioactive. Anyplace
it is stored it can do damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a pilot study last year, Bertell found depleted uranium in
the urine of several Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say depleted uranium sits in the body for eight years and
doesn't do anything is beyond belief,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertell also challenged Rand's focus on cancer deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk of a fatal lung cancer is the only risk they accept
as important,'' she said. ``What about looking at the risk of a
depressed immune system or of neurological damage? If they don't
look, they're not going to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertell said researchers would probably have to wait 50 years to
find lung cancer deaths among Gulf War veterans. But they're likely
to find other disabling lung disorders much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority will have fibrosis _ in which the lung tissue
loses the ability to stretch and contract, and hardens _ and
necrosis _ in which the tissue dies,'' she said. ``Those people
will be suffering from emphysema and other lung diseases.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS DUCKS ACTION ON BALKAN WAR
 &HT;    For release Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than three weeks after the first U.S. missiles
began exploding in Yugoslavia, Congress has yet to take a clear
stand on the escalating conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Following a pattern set only in recent history, President
Clinton has exercised his power as commander-in-chief without
asking Congress for permission to send U.S. forces into combat.
</P>
<P>
   And while lawmakers pummeled the administration last week with
complaints about the strategy and goals of the NATO air war, they
have been content to leave the war-making decisions to the
president, while promising to pay the bills later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Constitution's statement that ``the Congress shall
have the Power ... to declare War,'' House Majority Whip Tom Delay,
R-Texas, said of the Balkan fighting: ``It's the president's war.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is rich with irony. Just a few months ago, the
House voted to impeach Clinton, and half the senators voted for
removing him from office. Now both chambers have yielded the
president unchallenged power to conduct the biggest war in Europe
in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   One of the House managers in the impeachment trial, Rep. Steve
Buyer, R-Ind., recently urged Clinton to consider the use of ground
troops against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does decide to use ground troops, that may provoke
formal consideration of the Balkan conflict on Capitol Hill.
Lawmakers are already planning for an emergency spending bill to
pay for the operation, estimated to cost $1 billion a month.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said last week it was
``too soon'' to take up a full debate on the military operation,
however. Instead, congressional leaders sent a fact-finding
delegation to Europe this weekend to inspect military bases and
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   Such congressional reluctance to take a position on military
missions has long concerned former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind. Before
retiring in 1998, he tried, with little success, to force
colleagues to take a stand when troops were sent into hostile
regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the Congress are no profiles in courage when it
comes to issues of war and peace,'' said Hamilton, a former
chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer to let the president make the decision. ... If the
president's decision turns out to be right, they applaud it. If it
turns out to be wrong, they criticize it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence of all this is that Congress gives up its
power to the president,'' he continued. ``It says, 'We really don't
want to participate in it. We don't want the burden of it. We don't
want to make the tough decisions. We'll leave it to you.' So the
Congress over a period of years has ceded enormous power to the
president on the most critical issue that the nation confronts _
the war issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The rare exception was the Persian Gulf war. In that case,
President Bush ordered a huge military buildup, and then sought
authorization from Congress before pushing Iraq's invading army out
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Clinton has ordered an invasion of Haiti, a
bombing campaign against Iraq, and now the Balkan war, all without
formal authorization from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few members have raised objections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., last week dusted off the
long-ignored War Powers Act, under which Congress must either vote
authorization for keeping troops in a hostile region or require the
president to order them home. And Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
reiterated his long-held position that ``Congress should assume
their constitutional responsibility, and that is, not allow the
president to wage war without congressional approval.''
</P>
<P>
   This position has few backers, however. Congress's
constitutional power to declare war has become a ``dead letter,''
said Hamilton, noting that the last time that happened was during
World War II. ``And we've had a lot of wars since then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Sen. Bob
Smith, R-N.H., locked onto Defense Secretary William Cohen. ``Are
we at war?'' he demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are engaged in open hostilities with the forces in the
field of President (Slobodan) Milosevic'' of Yugoslavia, Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems to me that's an act of war,'' Smith said. He posited the
idea of introducing a declaration of war in the Senate, although he
said the vote would be 100-0 against it.
</P>
<P>
   The next serious action on the Balkan operation will come when
Congress considers the administration's request for additional
funding. But even then, the lawmakers may skirt the issue of
whether they approve of the war. Some of the harshest critics have
declared they will vote for the extra spending as an expression of
support for the troops.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the big dispute over Clinton's planned $4 billion
supplemental request is whether it's high enough, since many
Republicans want to give the military a much bigger increase.

gray-area approach to adolescence and adulthood, [ix]The

of view she easily comprehends.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She considers [ix]Clueless[nm] &UR; ''just entertainment,'' finds
[ix]South Park[nm] &UR; ''stupid'' and even offers her own take on why
[ix]Friends'[nm] &UR; characters have no homeys who look like her.
(''They don't want it to be a black show.'')
</P>
<P>
   She finds local news ``depressing'' and reality TV shows like
[ix]Cops[nm] &UR; funny but ``kinda sad. It's real people, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   We met recently at Morningside Elementary in Fort Worth, where
her encyclopedic knowledge of the tube was equal parts amazing and
unsettling. When she speaks of programming, it's with an
understanding rare among young minds. Kids may know what they like
on [ix]Jerry Springer[nm] &UR; (the fighting) or dislike (the fighting),
but most would fumble mercilessly articulating the whys.
</P>
<P>
   Abney explains them with glee. She watches more and knows more
and ``understands'' more. What an exception. Young minds often
digest television like a vacuum swallowing dust. No analysis, no
deciphering. They believe what they see and act accordingly. They
become sponges for messages from an influential medium where profit
responsibility cancels out morality.
</P>
<P>
   Trampled in the process are the young minds, not that they have
to be. I ask Abney about media literacy and whether she'd heard
about it, and the answer is no. It's one of those vague terms that
means to analyze and assess media messages so as not to be
manipulated by them, something Abney seems to be accomplishing
without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   My time with the Morningside students, from curious
kindergartners to jaded 5th-graders, reminded me that young viewers
must arm themselves with critical observation tools to make
informed choices about media messages.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's a tricky area in an age of budget cuts and school
finance gone amok, particularly in financially struggling districts
that tend to linger at the bottom of the priority scale.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case at Azle High School just northwest of Fort
Worth, one of the few schools nationally to add to its curriculum a
course titled ``Analysis of Visual Media.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marchand, a teacher turned ad man turned teacher, handles
the course. ``Media literacy,'' he says, ``is the ability to
assess, analyze, evaluate and produce media in a variety of
forms.''
</P>
<P>
   It means his students learn to read and interpret and evaluate
the images, words and sounds that make up our contemporary mass
media culture.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand's first step is cultivating awareness, followed by
teaching critical-viewing skills. His thing is that when we as
television viewers learn to ask questions about what we see, when
we recognize and defuse the effects of commercials and media
violence, and when we intentionally evaluate program content, we
are on the road to being media-literate.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand understands this because he spent a decade in
advertising and knows how messages are deliberately pieced together
for a desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand and other educators are saying it's not enough to read
and write; youth must be able to communicate in a variety of media.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's important to try not to present one side or
another,'' he adds. ``They need to understand that what we want to
give them is the tools to make their own analysis of the media
messages they encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand and his students recently took a look at the media
coverage of Kosovo, asking, among other things, about the
possibility of censored news. ``It was a pretty lively
discussion,'' says Marchand.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher knows some things will stick with students, some won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he adds, ``enough will stick that they will
become a more perceptive consumer, whether in general or on
specific issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the class discussion on the subject of stereotypes, using
Fox's [ix]The PJs,[nm] &UR; an animated half-hour about life in the
housing projects, as launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yeah, [ix]The PJs.[nm] &UR; That's certainly one Abney could have
sunk her teeth into.

 &HT;    Sotheby's to auction `extraordinary' Whitney collection
 &HT;    By Shannon Donnelly
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people know how to live.
</P>
<P>
   Jock and Betsey Whitney were two of them. Homes at the finest
addresses in Manhattan, Saratoga, London, and Manhasset; a
plantation/hunting lodge in Thomasville, Ga.; fine furnishings and
decorative pieces; and an assemblage of paintings and sculpture
considered by many experts to be the finest private collection in
the
</P>
<P>
   world.
</P>
<P>
   Property from the estates of Ambassador John H. and Betsey
(Cushing) Whitney will be offered by Sotheby's in two separate
sales, one later this month and the other in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Furnishings, decorative arts and fine art will be offered in a
six-session sale from Thursday, April 22 to Sunday, April 25. The
paintings and sculpture collection will be offered in a
single-session sale on Monday, May 10. Both auctions will take
place in Sotheby's New York salesroom.
</P>
<P>
   John Hay Whitney founded J.H. Whitney and Co., the oldest
venture capital firm in the United States, and the Whitney
Communications Corp. He was also was a social activist and
philanthropist whose John Hay Whitney Foundation was established to
combat discrimination based on race, gender and economic condition.
</P>
<P>
   He was a decorated World War II veteran and served as ambassador
to the Court of St. James from 1956 to 1960. After leaving
diplomatic service, he was editor-in-chief and publisher of the New
York Herald Tribune until 1966 and chairman of the International
Herald Tribune from 1966 until he died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Maria Cushing was one of a trio of fabled daughters of
neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing and Kate Crowell Cushing. The three
young women epitomized the beauty and style trends of their day and
were famous for making marriages to prodigiously wealthy men. Her
sisters, Barbara (``Babe'') and Mary, became Mrs. William Paley and
Mrs. Vincent Astor, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Whitney spent a lifetime collecting art, furnishings and
``objets'' with an impeccable eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Whitney had incredible taste and an extraordinary
collection,'' said Diana Brooks, chief executive of Sotheby's
Holdings. ``Was she a perfectionist? Of course she was. She had an
unusual ability to create beauty in her surroundings, placing
furniture and decorative objects imaginatively together. ... It was
effortless, welcoming and original.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those furnishings and decorative ``objets'' will be
offered during the six-session sale. Highlights from that sale
include the 1794 illuminated ``First Book of Urizen'' by William
Blake, written, etched and colored by Blake himself (estimated at
$500,000-$700,000); and a Louis XV ormolu and patinated bronze
mantel clock from the mid-18th century in the form of a rhinoceros
($150,000-$200,000).
</P>
<P>
   At her death in March 1998 at age 89, Mrs. Whitney bequeathed a
$300 million portion of her art collection to the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, D.C., and to the Museum of Modern Art in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the May 10 art auction will be the sale of
Cezanne's Rideau, Cruchon et Compotier, a still life, circa
1893-94.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moffett, co-director of Sotheby's Department of
Impressionist and Modern Art, called it ``one of the
</P>
<P>
   greatest still lifes by the greatest still-life painter of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Executed during the peak of the artist's career, it is one of
the most important Cezannes to be offered at auction in years. The
work, which has been in the Whitney family for more than 50 years,
is expected to sell for between $25 million and $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another offering, George Seurat's L'Ile de la Grande Jatte, is
the only major image relating to Seurat's most famous work that
remains privately owned. It is one of two large final works
preceding Un Dimanche a la Grand Jatte, Seurat's masterpiece, now
at the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Executed over a five-year period beginning in 1894, the Seurat
also is expected to bring between $25 million and $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The May 10 sale also includes two works by Picasso, both
acquired in 1968 from the collection of Gertrude Stein. Le Journal
was executed in 1912 during the high period of analytical cubism.
It is expected to bring $4 million to $6 million. Verre, Bouteille
Rhum Pailee, Compotier sur une Table, is an early synthetic cubist
work executed in 1914. It is estimated at $5 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include Gustave Courbet's The Hound from ``The
Burial at Ornans'' ($1 million-$1.5 million) and Berthe Morisot's
Cache-Cache, one of the artist's most recognizable images ($1.8
million- $2.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   The pre-sale exhibition begins at 1 p.m. Saturday and continues
through noon on Thursday, April 22.

DODGE DURANGO IS CALLED A MID-SIZED SUV, BUT IS IN A CLASS BY
ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't call it a midsize, because the Dodge Durango
sport-utility vehicle is nearly as big as the Ford Expedition, and
can seat up to seven adults.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at DaimlerChrysler want everyone to believe it's a
midsize, so they can say that it's the biggest, roomiest and most
powerful vehicle in the midsize SUV class _ competing with the Ford
Explorer, Chevy Blazer, Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Isuzu
Rodeo, Mitsubishi Montero Sport and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But just like the Chevy Suburban, the Durango really is in a
class by itself (although the Suburban finally is getting some
competition from Ford, which will begin selling an even bigger
sport-utility this fall).
</P>
<P>
   Although it really falls midway between midsize and full-size,
the Durango does compete more against the midsize models than the
bigger ones. That's probably due in part to DaimlerChrysler's own
marketing, but it's also because the Durango really doesn't measure
up as a full-size sport-utility, except in fuel economy, which is
among the worst in either the mid- or full-size class.
</P>
<P>
   What the Durango offers is a roomier alternative to the Explorer
and others in that class without having to go to a bigger, bulkier
vehicle that might not fit into your garage or into downtown
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Built on the chassis of the Dodge Dakota pickup (which competes
in the compact pickup class, but is bigger than all of the rest ...
you get the picture), the Durango was introduced last year to
appease Dodge dealers who were clamoring for a sport-utility
vehicle. Until then, the former Chrysler Corp. had been satisfied
to let its Jeep-Eagle dealers sell its two sport-utility vehicles,
the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee, leaving Dodge dealers only
minivans and pickups in the truck segment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only a four-wheel-drive version of the Durango was
offered. But for 1999, DaimlerChrysler has introduced a
two-wheel-drive model for those who want or can afford only half a
truck. This is no slam at the manufacturer; there are people who
really don't care about four-wheel drive and don't want to pay the
roughly $2,000 extra to get it, and DaimlerChrysler is just meeting
market demand.
</P>
<P>
   Two-wheel-drive customers are common in Texas, where virtually
everything _ including the most remote farm roads _ is paved, and
there is rarely any snow on the roads. But you couldn't give one of
the two-wheel-drives away in Denver during a winter snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle for the week was the 1999 Durango SLT Plus
(base price $25,265 plus $525 transportation) with two-wheel drive
and the biggest engine in a less-than-full-size SUV (that's my
designation for the Durango).
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle's 5.9-liter Magnum V-8 ($1,085 extra) cranks out a
respectable 245 horsepower and a whopping 335 foot-pounds of
torque. Of course, you need all of that torque to get this vehicle
moving; it weighs well above two tons empty. Fill it with seven
adults and their ``stuff,'' and you've got a big load _ well above
5,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There are two smaller engines available in the Durango. The base
powerplant is a 3.9-liter V-6 with 175 horsepower and 225
foot-pounds of torque. It has adequate power for most needs,
particularly if you don't buy the optional third seat ($550).
(Without the third seat in place, middle-seat passengers get an
extra two inches of leg room.)
</P>
<P>
   The midlevel engine is a 5.2-liter V-8, rated at 230 horsepower
and 300 foot-pounds of torque. That engine is more than adequate
for just about any need; the only reason you might want the bigger
V-8 is to pull a heavy trailer.

   You won't save a lot of gas buying the smaller V-8 or even the
V-6, however. Fuel-economy ratings are 12 miles per gallon in the
city and 16 mpg on the highway for the biggest engine, but that
improves only one mpg with the smaller V-8, to 13 city/17 highway.
And surprisingly, the V-6 is only slightly better at 15 city/18
highway.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ Military developments on Kosovo:
Heavy bombing overnight that NATO claims was one of the most
successful nights of the campaign. Other developments.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SCENE (Urosevac, Serbia) _ The evidence of ``ethnic
cleansing'' here in Kosovo is written upon the doorposts of their
houses and upon their gates. On the streets of this quiet, modest
city in southern Kosovo, many doors and storefronts bear a
spraypainted Christian cross with a Cyrillic ``C'' in each quadrant
_ a widely understood sign that the owners and occupants are Serbs.
By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-VOICES (White Plains, N.Y.) _ For all the wrenching
scenes of Kosovo refugees and burning buildings, of starched
military men talking damage assessment, of monochromatic video
clips of exploding targets, the bombing campaign against Yugoslavia
was beginning to fade to a remote concern for many people. Now, the
news that up to 33,000 reservists may be called up to reinforce
attacks on the Serbs, a portent of widening American involvement,
has once again brought the war into sharp focus. By Susan Sachs.

election with 73.8 percent of vote. By John F. Burns.

1996. By Don Van Natta Jr.

   MINN-VENTURA (St. Paul) _ In his first three months of office,
Governor Ventura, the former professional wrestler known for
fighting in a pink boa, has managed to offend, annoy and outrage
plenty of Minnesotans _ but win the cheers of most. ``For as much
feathers as I've ruffled in being politically incorrect,'' the
Governor said in a recent interview, ``I get 10 to 1 letters from
people saying that's why they like me.'' By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-WELFARE (Boston) _ A year out, the vast majority of
Massachusetts people who get off welfare and stay off find modest
improvements in their earnings and are able to stay employed,
despite dire predictions that the early gains of the welfare
overhaul would not last, according to a report released Friday that
is the most detailed study of the effects of welfare in a state
with some of the toughest laws. By Carey Goldberg.

eggs but failed to tell anyone because he did not think the

policy today, denouncing protectionism and arguing that pockets of
workers sometimes had to suffer in order for the national economy
to grow stronger. Greenspan did not directly address the biggest
question on the trade agenda, the possible entry of China into the
World Trade Organization. But he cited rising protectionist
sentiment as one of the biggest threats to the long-term economic
health of the United States, and suggested that any steps to reduce
trade barriers, even if not fully reciprocated, would have
substantial benefits. By Richard W. Stevenson.

UNDATED: city/18 highway. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This vehicle is roomier than the segment-leading Explorer, and
that could be a big plus for folks with lots of kids and soccer
equipment to haul. Seven adults can be seated adequately in the
Durango, although the third seat is more suited to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Ride and handling are trucklike, of course, but not unpleasant.
Unlike some of the competition, such as the Grand Cherokee and
Lexus RX 300 _ the Durango is, after all, built on a truck chassis.
On smooth roads, the ride isn't bad at all; it's when you take a
Durango off-road onto bumpy jeep tracks that you begin to feel
every bump.
</P>
<P>
   Modern amenities abound, giving the Durango a carlike appearance
inside the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   All Durangos come with air-conditioning, tilt steering wheel,
cruise control, power door locks with keyless entry, power
one-touch windows, AM/FM/cassette stereo, dual front air bags, roof
rack, tinted glass, power outside mirrors, 15-inch aluminum wheels,
power rack-and-pinion steering, and a full-size spare tire.
</P>
<P>
   (The remote control for the keyless entry system has
super-sensitive buttons that I kept hitting accidentally just
taking the control out of my pocket or putting it back in. I must
have hit the ``panic button'' accidentally a couple dozen times
during the week I drove the Durango, setting off a blaring horn and
flashing the lights.)
</P>
<P>
   The Durango has power-assisted front disc, rear drum brakes with
an antilock system that works only on the rear wheels. Most of the
Durango's competitors have four-wheel antilock brakes, an important
safety feature.
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our vehicle included and optional equipment group
($2,525), which added such items as fog lights, overhead console,
floor mats, 3.92 axle ratio, automatic day/night mirror,
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo with equalizer, and a
leather-wrapped steering wheel with integrated audio controls.
Also, we had power heated fold-away outside mirrors ($75), rear
air-conditioning ($430), and a trailer-towing package ($245).
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker, including transportation, was $30,640, which is
somewhat below several comparably equipped competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tank holds 25 gallons of gasoline, and regular octane
fuel is sufficient.

<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Dodge Durango SLT Plus sport-utility
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Less-than-full-size, four-door, five- or
seven-passenger, Magnum V-8 powered, rear-drive sport-utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: New for 1999 is the first two-wheel-drive Durango.
The 5.9-liter Magnum V-8 has more power than most people will ever
need; interior is roomy; ride is comfortable on smooth roads; price
is competitive against smaller midsize SUVs.
</P>

ARMING CHILDREN TO FIGHT OFF ASSAULT OF MASS MEDIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Age 10, with a TV IQ noticeably higher than average. That's
Abney, round-faced and pig-tailed, feisty and inquisitive. This
much is apparent the moment she opens her mouth, the moment she
begins to rattle off the television programming she digests on a
daily basis. How it excites her and intrigues her, saddens her and
angers her.
</P>
<P>
   She likes ``The Smart Guy'' for its easily identifiable
messages, ``Moesha'' for its gray-area approach to adolescence and
adulthood, ``The Hughleys'' for its comical musings on race and
class from a point of view she easily comprehends.
</P>
<P>
   She considers ``Clueless'' ``just entertainment,'' finds ``South
Park'' ``stupid'' and even offers her own take on why ``Friends'''
characters have no homeys who look like her. (''They don't want it
to be a black show.'')
</P>
<P>
   She finds local news ``depressing'' and reality TV shows like
``Cops'' funny but ``kinda sad. It's real people, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   We met recently at Morningside Elementary in Fort Worth, where
her encyclopedic knowledge of the tube was equal parts amazing and
unsettling. When she speaks of programming, it's with an
understanding rare among young minds. Kids may know what they like
on ``Jerry Springer'' (the fighting) or dislike (the fighting), but
most would fumble mercilessly articulating the whys.
</P>
<P>
   Abney explains them with glee. She watches more and knows more
and ``understands'' more. What an exception. Young minds often
digest television like a vacuum swallowing dust. No analysis, no
deciphering. They believe what they see and act accordingly. They
become sponges for messages from an influential medium where profit
responsibility cancels out morality.
</P>
<P>
   Trampled in the process are the young minds, not that they have
to be. I ask Abney about media literacy and whether she'd heard
about it, and the answer is no. It's one of those vague terms that
means to analyze and assess media messages so as not to be
manipulated by them, something Abney seems to be accomplishing
without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   My time with the Morningside students, from curious
kindergartners to jaded fifth-graders, reminded me that young
viewers must arm themselves with critical observation tools to make
informed choices about media messages.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's a tricky area in an age of budget cuts and school
finance gone amok, particularly in financially struggling districts
that tend to linger at the bottom of the priority scale.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case at Azle High School just northwest of Fort
Worth, one of the few schools nationally to add to its curriculum a
course titled ``Analysis of Visual Media.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Marchand, a teacher turned ad man turned teacher, handles
the course. ``Media literacy,'' he says, ``is the ability to
assess, analyze, evaluate and produce media in a variety of
forms.''
</P>
<P>
   It means his students learn to read and interpret and evaluate
the images, words and sounds that make up our contemporary mass
media culture.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand's first step is cultivating awareness, followed by
teaching critical-viewing skills. His thing is that when we as
television viewers learn to ask questions about what we see, when
we recognize and defuse the effects of commercials and media
violence, and when we intentionally evaluate program content, we
are on the road to being media-literate.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand understands this because he spent a decade in
advertising and knows how messages are deliberately pieced together
for a desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand and other educators are saying it's not enough to read
and write; youth must be able to communicate in a variety of media.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's important to try not to present one side or
another,'' he adds. ``They need to understand that what we want to
give them is the tools to make their own analysis of the media
messages they encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand and his students recently took a look at the media
coverage of Kosovo, asking, among other things, about the
possibility of censored news. ``It was a pretty lively
discussion,'' says Marchand.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher knows some things will stick with students, some won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' he adds, ``enough will stick that they will
become a more perceptive consumer, whether in general or on
specific issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the class discussion on the subject of stereotypes, using
Fox's ``The PJs,'' an animated half-hour about life in the housing
projects, as launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yeah, ``The PJs.'' That's certainly one Abney could have
sunk her teeth into.

 &HT;    MANY TEXANS FEELING AT HOME ON U.S. HELICOPTER CARRIER
 &HT;    With Photo.

 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE U.S.S. INCHON OFF ALBANIA _ Like about 60 percent of
the seamen and women aboard this helicopter carrier, U.S. Navy Cook
David Spencer is a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   When Spencer and the 1,064 others aboard the U.S.S. Inchon left
their home port in Corpus Christi on March 1, they thought they
were heading for the Persian Gulf for a mine-hunting exercise.
Hunting and sweeping mines is what the Inchon does best.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, the Inchon was anchored in the eastern Mediterranean
Sea waiting to pass through the Suez Canal. The next day, the ship
was ordered by the Pentagon to turn around and head for the
Adriatic off Albania to use its 10 giant mine-sweeping helicopters
to haul food to Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was a little skeptical because I couldn't figure
out why we were changing our mission,'' said Spencer, 36, of
Longview, Texas. ``But now I feel really good about it. We are
doing something for America and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer awakens every day at 4:30 and helps cook a 7 a.m.
breakfast for the helicopter pilots and other officers. ``As soon
as we finish breakfast, we start lunch. And then after that, it's
dinner. The job is not really difficult, but it gets monotonous.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spencer and others, this ship is almost like a floating
piece of Texas. Whenever the ship lands in port, says Capt. Kurt
Garbow of Ingleside, Texas, the executive officer, ``We unfurl this
humongous Texas flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they steam out of port, the ship's public address
system plays ``The Yellow Rose of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is kind of glad we are out here,'' said Petty Officer
3rd Class Clenzo Kitchen, 21, of Houston, who is an aviation
electronics technician. ``Americans are really helping someone. And
we are getting to practice our secondary mission, which is heavy
lifting.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why so many people from Texas ended up serving on the
Inchon, Petty Officer 1st Class Scotty Morton, 28, of Wink, Texas,
said, ``Actually, there are a lot of people from Texas throughout
the Navy. Maybe it has to do with the job situation out in the oil
fields. And of course, the fact that the Inchon is home-ported in
Texas makes it all the more attractive.''

INFLUENTIAL EDITORS PROTEST U.S. CLAMPDOWN ON KOSOVO INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton noted in his speech to
newspaper editors here the ``stark contrast between a free society
with a free press and a closed society where the press is used to
manipulate people by suppressing or distorting the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But while U.S. journalists are not being found shot dead, as one
dissident editor was this week in the Balkans, some of America's
most prominent opinion-makers are accusing the Pentagon of
kidnapping the facts on the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Pentagon this week, seven editors and bureau
chiefs of national news organizations covering the war say they are
getting far less information than they did during the Persian Gulf
War and the more recent bombing campaign in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not daring to venture back into Serbian-controlled Kosovo
without an official escort, most U.S. journalists have been
covering the war from the White House, NATO headquarters, the
Pentagon and refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the U.S. government a strategic advantage in a war
that seems to have caught the country by surprise: The flow of
information is easier to control, public opinion easier to
manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the relationship between the military and press is
under scrutiny during wartime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We of course recognize your need to withhold information that
would jeopardize ongoing military operations or endanger the lives
of individual members of the military,'' top-level editors at the
Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, NBC, Associated
Press, CNN and the Wall Street Journal wrote Defense Secretary
William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long history of cooperation between the media and
the military on this point,'' the letter continued. ``But the
current restrictions on the flow of information seem to us to go
way beyond this need.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took the podium Thursday to address the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, the crowd of about 600 editors and
writers gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's brief visit to San Francisco, which attracted
about 500 war protesters, came amid reports of deadly NATO attacks
on convoys of refugees in southwestern Kosovo. Clinton said the
civilian deaths would not deter NATO attacks. He also said the
pilots were ``dealing with an enemy ... who is willing to use
people as human shields.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attacks, which Clinton said were ``regrettable'' but
``inevitable,'' also raised questions about the accuracy of initial
Pentagon and NATO reports on the matter _ and whether Clinton was
attempting to raise a red herring by implying those refugees may
have been used as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   NATO at first had suggested the attacks on the Kosovo Albanians
were carried out by Yugoslav police, but then officials retracted
the statement. There was no evidence the refugees were being used
as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, was a really classic example of how the information
should not be passed down,'' said Ariana Huffington, a conservative
commentator who writes for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. ``They
effectively accused the Serbians of bombing the convoy to arouse
public opinion against the war. A few hours later, they had to say
it was NATO who bombed the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton was asked directly by one editor why
the military was withholding information about the war.
</P>
<P>
   The president blamed the Balkan weather and terrain, which he
said makes it more difficult to evaluate targets. And he blamed the
difficulty in getting the sprawling NATO alliance coordinated. He
said he'd already spoken with two other NATO leaders about the
information gap and promised more details would be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more information we can get out there more
quickly, the better we are,'' Clinton said. ``The assumption is
there is some deliberate scheme at work here, but I don't think
that is the case. NATO has never done this kind of operation before
and we're trying to work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike the Gulf War, said Leonard Downie Jr., executive
editor of the Washington Post, the Pentagon is not providing
specific information about the number of bombing raids, location of
targets, which raids were effective and which were not, and the
type of aircraft carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the flow of information may help the Pentagon avoid
the kind of embarrassment it experienced after the Gulf War, when
reporters discovered, for example, that military officials had
greatly overstated the effectiveness of the Patriot missile-defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Downie said Clinton actually provided some of the most specific
information of the NATO campaign during his speech Thursday. The
president said NATO had destroyed ``all of Serbia's refineries,
half of its capacity to produce ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about not giving us propaganda, which happened
during the Persian Gulf War,'' Downie said. ``But it (the
propaganda) was accompanied by a lot of specific information so you
could keep track of how well things are going. We don't even know
how many sorties, for example, ... dropped ordnance or not.''

 &HT;    REFUGEE FAMILY SIDETRACKED TO FREEDOM: 'I THOUGHT, 'OH NO, WE'RE

 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0417.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ In a hot and crowded railroad car, the
Rustemi family waited for the doors to part and freedom from
Kosovo's terror to be just down the road in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the train lurched and began to move, back into the
heart of southern Kosovo, back toward the burning cities and
villages the Rustemis and thousands more thought they had left
behind on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had high hopes. We were approaching the border and we were
going to be safe and sound,'' said Enver Rustemi, 41. ``But when we
stopped and they turned us back, I thought, 'Oh no, we're dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they and thousands more ethnic Albanians finally
escaped, again by train, and told the story of their frightening
two-day ordeal. Rustemi and his family sat on the damp ground at
Brazda refugee camp while waiting to be assigned a tent. They ate
U.S.-supplied rations, a civilian version of the army's MRE --
meals ready to eat -- their first in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Rustemi, a gas-station operator, and
his family were on the run after being forced from their home in
Urosevac. They scurried from house to house, from village to
village seeking to elude Serb forces and their mass expulsions in
the embattled Yugoslav province that have created more than 500,000
refugees in Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, low on food and traveling with six children, including
their 7-year-old daughter, Samire, and a close friend's
five-month-old baby, they decided to take a chance earlier this
week and return to their home in Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   They made it to their house, but were trapped there. Serb
snipers fired from rooftops, and nearby homes were destroyed and
smoldering.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, masked men with automatic rifles came to the door
with a menacing question. They asked Rustemi how many women were in
his house, how many on the block?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't intend to leave my house, but felt we had to . . . We
we're lucky to escape. We think they had this on their minds: Take
the women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the darkness Wednesday night, they dashed to the home of a
friend. The following morning, they made their way to the train
station in Urosevac, abandoning their Yugoslav-built car and
joining the throngs clamoring for tickets for the 25-mile trip to
the Macedonian border town of General Jankovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to leave the car there than my soul,'' Rustemi said.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Serb forces was surprisingly light. But inside
the station, there was chaos, as thousands of ethnic Albanians
sought to board the 12-car train.
</P>
<P>
   People were pushed into the cars ``like matches in boxes'' the
Rustemis said. In the confusion, some children and parents were
separated, old people were shoved. ``It brought tears to your
eyes,'' said Rustemi. ``Children were crying, people had pale
faces, ready to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the train pulled away for the hour-long trip south.
Hopes soared until, without explanation, the train arrived at the
border and was turned back.
</P>
<P>
   Again, they rose earlier on Friday morning and headed to the
station. Again, they struggled with thousands more to get aboard
the train. By 10:30 am., they were again at the border. This time,
the doors opened and they were instructed to walk down the railroad
tracks the remaining half-mile to the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   There, they boarded buses for the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born for the second time,'' Rustemi said with a broad
smile. ``At least here I can have a meal and not hear the shooting.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather will embrace the interior West from the deserts of
the Southwest to eastern Washington and Oregon on Saturday as a
ridge of high pressure spans from Baja California to western
Canada. However, cooler Pacific air will come ashore along the West
Coast, though offshore breezes may keep cool ocean air at bay along
parts of the southern California coast, thereby allowing
temperatures to rise into the 80Us. Meanwhile, milder air will
spread eastward into the Rockies on the eastern flank of the warm
ridge.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansive warm ridge covering the West, a flabby trough
of low pressure will promote cool, unsettled weather over the
Middle West and East. The focus of unsettled weather will lie from
the Ohio Valley to interior New England, where variable clouds and
scattered, occasional showers will prevail. A few of the showers
will produce gusty, fitful winds and brief modest rains, but most
of the showers will be light and relatively tame.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop in central Florida along
and just behind a front marking the leading edge of cool air
associated with the chilly trough over the East. Saturday's
combination of clouds, rain and drier air will bring a halt to the
tropical heat wave that occurred over much of the state the past
few days. Indeed, temperatures will fall into the 30s Saturday
night across parts of the panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds, patchy drizzle and isolated showers will dull the
day over the high ground of southwest Texas as moist winds from the
east are forced to ascend the sloping terrain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Opposite Extremes
</P>
<P>
   At Oceanside, Calif., a coastal town in the southern California
the mercury struggled to 55 degrees on Thursday setting a record
for the coolest April 15 on record. Meanwhile, at Escondido about
15 miles inland, a record high of 87 was reached. This striking
contrast of opposite extremes was a result of the vagaries of the
marine layer. The layer of cool and often foggy air in contact with
the cool Pacific waters drifts in and out near the shores of
California throughout the year. On summer days, the marine layer
makes 30 degree contrasts common around the California coast. &QL;

   WOMEN-ARTISTS (New York) _ Amid the crowd of 500 who flocked to
the opening of ``Another Girl, Another Planet,'' an exhibition of
photographs by and about young women, the dozen artists in the show
were as easy to spot as fireflies at dusk. With their tousled hair,
bare legs, colorful stilettos, sexy leather pants, Tracy Feith slip
dresses and beaded vintage handbags, they looked as if they had
stepped out of the fashion pages. By Elizabeth Hayt. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   FASHION-CULTURE (New York) _ One Tuesday afternoon in mid-March,
a flock of junior stylists and fashion editors debarked from a
cloud of limousines and stepped into a gallery at the World
Financial Center. Gen Art, the nonprofit organization had convened
the young selection committee for an international fashion design
competition. Devoted to showcasing young talent, Gen Art was asking
the panelists to select the finalists _ culled from design schools
and other sources _ for a glitzy fashion show to be held three
weeks later. By Bob Morris.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GO-GO-REVIVAL (Undated) _ The latest Gap ads, which had their
premieres during last month's Academy Awards telecast, have taken
something far out and made it totally in. Hold on to your feather
boas, pop culture is going ``a go-go.'' Again. Gap, the ubiquitous
San Francisco-based retailer, whose ``Khakis Swing'' ad last year
helped to make the 1940s dance revival cool, has now unleashed 15
sexy dancers who do the frug, the pony and the jerk in a
'60s-inspired spot called ``Khaki a Go-Go.'' By Frank De Caro.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-SKINNYWOMEN (New York) _ I feel testosterone surging
through my veins,'' said Susan Sistrom, a doll-size woman engulfed
in a swelling pool of portly men at Sparks Steak House in midtown
on Wednesday night. ``I feel like the Yankees are going to show
up,'' said Patricia Marx, also a pretty, tiny person. The two were
waiting to be seated with six other small women at this temple of
beef _ where both portions and patrons tend to be oversize _ for,
of all things, a ``skinny dinner.'' Ms. Sistrom and Ms. Marx,
writers for The New Yorker (Ms. Sistrom under the name Susan
Orlean), conduct ``skinny'' meals with groups of weight-savvy wits
who gorge on bons mots, not bonbons, to siphon their secrets for
staying thin. A series of ``skinny lunches'' are the basis of their
new book, ``The Skinny'' (Dell, $9.95), a guide to help women stay
thin whatever their genetic makeup. By Amanda Hesser. Photo. &QL;

<P>
   BHANGRA-BLOWOUT (Washington) _ On a Saturday night in April at
Constitution Hall, young women in long braids and shimmering,
sequined outfits sashayed onto stage, carrying water jugs and
swinging their hips to Punjabi folk songs. Young men with sky-high
turbans, some with two-headed drums whirled, leaping and heaving
their shoulders in rhythm, their arms raised to the roof. Every now
and then, dancers clasped their legs around a partner's torso and
spun at breakneck speed. At other times, they climbed atop one
another's shoulders, building human pyramids. Welcome to Bhangra
Blowout, an annual intercollegiate dance competition in which teams
from a dozen schools perform their renditions of traditional
Punjabi dance in a bid for a $1000 prize. By Somini Sengupta.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ There is much good to say about a
flower with a sunny disposition and a desire to please. In August,
when most perennials are in their summer sulk and the annual flower
garden looks a bit ratty, marigolds can be counted on to look
presentable. By Cass Peterson.

IN SEARCH OF THE NEXT CALVIN KLEIN AND COCKTAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 18) 
(DW) 
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One Tuesday afternoon in mid-March, a flock of junior
stylists and fashion editors debarked from a cloud of limousines
and stepped into a gallery at the World Financial Center. After
being ceremoniously greeted by some junior administrators and
helping themselves to grilled chicken sandwiches, they were
escorted to a long table, where there were tins of Altoids and a
score sheet and pencil at each setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like fun,'' Shyama Patel, the fashion-market editor
of New York magazine, said. ``I mean, I always wanted to be a
panelist when I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   She had come to the right place. After all, being grown up is
what Gen Art, the nonprofit organization that had convened the
young selection committee for an international fashion design
competition, is all about. Devoted to showcasing young talent, Gen
Art was asking the panelists to select the finalists _ culled from
design schools and other sources _ for a glitzy fashion show to be
held three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some reservations about what they saw, all the panelists
seemed delighted to have been asked to play Anna Wintour for the
afternoon. ``Who needs a car service?'' a Gen Art administrator
asked when it was time to depart. Of course, every hand in the room
shot up into the air.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, being an art insider was a way to flash social
cachet. Now the art world _ after Hollywood and pop music _ has
been sucked into the gravitational field of fashion. The Guggenheim
Museum runs style forums; Herb Ritts, the celebrity photographer,
gets a museum show sponsored by Donna Karan, and next month,
Creative Time, a downtown avant-garde arts presenter, is mounting a
fashion exhibition under the Brooklyn Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the stage. These days, all the world's a runway. VH-1
produces a fashion awards show for television. Victoria's Secret's
shows are broadcast on the Internet. Absolut vodka, having moved in
on fashion from the art world, has been playing runway with its
promotional collection of designer clothes for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mass market for fashion culture is at its height right
now,'' Sally Singer, the fashion editor of New York magazine, said.
``Still, fashion shows are fundamentally boring, so I expect that
in a while the general public will become as tired of them as the
editors and buyers are.'' At a moment when teen-agers distinguish
Chanel from Prada, however, she wasn't sure when that time would
come. ``You can't unlearn an awareness of fashion,'' Ms. Singer
said. ``It's like nuclear weapons: once you start you really can't
turn back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though its original mission was primarily to showcase young
artists and filmmakers, Gen Art now devotes tremendous resources to
featuring young designers in dazzling corporate-like venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion has definitely become our most successful area,'' said
Ian Gerard, who left his job as a lawyer last year to run Gen Art,
which he founded with his brother, Stefan, in 1993. ``It's the
industry we can have the most impact on.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization cites Rebecca Dannenberg and Pixie Yates as
some of the deserving talent it has presented in recent years at
well-received shows in both Los Angeles and New York. Shoshanna
Lonstein was among the ``fresh faces'' Gen Art featured in a major
runway event last fall. As a result, Ms. Lonstein, the former
girlfriend of Jerry Seinfeld, got a favorable review in Women's
Wear Daily for one of her first collections of lingerie-inspired
sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Did she need the boost so early in her career?
</P>
<P>
   Does any young designer? The senior judges at Gen Art's big,
glitzy ``Styles for the New Millennium'' show of finalists on April
6 thought so. Polly Mellen, the creative director of Allure;
Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul, and Richard Martin, the curator
of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, all
felt good about judging Gen Art's show before a young audience of
1,000 at the World Financial Center. Even if it was, in typical
grown-up-fashion style, an hour late in starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like structure,'' said Hal Rubenstein, In Style
magazine's fashion editor, another judge. ``They also like
cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising executives, lawyers, media movers and bankers, who
had paid $50 each to have an authentic runway experience, cruised
the party before the show. ``So let's face it,'' said Nelson Mui, a
sportswear and media editor at The Daily News Record, the men's
fashion trade newspaper. ``These people aren't here to see clothes.
They're here to get dates.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was time to begin. Under the glass roof of the World
Financial Center's Winter Garden court, models with their hair in
beehives for the millennium walked around for an audience that was
especially enthusiastic after the Absolut-sponsored cocktail hour.
But for all the hoopla, there was only one truly memorable dress _
made of broken record albums _ by Anne Hung, from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else was so conservative,'' said Simon Doonan,
known for his outlandishly creative displays at Barneys New York.
``It's a drag to see that that's how young people are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson was let down, too. ``Right now fashion's in a
down moment,'' she said. ``I think it's sad that design schools are
encouraging students to be so sales oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Mui said: ``It's a weird phenomenon. Everyone's looking for the
next new thing. But there's absolutely enough fashion out there
already, and these people only submitted two outfits to get into
this show in the first place. They haven't really proved themselves
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly mattered to the amateur arbiters whooping it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think I have good taste, and this stuff looked good
to me.'' Todd Roth, a real estate agent and Gen Art supporter,
said. Dino Markus, his friend, who is also in real estate,
especially liked a pair of leather pants one designer showed. ``You
just liked the girl wearing them,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Happiest of all at night's end were the founders of Gen Art.
Stefan Gerard was standing at the top of the marble steps
overlooking a mob of well-dressed young people wrapped in black
Absolut feather boas, holding gift bags and cocktails, and looking
each other over with the acquisitive eyes of shoppers at a sample
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that if I can get somebody out of a sports
bar and turn him into an art collector or a fashion investor, then
I've done something positive,'' Gerard, a strategic planner at
Young &AMP; Rubicam, the advertising agency, said. ``OK, an event like
this doesn't save needy children. Still, it helps all these people
get engaged in something above the mundane.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the Absolut bar, a woman asked Markus if he was a
model. He was pleased with the question. ``Usually if I want to
impress a woman at parties,'' he said later, ``I tell them I write
children's books.''

DESPITE L.A.'S IMAGE, ARTISTS AND SCHOLARS ARE THRIVING IN A
HOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanley Sheinbaum, the publisher of New
Perspectives Quarterly, was standing by the window lamenting the
lack of ideological commitment among Hollywood executives. ``They
give their money away purely for ego rather than because they
identify with any particular cause,'' he said, his black turtleneck
setting off his white hair.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wiener, a history professor, was waiting in line for a
sandwich and arguing about loyalty and betrayal in Washington. At
another table a discussion was starting about whether Mike Davis'
apocalyptic book on Los Angeles, ``Ecology of Fear,'' was fair to
their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   These 45 Angelenos had ventured out for their newest biweekly
tradition: a meeting of the Los Angeles Institute for the
Humanities, a group of writers, academics and intellectuals who
meet at the Faculty Center of the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   On this warm Friday they got to eat ham and turkey sandwiches
and listen to Ronald Steel, a professor and author, discuss his
forthcoming biography of Robert F. Kennedy. Also seated in the
standard-issue college dining room were Dagmar Barnouw, a
historian; Russell Jacoby, who wrote a book on public
intellectuals; the conservative columnist Arianna Huffington, and
David Schweitzer, a theater director.
</P>
<P>
   This is Los Angeles' intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like an oxymoron. After all, the notion that Los
Angeles has no brain is about as old as the city itself. Not even
its residents tend to think otherwise. ``That this city is so much
more complex than `Baywatch' is a fact too infrequently experienced
by its own residents,'' said Steve Wasserman editor of The Los
Angeles Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the city's public and private universities, a slate of
Nobel Prize winners, some of the country's most creative artistic
talent, a reservoir of scientific expertise at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, these
stereotypes were always more alive in the imagination, particularly
on the East Coast, than in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, writers and scholars are now saying that a new influx
of institutions and art museums has helped make intellectual life
more vital than in any other period in this city's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the West Side of Los Angeles there is now an intellectual
and cultural life that is easily comparable to that of New York or
Boston,'' said Davis, the historian, whose book is causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Harding, the director of the Center for the Study of
Women at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed: ``Los
Angeles intellectual life is thriving. At the same time it is less
elitist and no one is intimidated by the big names.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the seven-month-old Institute for the Humanities
there is the new Institute for Art and Cultures at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, which sponsors lectures. Over the past year
59 Americans and Europeans, like the cultural critic Elaine Scarry
and the video artist Bill Viola, have come to study at the Bel Air
campus of the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and
the Humanities. The area's universities regularly attract visiting
lecturers like the European philosophers Jacques Derrida and Jurgen
Habermas.
</P>
<P>
   Informal seminars and literary gatherings are becoming frequent
fixtures. On a recent Sunday night more than 80 people came to a
monthly literary salon at Le Coloniale, a West Hollywood
restaurant. For $20 you could get a buffet dinner and listen to
four writers read from new work. On this night DeLaune Michel,
whose one-woman show ``Southern Gothic'' played here last year, was
one of the attractions. ``There's a real desire out there to be
part of some greater literary community,'' said Charlie Otto, who
directed the reading.
</P>
<P>
   Books are a growth industry here. Last April 110,000 people
bought tickets to the third annual Los Angeles Times Book Fair.
``The greater Los Angeles area is the No. 1 book market in the
country,'' said Joseph Tosney, the regional manager of Borders
Books and Music.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the intellectuals don't try to claim that
cultivating the body never takes precedence over developing the
mind, or that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
doesn't generate more interest than the academy.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis explained, ``This city has always been dominated by a
dictatorship of the boosters who were duly intolerant of the
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's geography hasn't helped. UCLA is more than 40 miles
from the Claremont Colleges. Driving is not only time consuming,
but it also works against spontaneous meetings and discussions.
``There's a vast intellectual audience out there,'' said Ruth
Seymour, the general manager of KCRW, the National Public Radio
station in Santa Monica. ``But it's much more hermetically
sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are simply learning to work around such drawbacks. ``We do
not compete with the big gorilla,'' said Michael S. Roth, the
director of the Scholars and Seminars Program at the Getty Research
Institute, referring to Hollywood. ``We are not trying to make
money on ideas. We're here to demonstrate that ideas have
consequences on their own accord.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, technology has helped. The Southern California
Science Writers Group, frustrated by failed attempts to meet in
person, now plan to hold meetings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To what extent the isolation and narrowness is self-imposed is a
matter of debate, however. Chon Noriega, the editor of Aztlan: A
Journal of Chicano Studies, said that in a city that is 43 percent
Hispanic and 10 percent Asian the big new, largely white
intellectual institutions on the West Side ``do not represent the
population changes that have already occurred in this city.'' He
continued, ``What were once called minority writers are now on the
front lines of the new thinking about Los Angeles because it's they
who are grappling with the greatest range of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   One subject that seems to interest those inside and outside the
intellectual establishment is Los Angeles itself. ``The city is as
self-conscious about itself and generating as much literature about
itself as any other city in the world, including New York,'' said
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   If the subject matter is different here, so is the style of
discourse. Davis said there was a ``much tougher intellectual
climate in New York'' that ``arises from that city's political,
Jewish and radical traditions. Without that, it's more difficult in
a place like Los Angeles to get a harsh, critical discourse
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Winer, a former drama critic at The Times, said, ``If you
get into an argument here, people's first instinct is to smooth it
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, smoothing over isn't necessarily a bad idea. So many
people showed up for a recent 40-minute lecture by the American
painter R.B. Kitaj at the Institute for Art and Cultures that 300
of them _ including three museum trustees and the actor Michael
York _ had to be turned away amid angry complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the organizers figured out how to defuse the
lecture-hungry crowd: Pipe the lecture through a loudspeaker on the
plaza and pass out glasses of free wine. That's an idea that even a
New York intellectual could love.

   WASHINGTON _ On a Saturday night this month at Constitution
Hall, young women in long braids and shimmering, sequined outfits
sashayed onto stage, carrying water jugs and swinging their hips to
Punjabi folk songs. Young men with sky-high turbans, some with
two-headed drums whirled, leaping and heaving their shoulders in
rhythm, their arms raised to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, dancers clasped their legs around a
partner's torso and spun at breakneck speed. At other times, they
build human pyramids atop one another's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Bhangra Blowout, an annual intercollegiate dance
competition in which teams from a dozen schools perform their
renditions of traditional Punjabi dance in a bid for a $1000 prize.
At the sold-out show, students from universities like Duke, Johns
Hopkins and Massachusetts Institute of Technology filled the
3700-seat auditorium. They came to cheer on their home teams, and
to party all weekend amid the roots-seeking crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 6th year, Bhangra Blowout, organized by the South
Asian Society at George Washington University, has become a rite of
spring for the growing legions of South Asian-American college
students along the East Coast _ akin to, say, the spring break
pilgrimage that some collegians take to Fort Lauderdale or to the
streets of Atlanta, where black students gather for Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   Bhangra, a rowdy folk dance traditionally practiced by the
menfolk of Punjab, a province in India's northern farm-belt,
bhangra has been retooled by a generation of Americans growing up
far from bhangra's native soil. Bhangra, New World-style, is done
by women and men. Folk songs from the old country are remixed with
techno and hip-hop. Its signature moves are woven together with
African-American dance traditions _ namely step and breakdancing.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage the students danced to songs celebrating the Punjabi
farmer and that told tales of a young bride eager to dance. Amar
Kendale, a chemical engineering major from MIT, danced to a song
that boasted of hiding bottles of alcohol in their turbans.
</P>
<P>
   In a break before intermission, came a South Asian version of an
Ivy League tradition: Penn Masala, a men's acapella ensemble didn't
do Cole Porter standards, but came dressed in black Nehru-collared
suits and sang a medley of popular Hindi showtunes.
</P>
<P>
   What do the elders think of all this?
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the show, Reena Ninan, the evening's lithe,
sari-clad emcee, a George Washington junion, crouched low and
approached a man in the front row, one of several in the audience
who looked as though they were a few decades from their last
college midterm. ``Uncleji,'' she inquired, addressing him with the
ubiquitous honorific used to refer to an elder. ``How has bhangra
changed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better now,'' the man replied into the mike, rocking
his head in delight. ``More energy, more enthusiasm and no
inhibitions!''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle at Constitution Hall was more than a talent show.
The young bhangra enthusiasts were spinning a new collegiate
tradition, a curious mix of Indian ethnic pride and American party
fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're celebrating your culture, and then, you can get your
groove on afterward,'' said Dawinder Sidhu, 20, a University of
Pennsylvania junior, at his fourth Bhangra blowout.
</P>
<P>
   The groove is a major attraction of the weekend. The ``official
after party'' at the Old Post Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania
Avenue, drew more than 4,000 revelers, despite a $40 cover charge
at the door _ $22 in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Fades, shaved heads and turbans bobbed on the dance floor until
4 a.m. Thesalwar kameez, the long, loose outfit worn on the South
Asian subcontinent, was donned early in the evening but was shed in
favor of short skirts and strappy sandals. Inside the pavilion,
three deejays were spinning everything from hip-hop to drum and
bass.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The party organizers estimated that, all told, profits from the
competition and party would exceed $50,000, which is earmarked for
charity and a scholarship fund at George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What began in 1994 as a modest local fund-raiser in the student
cafeteria drew a dozen teams from around the country this year,
from Duke University in Durham, N.C. to Case Western University in
Cleveland and Cornell University in New York. The 12 were selected
from about 20 teams that applied, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all those onstage at Bhangra Blowout could claim bhangra
as their own motherland groove. Many of the dancers, like Pauravi
Shah of MIT, have families that came from parts of South Asia where
bhangra is as foreign as the bolero. Many of the teams this year
even attracted dancers with no roots in the Indian subcontinent at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Shah, 18, whose parents are from Gujarat, is a native of
Sugarland, Texas, and a freshman majoring in chemical engineering
at MIT. She was drawn to bhangra when she arrived on the Cambridge,
Mass., campus last fall. The MIT team had placed second in the
blowout that year, and she was hooked, though her parents had more
interest in her devoting her time to studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `I got to do bhangra,''' Miss Shah gushed after
the performance, her parrot-green salwar drenched in sweat.
``Besides, I live a thousand miles away,'' she added. ``They can't
do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Shweta Udeshi, whose parents also emigrated from Gujarat, was
oblivious to the bhangra scene while growing up in Huntington, N.Y.
In high school, she played field hockey and badminton, and served
as the treasurer of her senior class. Bhangra wasn't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I lived on Long Island there were only two Indian
people,'' Miss Udeshi, 20, a George Washington junior recalled.
``It was pretty isolating.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, her two roommates are Indian-Americans. So are her
closest friends. And this year, she is a vice president of the
campus South Asian Society, whose central project is the Bhangra
Blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Miss Udeshi concedes, is bewildered by the
insularity of her social circle. So is her younger sister, now in
high school. ``I'm like, `Just go to college, and I'll talk to you
then.'''
</P>
<P>
   That bhangra has been embraced by youngsters who are not Punjabi
has stirred debate in South Asian student circles. Some favor
authentic Punjabi tradition (``the real deal,'' is how Sidhu of
Penn describes it), while the experimentalists go for a more hybrid
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Cornell opened with a rapper. The men from Johns
Hopkins marched onstage in hooded sweatshirts and warm-up pants,
and began their number with a high-octane stepping routine before
stripping down to saronglike lungis and gleaming knee-length
kurtas.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Bhangra Blowout in Washington, authenticity was at a
premium. Many of the contestants believed that the more traditional
they were, the better they would fare with the judges, who were,
after all, Punjabi dance aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we thought the judges were judging us on,'' Miss
Shah said. ``Our goal was to teach people this is what bhangra is
in the motherland, or whatever. In India. In Punjab.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the judges gave first prize to the George Washington
team, which expertly performed a traditional routine dressed in
costumes brought from India. But the runner-up was the team from
Johns Hopkins, with its hoodies, warm-up pants and painted-on
beards.

JOHN HUGHES TAPPED INTO TEEN ANGST LIKE NO OTHER FILMMAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like all great artists, John Hughes knew whom to steal from. But
that doesn't mean he didn't have talent. He treated the misery
hidden behind the styling gel and shoulder pads of the 1980s more
profoundly than any other filmmaker. You can't watch the current
plethora of teen movies, such as ``She's All That'' or ``Cruel
Intentions'' or ``10 Things I Hate About You'' _ or for that
matter, TV's ``Dawson's Creek'' _ and not luxuriate under the
comfort of trees grown on ground he plowed and seeded. But with the
exception of Kevin Williamson, creator of ``Dawson'' as well as
``Scream'' and ``The Faculty,'' not one of Hughes' imitators can
create ache as elegantly as he did in his protagonists. Even in
``Home Alone,'' with its comforting blanket of Three Stooges and
Tex Avery-flavored violence, melodrama swells while the cartoon
souffle rises.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have figured, while sifting through the pile of
scripts that became the movies ``Mr. Mom'' and ``National Lampoon's
Vacation,'' that the writer of those pictures _ Hughes _ would go
on to become the most successful, and influential, filmmaker of the
1980s? He has written more than 20 scripts, ranging _ if you'll
pardon the expression _ from ``National Lampoon's Class Reunion''
to ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' from ``Planes, Trains and
Automobiles'' to ``Curly Sue.'' This Michigan-born boy, who moved
with his family to Chicago as a teen, made the Cook County suburbs
into the promised land. All those rich kids with triple-pleated
pants and Corvettes paid for by Daddy practiced a high-school
cruelty that was particularly American, and that every member of
Hughes' white audience understood.
</P>
<P>
   His willfulness and the combination of awkwardness,
resentfulness and sweetness first surfaced in Hughes' work for
``National Lampoon'' magazine _ specifically in the story
``Vacation '59,'' which became the movie ``Vacation.'' Although its
director, Harold Ramis, would continue to examine the anxiety of
the midlife crisis in his subsequent movies (of which ``Analyze
This'' is another example), Hughes moved in the other direction; he
made movies about younger and younger protagonists, eventually
going all the way back to the crib with ``Baby's Day Out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking their plights extraordinarily seriously was Hughes' gift.
No one before him had created a body of work that treated
adolescent crisis as if it were a tragedy disrupting the world as
the millennium nears. Yes, it's true that much of his entire
filmography was influenced by ``Alice Adams,'' the Katharine
Hepburn movie in which the good-hearted but poor protagonist was
humiliated by her social superiors. (Only we noticed, after 90
minutes of exquisite suffering, that she was their better.) But
what did it matter? His balance of sophistication and cruelty,
scored with the smartest use of contemporary music a director has
ever brought to pictures on a consistent basis, played ever so
brilliantly to an audience that felt it had never seen its own
stories on the screen before. The gasp of recognition from the teen
audiences when Judd Nelson snarled, ``When you grow up, your heart
dies'' in ``The Breakfast Club'' could be heard across the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a filmmaker, Hughes has the hypnotic ease of an advertising
ace, a pro who actually believes in the products he's selling.
Which is true, because he got his start as an ad copywriter who
churned out free-lance work, including the ``National Lampoon''
stuff, during his off-hours. And like any good adman, he manages to
exploit his audience's neediness with a total lack of shame.
Because he has no shame _ the bruising sentimentality that he has
employed in over half of his pictures, including the best of them,
``Sixteen Candles'' and ``Pretty in Pink,'' is mounted with a
shocking simplicity. Those pictures were his best because his muse,
Molly Ringwald, with her pliant pout, gave simple, honest
performances.

INVESTING WITH JEROLD L. STODDEN AND NANCY M. SCINTO OF
ALLEGHANY/CHICAO TRUST GROWTH AND INCOME FUND

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I sort of shudder at the word `hot,''' said Jerold L. Stodden,
lead manager of the Alleghany/Chicago Trust Growth and Income fund.
``That sort of denotes a nearer-term outlook on things.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stodden prizes a fast-rising equity, his firm's investment
discipline requires a five-year history of stable growth in sales
and earnings. That standard, intended to reduce risk, rules out
bets on many technology yearlings.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund, with $504 million in assets, has done just fine
without any of the new Internet stocks that have added to the gains
of so many growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   It returned 33.1 percent for the 12 months ended April 9,
compared with 23.3 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. And for the five years ended that day, it returned 28.8
percent a year, on average, versus 27.4 percent for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Stodden, 56, has been with Chicago Trust, which is a subsidiary
of the Alleghany Corp. and advises the fund, for three decades and
has managed the fund since its inception in December 1993. Nancy M.
Scinto, 39, has been his co-manager since December 1997 and has
been with the firm since 1984, when she started as an analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scinto emphasized the fund's long-term perspective. ``We
hold our companies usually for a long time,'' she said. ``I think a
little over 20 percent of the current portfolio has been there
since inception.''
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio usually contains 35 to 40 stocks, none of which
account for more than 5 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Stock selection begins with a computer screening, to find
companies that are outperforming the S&AMP;P 500 in measures like
earnings growth, sales growth and return on equity. Special
attention is paid to a company's price-to-earnings growth ratio: in
this case calculated as price-earnings ratio for the period two
year's hence multiplid by its expected two-year earnings growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we look at the level of stability of historical
earnings _ not the growth rate, but the stability of the earnings
pattern over the past five years,'' Stodden said. ``We try to find
companies that are more stable than the market itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The process yields about 350 to 400 stocks _ ``the group that is
then handed over to the analysts,'' Ms. Scinto said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's five analysts look at company balance sheets,
business models, competitive market positions, strategies and
management before making recommendations to the firm's equity
committee, which is composed of five senior portfolio managers
including Stodden.
</P>
<P>
   The committee picks the stocks. But then ``it's up to the
individual managers to implement those decisions,'' Stodden said.
The managers choose how to buy those stocks and what to sell to
raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   Walgreen, the drugstore chain, has been in the Growth and Income
fund nearly from the start. Ms. Scinto is impressed that the
company has grown through internal expansion, rather than through
acquisitions. She also lauds Walgreen's technology: The company
uses a computer program, for example, to determine what size vial
is used to fill a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The fund started buying Walgreen in 1994 for $5 a share; it is
now at $29. Ms. Scinto said she expected Walgreen earnings to grow
about 16 percent a year through 2000, with share prices at least
keeping pace.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has held Cintas, a work-uniform rental company, since
April 1996, when it was at $26; it closed on Friday at $68.
</P>
<P>
   Stodden said Cintas should benefit as more businesses hire
contractors to supply and clean uniforms. The market is still
``very lowly penetrated, maybe only 25 percent penetrated,'' he
added, ``and Cintas has by far the largest market share.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, he added, ``has had 26 years of consecutive
growth;'' he estimated annual earnings growth at 20 percent over
the next two years, with comparable increases in the stock price.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund's newest purchases is Omnicom Group, the big
holding company for advertising agencies. The fund started buying
Omnicom in December at about $54 a share; it now trades at $78. The
stock accounts for 2.5 percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This management is viewed as having some of the best financial
controls on a company,'' Ms. Scinto said, ``but they're also the
most creative, and in an advertising agency, that's key to getting
net new business wins.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Omnicom has had consistent growth, attributable in
about equal proportion to new work for its existing clients,
signing of new clients and acquisitions of other agencies. She
estimated earnings growth for the next 12 months at 18 percent and
said the stock price could grow at that rate or slightly faster.

UNDATED: simple, honest performances. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three times in his career, Hughes found actors who gave him
exactly what he needed: Ringwald, the ambitiously geeky Anthony
Michael Hall, and one actor he seemed to have discovered at a
larval stage: Macaulay Culkin. (Culkin's first Hughes movie was
``Uncle Buck,'' in which he seems nearly unformed.) Given his
peculiar smoothness _ his directing debut, ``Sixteen Candles,'' has
the deep-dish confidence of a veteran _ he showed a talent for
actors. And an empathy for them as well: In ``Planes, Trains and
Automobiles,'' Steve Martin exhibited a wet-eyed sappiness that,
with the ``Father of the Bride'' movies, he turned into a second
career. Hughes could be one of those people who were born to make
movies. Nowhere else could his unique assemblage of gifts and
sensitivity and anger have connected on such a large scale. He's
like a combination of screwball-comedy master director Preston
Sturges, young-adult novelist Judy Blume and Steven Spielberg. As
in Spielberg's most successful mainstream films, there's a fear of
sex in his movies. This is why his instinct for using pop is so
important. Through music, he communicates the restless teen desire
for sex without actually ever having to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' love of music may be the most redeeming element of his
movies, and the thing that makes them the most idiosyncratic.
Several of his other films also take their names from pop songs,
such as ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``Pretty in Pink.'' He picks most
of the music himself, and his song scores scurry from little-known
R&AMP;B classics to up-to-the-minute pop and oddball gems that clearly
reflect his own tastes. Hughes' love of music briefly led to his
creating a label, although his tastes were so outside the
mainstream _ and his attention so divided _ that it died quickly.
</P>
<P>
   He was so prolific that he couldn't possibly have got around to
directing all of the movies he scripted. ``She's Having a Baby''
seems to depict a move toward self-destruction. A sequence in which
star Kevin Bacon, fearful of the death of his creativity because of
his marriage, hurtles into a wall while strapped to a rocket sled
looked like nothing more than spitting in the face of a studio.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' tantrums probably helped him resurrect Chris Columbus'
career, which had nose-dived into a ditch. Hughes' combative
attitude and Columbus' damaged status led to Hughes' exploding the
deal at ``Home Alone's'' original studio, Warner Bros., over a
budget disagreement of less than $2 million. Undefeated, Hughes
walked the movie over to Fox. (The guy who asked if you wanted to
supersize that Big Mac might be one of the Warner execs who let
``Alone'' get away.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for the infantilization of mainstream movies
has been laid at the feet of Spielberg and George Lucas, who raised
the stakes of box-office success. But some of that blame has to be
laid on Hughes, too. He was the man who proved that you could
consistently program movies for the ages 12-24 audience. It was
that chunk of the market that streamed into Hughes' filmography,
because they wanted to see themselves and their suburban angst
again and again. And he kept giving those movies to them, until he
apparently burned himself out. No one could write that many
pictures on roughly the same subject and not finally drain the
well.
</P>
<P>
   He fell into a slump after ``Curly Sue,'' and though he
reclaimed some popularity by writing and producing the live-action
``101 Dalmatians'' and the ``Flubber'' remake, he didn't seem to
matter anymore. Probably because he never embraced hip-hop, the pop
of his world became increasingly irrelevant to his target
audiences. His movies seemed too white even in the age of Vanilla
Ice and Milli Vanilli, a world transformed by ``Yo, MTV Raps'' and
the Fresh Prince. (Will Smith, however, would have been the perfect
star for a Hughes movie.) Only now are things reversing, as the
audience that grew up on his work begins making its own movies,
e.g. Adam Sandler and his Hughes-like ``The Wedding Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what's lost on them is that Hughes, maybe unlike any
other director of his generation, isn't a film-school maven. His
pictures show a bigger sphere of tributes _ accumulated matter that
he picked up from a number of sources _ than any of those by young
directors who view his movies over and over while scribbling down
scenes they want to steal. Remember, his first movies were about
men feeling middle age beading up on their receding hairlines.
Maybe he'll have to come back and show his devotees how to do it
right.

SURVIVOR RECALLS THE FURY OF GREAT SAN FRANCISCO QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CERRITO, Calif. _ Survivors of the April 18, 1906, earthquake
might be the rarest people around San Francisco, and Ernest Latapie
is the rarest of the rare: Not only was he alive when the city
collapsed and burned, but he remembers vividly the horror of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who will be participating in commemorative
celebrations this weekend were too young to understand, or even
notice, the earthquake, and have no stories to tell. But Latapie,
who turns 103 on July 20, is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he sat down in the kitchen of his comfortable,
well-tended El Cerrito home and told his tale one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when my mother came running into my room and
snatched my brother and me out into the street,'' said Latapie, who
was 10 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Latapie said the ground was still shaking when his mother yanked
him awake at 5:13 a.m. in their Western Addition home.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake, with a magnitude estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale, triggered fires that destroyed the downtown and much of the
city's residential areas. More than 500 people died.
</P>
<P>
   Latapie's parents, two French immigrants who met and married in
San Francisco, operated a bakery that was attached to their home.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea what was going on when his mother dragged her two
offspring into the predawn chill. ``I thought it was wintertime and
a storm was brewing. I did not know it was an earthquake. I had no
knowledge of what an earthquake was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he recalled, ``A man walked up the street. He said, `Oh,
you should see the church down on the corner.' It was St. Dominic's
Catholic Church at Steiner and Bush. Both towers of the church were
down. All the walls were down.''
</P>
<P>
   While their home was intact, the brick chimney over his father's
bakery oven was cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse-drawn fire engines were coming down the street, back
and forth. All the mains were broken. They just went back to their
stations and the city was left to burn,'' Latapie said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds were pressing into his neighborhood, scurrying to escape
the conflagration. Later that day, large swathes of San Francisco
were dynamited to make fire breaks and control the spread of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire kept coming west, and my father said, `Well, I guess
we're going to be burned out,''' Latapie recalled. ``So we had an
employee load mattresses and blankets and clothing into a wagon and
we were going to be refugees. We went down and stayed in what today
is Hunters Point. That was all country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sleep in the fields like many of the suddenly
homeless, the Latapie family managed to rent a house there for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, after the fire was out, brought us home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their house was still standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the meantime, he was baking bread for the refugees,''
Latapie said. ``I remember lines about a block long waiting to get
a handout of a loaf of bread for each one.''
</P>
<P>
   For Latapie and his friends, the ruins of San Francisco were a
place for adventure and entrepreneurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market Street was all ruined,'' he said. ``At my age, Fillmore
Street was the new main street of San Francisco. A few kids in the
neighborhood and myself went to Chinatown for souvenirs that we
could sell. The city was under martial law and anyone caught there
would be fired on. Several times the soldiers would shoot at us.
They didn't hit anything. They probably were just scaring us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would sell these Chinese cups and things on Fillmore Street
out of a barrel,`` he said. ``Naturally, at my age, we were trying
to make a few dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Latapie's family moved to Emeryville, on the
east side of the San Francisco Bay. He has lived in there since,
and in his current home 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Latapie went on to serve in the Navy during World War I, to work
as a pharmacist for 20 years, then as a real estate broker and
finally, for 35 years, as owner of the Golden Bear Motel in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 20 years, Lucille, died of breast cancer. They had
no children.
</P>
<P>
   Latapie frequently visits San Francisco. ``As I go over there on
the bridge, it's hard for me to fathom that in my early days it was
all in ruins,'' he said.

DENNIS FRITZ IS COMING HOME AFTER 12 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A MURDER
HE DIDN'T COMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After serving 12 years in an Oklahoma prison for a murder he
didn't commit, Dennis Fritz is coming home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told before I went into the courtroom today (Thursday)
that I was going to be released,'' Fritz said in a phone interview,
``but I didn't want to get my hopes up until I heard it from the
judge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz, who was born in Kansas City and attended high school in
Lee's Summit, plans to return to the area next week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equally excited was his daughter, Elizabeth, who was 13 when he
was sent to prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great to have my dad back,'' she said. ``I never had
a dad growing up. I want to spend a great deal of time with him now
so we can get to know each other again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, in Ada, Okla., District Judge Tom Landrith
dismissed the murder charges against Fritz and his co-defendant,
Ron Williamson. Fritz had been living in Oklahoma when Debra Sue
Carter was killed in 1982 but insisted he never knew her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz, 49, had been sentenced to life; Williamson, 46, had been
sentenced to death. Both have maintained their innocence since
separate juries in 1988 convicted them in the slaying of Carter,
21, who was sexually assaulted and strangled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz had trouble believing he was free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm numb. I'm still trying to get used to it. It
hasn't sunk in yet,'' Fritz said Thursday night by phone from his
Ada motel room where he was staying with his mother and daughter.
``I'm just going through the process.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz was represented by Barry Scheck, a former O.J. Simpson
attorney and co-founder of the Innocence Project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To release ``bitter feelings,'' Fritz worked on his case while
he was in prison. He contacted the Innocence Project four years ago
after he heard about the organization from another inmate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a purpose by getting involved in my own case and doing
all I could to fight back,'' he said. ``But at the same time it was
like rubbing an open sore.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz admitted he was still angry but ``not to the point it will
negatively affect me. I may seek some kind of light counseling
though.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is considering suing Oklahoma for compensation for the 12
years he spent in jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison is an experience I don't want to go through again,''
Fritz said. ``When you're an innocent man doing time you can't
accept your incarceration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A guilty man has a little easier time to accept his
incarceration and resolve some issues and move on. I couldn't do
this. I was innocent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williamson described how it felt to be labeled a ``sex-slayer''
in his hometown and his experience in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Living on death row, I can say...there's a lot of pain and
misery,'' he said. ``That's a miserable existence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz plans to live with his mother in Kansas City and ``just
relax and get my priorities straight over the next few months.'' He
is thinking of studying law and ``doing everything I can to prevent
this from happening to someone else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz moved to Oklahoma when he was 17 and held several
construction jobs while he earned a teaching degree at Southeastern
State University. Before his arrest he taught science at the junior
high school in Noble, Okla. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, while he was visiting his mother to help her paint her
house, Fritz was arrested by Kansas City police and extradited back
to Oklahoma for Carter's 1982 murder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carter was beaten, a washcloth was stuffed down her throat and
she was strangled, possibly with an electric blanket cord. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew Miss Carter,'' Fritz said. ``I heard her name on
the news. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months after she was killed I was questioned a couple of
times. Just routine questions. After that I assumed I was
cleared.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fritz plans to do a lot of catching up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get used to little gadgets,'' he said. ``It feels
very odd. We used a card to unlock the motel room. At the time I
went to prison you used a key. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4:15 I looked at my watch and thought, `It's time for lock
down.' That was the time I was locked down and now I'm free.'' &QL;

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-IDEA &LR;  -- It is romantic love, which in the
ancient world was virtually unknown. ``Eros'' referred to chaos,
even disaster. But to the modern sensibility, love is the very
engine of life. 1,100 words. By the prolific American author Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-INVENTION &LR;  -- No doubt, the printing press is

deserve sole credit for inventing it. 1,500 words. By Jared
Diamond, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and physicist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SERMON &LR;  -- The concept, the `Shining City on a
Hill,' came to life in the 1630 sermon by the Massachusetts Bay
Colony's Gov. Robert Winthrop. His plea for civic virtue inspired
JFK and Reagan and perhaps even Martin Luther's King Jr.'s ``I Have
a Dream'' speech. 1,200 words. By Peter J. Gomes, minister of The
Memorial Church at Harvard.

 &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``The Best View of the World'' &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; ''The Agnese Map'' -- Created by Battista Agnese, a Venetian

 &UR; CREDIT: Courtesy of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown
University &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission
(via E-MAIL, NEWSCOM or WIECK photo database) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This flat map of the world traced the route of Magellan's
voyages and the Spanish silver fleet. Decorated with cherubs' faces
in a cosmos of billowing clouds and turquoise skies, it is a high
mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-DEMOCRACY -- Every dictator's nightmare is the
idea that humans have rights. The universal principle of the
fundamental rights of man is any tyrant's ``province of terror.''
1,900 words. By Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and Nigerian
pro-democracy leader Wole Soyinka.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-TIME &LR;  -- In this panel discussion moderated by
veteran New York Times columnist Russell Baker, the talk is of the
best time to be alive. The Ming dynasty? Puritan New England?
Yale's Jonathan Spence, Harvard's Orlando Patterson and others tell
where they'd have lived, given the choice. 1,900 words.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PRODUCT &LR;  -- Forget electricity, the microchip
and the car. Without beans we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark
Ages. If human beings are still here, descendants of the Pilgrim
Fathers or the Spanish conquistadores, it is thanks to beans. 2,400
words. By Umberto Eco, the author of ``The Name of the Rose'' and
``Foucault's Pendulum.''

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great
battles, like Gettysburg and D-Day, but for 1,000 years, only the
defeat of the Turks by Jan Sobieski near Vienna in 1683 has rivaled
the Battle of Saratoga. 1,200 words. R.J. Apple Jr., chief
correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a
kindly, harmless bunch. They never took up with Big Brother; they
were pacifists; they didn't kill anyone; they didn't try to impose
their ideas by force. Plus they made a lasting contribution to
furniture design and music. 700 words. By Margaret Atwood, author
of ``A Handmaid's Tail'' and ``Alias Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,

France's victory in the World Cup. Just a sports coup? 800 words.
By Paul Auster, the author, most recently, of ``Timbuktu.''
</P>

music director of the American Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-REVOLUTION &LR;  -- Thanks to Gandhi, the peacemaker,
India won its freedom without firing a shot. ``Of the many
revolutions ... the human-rights revolution seems to be the most
morally appealing to the world of our time.'' 700 words. By Alan
Brinkley, a Columbia history professor and author of ``Liberalism
and Its Discontents.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-STORY &LR;  -- ``Scheherazade'' has everything a tale

biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''

editorial board member Gail Collins.

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-NUISANCE &LR;  -- Octavia Hill, queen of open spaces,
loved the English countryside, its green fields and fresh air. And

bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's

Kimmelman.

<P>

Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of

writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.

mark of the Renaissance fascination with science and humanism.

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-BATTLE &LR;  -- The millennium would see other great

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-UTOPIA &LR;  -- As utopians go, the Shakers were a

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-GAME &LR;  -- Soccer is a perfect substitute for war,

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LEADER &LR;  -- ``Just look how well she governs,''

bully, about preserving the land she loved. 350 words. By Penelope
Fitzgerald, author of ``The Blue Flower.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ESCAPE &LR;  -- Just as the lords of evil were about
to make the world part slave colony and part death camp ... the
democracies seized their chance, and mankind made its narrow escape
from global darkness. In short, the Axis self-destructed. 400
words. By David Fromkin, author of ``The Way of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-MEDICINE &LR;  -- In 1796 Edward Jenner tried the

</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-ART &LR;  -- Florentine architect Brunelleschi's

Kimmelman.

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-FASHION &LR;  -- The zipper is probably the only

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-LOVESONG &LR;  -- Not ``You're a Hard Dog to Keep

Lorrie Moore, author of ``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PORT &LR;  -- ``Talk has been of Venice sinking below

years.'' 750 poetic words. By Jan Morris, author of ``The World of

history of the Byzantine Empire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-VICTORY &LR;  -- It was a come-from-behind triumph:

desperate wish to sort it out. So we hunger to rank almost
everything as The Best. 1,500 words. By op-ed columnist and senior
writer for The New York Times Magazine, Frank Rich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-PIANO &LR;  -- The keyboard music of Johann Sebastian

Offering.'' 400 words. By Charles Rosen, concert pianist and author
of ``The Classical Style.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-BEST-SQUARE &LR;  -- The Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome,

 &HT;    SECURITY CONCERNS SLOWING ALLIED AIRLIFT OF AID TO REFUGEES
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0417.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ The Western airlift of food and
bedding to 100,000 refugees in the mountain town of Kukes has been
crimped in the last three days by a decision by U.S. military
commanders to ground all American helicopter flights to that area
of Albania for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Off the coast of Albania, 10 giant U.S. Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon
helicopters on the U.S.S. Inchon are awaiting orders to resume
flights to the swelling crowds of refugees in Kukes, the largest
single concentration of refugees just across the border from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the flights to Kukes by American helicopters have been put
off indefinitely because of intelligence reports of Serb
infiltrators and the risks of having more airlifted supplies seized
by crowds of refugees and resident Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees in Kukes are still being supplied by flights on
smaller Swiss and French helicopters, as well as by truckers
weaving their way up the tortuous 10-hour road trip from the
Albanian port of Durres. While daily food requirements of the
refugees are being met so far, U.N. relief officials at the border
have been unable to build up more than a few days' stockpile in
Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   That deficiency became painfully apparent Friday as thousands of
Kosovar Albanian refugees began pouring across the border into
Albania, a result of Serbian military units beginning to clear out
the most remote mountain villages.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of U.S. helicopter flights to Kukes is the latest
frustration for the Clinton administration in trying to get a grip
on the Kosovo humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, the Pentagon had ordered the Inchon diverted from a
mission in the Persian Gulf. The aim was to to triple the allies'
airlift capacity to stranded Kosovo refugees in Kukes and
</P>
<P>
   elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Dragons on the Inchon are capable of hoisting more than
50 tons of food a day to the mountain refugee camps. But the giant
helos carried only about 20 tons of supplies to Kukes before the
flights were suspended late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we feel comfortable with the environment, we will
fly to Kukes again,'' said Maj. Tom Dolney, a spokesman for the
allied humanitarian operation based at the Rinas Air Field.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the flights of the U.S. Air Force's
special purpose Pave Low helicopters from Rinas to the Albanian
border were also cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that led to the cancellations was an intelligence
report late Tuesday that Serb infiltrators armed with
shoulder-mounted SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles may have been
positioned on an Albanian mountainside near Kukes. The suspected
Serb position was within range of the landing zone where the Navy
Sea Dragons dropped food on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was a concern among U.S. Navy commanders of a
repetition of Tuesday's chaotic episodes in which crowds of
refugees and local Albanians stormed onto the Navy's landing field
in Kukes and made off with more than six tons of food and sleeping
bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security is an important issue for us from a safety
perspective,'' the Inchon's commander, Capt. Dick Gallagher, told
reporters visiting the Inchon late Friday. ``The last thing we want
to
</P>
<P>
   do is hurt some poor innocent hungry person who is just there
trying to get a box of food or a sleeping bag.''

VIRTUAL REALITY AS THE ONLY REALITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget about waking up as an insect, or whatever it
is that Gregor Samsa becomes in Kafka's tale. Judging from ``The
Matrix,'' the nation's top grossing film the last three weeks, when
we awaken we won't find that we have become bugs. We'll find that
we're their servants. Or at least the servants of creepy machines
that look like bugs.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the basic premise of this film _ in case you
haven't heard yet _ is that we are all under the control of a
massive computer program run by arthropods. Everything we think
real is just a virtual reality created in our lulled,
software-driven brains by bug-eyed masters whom we serve but never
see. Everyday life is a worldwide web of illusion, a matrix, an
intricate simulacrum.
</P>
<P>
   This idea may seem strange, but give it time. It is about to
become cultishly familiar. ``The Matrix'' has inspired thousands of
testimonials on dozens of Internet news groups. At
www.whatisthematrix.com there are hundreds more. In Sydney,
Australia, where it was filmed, fans are mapping out the landmarks.
The authors are hinting at sequels.
</P>
<P>
   This fascination is not just inspired by stunning high-tech
effects and clever plotting, nor by the skilled use of formulas
from the sci-fi cyberpunk canon. (``Blade Runner'' and
``Terminator,'' and Philip Dick and William Gibson are all knit
into ``The Matrix.'') There is something more. The film has touched
a nerve with its view of reality as just a massive computer
program. The fervent devotion being inspired is linked to an
intricate network of ideas about cyberspace and the Internet, your
own version of the Matrix.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this intellectual nexus can be picked up from the
film's Web site. The directors, Larry and Andy Wachowski, convinced
the studio to produce the exotic film by preparing a comic-book
first, simplifying ideas and images. The web site does something
similar in a series of ``Matrix''-inspired comics about a dreary,
ordinary world that seems fraught with illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In one Web comic a weary stockbroker sitting in a row of
cubicles says: ``I spend my day speaking to disembodied voices
about glowing, ever-changing numbers, representing potential values
agreed upon by people I don't know and won't ever meet. Sometimes
it doesn't seem very real.''
</P>
<P>
   In another comic a young computer hacker moans about her
``hellish life as a pitiful shell of a human,'' a ``ghost in a
machine.'' This is also the world of the film's hero, played by
Keanu Reeves, who is just as bored and gets his thrills by breaking
codes and jacking his way into forbidden computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   What all of these techno-sophisticates sense is that what seems
to be the real world (and seems to us to be the real world) is not
all it's cracked up to be. They even begin to watch it crack up,
finding its flaws and quirks, seeing it as the computer program it
really is, even if they don't grasp who is writing the code. In
fact, these fictional hackers learn to see the matrix pretty much
the way real hackers see our world. In the hacker's vision,
information _ digital strings of ones and zeros _ is the essence of
matter and life; everything else is just scaffolding,
superstructure, illusion.
</P>
<P>
   But having seen so deeply, the hacker also has a messianic
mission. The hacker is a rebel, an iconoclast, a seer. The hacker
is a kind of cyber-revolutionary for whom the villains are not
economic capitalists but information capitalists and controllers:
the corporation, the government and the media. The digital truth,
the hacker proclaims, should be free and shall set us free. This is
what the heroes proclaim in ``The Matrix'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker myth is, of course, a comic book version of the
universe, but it is based on enough truth to have enormous cultural
power. The revolutionary promise of the Internet, for example has
surely affected the stock market. And the notion that life and
social behavior are really just complex forms of information
processing is taken quite seriously. Some economists compare
financial markets to organisms. Some cyber-biologists create
computer programs that simulate evolution and development, creating
forms of ``artificial life'' (often called ``A life'').
</P>
<P>
   Many advocates insist that the same thing is happening on the
Internet. Each user is a neuron hooked into a worldwide organism
that is gradually evolving; a living matrix is taking shape. There
are programs that maneuver through the Internet guided by primitive
forms of artificial intelligence, gathering information. Software
aficionados speak of them, imagistically, as ``agents,'' quietly
making their way across cyber-borders. That metaphor returns to its
origins in ``The Matrix'' where software ``agents'' protecting the
matrix appear as hard-core beings equipped with suits and
secret-agent-shades.
</P>
<P>
   So the film, despite its kung fu gestures and classical
allusions, is a restatement of the hacker myth, retaining and
celebrating its almost utopian hopes. Life is information and
information life, so what isn't possible? What couldn't a master of
code accomplish? The mechanized arthropods have mastered humans
with their code; now the hackers must master the masters. Is it any
wonder, then, that we are drawn into ``The Matrix''? The hacker
myth is so powerful it is difficult to resist. It is so dominant it
is almost impossible to dissect. Reality, we are told, is just
software. The hacker is our savior. The film's only twist is that
the truth revealed is so much uglier than the illusion stripped
away. But that leaves plenty of room for sequels about virtual
unreality and its masters, and lots of time for hacker saviors to
take on what are, after all, software's recurrent nemeses: pesky
bugs.

 `HAVING OUR SAY': A MEMORABLE DELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the television version of ``Having Our Say'' had been only a
vivid history lesson, that would have been enough to justify what
is clearly a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   But this film is more, an engrossing drama built on characters
who are at once exceptional and accessible. If you've already met
the formidable Delany sisters through their books and the play they
inspired, you'll be delighted to be in their presence again. If
not, you're in for a memorable surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah L. Delany, known as Sadie, a retired teacher, and her
sister A. Elizabeth, called Bessie, who had been a dentist, were
both past 100 when Amy Hill Hearth, a writer, came to their door in
Mount Vernon, N.Y., in 1991. (She had to go to their door; they
never saw the need for a telephone.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Ms. Hearth, the sisters were overflowing with
memories and opinions and were willing to share them. Fortunately
for everybody else, Ms. Hearth was able to distill that cornucopia,
first into an article for The New York Times and then in what
became a best-selling book, ``Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters'
First 100 Years,'' in 1993, followed the next year by ``The Delany
Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   That considerable wisdom had been earned during lives that took
them to the Harlem Renaissance from Raleigh, N.C., where their
father, a former slave who became the nation's first black
Episcopal bishop, ran a school.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Mann, who adapted the sisters' reminiscences into a
two-woman play that appeared on Broadway in 1995, has now expanded
it into the film that CBS is broadcasting Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At its center are strong portrayals of these strong women.
Diahann Carroll, playing against type and encased in a distracting
quantity of makeup, is the gentle, thoughtful Sadie. Ruby Dee, who
defies type, is the blunt-talking Bessie. ``She has trouble
forgiving and forgetting,'' Sadie says of her sister. Bessie
doesn't deny it: ``Most of the people I'm still mad at are long
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed by Lynne Littman, moves back and forth in
time without compromising its narrative. Ms. Carroll and Ms. Dee
embody the sisters in middle and old age. Their performances
occasionally threaten to glide into caricature but more often
capture the women's complementary strengths and frailties and their
extraordinary bond.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Arrindell Anderson is cryptically lovely in the role of
Sadie as a young woman. Mykelti Williamson and Lonette McKee convey
little more than loving nobility as their beloved parents, who
reared 10 children, instilling them with a deep pride and a deeper,
if largely unrequited, love for their country.
</P>
<P>
   The smoldering heart of the flashbacks is young Bessie, played
by Audra McDonald without a chance to display her celebrated
soprano voice. When Bessie faces down a white drunk demanding sex
and in another scene in which she tearfully chooses her career over
marriage, Ms. McDonald displays a vulnerable strength.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more central character in the film, Ms. Hearth,
played by Amy Madigan. In the books she had her say, briefly, in
introductions, and then skillfully shone the spotlight on the
Delanys. In the stage play, the audience members play the role of
the visiting stranger, as much of the dialogue is delivered
directly to them. Here, however, Ms. Mann has elected to bring Ms.
Hearth into the spotlight, too.
</P>
<P>
   This enables Ms. Mann to explore how Bessie's initial distrust
of this stranger evolves into affection. ``Once in a while God
sends a good white person to me,'' Bessie says. ``I guess it's
God's way of keeping me from becoming too mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madigan is called upon to portray Ms. Hearth's own
evolution. As her nervousness around the sisters gives way to an
easy admiration, she becomes a better person by absorbing their
advice (and wearing a hat they give her). Ms. Madigan is a game
participant, but her character is a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   When she exclaims, ``To tell you the truth, you two are the most
wonderful women I've ever known,'' the effect is to underline a
point that has already been indelibly made.
</P>
<P>
   The film ends with the sisters attending a performance of the
play they inspired and accepting a standing ovation. It is
gratifying to know that these courageous women lived to receive
such tributes. (Bessie died in 1995, Sadie earlier this year.) And
it is gratifying to see their story well told again. So watch the
movie. But if you haven't read ``Having Our Say,'' find a copy.
You'll be enriched by the sisters' unadorned eloquence. &QL;

TEMPORARILY YOURS 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., S.C.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I took a job stuffing envelopes. It was a
necessity: I had just graduated from college and had no idea what I
wanted to do with my life, but the lenders who had financed my
college education weren't sympathetic to my existential crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The job came through a temporary-employment agency, which paid
me $7.25 an hour to cram manila envelopes with a company's pap. I
lasted one day.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the temp world has changed dramatically. According
to the National Association of Temporary and Staffing Services,
there are nearly three million temporary employees in the United
States, up from 500,000 in 1983. Today's temps are younger (50
percent are 20 to 34 years old) and smarter (30 percent have an
associate or bachelor's degree). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And the Bureau of Labor Statistics says they make an average
of $10.62 an hour. Experts expect the $57 billion temp industry to
nearly double its annual revenue by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary employment has grown in part because employers are
more cautious about committing themselves. ``They want to try
people out before hiring them,'' said James Essey, president of the
Tempositions Group of Companies in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies also prefer temps because they may not have to
give them full benefits, or any benefits at all. &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; But it is not only employers who are fickle. Many young people
engage in serial workplace monogamy, refusing to enter into serious
relationships until they have sowed their corporate oats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You test each other out, like a trial marriage,'' said Georgia
Ellis, a vice president at Fifth Avenue Temporary Services in
Manhattan. ``And it doesn't look bad on your resume, because it
doesn't look like you've jumped from place to place. You have an
excuse. You're a temp.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Robinson, 29, has morphed into what is known as a
``permanent temp'' _ one with a long-term assignment. For the last
two years, Ms. Robinson, who is also an actress, has had a
continuing temporary position as a graphics artist, three days a
week, at Andersen Consulting in Manhattan. She freelances the other
two days from connections made at other temp jobs. The freedom, she
said, is invaluable: ``I try to be respectful and give notice, but
if I need to leave I leave. And I don't take work home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young corporate nomads, some of whom are actors, musicians
and writers, want to focus on their ``real'' careers without having
to ask, ``Do you want fries with that?'' They thrive on the
flexibility and often use their day jobs as floating office spaces
for managing the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In a full-employment economy, the competition among temp
agencies has intensified. Many offer benefits to attract workers;
employees staying six months may be eligible for vacation pay,
child-care reimbursement and the purchase of medical coverage at
group rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the life of a temp isn't all free Krispy Kremes. Stories
abound of demeaning treatment from employers and permanent workers.
For details, check Tempslave, a magazine, or the Temp24-7 Web site
(www.temp24-7.com), where temps can vent. Temp24-7 includes ``Temps
vs. Suits,'' a game in which temps can attack a virtual boss.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ``gripe of the week'' on the Web site told of how a
group of temps were all called ``Jane'' by colleagues who didn't
feel like learning their names. Elsewhere on the site, temps posted
stories of endless dry spells with nary a job proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberwrath aside, most of today's temps have strong bonds with
bosses and agencies. Some employers are so fond of their
longer-term temps that, when they take time off, other temps are
hired to stand in.
</P>
<P>
   Once displeased, temps can also request transfers. Or walk away.
Suzanne Lynn, 27, said she left a Greenville, S.C., law firm for
lunch and, angry about being yelled at, didn't come back. Her
agency understood and handed her another assignment.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of freedom and unconditional love, temporary work
might be the wave of the future. And even envelope stuffing, now
paying $10 an hour in New York City, might be a slightly more
profitable, if not enviable, experience.

PRESENTATION SOFTWARE: DEBASER OF PUBLIC DISCOURSE, OR ELEVATOR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Begin itals)Good morning.
</P>
<P>
   The title of today's presentation is: ``The Effect of
Presentation Software on Rhetorical Thinking,'' or ``Is Microsoft
Powerpoint Taking Over Our Minds?''
</P>
<P>
   _ I will begin by making a joke.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then I will take you through each of my points in a linear
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then I will sum up again at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because of the unique format of this particular
presentation, we will not be able to entertain questions. (End
itals)
</P>
<P>
   Were Willy Loman to shuffle through his doorway today instead of
in the late 1940s, when Arthur Miller wrote ``Death of a
Salesman,'' he might still be carrying his sample case, but he
would also be lugging a laptop computer featuring dozens of slides
illustrating his strongest pitches complete with bulleted points
and richly colored bars and graphs.
</P>
<P>
   Progress? Many people believe that the ubiquity of prepackaged
computer software, which helps users prepare such presentations,
has not only taken much of the life out of public speaking by
homogenizing it at a low level, but has also led to a kind of
ersatz thought that is devoid of original ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, the shoot-from-the-lip chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems, who regularly works himself into a
lather criticizing Microsoft Corp., announced two years ago that he
was forbidding Sun's 25,000 employees to use Powerpoint, the
Microsoft presentation program that leads the market. (The ban was
not enforced.) Some computer conferences have expressly barred
presenters from using slides as visual aids during their talks,
because they think it puts too much emphasis on the sales pitch at
the expense of content.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, computer scientists and software developers are
more divided about the effect of Powerpoint and its competitors.
Some are sympathetic to the argument that the programs have debased
public speaking to the level of an elementary school filmstrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tools we use to shape our thinking with the help of
digital computers are not value free,'' said Steven Johnson, the
author of ``Interface Culture,'' a 1997 study of the designs used
to enable people to interact with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson uses Powerpoint himself (for example, during a recent
talk he gave at Microsoft) but nonetheless said, ``There is a
certain kind of Powerpoint logic that is brain numbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, presentation programs are primarily used for
corporate and sales pitches. Still, the approach has leaked into
the public discourse. Think of Ross Perot's graphs or President
Clinton's maps. Critics argue that such programs contribute to the
debasement of rhetoric. ``Try to imagine the `I have a dream'
speech with Powerpoint,'' said Cliff Nass, an associate professor
of communication at Stanford University who specializes in
human-computer interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Other people, however, have made the opposite argument, saying
that Powerpoint has elevated the general level of discourse by
forcing otherwise befuddled speakers to organize their thoughts and
by giving audiences a visual source of information that is a much
more efficient way for humans to learn than by simply listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are visual creatures,'' said Steven Pinker, a psychology
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
author of several books about cognition including ``The Language
Instinct.'' ``Visual things stay put, whereas sounds fade. If you
zone out for 30 seconds _ and who doesn't? _ it is nice to be able
to glance up on the screen and see what you missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinker argues that human minds have a structure that is not
easily reprogrammed by media. ``If anything, Powerpoint, if used
well, would ideally reflect the way we think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Powerpoint too often is not used well, as even Pinker
admitted. He is on a committee at MIT that is updating the
traditional writing requirement to include both speech and graphic
communication. ``MIT has a reputation for turning out Dilberts,''
he said. ``They may be brilliant in what they do, but no one can
understand what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, visual presentations have played an important part in
business and academia for decades, if not centuries. One of the
most primitive presentation technologies, the chalkboard, is still
widely used. But in recent years the spread of portable computers
has greatly increased the popularity of presentation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the word processing programs eliminated many of the
headaches of writing on a typewriter, presentation software makes
it easy for speakers to create slides featuring text or graphics to
accompany their talks. The programs replace the use of overhead
projectors and acetate transparencies, which take time to create
and are more difficult to revise. Most lecture halls and conference
rooms now feature screens that connect directly to portable
computers, so speakers can easily project their visual aids.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Powerpoint's success is that it comes free with
Microsoft's best-selling Office software package, which also
features a word processing program and an electronic spreadsheet.
Other presentation programs, like Freelance from IBM's Lotus
division and Corel Corp.'s Presentations, also come bundled with
other software, but Office is by far the most successful, racking
up $5.6 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people do not buy Powerpoint on its own, it is
difficult to tell how many actual users there are. Microsoft says
that its surveys show that, compared with two years ago, twice as
many people who have Office are regular users of Powerpoint today,
and that three times as many Office users have at least tried the
program. Anecdotal evidence indicates an explosion in the use of
Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the program is used for countless sales pitches
every day both inside and outside a wide variety of companies. It
is de rigueur for today's MBA candidates. The Dale Carnegie
Institute, which imbues its students with the philosophy of the man
who wrote the seminal work ``How to Win Friends and Influence
People,'' has a partnership with Microsoft and offers a course in
``high-impact presentations'' at its 170 training centers in 70
countries. Microsoft has incorporated into Powerpoint many more
templates based on the Carnegie training programs and has even
incorporated the Carnegie course into the program's help feature.

demands for further explanation _ demands that at times appeared to
touch a nerve during the briefing at NATO headquarters. The

<P>
   (For Texas papers): KOSOVO-COOK _ ABOARD THE USS INCHON OFF
ALBANIA _ Like about 60 percent of the seamen and women aboard this
helicopter carrier, Navy Cook David Spencer is a Texan. When
Spencer and the 1,064 others aboard the Inchon left their home port
in Corpus Christi March 1, they thought they were heading for the
Arabian Gulf for a mine-hunting exercise. Hunting and sweeping
mines is what the Inchon does best. On April 4, the Inchon was
anchored in the Eastern Mediterranean waiting to pass through the
Suez Canal. The next day, the ship was ordered by the Pentagon to
turn around and head for the Adriatic off Albania to use its 10
giant mine-sweeping helicopters to haul food to Kosovo refugees.

dead. On Friday, they finally escaped and told the story of their

   URBAN-WARGAMES _ The black helicopters, and the
specially-trained U.S. Army troops they dropped across South Texas
for 10 days in February, are gone now. In their wake, they left a
trail of tales that will be told, retold, and embellished for years
_ the soldiers rappeling into cities, the explosions, the
accidental fire, the satchel full of cash to pay for damages. And
they ignited a new round of buzz among those who consider the
helicopters symbols of government oppression or a coming one-world
order. The training exercises by the Army's Special Operations
Command, dubbed Operation Last Dance, were the latest in a 10-year
effort to give America's elite troops real-world experience in
different urban environments. And in town after town, local leaders
remain divided over whether they would invite the soldiers back for
an encore. (Harmon, Austin American-Statesman).

 UNDATED: help feature. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Powerpoint is so popular that in many offices it has entered the
lexicon as a synonym for a presentation, as in ``Did you send me
the Powerpoint?''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against the program is understandable. Even before
the advent of the personal computer, there were those who argued
that speeches with visual aids stressed form over content.
Executives at IBM Corp., the model of a successful corporation in
the 1950s, '60s and '70s, were famous for their use of ``foils,''
or transparencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People learned that the way to get ahead wasn't necessarily to
have good ideas,'' wrote Paul Carroll in ``Big Blues,'' his 1993
study of IBM's dramatic decline in the era of the personal
computer. ``That took too long to become apparent. The best way to
get ahead was to make good presentations.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics make many of the same claims about Powerpoint today.
``It gives you a persuasive sheen of authenticity that can cover a
complete lack of honesty,'' said John Gage, the chief scientist at
Sun Microsystems, who is widely respected in the computer industry
as a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Academic critics echo the arguments made by Max Weber and
Marshall McLuhan (``The medium is the message'') that form has a
critical impact on content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as trying to be creative on a standardized form,''
Nass said. ``Any technology that organizes and standardizes tends
to homogenize.''
</P>
<P>
   Powerpoint may homogenize more than most. In the early 1990s
Microsoft realized that many of its customers were not using
Powerpoint for a very powerful reason: They were afraid. Steven
Sinofsky, the Microsoft vice president in charge of the Office
suite, said that writer's block was an issue for people using word
processors and other programs but the problem was worse with
Powerpoint because of the great fear people had of public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would happen was that people would start up Powerpoint
and just stare at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's answer was the ``autocontent wizard,'' an automated
feature that guides users through a prepared presentation format
based on what they are trying to communicate. There are templates
for ``Recommending a Strategy,'' ``Selling a Product,'' ``Reporting
Progress'' and ``Communicating Bad News.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when it was first introduced, the autocontent wizard
in Powerpoint has become increasingly sophisticated. About 15
percent of users, Sinofsky said, now start their presentations with
one of those templates.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of Powerpoint, which will be released this
month, will feature an even more powerful wizard. The new version
also includes thousands of pieces of clip art that the program can
suggest to illustrate slides. There is even a built-in presentation
checker that will tell you whether your slides are too wordy, or
that your titles should be capitalized while bullet points should
be lower case.
</P>
<P>
   Many see the best antidote to the spread of Powerpoint in a
graphic medium that is expanding even faster than the use of
presentation software: the Web. Whereas Powerpoint presentations
are static and linear, the Web jumps around, linking information in
millions of different ways. Gage of Sun tries to use the Web to
illustrate his many public speeches, though a live connection to
the Internet is not as readily available at lecterns these days as
a cable that can connect a notebook computer to a screen for a
Powerpoint presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powerpoint is just a step along the way because you can't
click on a Powerpoint presentation and get the details,'' said
Daniel Bricklin, who developed the first electronic spreadsheet for
PCs and more recently a program called Trellix that puts Weblike
links into documents.
</P>
<P>
   Bricklin said the Web, like any new medium, required new forms
of composition just as the headlines and opening paragraphs of
newspaper articles helped readers skim for the most information.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not bemoan the popularity of presentation software.
``It was a lot worse,'' he said, ``when people got up with their
hands in their pockets, twirling their keys, going, `Um um um.'''

TO RETAIN POWER, INDIA'S RULERS COURT SMALLER PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For the moment, small-time politicians are
kingmakers here.
</P>
<P>
   This week the coalition government, led by a Hindu nationalist
party, lost the 18 votes of its largest partner and with them its
majority in Parliament.So the leaders of the coalition have been
engaged in hectic horse-trading and arm-twisting for the support of
small parties that will decide whether the government survives a
vote of confidence on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Om Prakash Chautala, who leads a party that has four of the 545
members of Parliament, said on Thursday that he definitely favored
the ouster of the year-old government. But after leaders of the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party courted his support, a
beaming Chautala announced Friday that he had changed his mind and
would support the government.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the arithmetic had shifted in favor of the
incumbent government, headed by Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee. Not only did Chautala return to the fold _ he deserted in
February _ but another party, with six votes, also defected from
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   And a third party, which represents lower-caste voters,
announced that its five members of Parliament would abstain, rather
than voting against the government.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to the government was set off when the leader of a
party from the state of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha Jayaram, announced
that she was withdrawing her support to the government. Ostensibly
she quit because she wanted the defense minister dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for the Bharatiya Janata Party said she actually
wanted the government to dismiss her rival from office in Tamil
Nadu under powers granted to the central government by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The other votes that the government gained Friday were from the
party of her archenemy in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha, who set off the frenzy, talked strategy on Thursday
with Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, which now
dominates the opposition, and for most of the last half-century ran
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was the declining power of the Congress Party, which became
calcified and unresponsive in the later years of its rule, which
contributed to the rise of the regional and caste-based parties
that now have the votes to shape who governs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Italian-born Mrs. Gandhi, who married into the
Nehru-Gandhi dynasty and who in the last year has become the
unquestioned Congress Party leader , has said little publicly about
her intentions.
</P>
<P>
   If Vajpayee's government falls, she would be the most obvious
choice as the new prime minister. But she has not disclosed who
would be in a new government nor who would lead it, a reticence
that the governing coalition has exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee told Parliament on Thursday when he opened debate on
the future of his government, ``Let the opposition tell the nation
who its leader is and what its programs will be if the government
falls.''

   DELTA-PILOTS _ In yet another sign of poor relations between
Delta and its pilot union, the union is demanding the airline not
use regional affiliate Comair on its Northeast Shuttle operation as
planned this summer. Union leaders passed a resolution at a special
meeting on the issue. They contend any Shuttle flying should be
done by Delta crews rather than lower-paid commuter pilots.

   BELLSOUTH _ ATLANTA _ BellSouth is making a bid to compete with
the national wireless companies, offering one-rate plans that
charge no extra for long-distance or roaming calls. The plans ($90
for 600 minutes and $120 for 1,000) are an implicit recognition
that the company has lost some lucrative customers to the likes of
Sprint and AT&AMP;T. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   INDUSTRY-RECRUITERS _ Fifteen years ago, industry recruitment
for most communities was a simple equation: cheap land plus cheap
labor equals new industry. Just how much that equation has changed
is clear watching a class of more than 100 new economic recruiters
going through a sort of boot camp this week at Georgia Tech. These
days, a community courting industry has to be concerned with its
teen pregnancy rate, high school drop out numbers and historic
preservation. (Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

Heavy bombing overnight that NATO claims was one of the most
successful nights of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SCENE (Urosevac, Yugoslavia) _ The evidence of ``ethnic
cleansing'' here in Kosovo is written upon the doorposts of their
houses and upon their gates. On the streets of this quiet, modest
city in southern Kosovo, many doors and storefronts bear a
spraypainted Christian cross with a Cyrillic ``C'' in each quadrant
_ a widely understood sign that the owners and occupants are Serbs.

   MINN-VENTURA (St. Paul) _ In his first three months of office,
Governor Ventura, the former professional wrestler known for
fighting in a pink boa, has managed to offend, annoy and outrage
plenty of Minnesotans _ but win the cheers of most. ``For as much
feathers as I've ruffled in being politically incorrect,'' the
Governor said in a recent interview, ``I get 10 to 1 letters from
people saying that's why they like me.'' By Dirk Johnson.

   WELFARE-REPORT (Boston) _ A year out, the vast majority of
Massachusetts people who get off welfare and stay off find modest
improvements in their earnings and are able to stay employed,
despite dire predictions that the early gains of the welfare
overhaul would not last, according to a report released Friday that
is the most detailed study of the effects of welfare in a state
with some of the toughest laws. By Carey Goldberg. (Skedded earlier

NISSAN SAYS LOSSES WILL BE WORSE THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Nissan Motor Corp., Japan's second-largest automaker,
reported a revised estimate of fiscal-year losses Friday that were
more than three times as bad as the company had anticipated. Nissan
also eliminated the shareholder dividend for the first time since
it became a publicly traded company a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The car company, which recently sold a 36.8 percent stake to
Renault SA of France for $5.4 billion, said estimated losses for
the year ending March 31 swelled to 35 billion yen, or about $294
million, compared with a projected loss of 10 billion yen it had
made earlier. The larger loss was not surprising to many automotive
analysts, who had expected such a downward revision.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profits plunged to 15 billion yen from an estimate of 70
billion yen, and sales slid to 3.3 trillion yen from the previously
predicted 3.4 trillion yen.
</P>
<P>
   On a consolidated basis, which includes the results of various
Nissan affiliates and subsidiary companies, the company stuck to
its previous estimate of a 30 billion yen loss.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan said it would eliminate the 5 yen a share dividend it had
planned to distribute, the first time since the company's shares
were listed in 1951 that it has not paid shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Renault released a statement saying that the new forecasts were
within the range of estimates it used in completing the deal with
Nissan, which was signed March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's official results for the fiscal year will not be
available until May but they confirmed what analysts had suspected
ever since they started seeing sales figures for the month of
March.
</P>
<P>
   March can account for one-quarter of a Japanese car company's
domestic sales in the last six months of the fiscal year, according
to analysts, and Nissan's sales were down by more than 18 percent
in the first 10 days of last month.
</P>
<P>
   It ended the month selling 15.9 percent fewer cars than it did
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the domestic car market was down 11.2 percent in the
year that ended March 31, and Nissan is not alone in seeing its
sales here slide. But the magnitude of Nissan's slippage has
usually been greater than that of competitors over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite deflation that is keeping a damper on prices, Japanese
consumers have been reluctant to spend, fearful of job cuts and
sharp reductions in wage increases, overtime and bonuses. Many
corporations are struggling through crises similar to Nissan's and
have sharply curtailed their purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside the government clearly sees any end in sight.
Nissan's president Yoshikazu Hanawa said he expected current
economic conditions to persist throughout this fiscal year,
although he did not give any estimates for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given chances that the yen will be stronger this year and with
little chance of a big change in domestic sales, I expect fiscal
year 2000 to be worse for Nissan than the one that just ended,''
said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Schroder Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bleak sales outlook in Japan, Hanawa said Nissan was
considering working to decrease production to 1.5 million vehicles
by 2003, rather than the 1.7 million target it had previously set.
Nissan currently produces 1.9 million vehicles and has excess
capacity of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanawa shied away from saying the company would close a
plant or production line, saying it could also merely reduce
production at various plants. Many economists argue that Japanese
companies like Nissan must reduce production capacity for the
long-term good of the economy.

SUPERSTAR DION A TURNCOAT, SEPARATISTS SAY, FUELING DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ So what do you call a singing superstar whose
recordings and concerts have enthralled hundreds of millions of
people around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Not a true Quebecer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view of one of Quebec's top separatist politicians,
whose disparaging cracks about the French-speaking province's most
beloved daughter, Celine Dion, have touched off a Titanic-sized
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her songs reflect nothing of what Quebecers experience,''
Parliament member Suzanne Tremblay, one of the more prominent
leaders of the Quebec separatist movement, recently said at a
government hearing on Canadian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her soul, she is neither a Quebecer nor a Canadian,''
Trembly declared in remarks that became public last week. ``Celine
Dion has become an American or universal performer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of swipe that separatists routinely take at
high-profile Quebecers who refuse to spend their days beating the
drums of secession or condemning the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it appears that Tremblay has gone a rhetorical
blast too far.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage at Tremblay's utterances is reverberating through the
province, as newspaper editorials, callers to radio talk shows,
television discussion panel hosts, and ordinary Quebecers _
separatists and federalists alike _ rally to defend the singer they
call ``our little Quebecer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Dion, who became fluent in English in her early
20s, is perhaps most famous for her song, ``My Heart Will Go On,''
from the film ``Titanic.'' But other recordings have kept her at
the top of international pop charts for years, and her music _ in
French and English _ is wildly popular among Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are so stuck on Celine,'' said Montreal music
critic Laurent Saulnier. ``They adore her.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Quebec cultural historian Frederic Demers: ``What's a true
Quebecois singer? One who sings only of snow, separatism,
lumberjacks, and spruce beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dion is of impeccably French-Quebecois heritage, born and raised
in the French heartland community of Charlemagne, one of 14
brothers and sisters in a musical clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our little girl from Charlemagne,'' said Denise Dion,
one of Celine's sisters. ``She's the little Quebecer who succeeded
on the world stage. Everyone is so proud of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's first recordings and early hits were sung in French, and
even after making a commercial decision to record some albums in
English _ the only way to break into the huge American and European
markets _ she stuck steadfastly to her Quebec roots, refusing in
1990 to accept a Canadian award for ``best anglophone artist of the
year,'' since the category implied that she was an English-speaking
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Quebecoise, and proud of it,'' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers were thrilled in 1997, when Dion made her opening
remarks in French at the Grammy Awards ceremony in New York,
thanking her original fans back in La Belle Province for her
success on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Quebecers, she is exporting the Quebec identity,''
said Demers.
</P>
<P>
   But not to Quebec's separatists, who control the provincial
government and are dedicated to cutting political ties with Canada.
It has long been the view of hard-core secessionists that any
Quebecer who succeeds in the English-speaking world is a sort of
turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dion last year was inducted into the Ordere National du
Quebec, the highest distinction the provincial government can
award, some separatists have never forgiven the music artist for an
offhand remark she made to reporters in 1992. Asked what she
thought of Quebec leaving Canada, she responded: ``Appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have been the first and last political comment she
has ever made in public, but separatist memories are long.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay, who represents a Quebec district in Canada's
Parliament, is one of the more pugnacious firebrands of the Quebec
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Celine Dion sings in `Titanic,' she's not singing
anything'' about Quebec, Tremblay more recently told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay's criticisms have exploded into headlines across
Canada, causing huge embarrassment for the separatists, who have
been forced to hold damage-control press conferences, professing
utmost admiration for Dion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celine Dion is an artist of international caliber, and I think
it is possible to be that and a true Quebecer at the same time,''
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Tremblay's party,
told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, columnists in French and English media are having a
field day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any doubt about the nationality of Celine's soul,
just consider that she spends most of her spare time in Florida,''
wrote Finbarr O'Reilly in the National Post. ``What could be more
Quebecois than that?''

ALGERIANS PROTEST ELECTION WITH AN UNSURPRISING WINNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS _ Police officers with batons broke up street
demonstrations in central Algiers and two other cities Friday after
a candidate backed by the army, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, was declared
the winner of a presidential election marred by allegations of
extensive vote rigging. At the last minute, all other candidates
withdrew from the ballot in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika, 62, a veteran of governments that the military led
in the 1960s and 70s, was credited in official tabulations with
having won nearly 74 percent of the vote in the election on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, he dismissed opponents' claims that he had
been imposed by the generals, who have held power here for decades
and said that he was ready to be sworn in as soon as the
formalities had been completed, probably by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, absolutely,'' Bouteflika told reporters who asked
whether he considered his election legitimate. ``Whether it is in
Algeria, or France or Sweden, 74 percent of the votes is a very
decent score.''
</P>
<P>
   The fraud allegations centered on reports that his tally had
been inflated by millions of phantom ballots prepared in advance by
the government of President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was a sharp disappointment for Algerians, who had
hoped that the vote would usher in an era of civilian rule free
from any taint of army control. Their hopes were encouraged when
Zeroual, a retired general, and the army commander, Gen. Mohammed
Lamari, pledged at the outset of the campaign that the army would
be neutral and suggested that it was time for the army to leave
politics altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If Algerians conclude that Bouteflika's election was rigged, it
could raise new doubts about the country's ability to emerge from
the trauma of recent years, when armed Islamist groups have waged a
brutal struggle for power. The conflict began after the army
canceled elections in 1992 because victory seemed to be going to
the Islamic Salvation Front, which had pledged to impose strict
Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, with popular sentiment's shifting sharply
against the Islamic guerrillas and with the army's gaining the
upper hand in the fighting, Algerians had begun to talk of moving
to a new era of moderation, with the radicals and the generals
sidelined in favor of a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bouteflika is seen as a front man for the generals, many
people in this nation of 30 million fear that opinion could begin
to shift back to the Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bouteflika celebrated, hundreds of protesters who were
gathering in a square in central Algiers, mostly young men, were
charged by the police. Several people were wounded by the charges,
and at least 20 arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One elderly man appeared to have been seriously hurt, lying face
down on the road for at least 20 minutes before an ambulance took
him away.
</P>
<P>
   The police suppressed similar protests in Tizi-Ouzou and Bajaia,
two cities east of Algiers that have been strongholds of opposition
to Bouteflika, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Algiers, Bouteflika's supporters responded to the protests by
organizing lengthy motorcades that wound through the streets to the
accompaniment of honking horns and waving Algerian flags.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Abdelmalik Sellal said 10.5 million of the
17.5 million eligible voters had cast ballots, a turnout of
slightly more than 60 percent. He angrily rejected the allegations
of vote rigging, saying everything possible had been done to
eliminate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since 1992, whatever the government did, all we ever
heard was, `Fraud, fraud, fraud!''' Sellal said. ``We were so fed
up with it that we were determined to have an election that was
free of any suggestion of taint''.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations seem highly likely to be a major handicap for
Bouteflika, not least because there is no way to test them. At the
outset of the campaign, the government rejected demands by
opposition candidates and Western governments, including the United
States, for international monitors, saying observers would
constitute interference in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The high turnout reported by the government surprised many,
contrasting as it did with what was visible on Thursday, when
polling stations here appeared to be largely deserted. Western news
agencies reported that similar quiet was evident at stations in
other major centers.
</P>
<P>
   But final government figures showed turnouts in some towns and
cities of more than 70 percent, offsetting single-figure turnouts
in areas of eastern Algeria, where Bouteflika's support is low.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the candidates except Bouteflika withdrew from the
contest 24 hours before the election, the names of all seven
remained on the ballot. Opinion polls published by independent
newspapers in the monthlong campaign had pointed to a victory by
Bouteflika, but not by anywhere close to such a huge margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said a moderate Islamic candidate, Ahmed
Taleb Ibrahimi, was the runner-up to Bouteflika, with nearly 13 per
cent of the votes. Another moderate Islamic candidate, Abdellah
Djaballah, was third, with nearly 4 percent, and Hocine Ait Ahmed,
a Socialist who was a leader of the struggle for independence from
France, received 3 percent. Ait Ahmed, 73, was favored to run
strongly but suffered a heart attack and spent the last two weeks
of the campaign in a Swiss hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Ibrahimi, who is 67 and spent 23 years as
a minister in military-led governments, said the government had
printed millions of extra ballots that had been added to
Bouteflika's total. Nonetheless, he said, the election had moved
Algeria closer to democracy by exposing the generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have smashed their democratic facade,'' he said. ``Instead
of responding to the Algerian people's yearning for change, they
have chosen repression, and they will have to answer for the
consequences.''

BAY STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 2.8 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' unemployment rate dropped to 2.8
percent in March, as the state reached a record for the number of
residents who were working.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.1 percentage point decline last month in the jobless rate,
down from 2.9 percent in February, continues a strong period of
growth for the Massachusetts economy, according to the monthly
report by the Department of Employment and Training.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate is down sharply over the past year from
3.5 percent in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder sometimes that it can't keep on going this good,''
said Elliott Weiner, the state's chief economist, ``but it still
seems to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom keeps going, but there is evidence of a slight slowdown
in New England. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this
week that job growth in the region slowed to 1.9 percent in 1998,
from 2.3 percent in 1997. A world economic slump, which hit
manufacturers particularly hard, was blamed for more moderate
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts employment levels rose 1.7 percent last year, down
from 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Massachusetts employers added a total of 7,100 jobs in
the typically strong hiring period that begins when the weather
warms. Job creation was well above the average of 4,000 new jobs a
month that has been recorded over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, most of the jobs were added by business service firms
and by retailers. Retailers _ mainly furniture and general
merchandise stores and restaurants _ reported the biggest job gains
among all industries for a second consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a record 3.2 million people were employed in
Massachusetts last month, according to the state's survey of
business payrolls. The jobless statistics are derived from a
separate survey of Massachusetts households.
</P>
<P>
   Good news was repeated as state unemployment rates fell around
the country, with sharp declines reported in Midwestern states.
Massachusetts had the nation's seventh-lowest jobless rate, and the
lowest among the 11 largest states.
</P>
<P>
   The only sector in Massachusetts that reported fewer jobs were
manufacturers, which shrank their payrolls by 700 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Corp. in Boston,
said that he believes the worst is over for manufacturers, which
were hit by a slump in demand for their export goods in markets
from Jakarta to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil's troubles now apparently contained, manufacturers
problems are ``abating,'' Breimyer said. ``The maximum impact has
been registered, and it doesn't look like there will be negative
impacts going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``You're not going to see a lot of vibrancy in
this sector.''
</P>
<P>
   All other sectors reported strong gains: Retailers added 2,800
jobs in March; services grew by 2,700 jobs, with 2,200 of those in
business services; construction gained 1,700 jobs in its ninth
consecutive monthly increase; and the financial and real estate
sector added 500 jobs.

   COOPER, Texas _ Russell Brewer never was the pride of Delta
County. He was a high school dropout, a layabout who swilled beer
atop a town water tank with his buddies and an inept burglar who
targeted the homes of his own relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Many considered Brewer the bad seed of a good, hard-working
Christian family, an affliction to his many kinfolk who populate
the hardscrabble country between the North and South Sulphur
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer's accusation that Brewer had joined ex-cons Bill
King and Shawn Berry in dragging a black man, James Byrd Jr.,
behind a pickup to his death startled most people in this tiny
Northeast Texas farm town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought his chance of becoming a productive citizen
was too bright,'' said former sheriff's investigator Gary Thompson.
``But I was surprised that he got into trouble of such magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Brewer, 32, played a key role in what is
arguably the most monstrous crime in recent Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of June 7, they say, Brewer, his old prison
friend, King, and King's longtime buddy, Berry, accosted the
intoxicated Byrd as he walked along a Jasper street. They then beat
him, chained him to a pickup and dragged him. Byrd was decapitated
when his body struck a culvert.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's DNA was detected on a cigarette and beer bottle found
at the crime scene. Byrd's blood was found on his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of Brewer's May 17 capital murder trial in
Jasper, residents of Delta County are puzzling openly about how the
seemingly pensive, dark-haired, dark-eyed man could be implicated
in such unspeakable cruelty. Though Brewer's previous scrapes with
the law were numerous, they never were violent nor, apparently,
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Texas, Delta County has a history of racial
violence. In 1913, a black man accused of murdering a white girl
was pulled from a courtroom and lynched on the town square. But in
recent years, race relations have been good. Delta County, one of
the state's smallest and poorest, is 90 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell didn't hate blacks,'' said his maternal aunt, Carol
Gillham. ``We've never had any KKK in this family. We had blacks in
this family. Russell's cousin married a black man. They had two
kids. Russell married a Hispanic. They had a son.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's father, Lawrence Russell Brewer Sr., who brought his
wife and five children back to his native county when he retired
from the Army in the late 1970s, has commented that his son was
reared in a cosmopolitan military setting, associating with people
of all races since infancy. If Brewer learned hatred, the older man
said shortly after his son was arrested, he didn't learn it at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Roberts, the black concrete worker who for seven years
was married to Brewer's cousin, said the accused killer betrayed no
racial hostility at family gatherings or during chance encounters
on the street. Sylvia Nunes of Fort Worth, Brewer's wife of five
years, has declined to comment about her ex-spouse. But her mother,
Marina Nunes, told The Dallas Morning News that Brewer seemed
racially tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, himself, eschewed racism when he first was processed
into state prison 12 years ago, telling authorities he had no
objection to sharing a cell with an African-American. By the time
he was released from the Beto I unit in the summer of 1997, though,
prison gang experts suspected Brewer had allied himself with white
supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Brewer and Bill King _ who was
convicted of Byrd's murder in February and sentenced to die _ were
members of the Confederate Knights of America, a KKK-related prison
gang. Upon being released, prosecutors said, they planned to form a
``free world'' chapter _ Texas Rebel Soldiers _ in Jasper, and
Byrd's murder was meant to attract recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Benny Fisher, who grew up with Brewer's father in rural
Delta County, described the accused killer as ``just a country
boy'' and recalled nothing in his background that could engender
violent racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lawrence Brewers were a good family,'' he said. ``They
went to church. They weren't mean to the kids. ... Brewer had to
pick up (the hatred) in prison. When the boy went off to prison, he
fell in with the wrong gang. It destroyed his life as well as his
parents' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime Brewer allegedly committed in Jasper, he said, ``was
worse than crucifying Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who recalled Brewer from his teen-age years in the Delta
County hamlet of Klondike, remembered an uncommunicative youth,
more feckless than malign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the loners,'' said Sam Fall, Brewer's high
school physical education instructor. ``He wouldn't say a word.
You'd never see him smile. I've watched kids for 30 years. He
seemed unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   An unremarkable student who excelled in nothing, Brewer was ``a
guy who didn't stand out in your mind,'' said Cooper school
Superintendent Fred G. Wilkerson. Brewer, who dropped out of school
in the 11th grade, wasn't even a memorable discipline problem,
Wilkerson said. ``There was certainly no indication that he someday
would commit the most despicable act in history.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Klondike residents said Brewer and his friends plagued the
community of 135 with petty crime. Once, the youths stole parts
from a vehicle on a used car lot, the owner contended. Sometimes
the criminally inclined teens perched on the Klondike water tank to
drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a real bad one,'' added former sheriff's deputy Glen
Stone. ``He was just another one who had too much time on his
hands. He was one of those into drugs _ marijuana _ and then he
started doing burglaries.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of his first arrest in the fall of 1986, Brewer had
been linked to as many as 16 burglaries, many of them poorly
planned, almost desultory adventures in lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Brewer and his accomplices targeted acquaintances or even
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer occasionally expressed remorse for his crimes. ``I know
what I did was wrong,'' he told authorities after he was
apprehended for burglarizing the home of a relative. ``I'm sorry
for what I did and want to get right with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certain that he was sorry that he was in the situation he
was in,'' Delta County District Attorney Frank Long observed dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer began serving a seven-year sentence for burglary in
summer 1987 at the Hilltop prison in Gatesville. Brewer was paroled
in February 1988, but returned to prison in May 1989 with a 15-year
sentence for possession of cocaine in Scurry County in northwest
Texas. Paroled in May 1991, he returned to prison a second time in
February 1994 for a technical parole violation such as failing to
report to his parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was released from prison a final time in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During the slightly more than seven years he was locked up in
county jails or state prisons, Brewer was cited no less than seven
times for violating regulations. While held in the Beto I Unit at
Tennessee Colony, where he met Bill King, Brewer received ``major
punishments'' for refusing to work, being absent from his assigned
location and participating in a riot.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's 1997 release under the state's mandatory supervision
program warranted the highest level of supervision, said Emmer
Gray-Mallard, a pardons and paroles spokeswoman. Had the Paris
parole office that was assigned to his case possessed the
equipment, Brewer would have been subject to electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's father declined to be interviewed for this story. ``I
just can't stand it anymore,'' he blurted in ordering a reporter to
leave his Sulphur Springs home. But last year, in a brief interview
with the Houston Chronicle, he admitted he had been appalled when
his son visited him after his last release.
</P>
<P>
   The younger man's arms and body were covered with prison
tattoos, including Nazi ``SS'' lightning bolts and a KKK emblem.
The elder Brewer advised his son that such adornment was ``a
sickness,'' and the ex-con departed in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   The next development in Brewer's story reveals how deeply his
life is rooted in Delta County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence Brewer,'' said Sheriff Fisher, ``took up with my
son's ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Brewer lived with Tammy Perritt and her
young children and another woman, Kara Pruitt, in a battered mobile
home in the Hopkins County community of Como.
</P>
<P>
   Perritt and Pruitt declined to be interviewed, but in an earlier
interview with the Beaumont Enterprise, Pruitt described Brewer as
a ``loving'' individual who took good care of Perritt's children
and expressed no racist feelings.
</P>
<P>
   In late spring 1998, Como Assistant Police Chief Donald Meeks
made what he thought was a routine traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel was Lawrence Russell Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed extremely nervous,'' Meeks recalled. ``I asked him
why he seemed so anxious, and he said that he was just out of the
penitentiary and he was nervous around police.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious, Meeks asked, and was granted, permission to search
the car. ``We searched it bumper to bumper for drugs or weapons,
but it came up clean,'' he said. ``It looked like he had all his
earthly possessions in there, everything very neatly stacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy had told me that she was kicking him out of the house
because he wouldn't work, so I wasn't too surprised. I asked him
where he was going. He said Houston. He was going to look for
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer had told the same story to his father and his parole
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he ever went to Houston is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, by late May, Brewer was a hell-raising resident of
a rundown apartment complex in Jasper, more than 100 miles from his
reputed destination.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate?
</P>
<P>
   Bill King.

KOSOVO BOMBING COSTS U.S. $40 MILLION PER DAY 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cost of waging war, even an undeclared one, is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already spent nearly $1 billion in its
effort to end ethnic violence in Yugoslavia, and the price tag is
rising by nearly $40 million per day, according to an independent
accounting organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If White House predictions are correct that NATO's bombing
campaign could continue for several more months, the United States'
cost of the allied operation could reach $4.6 billion by mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first 15 days of the nearly month-old conflict, the
United States spent about $500 million on the military operation.
That amount has since risen to nearly $950 million, the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   And if the air campaign develops into a ground war, the
mission's expense would increase astronomically, said Steven
Kosiak, a CSBA analyst. But President Clinton has continued to
state publicly that NATO has no intention of adding ground troops
to the aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the operation's escalating costs, Clinton will soon
ask Congress to appropriate $3 billion to $4 billion more for the
effort, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said last week.
Congressional sources, however, said the request could be for as
much as $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., a
leading congressional hawk, voiced support for any additional money
Clinton might seek to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
displacement of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that the Congress act on that (presidential
request) and send a strong signal to Milosevic,'' Warner said
during a committee hearing last week on NATO's Operation Allied
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty members of Congress, led by the Senate's assistant
majority leader, Don Nickles, R-Okla., are on a fact-finding
mission in the Balkans this weekend to weigh the financial needs of
U.S. forces fighting in the region. The delegation consists of 10
senators and 10 House members divided evenly between Republicans
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not disclosed how much the war has cost,
leaving the accounting center to calculate U.S. expenses based on
the price of the warplanes used and the munitions expended.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United States lost $70 million in a matter of
moments when an F-117A jet crashed March 27 in Yugoslavia, perhaps
due to hostile fire, the center said. The pilot was rescued, but
the multimillion-dollar plane was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also has spent $220 million in missiles fired
during the Kosovo conflict. These munitions include 100 Tomahawk
land-attack missiles, at $1 million each, and 60 conventional
air-launched cruised missiles, at $2 million a piece.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CSBA estimated that a total of 600 unguided
munitions were fired at ground targets during 600 of the U.S.
aircraft sorties. At a cost of $50,000 each, the United States has
spent $30 million on those munitions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. planes also have fired an estimated $70 million in
munitions in trying to destroy Yugoslav air defenses, the center
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flights themselves, CSBA said the United States has
spent more than $50 million on the more than 5,000 U.S. sorties so
far, based on a rate of $10,000 per flight, and there is no letup
in sight. NATO's military commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
said last week that the United States plans to send an additional
300 aircraft to the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the air war, however, pales in comparison to what a
land invasion would cost, said CSBA's Kosiak. Depending on the
scope of the ground war, the cost could escalate from several
billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United States would sustain exorbitant expenses
if NATO were to opt for a decisive ground force to oust Milosevic
and occupy a large area of Yugoslavia while facing resistance from
Yugoslav soldiers, Kosiak said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a peacekeeping force of 4,000 U.S. troops, limited to
escorting refugees back to Kosovo, would cost several billion
dollars, Kosiak said. Maintaining that peacekeeping force in Kosovo
would cost about $1 billion annually, he said, noting that the
United States is spending about $2 billion per year to support
9,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But predicting the cost of a military campaign is difficult,
especially with regard to Yugoslavia, where the issue of whether
ground troops will become involved has not been resolved, Kosiak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the NATO military leader, conceded last week that the
financial cost of Operation Allied Force would be high. But he
added the costs of the air campaign ``will be far more substantial
for Yugoslavia.''

MISSING ATHEIST ONCE COMPLAINED OF POLICE BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Shortly before vanishing in September 1995,
atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair sent an angry letter to her
followers about her troubles with the Austin Police Department and
with a former employee, David R. Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, had just plead guilty to stealing $54,400 from
O'Hair's atheist organizations the year before. He is now a prime
suspect in her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy essay in the July 1995 edition of the American
Atheist Newsletter, O'Hair accused law enforcement officials in
Austin of bias against atheists in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Waters had stolen this amount of money from any church,
or had invaded the home of any minister, he would have been
arrested within hours, tried and convicted within days, and would
even now be serving a term in the Texas state penitentiary,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair had risen to prominence more than three decades ago in
the wake of federal court battles to remove prayer and Bible
reading from public schools. She later ran a cluster of atheist
organizations in Austin with her two adult children _ Jon Garth
Murray and Robin Murray O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since O'Hair's disappearance, similar complaints of
police indifference have been raised by other atheist leaders and
O'Hair's surviving son, William Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin police, however, discount any bias against atheists
and say they thoroughly investigated the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regrettable that William Murray feels the way he does.
Austin Police Department detectives have put forth a great deal of
time, effort and energy into locating his family members,'' the
department said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Murray-O'Hairs were not reported missing for a year after
their initial disappearance, and evidence indicated they were in
San Antonio after they left Austin. No evidence of foul play in
Austin was ever uncovered,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair's angry newsletter came two months before she and her two
children disappeared after spending a month in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   They vanished hours after picking up $500,000 in gold coins
purchased with atheist funds transferred from New Zealand. All
three are presumed dead, although no bodies have been found and no
one is charged with any crimes related to their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   However, Waters is currently being held in lieu of bond on a
federal firearms offense, and the FBI is actively investigating him
as a suspect in the O'Hair case.
</P>
<P>
   Waters began working for O'Hair as a typesetter in February
1993. O'Hair's last newsletter provides a lengthy, if one-sided,
account of what went wrong after Waters was promoted in January
1994 to manage the office of American Atheist General Headquarters
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Waters was a good worker, steady and reliable. He learned
quickly and seemed to manage office routines well,'' noted O'Hair
in explaining the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Hair family members traveled to San Diego to defend
themselves in a lawsuit in March 1994, Waters was left in charge
and also had keys to the O'Hair home.
</P>
<P>
   But when the three returned in early April, the staff had been
laid off, the office was closed and Waters was gone, leaving behind
only a cryptic message on an office answering machine, according to
the O'Hair letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had quit because he `could no longer tolerate the mystique
of the organizations,''' she wrote. The $54,4000 soon turned up
missing from atheist accounts and was traced to checks Waters had
written to himself. In May 1995, Waters pleaded guilty to stealing
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite prior convictions for murder, battery and forgery,
Waters was sentenced to 10 years' probation and was ordered to make
restitution to the atheists.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair thought the punishment was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Waters has not even been asked what he did with the money,
or if he has any left. Now, if you stop and think about this deal,
wouldn't you be willing to get about $55,000 in cash and pay it
back in ten years at $500 a month with absolutely no interest?''
O'Hair wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``After ... the judge declined to issue a restraining order
against Mr. Waters, although several of his `priors' involved
physical violence, it was decided that a seven-foot steel-link
fence must be erected around the General Headquarters building and
land,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the O'Hairs' fate.
He believes they are probably hiding overseas, living off funds
siphoned from atheist accounts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past three years, the Austin Police have
subscribed to the same general theory, assigning a young detective
to the case, and treating it as a voluntary disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Even after information was published last summer suggesting a
kidnapping and murder and another source provided specific leads
and names to the police, the department was unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing indicates foul play. There's nothing to indicate to me
they would not be alive. They are just missing,'' Sgt. Steve Baker
said in January. Baker worked the case until late last year.
</P>
<P>
   While critical of the police, William Murray doubts any
philosophical bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was not my mother's atheism. She was just not a nice
person to deal with and I believe a lot of the indifference on the
part of the Austin police was a policy of good riddance,'' Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very early on I sent a fax to the police chief, asking her to
reassign the case. I got back a flippant response from some
underling saying that the most competent officers were involved,
but in fact the matter was being handled by someone who
investigates 14-year-old runaway juveniles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In her last newsletter, O'Hair said the police were indifferent
to a series of disturbing events at American Atheist General
Headquarters in Austin in early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The problems included the theft of a computer loaded with
proprietary files, the theft of $60,000 in bonds from an office
safe, and the embezzlement of $54,400 to which Waters later pleaded
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the police did nothing; the Murray-O'Hairs alone
traced Mr. Waters' every step and reported it to the police, piece
by piece,'' O'Hair wrote of the investigation of Waters.
</P>
<P>
   David Travis, an O'Hair employee, confirmed the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were given all the particulars by the
Murray-O'Hairs. I forget what all they took down there, bank
records, canceled checks, but there was no doubt whatsoever who had
written and cashed all those checks. David had done it himself,''
Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the police didn't even bother to pick him up. He lived in
the same apartment then, and I was very surprised when he went down
and turned himself in,'' Travis said.
</P>
<P>
   The police, however, say they acted quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theft was reported April 9, 1994. Waters was charged with
theft by appropriation ... on April 13, 1994, when a warrant was
issued for his arrest. He turned himself in on April 29, 1994,''
the police statement said.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ As a solitary voice intones prayers to Allah,
Umer Hoxha joins about 30 other worshipers on the mosque floor,
touching his nose and forehead to the carpet, submitting himself to
the will of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is great,'' the muezzin sings in staccato Arabic, as Hoxha
and 30 other men go through their late-afternoon prostrations.
``God is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha, a Kosovar refugee, has much to relinquish to God's
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Though he, his wife and three children have reached safety,
Hoxha has no idea when they will be able to return to Kosovo. He
has no idea what has become of his home. He has no idea what has
happened to many of his friends, relatives and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like thousands of other ethnic Albanians who have fled
Kosovo over the past three weeks, Hoxha, 45, says he has reason to
be thankful. He and his family found refuge in the basement of a
small mosque tucked into a working-class neighborhood shortly after
they arrived in the Albanian capital.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks now, the mosque has provided Hoxha's family and
23 other Kosovars with food and clothing, putting a financial
strain on the hand-to-mouth congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will remember the mercy of these people for a long time,''
Hoxha says, as he and other refugees sit talking on the thick
carpets and mattresses in the basement of the mosque. ``We will
remember this kindness our whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Albania, a poor, disheveled country that is still
grappling for an identity eight years after the fall of its
hard-line communist regime, people have thrown open their homes,
wallets and hearts to the flood of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   About 60,000 of the estimated 300,000 Kosovars who have poured
into Albania since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March 24 have
found refuge in tent cities and makeshift shelters set up by NATO
forces and private relief agencies. But four times that number have
been taken in by mosques, churches and families across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Albanians, and we are assisting them through
difficult times,'' says Hamet Balla, a clergyman at the mosque
where Hoxha and his family are staying. ``We are all one nation. We
have heard from our grandfathers _ and now we are seeing with our
own eyes _ that Serbia is the cruelest enemy of the Albanian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Albanians, like the vast majority of Kosovars, are Muslim.
Yet the help offered to the newcomers cuts across religious lines,
many say.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one cares about religion. People don't even ask,'' says
Muharrem Loxha, a 45-year-old window-maker from the Kosovo town of
Peji. Loxha, a Muslim, is living in the Tirana apartment of an
Orthodox Christian along with his wife, three children and 17 other
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians or Orthodox or Muslim, we are all Albanian,'' Loxha
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians say that the refugee crisis has galvanized their
country of 3.3 million people. Many of those providing refuge to
the Kosovars say they are motivated both by a sense of charity and
by a patriotic desire for a ``Greater Albania,'' which would unite
ethnic Albanian communities across the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are our brothers,'' Eduart Emiri, an 18-year-old
student, says of the refugees, as he performs volunteer work in the
kitchen of a camp set up for the Kosovars outside Tirana. ``We hope
that someday Kosovo is part of Albania again.''
</P>
<P>
   That dream is shared by many Kosovars and feared by Albania's
neighbors. It is the sort of dream that has kept the region in
turmoil for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of Albanian nationalist aspirations has apparently played a
part in the harsh treatment of Kosovar refugees in neighboring
Macedonia. Ethnic Albanians account for as much as 30 percent of
that country's population of about 2 million people. Some people in
Macedonia fear that hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees could
tip the scale in the Albanians' favor.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the resurgence of nationalism in Albania has
taken a back seat to the problem of handling the crush of refugees.
Already the poorest country in Europe with a per-capita income of
$830 a year, Albania must find a way to absorb a flood of newcomers
equal to a 10th of its population.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials warned Friday that tens of thousands of
additional refugees could cross the Yugoslav border this weekend
because of a renewed Serbian offensive in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO governments and aid agencies have been providing shelter,
food and other basic necessities to Kosovars living in refugee
camps. But proposals to give food rations and cash subsidies to
Albanians who have taken refugees into their homes remain in the
discussion stage.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' Albanian hosts are largely on their own, at least
for now. And because many Kosovar families do not want to be
separated, Albanians who open their doors to the refugees often
find 10, 15 or 20 strangers living in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our duty to share what little we have with those who
need it,'' Balla says.
</P>
<P>
   Since communism collapsed in Albania in 1991, the transition to
a free-market economy has been frenetic.
</P>
<P>
   As investment money poured in and Albanians went on a buying
spree for consumer goods, economic growth averaged 10 percent a
year for much of the decade. But feckless government policies,
rampant corruption and the collapse of pyramid investment schemes
that promised interest rates of 60 percent or more a year combined
to scuttle the good times.
</P>
<P>
   The economy crashed in early 1997, bankrupting many Albanians
and sending a wave of desperate job seekers sailing for Italy and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   An economic recovery is under way, but unemployment has hit 30
percent, and even good jobs pay less than $5 a day. Many Albanians
eat only because of money sent home by relatives working in other
European countries or in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And now come the Kosovars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard,'' says William Garvelink, an official
with the U.S. Agency for International Development who is directing
the organization's relief efforts in Tirana. ``You add this many
people into a country, the entire social infrastructure _ not to
mention the physical infrastructure _ is overloaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Carried from the Yugoslav border in buses, flatbed trucks and
farm wagons pulled by tractors, Kosovar refugees bounce over
Albania's deeply potholed roads, past gutted factories, fallow
fields and half-built villas whose owners went bust in the 1997
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Like Easter eggs hidden in a yard, small concrete bunkers pepper
the hillsides and pastures. The former communist government,
fearing invasion from a host of real or imagined enemies, ordered
700,000 of the bunkers to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Skeletons of hundreds of cars, the casualties of Albania's early
fling with modern consumerism, flank the road that links the border
to Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vehicles were smashed in accidents. Forbidden to own
cars under the communists, most Albanians only recently learned to
drive, and traffic remains dangerous and chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the cars lining the road were simply abandoned.
After the collapse of communism, motion-craving but cash-poor
Albanians bought up Europe's jalopies. When those cars broke down,
their owners simply abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Albania is swimming in a sea of Mercedes Benzes and other
luxury vehicles, many of them reported stolen in Germany and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The abundance of stolen cars reflects the larger problem of
organized crime. The country is rife with gangs, many of them based
on old clan relationships that re-emerged after the fall of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is considered such a problem that U.S. troops taking part
in the refugee relief operation at the Tirana airport have been
restricted to their base.
</P>
<P>
   How the refugees will ultimately affect Albania depends on how
long they stay and on how much international help is sent, some
experts says.
</P>
<P>
   Valdete Sala, the program manager of a Tirana foundation, says
the influx of refugees has created ``such an emergency, that all we
can do is react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is thinking about what will happen tomorrow,'' cautions
Sala, whose organization funds projects aimed at strengthening
civil society. ``To take in seven people or 15 people _ no family
in Albania can do that for a long time. This will have a great
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the talk of unity, Albania remains sharply divided
between people living in the northern mountains and those residing
along the coast and on the central plains. Social tensions have
been stoked since 1991 by the migration of hundreds of thousands of
northerners to Tirana and other Albanian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Garvelink and other foreign relief officials warn that unless
the Albanian people receive aid along with the refugees, the
current charitable mood could turn bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look for all the world that the refugees are
getting everything,'' Garvelink says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Albanians express hope that the refugee crisis will
force many people here to re-evaluate their lives and change their
country for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the resurrection of Albania, both spiritually and
culturally,`` says Pellumb Vorpsi, a music composer and a prominent
member of the mosque where Umer Hoxha and other Kosovar refugees
are staying. ``If people believe in God, all the other problems
will be resolved.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18)  
 (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOUGHTON, Mass. _ In 1998, the National Basketball Association
players were locked out and buyers of athletic shoes went on
strike. Hurt by changing fashions, foreign recessions and the job
dispute that gave the league's shoe spokesmen a collective bad
name, shoemakers saw their earnings plunge. As a result, Reebok,
for one, lost more than half its stock market value last year.
</P>
<P>
   So in December, Reebok called in its ace: Angel Martinez. He had
pulled Reebok out from Nike's shadow in the 1980s, when he created
the aerobic-workout shoe. And as chief executive of Rockport,
Reebok's street shoe subsidiary, the last four years, he even
managed to convince younger shoppers that their grandfathers'
clunky brown shoes could be sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reebok is waiting to see what magic Martinez, as its new
marketing director, can create for its flagship brand. Should he do
well, he could position himself to eventually succeed Paul Fireman
as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says he wants to put the humanity back into Reebok and
its products. Instead of sitting grimly at computers, he says,
employees should spend more time jamming, both on the company
basketball court and in a company jazz band he hopes to revive.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of making customers feel good not only about their
shoes, but also about the workers who made them _ under more humane
conditions than past industry practice _ and of the benevolent
athletes who promote the products. While some analysts say Reebok's
foreign factories treat workers better than most in those
countries, some human-rights groups call for far higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, from Reebok's headquarters in this suburb south of
Boston, announces the end of the hype. ``Yes, we did go through
that period where you had to have the athlete with the giant
contract slam-dunking in the NBA or doing incredible things in the
Olympics to sell any shoes,'' he said. ``And that's not who we
were. All we're doing now is going back to our roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Way back. It is hard to remember when this corporate giant was
not spending more than $140 million a year on advertising,
promoting gimmicks like shoes that inflated. But if there's a model
for the down-to-earth company that Reebok now strives to be, it is
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old with close-cropped dark brown hair and a goatee,
he wears a collarless dress shirt and a pair of the black Rockports
he helped glamorize. He spoke frankly about the mind-set that
brought Reebok to its present state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an industry on steroids,'' he said. ``It's been an
industry that convinced itself that the average consumer out there
was going to go from nine pairs a year of $100 shoes to 12 pairs a
year of $100 shoes. And the consumer decided that no, maybe two
pair a year was all they need.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer a strong challenger to Nike _ which has about 45
percent of the athletic footwear market, to Reebok's 10 percent _
the company is depending on its new chunky DMX design for serious
runners, a strong seller since it was introduced last year. But
even as he discusses its virtues, Martinez freely acknowledges that
the garish blue-and-chartreuse DMX in his hand is no thing of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was: `boy, that is ugly,''' he said. ``But
you know what happened? It happened for the Volkswagen Beetle,
right? People buy it despite it being ugly. It feels so good that
they buy it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street remains skeptical. John Shanley, an analyst with
First Security Van Kasper, doubts that customers are looking for
the softer side of Reebok. ``We're talking about teen-age males,
who have almost no sense of humanity,'' Shanley said. ``They are
basically looking for whatever is new, whatever is hottest.''
</P>
<P>
   Style was crucial when Martinez was a Reebok marketer in the
1980s. It was the start of the aerobics craze, and he saw that his
wife, Frankie, would rather go barefoot to class than wear
sneakers. ``She didn't want to wear bulky, ugly-looking running
shoes,'' he said. He convinced Fireman to promote a sleeker, yet
very comfortable shoe just for women, and sales took off.
</P>
<P>
   After marketing Reeboks for 14 years, he was sent by Fireman to
head up the stagnant, tradition-bound Rockport in 1994. Linda Lewi,
now Rockport's senior vice president for marketing, said Martinez
had encouraged his workers to ``get the hairballs out of the
plumbing.'' Whether it was coming up with new styles or using less
expensive materials, ``he would be the evangelist for that idea,
and really, people would want to suspend their disbelief and join
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireman, 55, confirmed that the Rockport success had helped
groom Martinez as his possible successor. Only one thing has
changed about Martinez in 20 years, he said: ``He gained weight. I
knew him when he was running track and field and he was skinny. Now
he's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez came to America from Cuba when he was 3, to live with
his grandmother's sister in the Bronx. He remembers saving nickels
to buy a $5.95 pair of Converse Chuck Taylors and walking home on
the sides of his feet to keep the soles from getting dirty. Now he
can afford toys like a Harley-Davidson and the Fender Stratocaster
he might play in that company band.
</P>
<P>
   Still, getting employees to loosen up at a headquarters where
100 colleagues were laid off last year is another matter. But
Martinez says he's not kidding when he tells them to shun e-mail in
favor of real chat. ``People weren't talking to each other; nobody
was picking up the phone,'' he said. Pointing to his computer, he
added, ``I almost threw this thing out the window.''

 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ In a state Capitol reception room ornamented
with marble fireplaces and crystal chandeliers, Gov. Jesse Ventura,
wearing blue jeans and white socks and looking like someone who
could use a shave, was talking _ roaring, actually _ about running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could win,'' Ventura said, rattling off poll numbers as he
jutted his broad chin, ``if I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first three months of office, Ventura, the former
professional wrestler known for fighting in a pink boa, has managed
to offend, annoy and outrage plenty of Minnesotans _ but win the
cheers of most.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as much feathers as I've ruffled in being politically
incorrect,'' he said in an interview, ``I get 10-to-1 letters from
people saying that's why they like me.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent public opinion survey showed Ventura with a 57 percent
approval among voters, a high rating, if down from the lofty 72
percent he received just after his stunning triumph last November.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that prides itself on having a painfully earnest
style of trying to say and do the right thing, Ventura has jumped
at every chance to be incendiary _ and then to pour on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In the 27 appointments he has made as governor, he has not named
a single black man or black woman. He joked on national television
_ and later offered a tepid apology _ that St. Paul's confusing
street plan had been designed by ``drunken Irishmen.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that college athletes should not be required to
attend classes. He called, without success, for a salary for his
wife as first lady, and for bodyguards at his suburban horse farm.
And he has crossed swords with Garrison Keillor, the Minnesota
folklorist who is host of ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' the
National Public Radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is loud, profane and often seems ready to explode,
thrusting a forefinger menacingly in the direction of anyone who
poses an unpleasant question.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Carlson, a radio talk-show host and former Minneapolis
mayoral candidate, has had Ventura on her program, where time after
time she has corrected what she called his ``atrocious grammar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we are the envy of the nation or the laughingstock,''
said Mrs. Carlson, the former wife of former Gov. Arne Carlson. ``I
haven't decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Minnesotans, Ventura's antics continue to amuse.
But it is uncertain whether voters will ultimately want more in a
governor than an often delightfully outrageous showman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I like Jesse?'' said Gary Fursetzer, a 45-year-old
Minneapolis limousine driver. ``Sure I like him. Do I think he'll
be a good governor? Well, that's another question.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention and, often, affection he has received, the
mountainous hulk of a governor has yet to show much political
muscle. Steve Schier, a political science professor at Carleton
College, said Ventura, as a third-party candidate, had no real base
of power in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can huff and he can puff, but he can't blow their house
down,'' Schier said. ``Jesse is a man without a political base.
This guy has no votes in the state Senate or House that will,
forgive the pun, go to the mat for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has not pressed hard for any agenda. Indeed, some
politicians have scoffed that Ventura, a boat owner, has made
regulations on watercraft one of his chief concerns. Moreover, some
legislators have complained that Ventura does not always make
himself accessible or engage in the nitty-gritty of government.
</P>
<P>
   The departing Democratic Party chairman, Dick Senese, predicted
that Ventura's outrageous style ``will wear thin,'' especially if
the state's robust economy falters. Senese said the governor's
perceived contempt for negotiation and compromise would ultimately
hinder his ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fond of saying he's not going to play the games
politicians' play,'' Senese said. ``But it's not only the game of
politics, it's the game of life. You and your friends can't decide
what restaurant to go to without discussion and compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Schier said the governor had staked his ground as ``a centrist
with an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His style is fire-engine red,'' he added, ``but his policies
are beige.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That moderation, Schier said, makes the governor appealing to
many Minnesotans who are weary of the very liberal character of the
state's Democratic Farmer Labor Party and the sharply conservative
bearings of its Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On the biggest issue, how to handle the state's budget surplus,
Ventura has sided more often with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He supports a tax rebate that would be capped at incomes of
$100,000 for a household, while Republicans oppose any cap. Ventura
has also proposed big increases in spending for education and
public housing. And he favors the creation of a light rail transit
system between Minneapolis and the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions have won the support of Mayor Sharon Sayles
Belton of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a shared agenda,'' she said of Ventura. Ms. Sayles
Belton, who is black and considered a political liberal,
acknowledged that she had winced when the governor's appointments
did not include any blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the lack of diversity in his Cabinet bring a
glower to the governor's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in quotas,'' he said with an angry growl. ``I
pick the most qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura noted that some of his top advisers have included
blacks. And he said he had received few applications from blacks
for Cabinet positions. Minnesota is more than 90 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also created a stir by requesting, and obtaining, a
permit to carry a pistol. But he said he does not carry a pistol
while making his rounds at the Capitol, as some leaders had feared
he would do.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after an apparent cheating scandal was exposed among
University of Minnesota basketball players, Ventura raised eyebrows
by suggesting on a television show that athletes should not be
bothered by schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is, to eliminate this cheating, or the possibility of
it, why not let kids go to college and just be athletes while
they're there?'' he said. ``No classes. Let them simply play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when they're done, if they don't make it in the NFL, if
they don't make it in the NBA, if they don't make it in pro
baseball, whatever it might be, then give them their scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   He also offended some Minnesotans with his answer to a young
single mother who had described her plight to the governor at a
forum. In essence, the governor told her, she had gotten herself
into trouble and should not expect the government to solve all her
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While some people were outraged by his seeming lack of empathy,
many others cheered the governor for being straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks from the heart like an average, ordinary
Minnesotan,'' said Emmett Carson, the president of the Minneapolis
Foundation, a private group that supports charities. ``That is what
is so refreshing, and sometimes so scary, about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who rarely misses a chance to promote his upcoming
book, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' (Villard), has gotten into a
war of words with a much more understated Minnesota figure,
Keillor. Keillor's book, ``Me, by Jimmy `Big Boy' Valente as Told
to Garrison Keillor,'' a stinging satire of a professional wrestler
with an unmistakable resemblance to the governor, enraged Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has criticized Keillor as ``a highbrow,'' described his
radio show as ``boring'' and said, ``I never watched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he much preferred the brand of humor found in the
movie ``Fargo,'' which lampooned Minnesota stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graphic violence and things you can laugh at,'' he said,
referring to the movie. ``That's much better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for president, Ventura said some polling organizations had
found that nationally, he had the support of 23 to 32 percent of
those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, he would tell the truth, Ventura said, as he
sprinkled his speech with barnyard epithets and roared in delight.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not planning a presidential bid just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never say never,'' he said, folding his powerfully
muscled arms across his chest. ``Ten years ago, if somebody would
have said I'd be governor, I would have laughed.''

SUSPENSE AND JOY FOR SEVEN SURVIVING HOUSTON OCTUPLETS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release, Sunday, April 18, 1999) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The pink and blue balloons and streamers in the yard
announce something special inside the southwest Houston home.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the city garbage can parked next to the curb that tells
the real tale. The 90-gallon container, so full of plastic bags the
lid won't fit on top, is bulging with empty infant formula bottles,
household trash and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   And diapers, diapers and more diapers.
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, two more of the seven surviving Houston octuplets
were discharged from Texas Children's Hospital, bringing the number
of babies at home to five: Sisters Chidi, Chima, Ebuka and Echerem,
and brother Jioke. Ikem, a boy, and Gorom, a girl, are expected
home by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Nkem Chukwu's grueling pregnancy, miraculous
delivery and the babies' robust survival is one of suspense and
joy.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately it's about multiples _ in every sense of the
word.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve daily diaper changes, multiplied by five infants, equals
60. A skilled person can finish the task in about a minute, so at
least one hour of each day is occupied with baby bottoms. Eight
feedings a day times five is 40, and each feeding takes a minimum
of 20 minutes: a total of nearly 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``From morning to night, night to morning,'' said the babies'
grandmother, Janet Chukwu, who takes only short breaks from infant
care to nap or shower.
</P>
<P>
   Five new cribs, store tags still attached, are lined up along
one wall of the dining room, which has been converted into a
nursery. The family is moving into a 5,300-square-foot home,
donated by the giant mortgage company Fannie Mae, in May. The home
is in League City, a suburb southeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Four chairs and a sofa accommodate the steady stream of
volunteers, many of them from the surrounding neighborhood. A sign
posted on the front door tells first-time visitors, ``Please no
pictures yet. Wash your hands B/4 picking up.''
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, two or three babies are awake and sucking on
bottles, being bathed or cuddled, or getting a diaper changed.
Inside the house, all furniture is shoved against the walls as if
to make room for a large party. A newsletter from the Bellaire Area
Mothers of Multiples sits on a table, unopened.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the staggering task at hand, the atmosphere in the
Chukwu household is one of drowsy bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never gone over there and felt frazzled or felt like it
was impossible. It's been fairly smooth,'' said next-door neighbor
Karen Fish. ``We do have times when there are two or three crying
at a time, and you just do the best you can. I've held two babies
at a time, I've seen Grandma (Chukwu) hold three at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chima and Chidi's arrival home was celebrated with Nigerian
religious music and a rousing blessing by the family's pastor,
Gabriel Nwuba of Bible Believers Christian Church. Chukwu, husband
Iyke Louis Udobi, her mother and friends sang and danced _ with a
German TV crew filming _ the babies, each cradled in an adult's
arms, slumbered on.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd dispersed and Chukwu, tired after spending most of the
day at the hospital, simply sighed, ``Hallelujah.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies, conceived with the help of fertility drugs, were
born Dec. 8 and Dec. 20 at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital. It was
the first time a woman had given birth to eight living babies and
the feat thrust Chukwu and Udobi into the international spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu, 29, and Udobi, 42, are both Nigerian-born. They married
five years ago, after Udobi met Chukwu during one of his annual
trips home to Nigeria. Udobi, who has lived in Houston more than 20
years, works two jobs as a respiratory therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu is described as a gregarious woman who loves having
people around. She was intent upon having children.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu saw Dr. Brian Kirshon, a specialist in high-risk
pregnancies, when she was nine weeks pregnant. At that time,
doctors could see only six fetuses in her womb. She was informed
about the risks for high-order multiples, which include learning
disabilities, cerebral palsy, vision problems or death.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors offered to reduce the number of fetuses in her womb in
order to improve the remaining ones' chances of survival. The
procedure, called ``selective reduction,'' involves injecting some
of the fetuses with a drug that stops their heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu refused. The couple had lost triplets the year before,
and Chukwu was determined to have all the children her womb would
bear. She didn't tell her husband, who had been distraught over the
earlier loss, how many babies she was carrying. ``I needed to keep
it to myself,'' she said. ``That was the way I felt then.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 15 weeks, Chukwu was put on complete bed rest. For
the last month of the pregnancy, she was confined to a hospital bed
tilted at a steep angle to keep pressure off her cervix. Doctors
wanted to get the babies to 28 weeks, but she went into labor at 25
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, Ebuka, a girl was born. Her parents have said she is
the generous baby, because she left the womb early to make more
room for her siblings. Doctors saw for the first time there were
seven more. It was uncommon, though not unheard of, for one
multiple to be born while her siblings stayed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu's pregnancy continued. She was taking powerful drugs that
gave her daily nosebleeds. She coughed blood. All the while she
stroked her swollen belly and said, over and over, ``You will not
die, you will live. You will not die, you will live, to testify to
the goodness of the Lord, in this land of the living.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They heard everything,'' Chukwu said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, an ultrasound showed one baby was being pressed
against the side of the uterus by the other siblings. The womb was
too crowded. Kirshon decided to perform an immediate Caesarean
section.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the newborns were taken from the womb, wrapped in
blankets and handed off, bucket-brigade style, to medical personnel
who brought them to the neonatal intensive care unit at Texas
Children's Hospital. The babies were so small their combined weight
was just over 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The delivery was a success, but the drugs Chukwu had been taking
prevented her blood from clotting. After the birth, she began
hemorrhaging. Kirshon told interviewers on a recent ``20/20''
special that Chukwu lost so much blood _ 12 pints _ that she nearly
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly died? Nearly died?'' Chukwu said recently. ``God saved
me. I wasn't going to die. I believed that in my soul, my heart. I
will live.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One week after the Dec. 20 delivery, the condition of Odera, the
smallest baby and the one who had been pressed against the wall of
the uterus, began to deteriorate. Her lungs never developed as
fully as the others, and on Dec. 27 she died.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, the remaining babies underwent surgeries
and fought off infections. In the medical community and in the
media, a debate raged over whether the birth of octuplets was a
miracle or a mistake, a signal that fertility medicine should be
regulated somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a nightmare,'' Kirshon told ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see some form of control to prevent this
catastrophe. I think there has to be a lot of admiration for her,
... but it's not something that should be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   In early January, doctors examined an ultrasound view of each
babies' brain, to look for signs of bleeding. Brain bleeding,
common among babies born so early, is a precursor to cerebral
palsy. To the doctors' surprise and delight, the infants' brains
appeared normal.
</P>
<P>
   Ounce by ounce, they began to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Since the birth, the family has been showered with presents _ a
house, a van, $1 million in baby furniture, an unlimited supply of
infant formula and diapers. They've also been inundated with
requests for interviews, video footage and photographs. Chukwu and
Udobi turned publicity over to Chukwu's brother in Massachusetts,
who in turn looked to the McCaugheys of Iowa, who had septuplets in
1997, as a model for how to handle the media.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from brief appearances at press conferences held at the
hospital or in front of their new home, the family granted no
interviews until after a special about them aired last month on
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Udobi explained: ``We refused to give interviews until our kids
were out of the woods. And our kids are now out of the woods. We
can talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching a recent broadcast, Udobi is more amused than offended
when the TV reporter says that some people believe the family has
turned the birth of the babies into a ``commercial bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so, I don't think so. It's not commercial, ''
Udobi said. ``I have insurance, but there are some things that are
not covered. I have to take care of the kids. I don't have
scholarships yet. I have to take care of them. I work hard. I'm a
hard-working man.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has been careful about how they answer questions
regarding two troubling, or at least puzzling, aspects of their
story. In September, Udobi was charged with hitting his
mother-in-law with a chair. (In February, he pleaded no contest to
the misdemeanor and received a probated sentence.) In addition,
Udobi, who has been married twice before, was not present when the
seven babies were delivered Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues fueled speculation about the family's stability and
whether they could handle the tremendous job of caring for their
brood. But with Udobi playing host, offering soft drinks to
visitors, the domestic scene now is one of hospitality and
tranquility, muted by the exhaustion common to all new parents.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Fish, who barely knew Chukwu before the birth but is
now a central organizer of the babies' care, describes the
September assault as an out-of-character flare-up. She is the one
who called 911 at Chukwu's request after Chukwu came over that
night, upset that her husband was hurting her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole incident was stress-related,'' said Fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she was really distraught over losing those (triplets).
That seemed to be a priority in her life, having a child. I don't
know what caused it, it seemed out of character for Iyke. Things
like that just happen sometimes. They're very loving toward each
other. He's taking part in caring for them. I think the misdemeanor
probably was frustration on his part. It's hard to live with your
mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, while grandmother Chukwu and neighbor
Rose Okorocha looked after the infants, who now weigh a sturdy
seven or eight pounds each, Chukwu and Udobi sat holding hands in
the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited, we are very excited. The other two will join
them in no time,'' Udobi said. ``We get sleep whenever we can. ...
God has been so wonderful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Udobi explains that he was not present at the Dec. 20 delivery
because the Caesarean section was emergency surgery and he could
not be located in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at work and I was incommunicado because I have two jobs.
They didn't know where I was working that afternoon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Udobi explains, that is why he learned about the astonishing
birth when a friend reached him on the phone and told him to turn
on the television. As he watched the news on CNN, his hands began
shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got me a relief, I left,'' he said. ``Again, I
wasn't expecting the babies to be delivered. I was asking God for
(the pregnancy) to be extended.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the babies' care has combined deeply
religious and highly practical concerns. Yemi Adekunle, pastor of
Vineyard Christian Ministries International in southwest Houston,
said he ``made it a point of duty'' to visit Chukwu in the hospital
when he learned of Chukwu's decision to carry all eight babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in life that God can't give to us,'' he would
pray. ``There's no problem that prayer cannot undo. There's nothing
that prayer cannot change.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 11 p.m. on the day that Chidi and Chima came home from
the hospital, Fish said she and another woman were alone in the
nursery with the babies while the rest of the family slept.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rev. Nwuba and the Rev. Adekunle arrived. Fish said the
men went into the darkened living room where, for more than an
hour, they sang songs, read Scripture and prayed, just the two of
them. Afterward, Nwuba came into the nursery and asked for the
fussiest baby. He raised the baby up and said a prayer, then stayed
until 1 a.m. soothing the infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tears were just streaming down my face,'' Fish said. ``I was
just amazed. It brought to my realization that those babies have
been covered with prayer from day one, and so had Nkem.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu and Udobi said they are not worried about losing their
support network when they move to League City. Fish, already lining
up a second string of volunteers, is hoping friends infused with
the volunteer spirit will be willing to make the 30- to 45-minute
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of the help has come from Houston's substantial
Nigerian community, much of which is concentrated in southwest
Houston, Chukwu took note of the throngs of children and adults who
came by for punch and cookies when the family toured the new house
in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they love kids,'' she said. ``I don't expect any
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Adekunle spoke well of the future neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be part of their life,'' he said. ``I don't think
that should be a problem. ... (In Africa) we believe in this kind
of extended family. Those kids are blessings from God, and God will
provide for them.''

TELECOM ITALIA IS SAID TO DISCUSS MERGER WITH DEUTSCHE TELEKOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Telecom Italia SpA, trying to thwart a hostile takeover
bid by its main domestic rival, Olivetti SpA, is discussing a
possible merger with Deutsche Telekom AG, Italian officials and
others close to the companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement is far from certain, but such a combination would
create one of the world's biggest companies, with a a stock market
value of $216 billion and annual revenue totaling $63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions, between Telecom Italia chief executive Franco
Bernabe and Ron Sommer, his counterpart at Deutsche Telekom, have
been going on for a while, but a note of urgency was injected after
shareholders foiled Bernabe's plans to deflect a $65 billion
hostile bid by Olivetti, Italy's No. 2 phone company, when they
turned out last Saturday for a shareholder meeting in insufficient
numbers for a quorum.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever form a deal might take, it is sure to be complicated.
It would be contingent, in part, on Deutsche Telekom's withdrawal
from a global alliance it has formed with France Telecom and Sprint
Corp., people close to the companies said. It would also have to be
approved by both the German and Italian governments, which continue
to hold shares in both companies, and would face close scrutiny by
the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could also face resistance from some of Deutsche
Telekom's current partners, including France Telecom, which has a
reciprocal 2 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, and is a partner
with Deutsche Telekom and the Italian energy utility Enel SpA in an
Italian phone company called Wind.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted skeptically to the talks, which were reported
Friday in The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times of
London. In Frankfurt, Deutsche Telekom's share price was virtually
unchanged at 38.15 euros, or $40.43, while on the Milan exchange
the price of Telecom Italia rose 3 percent, to 9.88 euros, still
below the price of 11.50 euros Olivetti is offering.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said skepticism was based largely on the political
hurdles any such deal would face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is plain there are obstacles, and they are mainly
political,'' said Robert Grindle, who follows telecommunications at
HSBC Securities in London. The Rome government, he said, would balk
at surrendering control of Telecom Italia, the former national
phone monopoly, to Deutsche Telekom, which remains 72 percent owned
by the German state. Moreover, he said, European Commission
antitrust officials would scrutinize any proposed deal closely,
``all the more so because the Italian regulatory environment is a
benign one.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco said that Bernabe had
informed the Italian Treasury on Thursday of the discussions. But
Visco said any such deal would face ``notable technical problems.''
Given the German government's share in Deutsche Telekom, he said,
it would be tantamount to ``selling Telecom Italia to the German
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema telephoned German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to discuss the proposed merger, his
office said in a statement, but no details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Bernabe began discussing possible deals with a range of European
and U.S. phone companies, including British Telecommunications,
Deutsche Telekom and SBC Communications Inc., not long after he
took over at Telecom Italia late last year in a management
shake-up, one person close to Telecom Italia said. But Bernabe's
assumption was that while merging Telecom Italia with a U.S. phone
company would be politically unacceptable to the Italian
government, this person said, a deal with Deutsche Telekom was
``more palatable because it is European.''
</P>
<P>
   The major concern of Italian officials, people close to Telecom
Italia said, was the potential loss of jobs and the surrender of
control over what Italy continues to regard as a strategic national
industry. To remain competitive, Telecom Italia is expected to have
to shed as many as 40,000 jobs in coming years, regardless of whom
is in control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Telecom Italia declined even to confirm that talks
with Deutsche Telekom had taken place. Ulrich Lissek, a Deutsche
Telekom spokesman in Bonn, said DT had no comment on any possible
acquisitions by Deutsche Telekom, which he said were fueled by the
company's announcement on Thursday that it would sell as much as
$12.7 billion in stock to finance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Should a deal succeed, it would go a long way to redesigning the
landscape of the European telephone business and provide Deutsche
Telekom with ammunition against its fiercest domestic competitor,
Mannesmann AG. In part because of strong competition from
Mannesmann, a steel pipe company turned phone service provider,
Deutsche Telekom's share of the German fixed-line phone business
dropped in 1998 to 76.5 percent from 81.5 percent the year before.
Moreover, Mannesmann would be a big winner if Olivetti won control
of Telecom Italia. If that happens, Mannesmann has agreed to
acquire Olivetti's current phone businesses in Italy for about $10
billion.
</P>
<P>
   To placate concerns of D'Alema's government, people close to
Telecom Italia said, Bernabe is seeking to frame a deal with
Deutsche Telekom as a merger of equals, even though Deutsche
Telekom is almost double Telecom Italia's size.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, any deal would be made contingent on a commitment by
the Bonn government to sell its remaining stake in Deutsche
Telekom, which would already be diluted by the merger with Telecom
Italia. The stock sale announced by Deutsche Telekom this week, in
which the German government would abstain, would dilute the German
government's stake to about 62 percent, Lissek said, and the
government intends further reductions. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ All morning long, a steady stream of grumpy,
forlorn-looking drivers dutifully steered their cars out of the
flowing traffic on Changan Avenue, made a sweeping right turn and
landed in the far-as-you-can-see gridlock of the Second Ring Road.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old, prosperous and poor, the motorists had one thing
in common: the bad luck to be riding in a hatchback car.
</P>
<P>
   To help prepare for China's elaborate celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the Communist state this fall, Beijing's city
planners on Thursday enacted what must be one of the world's
strangest traffic laws: a local ban on hatchbacks during daylight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The central six-mile stretch of Changan, the central
thoroughfare that passes by Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City,
the Great Hall of the People, and Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leaders'
housing compound, officially became a hatchback-free zone. From 7
a.m. to 8 p.m., hatchbacks will have trouble getting to the scores
of hotels, government offices and commercial buildings that line
this majestic eight-lane road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is chaos,'' said Tian Fuhe, the driver of a hatchback
cab, who picked his way along side streets to avoid the forbidden
section of Changan.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulation also bans jeeps and station wagons. Cars must
have a trunk to pass. The new ban affects few government cars,
which are mostly sedans. But it does include some popular car
models and also, as angry commuters discovered, the omnipresent
tiny red hatchback Xiali cars, Beijing's dominant cheap taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's terrible for my business,'' Du Ke said,
standing on a side street next to his idle Xiali, watching
competitors with sedans glide onto Changan. ``I can't take
passengers to the places they want to go. Some won't even get into
my car.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has nothing against hatchbacks. City
officials simply needed to reduce traffic on the normally congested
Changan Avenue by 20 percent to help beautification projects that
now line the street, according the Beijing Municipal Public
Security Traffic Management Bureau. Hatchbacks became the fall guy
because it happens that 20 percent of cars in Beijing are
hatchbacks, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Changan is the only major east-west artery in the heart of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   What was good for Changan proved a burden to the rest of
downtown Beijing, as drivers complained that the regulation
produced vast traffic jams on the smaller roads and pointed out
that their roundabout journeys were adding to the capital's air
pollution. ``Trunkless'' drivers who could not use the avenue found
crosstown travel times doubled on many routes.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials _ and some Beijingers _ are clearly
prepared to make sacrifices for Changan. The avenue will be the
stage for a military review and parade involving half a million
people on China's National Day, Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law will have a bad influence on my life, but I'll strive
to overcome it,'' said Yang Zhigang, a man in his 40s, who drives a
station wagon. ``It's an important day, and they're going all
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, both sides of the avenue have been
transformed into a six-mile-long, 30-foot-wide construction site,
dotted with gaping holes, pyramids of pipes and bricks, and long
blue metal fences.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards have been dismantled according to government mandate.
Small stores and old homes have been leveled. Most of the old
sidewalk tiles, trees and curbstones have been removed, leaving
vast swaths of dusty rubble-strewn earth.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of workers from the Beijing Urban Planning Co. in
bright blue coveralls and orange baseball caps are busily sifting
dirt, spreading cement, and carting away branches and bricks from a
demolished courtyard home. Unemployed workers with pushcarts wait
to collect scrap metal as each building falls.
</P>
<P>
   The vast demolition job is the first step in a total facelift
that will widen and landscape Changan anew by October.
</P>
<P>
   With construction encroaching on sidewalks and even taking over
bike lanes, Changan's normal traffic problem has gotten worse in
recent weeks _ and that demanded an immediate and drastic solution,
some drivers said, not only because it interfered with the
renovations, but also because Chinese officials use Changan to go
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Officials defended their choice as fair: the new restrictions
cut across the vehicular class system, they said, including cars
that are expensive and those that are cheap, cars owned by the rich
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset, but at least I feel better that it was unbiased,''
said Yang, the station wagon driver. ``If they said Cherokees could
go on Changan but cheaper Citroens couldn't, there would be
conflicts. Companies would complain. This makes things easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing car owners have grown accustomed to the city's
ever-changing driving restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   For many months private cars could drive into town only every
other day, depending on their license plate number; that ended.
Then the city announced that the most common type of van, a cheap
tinny vehicle called a miandi, could no longer drive within the
city center on weekdays; the miandi was supposedly singled out
because of its extremely polluting exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the hatchback ban is temporary, though it might
not end ``until the end of the celebration activities'' in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mei banfa!'' _ ``It can't be helped!'' _ was the day's refrain
as the ban went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make me happy or unhappy _ we're used to this kind
of thing,'' said Du, the taxi driver. ``It's like this: for years
you use one tool to fix something. And then you're told you can't
use it anymore. You find another way.''

FATUMA ROBA: DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY VERY WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When Abebe Bikila ran, poetry rode along on his slim
shoulders. To watch old film of the legendary Ethiopian in the 1960
Olympics in Rome, where he competed barefoot and straight and
proud, is to understand that for the chosen few, running a marathon
is the most natural thing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Fatuma Roba takes off from Hopkinton on Monday in search of
her third consecutive Boston Marathon win _ a feat accomplished by
only one woman, Uta Pippig, since women were officially allowed to
compete in 1972 _ there will be many reasons to be reminded of
Bikila.
</P>
<P>
   Roba's style, fluid and seemingly without idiosyncrasy.
</P>
<P>
   Her carriage, one of grace and subtle authority.
</P>
<P>
   And her dreams, grand and humble at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to win again the Olympics, like my countryman,''
she said this week through a translator, a day after arriving from
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. ``To match the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, few had heard of Bikila before he won that Olympic
marathon, becoming the first black African to do so and the first
Ethiopian to bring home a gold medal. His time of 2 hours 15
minutes 17 seconds was a world record. In 1964, he repeated his
triumph in Tokyo, this time in 2:12:12, another world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened the door, not only for all Ethiopians but for all
Africans,'' said the 27-year-old Roba, born just a year before
Bikila died of a brain hemorrhage in 1973 after being left
paralyzed from a car crash in 1969. He received a state funeral in
Addis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, few had heard of Roba before she entered Centennial
Olympic Stadium in Atlanta far in front of her competitors, taking
the gold medal in 2:26:05 and, in the process, opening still more
doors. ``This is not only a very special thing for me, but also for
my country and all African women,'' she said after the victory,
still wrapped in her country's flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a hero like him, but a lot of people know me because
I make the same history at the Olympics,'' said the first black
African woman to win marathon gold. ``Especially children. Now they
want to be like me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roba first came to Boston, in 1997, she was intent on
validating her win in Atlanta. She succeeded, dominating in the
Newton hills and outlasting South Africa's Elana Meyer and Colleen
De Reuck in 2:26:23 to become the first African woman to win here
and ending the three-year reign of Pippig, who finished fourth.
Last year, Roba left De Reuck at the 16-mile mark and ran smoothly,
despite pain behind her left knee that had hampered her training
and hurt throughout the race, to win in a personal-best time of
2:23:21.
</P>
<P>
   But, oddly, she has not run well elsewhere. At the World
Championships in Athens in 1997, she dropped out midway with a leg
injury. At Tokyo in 1997 she was fourth, in 2:30:39; last year she
could manage no better than eighth there in 2:36:22, running with a
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance,'' answered Roba when asked why she runs so superbly in
Boston while struggling on other courses.
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely, said her agent, Mark Wetmore of Global Athletics &AMP;
Marketing. ``I don't think she's as good on a flat course,'' he
offered. ``She's very much faster on a difficult course. She thinks
if she can break the world record, she can do it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Roba remains reluctant to speak English, she has begun
spending more time in this country. For several months after last
year's race, she and several other Ethiopian runners, including
1989 Boston champion Abebe Mekonnen, rented a house on South
Mission Beach in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fit right in,'' said Mike Long of Elite Racing Inc., who
helped arrange the getaway. Running with a local club on Saturday
mornings, barbecuing, sunbathing, even playing volleyball (``They'd
sneak down when no one was there and they'd try batting the ball
around,'' said Long of their introduction to the sport) appealed to
the vacationers, although Roba drew the line at riding the roller
coaster.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Roba will return to her homeland right after the
race, to a nearly completed three-story house and to the
inspiration of Bikila's legend.
</P>
<P>
   Bikila, however, did not run well in his only Boston appearance,
finishing fifth in 1963 in 2:24:43. At the time, he was the seventh
Olympic gold medalist to fail in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if she was aware that her time here last year was
faster than Bikila's in '63, Roba looked puzzled, even annoyed.
What is your question? she wanted to know. He must have had a bad
race, she insisted, quick to defend her legendary countryman.
</P>
<P>
   But then she added: ``I'm hoping to make my race even faster
this year.''

TWO ROADS DIVERGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before history books are written, there are ``lifetime
achievement awards:'' the first rough guides to events that have
transformed our lives. When the National Venture Capital
Association gave a pair of them _ only its second and third _
during its annual meeting in Boston last week, the presentation
began with a little slide show.
</P>
<P>
   While Louis Armstrong's famous voice rasped ``You're the Top,''
the projector in the darkened ballroom flashed photographs of
Boston's Peter Brooke, 70, and San Francisco's Thomas Perkins, 67.
</P>
<P>
   The choices could't have been more different _ or more
illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   There was Brooke in his tweeds and and tie. There was Perkins
sans socks with polo shirt. Perkins in his state-of-the-art
sailboat. Behind the wheel of his fancy car. With his new wife,
writer Danielle Steele. There was Brooke in his office. In his
suit. In his academic gown and overseer's top hat at a Harvard
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   These two shapers dominated the venture capital industry in its
early years in their respective states.(Who won the first lifetime
achievement award? David Morgenthaler, who galvanized the
association to push the capital gains tax cut in 1978 that ignited
the current boom.)
</P>
<P>
   Today California's economy is roughly the size of Germany's.
Massachusetts is still a small state in New England. But Boston
remains headquarters for an impressive fraction of the world's best
brains/most advanced research and development. Brooke's and
Perkins' stories show why.
</P>
<P>
   Legends of Yankee high-tech ingenuity go back to colonial days.
As the historian Daniel Boorstin says, who else ever turned stone
and ice into export crops? Railroads, telephones, and electricity
found their first funding in Boston. But a convenient point from
which to date the first glimmer of the venture capital industry
might be April 1926.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the First National Bank of Boston hired a refugee
from the Russian revolution named Serge Semenenko straight out of
the Harvard Business School. It was Semenenko who discovered in the
early 1940s that he could make money backing motion picture studios
_ a practice as profitable as it was radical.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of World War II, Gen. George Doriot was teaching a
course at Harvard Business School in what today is delicately
called ``private equity,'' the art of providing capital to
scientists and entrepreneurs in exchange for a big piece of the
hoped-for action _ a heretical idea in an age of giant
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   His gospel: know as much about the business as the entrepreneur
himself. Brooke enrolled in the course in the early 1950s, then
impetuously walked out. After graduation in 1954 and a hitch in the
Army, he headed for the First National Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Brooke learned his first lessons in high-tech
lending, staying up late at night to study the Standard Industrial
Classification Code manual in hopes of discerning which new
electronic specialties were growing and which were not. By day, he
knocked on doors of dusty warehouses where the new tinkerers were
at work, offering loans against government contract receipts
instead of personal collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Having founded a high-technology lending group at the Boston
Bank, Brooke moved briefly to Bessemer Securities Corp. in New
York, to make private investments for the Phipps familty, then
returned to Boston to do the same thing for the old Boston
brokerage of Tucker, Anthony &AMP; RL Day. In 1967, he formed TA
Associates. It quickly grew to become the largest venture capital
firm in the US.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Perkins, meanwhile, had enrolled in electrical engineering
at MIT in 1949. Afterward, he went to Harvard Business School,
graduating in 1957, then straight to California, where he went to
work for a fledgling enterprise known as Hewlett-Packard Co.
</P>
<P>
   In Cupertino, the restless Perkins launched Hewlett-Packard's
computer business in 1965, then started a business of his own after
hours, buildinng shock-proof lasers with funding from the Bank of
America. When he sold the company after a few years, he was rich.
In 1972, he and Eugene Kleiner founded Kleiner &AMP; Perkins (now
Kleiner Perkins Caulfield &AMP; Byers.)
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s were kind to TA Associates and Kleiner &AMP; Perkins; by
the 1980s, the firms were fabulous mnoney machines. Most of
Boston's venture capital industry was formed by alumni of TA (the
notable exception is William Elfers' Greylock Management Corp.,
which grew out of the Doriot branch;) Kleiner Perkins spawned a
host of imitators in San Francisco and along Sand Hill Road in Palo
Alto.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the key was access to innovators working in
universities _ Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the east, the University of California at Berkeley
and Stanford University in the west. And in the 1980s, the
communities around them looked superficially the same.
</P>
<P>
   Then California took off. The decision not to appoint Robert
Noyce to a faculty position after he graduated from MIT in 1953
turned out to have been the key _ Noyce went briefly to
Philadelphia, then in 1956 to the Shockley Semiconducter Laboratory
in Mountain View, Calif., in 1956. The future development of
semiconductors moved with him. It was in 1959 he invented the
integrated circuit, now known as silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Brooke turned his attention overseas,
forming Advent International in 1985 to spread the techniques of
venture capital to more than 30 countries around the world. He
stopped doing deals and devoted himself to the development of an
international network self-consciously modelled on the Marshall
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Boston lost out on brains. The Internet had its early
development in Boston, at Bolt Beranek Newman and MIT's Laboratory
for Computer Science. Biotech in Cambridge got a jump on
California, thanks to Boston's teaching hospitals' proximity to
Harvard and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   But California had become the preeminent center for
manufacturing and marketing the new electronic technologies. New
England's old mill towns, which only a few years before had been
bursting with minicomputer activity, began emptying out again.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Business School even surpassed Harvard in attracting
the very most promising students. Harvard Business School has been
preparing an onslaught to recapture its lead and last week Stanford
Business School named a new dean to cope with the threat. He is
Robert Joss, 57, a Stanford PhD who helped build San Francisco's
Wells Fargo Bank and since 1993 has headed Australia's second
largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the lifetime achievement ceremonies at Boston's Ritz-Carlton
Hotel it scarcely mattered. Boston was rich, California was richer,
Brooke had been honored by a dozen foreign governments and Perkins
had his wife, his boat, his cars -- and his companies. Among his
directorships: Tandem Computer, Genentech, Spectra Physics, Corning
Glass Works, Collagen Corp. and LSI Logic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it was still dawn in the venture capital industry,
according to Perkins. The proof, he said, was that in a business
famous for preference _ at least in its early days _ for spreading
the risk among many partners, ``Peter Brooke and I have never done
a deal together.''

MALAYSIA'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER GOES TO PRISON; WIFE FORMS
POLITICAL PARTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ For 75 days, she sat in the gallery of
an austere courtroom here, bearing silent witness to the trial of
her husband, Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime minister of
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Anwar was found guilty of corruption and sentenced
to six years in prison. Now his wife, Dr. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail,
has been thrust into the center of Malaysia's gathering political
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Anwar was arrested, I realized I had to do something,''
Azizah said in an interview here after her husband's verdict rocked
this southeast Asian country. ``If not, he would just fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   So Azizah, a soft-spoken 46-year-old ophthalmologist, formed a
political party to topple the man who has ruled Malaysia with a
tight grip for 18 years, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Unlike
her husband, Azizah is not a born politician. On some days, she
confides, the crusade seems a crushing burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when the stress is unbearable,'' Azizah said,
as her suburban house echoed with the sounds of aides' chatting on
cellular telephones and two small children scampering to peer at
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to head this party _ my husband is behind bars _ I have
children at home,'' she said wearily. ``But there is this
tremendous overwhelming support from the people, and I think I
can't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's unexpectedly harsh sentence has uncorked a fresh burst
of anger in Malaysia, which has been roiled by anti-government
protests since he was charged with corruption and sex crimes in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students demonstrated on Wednesday and Thursday in
the old city, lighting bonfires, burning the flag of Malaysia's
governing coalition and clashing with red-helmeted riot troops.
About 400 students demonstrated again Friday, though witnesses said
they dispersed peacefully after 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 51, has vowed to lead a campaign from his prison cell to
topple the government. But with his wife allowed to see him only
once a month, he has to rely on her to be his proxy and field
commander of the campaign against his former boss and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's coalition has two-thirds of the seats in Parliament.
hough many people here were outraged by Anwar's trial, Mahathir, a
73-year-old physician, still commands respect among Malaysians, who
credit him with turning this former British colony _ with its mix
of Malays, ethnic Chinese and Indians _ into a modern, harmonious
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moral outrage does not translate into electoral victory,''
K.S. Jomo, a political economist at the University of Malaya here,
said. ``It will be an uphill battle for Azizah and company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Azizah acknowledged that before her husband's downfall she
rarely questioned the political culture propagated by Mahathir. In
fact, Anwar was a prime beneficiary of that system, a Muslim
student leader who rose rapidly in the party and government as the
prime minister's protege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system worked,'' Azizah said. ``But now the flaws are so
much that you have to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   As she prepares for parliamentary elections, which are to be
held before June 2000, she is touring the country with a message _
justice, for her husband and for the dispossessed, who have
suffered through a deep recession brought on by the collapse in
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts said her best chance for victory was to stitch
together a coalition of opposition parties, including the
Democratic Party, which is supported by the ethnic Chinese, and the
Islamic party. Her status as Anwar's wife cuts both ways with the
politically ascendant Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   At a mosque frequented by young supporters of Anwar, some said
Azizah was indispensable as the living symbol of their imprisoned
leader. But Mohd Fadil, a 32-year-old Muslim who designs oil
equipment, said: ``I can't see her as prime minister. In a Muslim
culture, we would choose a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some experts said, Mahathir was more vulnerable now than
at any time in his tenure, both because of the fierce reaction to
the verdict and because of his health. He was just released from
the hospital after a lung infection.
</P>
<P>
   Such calculations seemed far from Azizah's mind as she talked
about consoling her six children _ five girls and a boy ranging in
age from 6 to 19 _ after their father was led down a stairwell in
the court on Wednesday and driven to a high-security prison outside
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, they miss their father terribly and want him
home,'' she said. ``My son says he will be 20 by the time his
father gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Azizah herself has little time to grieve. On Wednesday evening,
hours after have bade Anwar farewell, she spoke at a raucous rally
of more than 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband told me,'' she said with a thin smile, `` `Don't
cry, be strong, don't be sad. It is part of the struggle.' ''

   Eastman Kodak Co., buoyed by six months of steady growth in film
sales, announced Friday that its net profit in the first quarter,
excluding one-time charges, rose 9.3 percent, to $259 million, or
80 cents a diluted share, from $237 million, or 73 cents. Sales
rose 6.5 percent, to $3.1 billion from $2.91 billion. The company
also said it would buy back $2 billion in stock over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted positively to the news, sending shares of
Kodak soaring $6.4375, or 9.67 percent, to $73.

   The delighted reaction was a bit startling, in that as recently
as February analysts had been predicting that Kodak would earn 89
cents a share. In fact, the stubbornly high expectations worried
Kodak so much that on March 29 it warned investors that its
earnings for the quarter would not top 80 cents. It indicated that
the earnings might even drop as low as 73 cents. But most analysts
figured that was a low estimate, and the consensus settled at 76
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Now analysts say it was not the earnings numbers, or even the
promise of a stock buyback, that drove the share price up. Rather,
they say, it was the indication that Kodak's sales were finally
growing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that the revenues were stellar,'' said Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   That the stock has long traded at less than 15 times earnings
helped as well, added B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with
Prudential Securities. ``You put together a cheap stock with
significant improvement in revenues, and you're going to get this
kind of movement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's sales growth came from various places. Film sales in
China, Brazil and a few other economically troubled markets were
surprisingly strong, as were sales of low-end digital cameras in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But film sales in America provided the happiest surprise. The
nation's entire consumer film market was up 10 percent this quarter
from the first quarter of 1998, after rising 9 percent in the last
quarter. Kodak did even better, with the number of rolls of film
sold rising by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales were a lot stronger than even we had expected,'' said
Kodak chief financial officer Harry Kavetas.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unit sales were up even though neither Kodak nor its
archrival, Fuji Photo Film, slashed prices this year. ``They're all
finally realizing that it is marketing, not price, that makes the
difference,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert,
Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one expects film sales to keep growing at a
double-digit clip. ``It seems unlikely that the very strong growth
in consumer markets that's been observed in the fourth and first
quarters will persist,'' warned Michael Ellmann, an analyst with
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kodak president Daniel Carp tempered his glee. ``It's been
quite a while since I've seen two back-to-back quarters of such
strong industry growth,'' he said. ``But industry numbers do bounce
around a lot as the year goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   And pricing may yet put a damper on profits. Kodak promised its
retailers aggressive price cuts on films and single-use cameras in
May and June, the time when film sales normally start to heat up.
``They sell the most film in the second and third quarters, which
means they've yet to establish what the really important prices for
the year will be,'' said Jack Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kodak's sales of consumer digital cameras keeps
growing, which may not be such a blessing. Kodak still loses money
on every unit it sells. And if enough consumers embrace digital
cameras, it could be bad news for films. ``Digital sales aren't
negatively impacting film sales yet, but that will be a
front-and-center issue by Christmas 2000,''said Henderson of
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There were more immediate tarnishes on the quarter's shine as
well. Kodak brought its costs down by only $80 million, possibly
jeopardizing its chances to deliver the $470 million in cuts it had
promised for the year. Kodak executives, however, insisted the
company was on target.
</P>
<P>
   It has delayed its much-anticipated project to electronically
deliver processed photos to America Online's 17 million customers.
Its sales of motion picture film, long a steady growth area for the
company, were sluggish at best.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Eastman Software subsidiary, which lost $65
million last year, continued to lose money. And Kodak wrote off
losing bets on some inkjet technologies and retail photo kiosks.
Those three troubled areas resulted in a combined charge of $68
million against the latest quarter's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the first time since June, the good news in a Kodak
quarter handily outweighed the bad. ``I know that one quarter does
not make a year,'' Carp said. ``But we are very pleased with where
we are right now.''

SUPERSTAR DION A TURNCOAT, SEPARATISTS SAY, FUELING DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MONTREAL _ So what do you call a singing superstar whose
recordings and concerts have enthralled hundreds of millions of
people around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Not a true Quebecer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view of one of Quebec's top separatist politicians,
whose disparaging cracks about the French-speaking province's most
beloved daughter, Celine Dion, have touched off a Titanic-sized
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her songs reflect nothing of what Quebecers experience,''
Parliament member Suzanne Tremblay, one of the more prominent
leaders of the Quebec separatist movement, recently said at a
government hearing on Canadian culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In her soul, she is neither a Quebecer nor a Canadian,''
Trembly declared in remarks that became public last week. ``Celine
Dion has become an American or universal performer.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of swipe that separatists routinely take at
high-profile Quebecers who refuse to spend their days beating the
drums of secession or condemning the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it appears that Tremblay has gone a rhetorical
blast too far.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage at Tremblay's utterances is reverberating through the
province, as newspaper editorials, callers to radio talk shows,
television discussion panel hosts, and ordinary Quebecers _
separatists and federalists alike _ rally to defend the singer they
call ``our little Quebecer.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Dion, who became fluent in English in her early
20s, is perhaps most famous for her song, ``My Heart Will Go On,''
from the film ``Titanic.'' But other recordings have kept her at
the top of international pop charts for years, and her music _ in
French and English _ is wildly popular among Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are so stuck on Celine,'' said Montreal music
critic Laurent Saulnier. ``They adore her.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Quebec cultural historian Frederic Demers: ``What's a true
Quebecois singer? One who sings only of snow, separatism,
lumberjacks, and spruce beer?''
</P>
<P>
   Dion is of impeccably French-Quebecois heritage, born and raised
in the French heartland community of Charlemagne, one of 14
brothers and sisters in a musical clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our little girl from Charlemagne,'' said Denise Dion,
one of Celine's sisters. ``She's the little Quebecer who succeeded
on the world stage. Everyone is so proud of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's first recordings and early hits were sung in French, and
even after making a commercial decision to record some albums in
English _ the only way to break into the huge American and European
markets _ she stuck steadfastly to her Quebec roots, refusing in
1990 to accept a Canadian award for ``best anglophone artist of the
year,'' since the category implied that she was an English-speaking
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Quebecoise, and proud of it,'' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers were thrilled in 1997, when Dion made her opening
remarks in French at the Grammy Awards ceremony in New York,
thanking her original fans back in La Belle Province for her
success on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Quebecers, she is exporting the Quebec identity,''
said Demers.
</P>
<P>
   But not to Quebec's separatists, who control the provincial
government and are dedicated to cutting political ties with Canada.
It has long been the view of hard-core secessionists that any
Quebecer who succeeds in the English-speaking world is a sort of
turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dion last year was inducted into the Ordere National du
Quebec, the highest distinction the provincial government can
award, some separatists have never forgiven the music artist for an
offhand remark she made to reporters in 1992. Asked what she
thought of Quebec leaving Canada, she responded: ``Appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have been the first and last political comment she
has ever made in public, but separatist memories are long.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay, who represents a Quebec district in Canada's
Parliament, is one of the more pugnacious firebrands of the Quebec
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Celine Dion sings in `Titanic,' she's not singing
anything'' about Quebec, Tremblay more recently told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay's criticisms have exploded into headlines across
Canada, causing huge embarrassment for the separatists, who have
been forced to hold damage-control press conferences, professing
utmost admiration for Dion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celine Dion is an artist of international caliber, and I think
it is possible to be that and a true Quebecer at the same time,''
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Tremblay's party,
told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, columnists in French and English media are having a
field day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any doubt about the nationality of Celine's soul,
just consider that she spends most of her spare time in Florida,''
wrote Finbarr O'Reilly in the National Post. ``What could be more
Quebecois than that?''

CLINTON SEES LONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN US, BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. _ Just as the United States led the effort to
rebuild Europe after World War II, President Clinton said Friday,
the nation could face a lengthy struggle to ensure a lasting peace
in the Balkans after the military conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to humanitarian relief agencies at a small
community center outside Deroit, did not estimate how much the
United States might spend _ or how long it could take _ to
physically and politically rehabilitate the Balkan region. But he
made a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do for southeastern Europe, including the Balkans,
what was done for central Europe after the Cold War and for the
battleground nations of Europe after World War II,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   As protest groups on opposite sides of the Kosovo issue
demonstrated outside, Clinton told more than 300 relief workers
that the postwar effort in the Balkans would be crucial to
preventing ``another decade where people carry around all this
hatred in their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, returning to the fund-raising trail for the first
time since the NATO airtrikes on Serbia began, addressed the relief
groups between high-priced events in Dearborn, Mich., and Weston,
Mass., aimed at bolstering Democratic campaigns for the House and
Senate. A luncheon for 250 donors in Dearborn raised $500,000,
while a lamb-and-potato dinner for 80 Friday night at the Weston,
Mass. home of Alan Solomont was expected to bring in $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed particularly affected by a crowd of about 200
protesters ouside the Dearborn fund-raiser who waved Serbian flags
and placards denouncing the NATO bombing. ``Serbian blood is red,
too!'' several placards said.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon and relief event later, Clinton warned against
anti-Serbian fervor rising in the United States. The NATO fight is
not against the Serbian people, he reiterated, but their president,
Slobodan Milosevic. ``I ask you to help me in making sure that in
this difficult period we do not diminish the humanity of any groups
of Americans, including the Serbian-Americans,'' he said in
Roseville.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who privately met after the speech with 30
Albanian-Americans, said he also had directed the Defense
Department Friday to build a refugee center in Albania to handle an
additional 20,000 refugees from the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting with Clinton, the Albanian-Americans asked the
president to postpone plans to transfer as many as 20,000 Kosavar
refugees to a US base at Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who attended the meeting said the group
cautioned that Milosevic would claim the removal of Kosovar
refugees to American territory as a victory in his campaign to rid
the Yugoslavian province of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian-Americans also questioned the US role in the NATO
bombing effort, asking if ``we are in it to win it,'' the
administration official said. Clinton was said to have affirmed his
commitment to achieving NATO's military goals.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the relief agencies, Clinton also appealed to the
public to continue contributing to the humanitarian effort. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency has received 31,000 calls over
the last days from prospective contributors, officials said, and a
public service announcement was released Friday featuring an appeal
from Hillary Rodham Clinton for additional aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of America has been engaged by this,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on his rationale for the US role in the NATO
operation, Clinton also cited the racially divided environment of
his youth. ``I grew up in the segregated South,'' he said at the
Dearborn fund-raiser. ``I grew up with people who were taught not
to like people who were different from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``After all the work we've done in America to get
people to live together across racial and religious lines . . . how
would you feel if I had come here to give this speech today and the
headlines were full of all those people being killed and all those
people being thrown out of the country, and we were having to
explain to people why we couldn't lift a finger to do anything
about it?''

KINGFISHER ACQUISITION WOULD CREATE LARGEST RETAILER IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Kingfisher PLC, Britain's sixth-largest retailer, will
buy the supermarket chain Asda Group PLC for $9.6 billion in stock,
the companies announced Friday. Such a merger would create the
biggest British retailer, with the ability to expand through
acquisitions into Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The merger has the potential to create stores selling everything
from food to toiletries to clothing, creating a platform to compete
with Continental European megastores. The new entity would have
combined sales of $22.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Kingfisher's closing price on Thursday of 875 pence,
the proposed deal, offering 0.2263 Kingfisher share for every Asda
share, implied a 12.2 percent premium for Asda stock, valuing it at
198 pence, or $3.16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Asda shares rose 22.24 pence (36 cents), or 12.6 percent, to
198.75 pence after the announcement, while Kingfisher fell 35
pence, or 4 percent, to 840.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give Kingfisher shareholders 66.33 percent of the
equity in the new company, which is expected to be called
Kingfisher. Asda holders would control the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chief executive of
Kingfisher, would hold the same position in the new company. Allan
Leighton, Asda's chief executive, would be deputy chief executive
of the new company and chief executive of its food and general
merchandising division.
</P>
<P>
   Kingfisher's holdings include the B&AMP;Q home improvement business,
Woolworth variety store, Superdrug health and beauty chain and the
Comet electrical goods group. Though Asda sells mainly food and
clothing and is Britain's third-largest food retailer after Tesco
and Sainsbury, there are broad similarities.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the merger would provide ``enhanced
opportunities for growth in the U.K., continental Europe and
internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingfisher has already begun buying in Europe, taking stakes in
Darty, a French electrical retailer; Castorama, a French home
improvement chain, and companies in the Netherlands, Belgium and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts described the merger as a defensive ploy to thwart
ambitions by the Wal-Mart Stores chain of the United States to
penetrate Britain's retail market through acquisitions. But others
saw it as a reflection of retailers being forced to seek profit
from mergers because of increased retailing competition and lagging
consumer spending in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Friday gave no details about possible job
losses among the 130,000 employees. Only a few weeks ago,
Kingfisher said that it planned to open 100 new stores, mainly in
Britain, providing 4,800 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies promised to divulge further details of the deal on
Monday. According to Merrill Lynch, Asda's financial advisers in
the deal, heavy trading in stock that pushed prices up by 20
percent over the last week persuaded the company to make a
preliminary announcement Friday.

CLINTON SEES LONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN US, BALKANS

   ROSEVILLE, Mich. _ Just as the United States led the effort to
rebuild Europe after World War II, President Clinton said Friday,
the nation could face a lengthy struggle to ensure a lasting peace
in the Balkans after the military conflict ends.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to humanitarian relief agencies at a small
community center outside Deroit, did not estimate how much the
United States might spend _ or how long it could take _ to
physically and politically rehabilitate the Balkan region. But he
made a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do for southeastern Europe, including the Balkans,
what was done for central Europe after the Cold War and for the
battleground nations of Europe after World War II,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   As protest groups on opposite sides of the Kosovo issue
demonstrated outside, Clinton told more than 300 relief workers
that the postwar effort in the Balkans would be crucial to
preventing ``another decade where people carry around all this
hatred in their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, returning to the fund-raising trail for the first
time since the NATO airtrikes on Serbia began, addressed the relief
groups between high-priced events in Dearborn, Mich., and Weston,
Mass., aimed at bolstering Democratic campaigns for the House and
Senate. A luncheon for 250 donors in Dearborn raised $500,000,
while a lamb-and-potato dinner for 80 Friday night at the Weston,
Mass. home of Alan Solomont was expected to bring in $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed particularly affected by a crowd of about 200
protesters ouside the Dearborn fund-raiser who waved Serbian flags
and placards denouncing the NATO bombing. ``Serbian blood is red,
too!'' several placards said.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon and relief event later, Clinton warned against
anti-Serbian fervor rising in the United States. The NATO fight is
not against the Serbian people, he reiterated, but their president,
Slobodan Milosevic. ``I ask you to help me in making sure that in
this difficult period we do not diminish the humanity of any groups
of Americans, including the Serbian-Americans,'' he said in
Roseville.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who privately met after the speech with 30
Albanian-Americans, said he also had directed the Defense
Department Friday to build a refugee center in Albania to handle an
additional 20,000 refugees from the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In their meeting with Clinton, the Albanian-Americans asked the
president to postpone plans to transfer as many as 20,000 Kosavar
refugees to a US base at Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who attended the meeting said the group
cautioned that Milosevic would claim the removal of Kosovar
refugees to American territory as a victory in his campaign to rid
the Yugoslavian province of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian-Americans also questioned the US role in the NATO
bombing effort, asking if ``we are in it to win it,'' the
administration official said. Clinton was said to have affirmed his
commitment to achieving NATO's military goals.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the relief agencies, Clinton also appealed to the
public to continue contributing to the humanitarian effort. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency has received 31,000 calls over
the last days from prospective contributors, officials said, and a
public service announcement was released Friday featuring an appeal
from Hillary Rodham Clinton for additional aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of America has been engaged by this,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on his rationale for the US role in the NATO
operation, Clinton also cited the racially divided environment of
his youth. ``I grew up in the segregated South,'' he said at the
Dearborn fund-raiser. ``I grew up with people who were taught not
to like people who were different from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``After all the work we've done in America to get
people to live together across racial and religious lines . . . how
would you feel if I had come here to give this speech today and the
headlines were full of all those people being killed and all those
people being thrown out of the country, and we were having to
explain to people why we couldn't lift a finger to do anything
about it?''

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The giant state-owned oil company,
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, typically holds important meetings in
its sleek, towering headquarters here. In late March, however, the
country's new president, Hugo Chavez &UR;  &LR; Frias, convened a special
session of the company's board at Miraflores Palace, where he has
his office.
</P>
<P>
   To Venezuelans who keep an eye on the oil business _ which
includes just about everyone in this Texas-sized country of 23
million people _ it was clear that Chavez was making a powerful
statement. Almost from its birth in 1976, PDVSA (pronounced
pay-day-VISa), as the company is called here, has operated with a
level of independence that has rankled the country's political
leaders, but which they have been unable to curb.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate in last December's presidential election, Chavez,
a 44-year-old former army paratrooper who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful coup attempt, made the state oil giant one of the
principal targets of his campaign against what he called a
complacent and bloated status quo. He labeled the company an
uncontrollable ``state within the state,'' criticized its
extravagant ``gold-card culture,'' and vowed to ``subordinate PDVSA
to the Venezuelan state.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office on Feb. 2, Chavez has forced the company and
its 48,000 employees to reverse course. He quickly halted an
ambitious expansion program aimed at doubling oil production,
calling it ``irrational.'' He announced plans for new independent
companies to develop natural gas and petrochemicals. And he
strengthened ties with other members of the reinvigorated
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make profound changes at PDVSA,'' the
president pledged during an interview here. ``This is a state
enterprise, and I plan to run it for the benefit of the national
treasury. It cannot go on acting like the sovereign Republic of
PDVSA, contracting debt as if it were a country of its own. We have
already done more in a short time than has been done in many years,
but we plan a deeper transformation, restructuring and
redirection.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's critics here and abroad are suspicious of his plans,
arguing that the oil company functions far more efficiently than
the rest of the government and needs only some minor tinkering, not
a major overhaul. But both sides agree that the very size and
complexity of the company's operations makes Chavez's goal a
daunting one.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its autonomy and Venezuela's proven crude oil reserves
of 76.1 billion barrels, the company has become the second largest
in the world and the largest foreign supplier of oil to the United
States in recent years. It regularly accounts for nearly 80 percent
of total Venezuelan exports and more than a third of all government
revenue, pumping nearly 3.2 million barrels of oil a day in 1998
and generating revenues of $25.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``PDVSA is an elephant in a swimming pool,'' Ali Rodriguez
Araque, the new minister of Energy and Mines said in an interview
here shortly after the March 29 meeting, the first ever to be held
outside the oil company's headquarters. ``Because it has such
weight, any movement it makes immediately produces an effect in the
whole of the national economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The change envisioned by Chavez has further clouded the
prospects for foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela. The
companies had planned to invest $65 billion when the previous
government opened up the industry. But many exploration contracts
were signed by foreign companies before oil prices slumped and
apply to areas where costs are high and results have been
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Luis Eduardo Paul, president of the Venezuelan Oil
Chamber, a local industry trade group, noted, ``the issue is not
just one of prices, but of success in drilling.'' One positive
development came in March when a consortium that includes Conoco
announced a significant find in the Gulf of Paria.
</P>
<P>
   Now that prices are beginning to recover, it is unclear how soon
the companies will be able to recoup their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of contractual terms and marginality of the
fields means that 9 out of 10 of the ventures are unprofitable or
are about to be,'' Bernard Wheelahan, president of Shell de
Venezuela, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, recently told The Caracas
Daily Journal, an English-language paper here. Wheelahan, who did
not respond to requests for additional comment, also said foreign
oil companies here are in an ``unsustainable'' situation and
suggested a renegotiation of contracts might be in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and every other oil company made those decisions with our
eyes wide open,'' Rob McKee, executive vice president for
exploration and production at Conoco, said when asked about the
possibility of renegotiating the contracts. ``They are tough terms,
and PDVSA has always told us, and continues to tell us, that if
those circumstances develop, come talk to them. My judgment in
hindsight is that this is something that needs to be talked about,
and over time you can expect Conoco will visit with the Venezuelans
about fine-tuning the terms, as opposed to overturning them.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the government has not only scrapped plans
to increase production to 6.5 million barrels a day by the middle
of the next decade, it has also ordered cutbacks of more than
600,000 barrels a day as part of OPEC's effort to raise oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting production has enabled the Chavez government to emerge
as an important figure in OPEC's latest effort to raise oil prices.
Within the oil group, Venezuela always had a reputation as a
quota-buster, but Rodriguez has pledged that despite the country's
yawning budget deficit, the production cuts by the state oil
company over the last several months will remain in place,
supporting OPEC's latest effort to lift prices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Chavez has also made waves by criticizing the performance of
the state oil company's extensive American and European refining
networks, particularly its wholly owned Citgo subsidiary, saying
they do not contribute enough to state coffers.

 CARACAS : state coffers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That has led to speculation that the Venezuelan government,
hungry for cash to finance the ambitious social programs Chavez has
promised, might sell all or part of the Citgo unit, whose
acquisition was completed in 1989 for $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But many oil experts here argue that such a step would be a huge
mistake. With oil markets in a volatile state, they maintain, not
only would Venezuela not get the best price for the company, but
the country's heavier, high-sulfur grade of crude, which requires
special processing, would probably lose ground in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Citgo investment was tailor-made to be able to process
Venezuela's peculiar crude, and if we didn't have that guaranteed
outlet, it's quite possible that Saudi Arabia or Mexico would take
advantage,'' said Angel Olmeta, a former company board member who
engineered the original deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of Chavez's advisers are now urging him to increase
the company's refining capacity in the United States and to add to
its overseas assets, recently valued at $9 billion, of which about
$7.5 billion are in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the company bought half of Mobil Oil's refinery in
Chalmette, La., and the Amerada Hess Corp.'s plant in the U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR; 
Virgin Islands, and it is said to be interested in other properties
available as a result of recent industry mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But with Venezuela mired in its worst credit and budget crunch
in decades, others here have even suggested that Chavez sell off
the state oil company, formed when the government nationalized
foreign oil holdings 23 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An independent assessment conducted in 1997 put the company's
value at more than $80 billion, but disposing of its assets appears
to run counter to the president's nationalist instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``PDVSA is not privatizable, and we're not going to talk about
that,'' Chavez said in a recent speech. While his government
respects all existing contracts and recognizes the need to
``stimulate private investment,'' he said, the goal is to make
Venezuela ``a global energy power'' in control of its own assets.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, predicted Paul, president of the local industry
trade group, the debate over selling at least some parts of the
company ``is a discussion that is going to continue, that is out
there on the table and at some point is probably going to be
resolved in favor of privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rodriguez, the Minister of Energy and Mines, suggested
that the company ``could sell some assets and acquire others'' as
part of the cost-reduction campaign Chavez has ordered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The uncertainties over oil policy come at a time when the
company's own corporate culture is in flux. Last year, it revamped
its traditional structure, merging its three major divisions into a
single entity and setting off a factional struggle for dominance.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chavez's first steps after winning the election was to
announce he would dismiss Luis Giusti, the highly regarded
executive who had led the oil company since 1994. Replacing Giusti
is Roberto Mandini, who had been executive vice president at
Citgo's Tulsa headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mandini declined a request for an interview. But Rodriguez said
he was chosen for the job in part because he had successfully
consolidated several smaller oil companies when he was head of the
company's Corpoven division. The other two main divisions were
Maraven and Lagoven, all derived from the separate organizations
acquired at the time of nationalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mandini can make use of that experience to mold three
cultures into one,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil analysts here predicted it would be more difficult, however,
for Mandini to resolve contradictions inherent to the company's
multiple roles as holding company, driller, exporter and retailer.
Not only does the state oil company regulate the foreign oil
companies that were invited back into Venezuela, but it is also
their partner in some ventures and their rival in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is all tangled up,'' said Pedro M. Burelli, an
investment banker who resigned from the board last year. ``There
are 70 different companies in Venezuela always operating in
association with PDVSA, and that is a tough challenge for any
company in the world, particularly a somewhat insensitive and
massive state monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The state oil company's most persistent problem, however, may be
the Venezuelan government's habit of viewing it as a cash cow whose
assets can be tapped without regard for its balance sheet. Even
when oil prices were in free fall last year, for instance, the
company was forced to pay an emergency $1 billion dividend to its
sole shareholder, the government.
</P>
<P>
   That left the company squeezed for cash, so it is now seeking
$900 million in new credits.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has also vetoed any increase in domestic gasoline prices
that might improve the company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``PDVSA's most baffling problem is that it is dealing with a
country that doesn't understand it or the complexities of the oil
industry in general,'' Burelli said. ``There are only two really
solid state institutions in this country, the military and PDVSA
One is in favor, one is not. One uses money, the other makes most
of what the state, and country, require.''

`SLAVIC UNION' VOTE PUTS MOSCOW IN A QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Seeking to pressure the West into halting airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, Russia's lower house of parliament Friday
overwhelmingly backed Belgrade's bid to join a ``Slavic Union''
that includes the former Soviet republics Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma voted 293-56 to ask the Kremlin to approve
Yugoslavia's request to join the loose alliance, which legislators
said would allow Russia and its arsenal of more than 6,000 nuclear
weapons to act as a deterrent against further attacks by NATO
against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this is the main thing that can stop the war in
the Balkans,'' Communist legislator Alexander Shabanov told the
Duma before the vote. ``The fear that Russia can get drawn into the
war is the main thing that can stop the Western politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vote received a cautious reaction in Russia, where most
people see NATO's attacks as unjustified agression against
Yugoslavia, but where few want Russia to get involved in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing Russia can do today is to respond to insanity
with insanity,'' the liberal minority bloc Yabloko, which opposed
the Duma's resolution, said in a statement. The party said an
alliance with Yugoslavia ``opens the possibility for military
confrontation between the leading nuclear powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, eager for Russian military aid, last week suggested
joining the loose Russia-Belarus alliance, which includes mutual
security guarantees. Last week, President Boris N. Yeltsin said he
looked favorably on a union of the three countries, all of which
are mainly Slavic and Orthodox Christian.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Yeltsin aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Thursday that the
Kremlin was not considering an alliance with Yugoslavia while the
war is on.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians condemn the airstrikes, especially after NATO
admitted its pilot accidentally bombed a column of ethnic-Albanian
refugees in Kosovo. Public opinion here is so clearly against the
West's role, that no Russian politician can afford to avoid harsh
criticism of NATO in public, especially with general elections
slated for December. The one legislator who tries to defend NATO,
Duma member Konstantin Borovoi, Friday was denied the floor in a
vote by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's government has avoided doing anything that could
cause a true break in relations with the West. Until now, Yeltsin
has avoided using Russia's nuclear weapons as a threat against the
West _ the one argument NATO would have to listen to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia can play a deterrent role only if it will use its
nuclear weapons for this role,'' said defense analyst Alexander
Pikayev of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``Whether Russia will do
that is a big question that no one can answer. Yeltsin's government
probably does not want to. But if you bring a warring country into
your alliance, you have nowhere to go but to consider this
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin last week said for the first time that Russia could be
pushed into a war by the West, but he followed that by naming
Viktor Chernomyrdin, a foreign policy moderate, his chief envoy for
Yugoslavia negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Yeltsin's position is that NATO has dismissed
Russia's rumblings and continued the bombings. The frustration at
being ignored, and nostalgia for Moscow's Cold War-era might, were
abundently reflected in Friday's Duma decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This initiative cannot be brushed aside by the West,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the Duma who visited
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic last week. ``Military actions
against one of these governments will be seen as an act agains the
other governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Alexy II, who
Friday became the latest senior Russian official to travel to
Belgrade, called the idea of a Slavic union ``a truly peaceful
initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ukraine, another Slavic state with a strong Orthodox
Christian following, protested the move toward an alliance between
Russia, Yugoslavia and Belarus as a threat to European stability.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Russia's 18 million Muslims also appear to disapprove.
Reports from some of Russia's 21 mainly Muslim regions say that
volunteers are signing up to help the Kosovar Albanians fight the
Serbs, mirroring a parallel volunteer movement among Russians who
want to fight with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But while the debate over the Slavic alliance raises thorny
questions, it does allow Russia to show its displeasure over the
war while continuing to avoid taking more concrete and dangerous
actions. These might include beginning the supply of weapons or
sending more warships to the Adriatic to join the spy ship Liman
which is already shadowing NATO ships -- already, Turkey has
received a request from Russia to let nine warships from its Black
Sea Fleet through the Bosporus straits into the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Duma's decision is not the most dangerous Russia could
make and to a certain degree reflects the restraint of the Duma's
leftist majority and the government as a whole,'' Pikayev said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 33,000 military reservists the Pentagon is
expected to call up for duty in the Kosovo crisis are likely to be
drawn mainly from the Air National Guard's aerial refueling
facilities at 19 bases across the country, military officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 25,000 Air National Guard personnel who help operate
KC-135 tankers used to refuel combat jets in mid-air could be
activated as part of the call-up, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing need for tanker specialists stems from NATO's
recent decision to dramatically expand the air campaign against
Yugoslav forces by adding more than 300 U.S. aircraft _ nearly a
third of which are likely to be refueling airplanes _ and 24 Army
Apache helicopters. The additions will bring NATO's total sky
armada to nearly 1,000 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 tankers from the Air National Guard and the Air Force
Reserve are already taking part in the NATO missions. Those units
volunteered for service and were not called to active duty by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The refueling tankers allow combat jets stationed in the United
States and dispatched to the Balkans to fly across the Atlantic
without stopping. In addition, the tankers allow jets sent on
bombing runs to stay aloft longer.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 Air National Guard facilities where the aerial tankers
are stationed are located at or near the following cities:
</P>
<P>
   Bangor, Maine; Portsmouth, N.H.; Niagara Falls, N.Y.;
Pittsburgh; Philadelphia (McGuire, N.J., Air Force Base); Columbus,
Ohio; Knoxville, Tenn.; Birmingham, Ala.; Meridian, Miss.; Chicago;
Milwaukee; Lincoln, Neb.; Forbes, Kan.; Salt Lake City; Phoenix;
Moreno Valley, Calif. (March Air Force Base); Fairbanks, Alaska
(Eielson Air Force Base); Spokane, Wash. (Fairchild Air Force
Base), and Honolulu (Hickam Air Force Base).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Air Force Reserve operates tanker units at the
following facilities that might be activated: Grissom Air Force
Base (outside Indianapolis), Tinker Air Force Base (outside
Oklahoma City), Seymour Johnson Air Force Base (outside Goldsboro.
N.C.), Selfridge Air National Guard Base (outside Detroit) and
Beale Air Force Base (outside Yuba City, Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen declined Friday to provide the
exact number of reservists who will be called. ``I think it'll be a
significant number,'' Cohen said, adding that he will present the
request to President Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Richelle Dowdell, an Air Force spokeswoman at the Air
Mobility Command headquarters at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., near
St. Louis, Mo., said the service is preparing for activation
orders. Scott is the command center for the tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Dowdell added, ``As of right now, we are not sure what is going
to get used and who is going to be called up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the military is relying heavily
on aerial tankers during the air strikes against Yugoslav forces
that began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous advantage to be able to refuel in the skies
as opposed to taking time to land and then get back into the
fight,'' said John Goheen, a spokesman for the National Guard
Association, which represents members of the Air National Guard.
``It's a much more efficient use of time and weaponry.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Merrill McPeak, who was Air Force chief of staff
from 1990 to 1994, said the Kosovo operations are ``air-refueling
intensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over Kosovo, our pilots have to loiter and find out what's
moving on the ground,'' he explained.

UNCERTAINTY OVER NUMBER OF KOSOVARS COMPLICATING RELIEF EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Uncertainty over the exact number of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo is complicating UN and NATO efforts to cope
with one of the worst European refugee crises since the second
world war.
</P>
<P>
   Most planners cite the 1991 census figure of 1.8 million in
estimating the size of Kosovo's population. But nobody is sure.
</P>
<P>
   The UN High Commissioner for refugees, the lead refugee agency,
claims that some 550,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the country for
refuge in neighboring Montenegro, Macedonia, and Albania since NATO
launched its war against the federal Republic of Yugoslvia. General
Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Friday that as few as 700,000 Albanian Kosovars remain displaced in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   If you account for the estimated 200,000 Serbs who live in
Kosovo, that leaves more than 500,000 people. The discrepancy,
according to UN officials, is due to the fact that nobody knows how
many people really lived in Kosovo before NATO began its March 24
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Serbia tighten its grip around the renegade province
of Kosovo in the late 1980s, tens of thousands of the country's
ethnic Albanians have been fleeing the country for a better life in
Europe. And tens of thousands more, facing Serbian repression, have
flooded across the border into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro
before NATO launched its war against the federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to some Congressional critics of the
relief effort, has been confusion. For the moment, UNCHR said it is
planning for a total of 650,000 refugees. Mark Kirk, a
Congressional staffer with the House International Relations
Committee, says that's not enough. ``As far as Congress is
concerned,'' said Kirk. ``We would urge the administration to plan
upwards of 1.2 million refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk said that key State Department planners have privately
acknowledged that they need to plan for a flood of more than a
million refugees. But he said that they are reluctant to announce
it publicly out of fear that some of the key host governments in
Albania, Macedonia or Montenegro, will shut their borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 24 hours, some 16,000 Kosovars have crossed their
borders. UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmont said 100,000 thousand new
refugees are on their way to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expulsions, which were put on hold or slowed down over the
past two weeks, have now resumed with full force,'' said Kris
Janowski, a spokesman for UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials and humanitarian aid workers, meanwhile, have begun
warning that the hordes of homeless ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo
are in danger of perishing if they don't receive assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, the director of the UN Children's Fund (Unicef)
testified before Congress on Thursday that displaced children and
the elderly are in peril of dying if they relief doesn't reach
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are indications thousands of people are hiding in the
forests and icy mountain areas in central and southern Kosovo,''
Mary Robinson, the UN's Commissioner of Human Rights said Friday.
``Kosovo Albanians express great concern at (their) lack of food
and security...and have urged the international community to assist
them.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are reluctant to mount a humanitarian
intervention in Kosovo without a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration urged other countries, including
Greece, to use their influence with Milosevic to gain access to the
internally displaced. Kirk said that the administration has
promised to provide air cover to any country willing to conduct a
humanitarian airdrop over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever country can use its relationship with people inside
Serbia to get access to the people at risk, we want to help them,''
said Rubin. ``But again, President Milosevic continues to use the
people of Kosovo in pursuit of his evil designs: as hostages, pawns
or victims.''

   The New York Times plans three pages of stories, photos and
graphics on the continuing crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ In what NATO claimed as one of
its most successful 24 hours in the air campaign against
Yugoslavia, NATO pilots destroyed 57 targets in Kosovo, including
several tanks and artillery sites. The pilots also gathered new
photographic evidence to back up reports of mass killings, NATO and
Clinton administration officials said today. By Philip Shenon.

<P>
   KOSOVO-SCENE (Urosevac, Yugoslavia) _ The scene in the province
of Kosovo as seen from 12 hours of riding around on a bus escorted
by Yugoslav Army, with a few stops and interviews. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ The confusion about whether NATO
accidentally bombed civilian refugees fleeing Serbian attacks in
Kosovo reflects the novelty of the first real air war the alliance
has ever fought and the determination of its American military
commander to control everything NATO says about air strikes even
while he runs the war. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-COHEN (Washington) _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen
today complained of an ``Orwellian twisting of language and logic''
under which NATO leaders are finding themselves trying to explain
the bombing of a refugee convoy on Wednesday, while Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic ``is not allowing his people to see
the kind of horrific damage that he is causing to hundreds of
thousands of people.'' By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Brazda) _ The flow of ethnic Albanians fleeing
Kosovo into Macedonia surged again today with more than 6,000
refugees pouring out of the Serbian province including families
that had been forced by Serbian forces to turn back more than a
week ago and had gone into hiding. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes) _ There is growing concern here in the
Kukes area, where there are 100,000 refugees, that the city will be
hit by a Serbian attack. On Thursday, Serbs shelled a nearby
encampment of the Kosovo rebel group, the KLA. By Anthony DePalma.

U.S. GETS NO SUPPORT FOR CHINA RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ The United States submitted a resolution
criticizing China's human rights record to the main United Nations
rights body Friday, but it was unable to get any other country to
sign on as a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted that the absence of publicly declared
support did not mean that the resolution was headed for defeat at
the 53-member U.N. Human Rights Commission, which is expected to
vote on it next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from both houses of
Congress, which voted unanimously in favor of submitting a
resolution critical of China, has been circulating a draft for nine
days in hope of attracting co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution criticizes ``severe restrictions'' on a
range of democratic rights, including freedom of expression,
assembly and religion, and harsh sentences for those seeking to
exercise those rights.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which U.S. officials described as balanced and
fair, calls on China to release political prisoners, including
those jailed for ``nonviolent counterrevolutionary activity,'' and
to protect the ``distinct cultural, ethnic, linguistic and
religious identity of Tibetans.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, European Union foreign ministers said they would avoid
censuring China's rights record, despite noting that they were
``dismayed'' by China's actions against pro-democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   This left the administration without its staunchest ally in the
procession of resolutions critical of China, which have been
introduced in the human rights body every year but one since the
violent suppression of pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the loneliest resolution in the history of China
resolutions,'' said Joanna Weschler of Human Rights Watch, the
advocacy and monitoring group based in New York, which supports the
U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at a House
subcommittee hearing Friday, acknowledged that the measure faced
``an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No other country has agreed to co-sponsor the resolution,
which is depressing to say the least,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   China, which has already mounted a vigorous public campaign to
defeat a vote, is also seeking support for a motion of its own to
take no action on the U.S. resolution. This has been the means by
which Beijing has defeated formal votes on all but one of the
previous measures against it.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the no-action motion means that the resolution never
comes up for a vote in the rights commission, which meets for six
weeks annually to review human rights violations worldwide. In
March 1995, countries voted down the no-action motion, and China's
human rights record was debated. The resolution, sponsored by the
United States and the European Union, lost by one vote when Russia
cast its vote in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   This was the closest China has come to defeat. In 1996 and 1997,
China once again blocked votes on critical resolutions when
countries backed the preliminary no-action motion. Asian and
African countries have generally supported China on grounds that
such resolutions are undue interference in domestic matters.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, buoyed by improvements in Beijing's treatment of
dissidents, and its promise to sign onto an international accord
guaranteeing those rights, the push to criticize China ran out of
steam. Both the 15-member European Union and the United States
declined to offer a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But in March the Clinton administration said the recent
crackdown on pro-democracy activists would prompt a renewed effort
to rebuke China. In December, three founding members of the banned
China Democracy Party were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for
acts against the state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the European Union's stand, several prominent Chinese
dissidents in exile turned up in Geneva to lobby for the U.S.
resolution. Referring to the European Union countries, Wei
Jingsheng, who spent 18 years in jail, said at a news briefing,
``We believe they will vote for the resolution.''

 &HT;    Council yet to lift limits on Trump club
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No beach parties for kids older than 12. No
cabanas higher than the next door neighbor's house. A wider tunnel
beneath State Road A1A.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just some of the demands being sought from Donald
Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club by his neighbors' lawyers and town
officials in exchange for approval of a beach-side pool, 14
cabanas, a 608-seat pavilion and ending membership and traffic
limits on the club.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of hearings, the town council is not close to
making a decision on the private club's requests. The hearing will
resume Tuesday at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of debate is lifting limits of 500 members (the club
has 360 now), the 390 persons per special event and 313 car trips
per day to the club. The limits were set when the council approved
the creation of the club in 1993 on the 18-acre landmark estate
built by Marjorie Merriweather Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Preservation Foundation, the Palm Beach Civic Association
and beachfront neighbor Alyne Massey complained that a Celine Dion
charity concert Feb. 27 attracted more than 800 spectators each and
snarled traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Mar-a-Lago Club attorney Ray Royce apologized for the Dion
problem and said a Beach Boys appearance two weeks later was
handled much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is not just a private club but an ongoing
business that rents itself out for profit,'' said attorney Ron
Kolins, representing Massey. ``You certainly shouldn't expand a
commercial use when it doesn't belong there in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen club members said the beach additions would
allow more family enjoyment and the pavilion would cut down noise
because it would replace a temporary tent used for large events.

 &HT;    Four-door Ranger more carlike
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Extra doors are the big deal these days for trucks and
vans, and Ford has taken that concept to the max with the '99
Ranger compact pickup. Just add $660 to the purchase price, and the
hot-selling Ranger becomes a four-door vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The added utility is so obvious it seems an idea whose time
should have come decades ago. No matter whether transporting people
or cargo, the third and fourth doors soon seem so natural it's easy
to forget that not all trucks have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``More doors means more utility,'' says Drew Cook, brand manager
for Ranger. ``Utility is what today's customer demands.''
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly earthshaking news, but it does mean Ford, along
with other manufacturers, is well aware that trucks _ particularly
the compacts _ are regarded by many buyers as personal
transportation vehicles that can be workhorses.
</P>
<P>
   Other features, too, are becoming more carlike, as are prices.
The test Ranger Sport Supercab with a no-effort, switch-on-the-go
two/four-wheel drive system had about everything that can be added
except a sunroof and leather seats. It totaled $24,450, but the
other end of the market isn't forgotten. A two-door,
two-wheel-drive Ranger with very basic standard features is
available for $12,295.
</P>
<P>
   Additional proof that compact trucks are primarily for people
and not cargo is the cabin size. Cabs keep growing, and cargo boxes
keep shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Sport has 39.2 inches of headroom and 42.2 inches of
legroom, and there really is enough space overall to justify Ford's
claim that buyers who stick with the standard bench seat can ferry
around five people.
</P>
<P>
   The two in the rear aren't going to be very comfortable, of
course. The folding jump seats aren't very large or body-fitting,
and there's really no place for adult legs. Even for children, the
novelty of riding in the rear quickly wears off.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and front passenger can be sitting pretty, however,
with the addition of the cloth bucket seats ($360). The manual
adjustments provide a good range of positions, and the shape will
suit most bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Ford offers both four- and five-speed automatic transmissions,
in addition to the five-speed manual, but the engine choices aren't
as pleasing. The base 2.5-liter four-cylinder makes a mere 119
horsepower, while the 3.0-liter V-6 produces 150 and the 4.0-liter
V-6 manages a 10-hp boost to 160. The test Sport's 4.0-liter six
had good acceleration, but using full power to merge with traffic
and for travel with a load in the 72-inch-long cargo box was a
noisy process.
</P>
<P>
   Locking out overdrive improved the performance notably in loaded
and unloaded situations. Left alone, the five-speed automatic
quickly went to overdrive and created the sensation of an abrupt
loss of power.
</P>
<P>
   But except for seeming underpowered, the Ranger Sport is a nifty
little pickup. The ride, loaded and unloaded, is good, and the
handling characteristics are rather remarkable compared with
yesteryear's pickups. The evolution to carlike dashes and control
placement also boosts the ease of driving. The test Sport's cabin
had the same quality of materials _ plastic included _ that is
expected in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Ford Ranger Sport Supercab two/four-wheel
drive pickup
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $24,450 (includes discounts not always
available)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, side-impact beams, power
anti-lock brakes with front discs and rear drums
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: optional 4.0-liter V-6 engine (160 horsepower,
$675), optional five-speed automatic transmission with overdrive
lockout ($1,130)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: four-door feature, $660; power
windows, locks and keyless entry system, $535; fog lamps and
16-inch aluminum wheels, $495; cruise control and leather-wrapped
tilt steering wheel, $395; cloth high-back bucket seats, $360;
trailer hitch, $215; upgraded stereo with CD player and four
speakers, $100
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 16 mpg regular unleaded city, 20 mpg highway

LEADER OF CHIRAC PARTY QUITS, CITING FRENCH RIGHT'S DISARRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The leader of President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist party
resigned unexpectedly Friday, indirectly accusing Chirac of
undermining his position and throwing France's conservative
opposition into fresh disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The party leader, Philippe Seguin, 55, who has himself long
harbored presidential ambitions, set out to unite the conservative
opposition when he took over the party, Rally for the Republic,
after the Socialist victory in parliamentary elections in May 1997.
Friday, however, the opposition is more divided than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Seguin's resignation, accompanied by a bitter statement,
nonetheless took French politicians by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that he found himself in a situation ``where
loyalty, clarity and transparency are no longer cardinal virtues,''
Seguin said he was also withdrawing as his party's leading
candidate in elections for the European Parliament on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not mention Chirac by name, he clearly felt
snubbed Thursday when the president received the leader of a
competing center-right coalition, Francois Bayrou. Moreover, Seguin
complained that one of the president's top aides had publicly
expressed sympathy for a Seguin party dissident. He said the entire
rightist opposition was being weakened by ``suicidal strategies''
promoted by Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the turmoil on the right stems from the
nonconfrontational way that the conservative president is managing
his ``cohabitation'' with the Socialist government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin. This approach, while damaging the right,
has allowed Chirac to increase his popularity and improve his
chances of re-election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But without clear leadership the mainstream opposition has
splintered, and three different groups of rightist candidates are
now competing in the coming European elections. Seguin, who opposed
French ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union in
1992, had formed a pro-European ticket with former Finance Minister
Alain Madelin, who runs his own dissident movement, Liberal
Democracy. The Maastricht Treaty aligned members' policies more
closely in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   Former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, a lifelong Gaullist who
campaigned with Seguin against Maastricht, remains opposed to
European integration and has been joined by Philippe de Villiers,
leader of another rightist party. The Union of French Democracy, a
loose of coalition of center-right parties now headed by Bayrou, is
running a pro-Europe ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Friday, Seguin said that the president of the
Association of Friends of Jacques Chirac, Bernard Pons, had
indicated that all three groups represented the president's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that I no longer belong at the presidency of the
Rally for the Republic or at the head of a European candidates'
list intended to champion the president's policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seguin's abrupt withdrawal from the political scene may be
only temporary. Some commentators said that if the right did poorly
in the European elections, as polls currently predict, Seguin would
avoid blame. And if Chirac's popularity weakened before the 2002
presidential elections, Seguin might be well placed to mount a
challenge as an independent Gaullist.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, his resignation has prompted new calls
for unity within the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely hope we will use this test to form a single,
united opposition list,'' said Jean-Louis Debre, the Gaullist
minority leader in the National Assembly. This was endorsed by
Madelin, who added that unity behind President Chirac was all the
more important during the current crisis in Kosovo. Pasqua,
however, congratulated Seguin on his ``courageous decision.'' &QL;

LOGISTICS OF KOSOVO GROUND WAR POINT UP DIFFICULTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are solid reasons why NATO nations are
reluctant to send ground troops into Kosovo. As Defense Secretary
William Cohen told the Senate this week, many alliance soldiers
would die.
</P>
<P>
   For NATO leaders worried about maintaing political support, that
alone poses a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   But military analysts who have studied the terrain and tactics
have another reason for concern: Mounting and sustaining an
invasion, they said would be more difficult than it might look at
first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as NATO's bombing intensifies and Slobodan Milosevic's
troops stand their ground, more and more people, especially in
Congress, are talking about sending in the troops.
</P>
<P>
   What might a ground war in Kosovo look like? How do the troops
get there? What do they do, once they are in?
</P>
<P>
   Cohen this week referred to Pentagon studies, estimating that
30,000 to 75,000 combat troops would be needed to push the 25,000
Serbian forces out of Kosovo. As many as 200,000 might be needed if
the aim were to take control of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The map shows several ways into Kosovo, but only a few are
practical. The easiest would be from the north, across central
Europe and through Hungary. But this makes sense only if an
invasion of all of Serbia is the object. That would include
conquest of the capital, Belgrade, a step that probably exceeds
NATO's wildest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to liberate Kosovo, then the troops must come in
through Albania from the southwest or Macedonia from the southeast,
preferably both.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to break in from both routes simultaneously,'' said
Barry Posen, professor of strategic studies at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``You want to maximize pressure on the
Serbs, make them wonder where we're coming from, rattle their
cages.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 11,000 NATO troops are currently stationed in
Macedonia, and more on the way, the leaders of the newly
independent republic oppose letting NATO use their territory as a
staging area for an invasion. If NATO respects Macedonian wishes,
an invasion would be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Two roads cut into Kosovo from Albania, though only one of them
is firm enough to support vehicles bigger than a four-wheel truck.
Even the one useful road runs into hills, mountains, and forests
just over the border, and it has just two lanes, which would allow
only a one-way column of military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really large forces are going to fall all over themselves,''
Posen said. ``There will be bottlenecks,'' which could make an
assault vulnerable even to beleaguered Serbian defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Posen said NATO troops would eventually push their way
in, possibly after a few days of quite intense fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After this push, the terrain opens up to plains, ideal for tanks
and other armored vehicles, assuming the roads and bridges up to
that point can support such heavy machines.
</P>
<P>
   However, a few miles farther north, the plains break up into
smaller basins surrounded by more hills, mountains, and forests.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified, said units
in one of these basins could not easily support or reinforce units
in other basins. He also expressed concern that Serbs could take
potshots from the many hiding places all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is like a medieval fortress,'' the official said.
``There are exit walls, interior walls, and compartments. Once you
penetrate the wall, you have to clean out the compartments.''
</P>
<P>
   British defense minister George Robinson, speaking at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government Friday, made the
same point: ``I would remind you that Kosovo was last successfully
invaded in 1395, because of its unique geography.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO were to attempt an invasion anyway, attack helicopters,
such as the 48 Apaches that are being sent to the region, would be
vital. They could fly across the geographic barriers and provide
additional firepower where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Air-cavalry brigades, including larger helicopters to transport
infantry troops, would also play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serbs are still believed to have a large arsenal of
antiaircraft weapons, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air
missiles. Much of NATO's bombing campaign is designed to destroy
the Serb antiaircraft threat, but many of the weapons are small and
portable.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have said the bombing could go on for weeks or
months. Mobilizing an invasion, which involves transporting troops,
weapons, and supplies to the area, as well as expanding bases and
staging areas in the region, would itself take a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contemplate a different approach _ a bold airborne
assault-and-landing on the one airfield in Kosovo, just south of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private organization, calls this tactic ``kicking the
door down.'' Just before such an assault begins, Pike speculated,
NATO attack planes would clear the area with a continuous barrage
of cluster bombs, forcing any Serbs around the airport to clear out
or take cover.
</P>
<P>
   Then transport planes _ carrying armored vehicles, weapons, and
troops _ would fly in, land at the airport, and set up an operating
base in the heart of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a week to get a brigade on the ground,'' Pike
estimated. A brigade consists of roughly 5,000 troops. Once the
base is secure, many more could fly in.
</P>
<P>
   Around Pristina, the terrain is fairly wide-open, and many roads
head wherever a commander would want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Pike noted such an operation would be ``challenging,'' likening
it to the Inchon landing in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The whole scheme _ like any scheme for a ground war _ assumes
that weeks of NATO bombardment will have reduced the Serbian forces
to a tattered, immobilized shadow of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, half the Serbs in Kosovo are army draftees, the other
half are security police. One group may not have the stomach for a
serious fight, the other may not have the training. But other
analysts worry that all these scenarios may underestimate the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon official points to an early-1950s US Army study of
the Yugoslav resistance to the Nazi juggernaut of World War II.
Hitler's generals threw well over 100,000 troops _ at one point,
over a half-million _ into Yugoslavia. For two years, until the
Allies conquered Italy, the resistance was on its own. The
partisans took heavy losses _ two-thirds of the country's males
between age 15 and 55 were killed or wounded _ but enough retreated
to the mountains or forests and returned to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the 14th century, Posen said of the Serbs, ``Their
whole mental construct involves fighting great powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Serbs, he added, may not be the fearsome warriors of
olden times, nor is today's Yugoslavia as big as it was back then.
Kosovo is tinier still _ a diamond-shaped province about 80 by 80
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even those who are optimistic about the results of a
ground war say NATO troops are bound to suffer a fair number of
casualties _ no one would guess how many _ especially in the
battle's first days, when the Serbs can be expected to haul out
everything they can muster to try to bog the Westerners down.
</P>
<P>
   This is why some analysts, particularly the military officers
who would plan an invasion, would prefer to pour in as many troops
_ and make the assault as overpowering _ as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for an all-out approach is that, even if NATO
restricted the invasion to Kosovo, commanders would want at least
to threaten Serbia _ to keep Milosevic's troops bottled up, unable
to reinforce or resupply those trapped in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Posen said one brigade might be poised on the border between
Macedonia and Serbia for this purpose. A Marine amphibious force
could anchor just off Yugoslavia's western shores, in the Adriatic
Sea, as a further threat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ground-war option in Senate hearings this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said,
``It would be a long and drawn-out proposition'' _ which is why,
for the moment, within the NATO alliance, ``there's no political
support to carry it out.''

HOUSE COMMITTEE SUBPOENAS CHUNG, THE FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional committee sent a subpoena Friday to
Johnny Chung, the former Democratic fund-raiser who has told
Justice Department investigators that he funneled tens of thousands
of dollars from two high-level Chinese military officials to
President Clinton's re-election effort in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The House Committee on Government Reform received permission
from the Justice Department to take the testimony of Chung, who is
cooperating with prosecutors after pleading guilty to
campaign-related bank and tax fraud. Justice Department lawyers
have concluded that his public testimony on these matters will not
jeopardize their continuing criminal inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we are finally going to have the opportunity to hear
from one of the central figures in this story,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ill., the committee chairman. The panel has spent two
years searching for evidence that the Chinese government tried to
influence the 1996 presidential election. Committee lawyers said
Friday that they planned to call Chung to testify on April 27 and
28, and he has made clear that he is willing to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Chung has told investigators that he met three times in 1996
with the chief of China's military intelligence agency, Gen. Ji
Shengde, who directed that $300,000 be wired to Chung's bank
account to be used as contributions to Clinton's re-election
campaign, officials familiar with Chung's statements to prosecutors
say. The development was first reported this month by The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Chung apparently contributed only $35,000 of the sum that he
received from Ji to the Democratic Party and deposited the rest
into one of his bank accounts in August 1996, lawyers said. It is
unclear how the rest of the money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, a businessman born in Taiwan but now an American citizen,
is one of the central figures in the campaign finance scandal.
Despite being labeled a ``hustler'' by a wary National Security
Council official, Chung was a frequent White House visitor whose
$400,000 in contributions to the Democratic National Committee and
the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign were returned when questions
were raised about their legality.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's 21/2-year-old investigation of campaign finance
abuses has been stymied by key witnesses refusing to testify or
fleeing the country. Burton said Friday that he had high hopes that
Chung's testimony would break new investigative ground. For the
Republican-led committee, Chung's story will serve to remind the
public of the Democrats' 1996 fund-raising embarrassments at the
same time Vice President Al Gore is busily raising money for his
run at the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chung has told investigators that he was introduced to Ji by Liu
Chao-ying, an aerospace executive and a lieutenant colonel in
China's People's Liberation Army. Her father was Gen. Liu Huaqing.
At the time, he was China's top military commander and a member of
the leadership of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The New York Times reported that Chung had told
prosecutors that ``tens of thousands of dollars'' of his
contributions to the Democrats were given to him by Ms. Liu. Under
American law, foreign governments are prohibited from contributing
to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Burton complained
that several media reports, which he called ``piecemeal leaks,''
had failed to provide a complete picture about what he suspected
was a coordinated Chinese plan to contribute money to Clinton's
re-election effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that it is in the public interest for the facts
about Chinese government efforts to subvert our elections to be
brought to light,'' Burton wrote in an April 7 letter to Ms. Reno.
``The American people have a right to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that the issue was especially timely as China sought
admission to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Burton said he was concerned that news
reports quoted Ji as saying that there were scores of conduits who
had funneled money to the Democrats. ``I want to find out what he
said and how extensive the additional channeling of funds was,''
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials and Democratic National Committee leaders
have repeatedly said they do not know the source of Chung's money,
or the background of several guests that he brought to Democratic
events, including Ms. Liu.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sun, the California lawyer for Chung, said Friday that his
client would testify truthfully under subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to work very hard to avoid this turning into a
partisan circus, because that is what this could very easily
become,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that several other committees in Washington had recently
sought Chung's testimony, including the intelligence committees in
the House and the Senate. ``The question remains as to how this is
going to be coordinated,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's cooperation in the inquiry helped him avoid a prison
sentence. Thanks to a recommendation of leniency from prosecutors,
he was sentenced in December to probation and community service.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on Burton's committee have been especially interested in
Chung, who they said ``captured the essence of the campaign
fund-raising scandal when he observed, `I see the White House is
like a subway; you have to put in coins to open the gates.' ''

MASS. POTATO CHIP MAKER SOLD TO N.C. SNACK COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: N.C.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cape Cod Potato Chip Co., maker of extra crispy, extra salty
chips that have become a legend, is being sold _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Inc., a Charlotte, N.C. snack company, said it bought the
Hyannis, Mass. company for an undisclosed sum Friday, a move Cape
Cod executives said was a must in the bare-knuckle world of chip
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, it's really tough for a small company
like us to compete with the giants,'' said Vincent Fantegrossi,
president and chief executive officer of Cape Cod Potato Chip.
</P>
<P>
   That may be so, but it's the second time the brand with the red
lighthouse on the bag tried to go long with a snack-food mammoth.
Last time it was Anheuser-Busch, which bought the company from
founder Stephen Bernard in 1985. Under Anheuser-Busch's Eagle
Snacks subsidiary, Cape Cod was driven to the brink of destruction
in what became known as the Great Potato Chip War _ a prolonged
battle for shelf space and profits that ended in 1995 with
Frito-Lay the victor.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Cape Cod chips were absent from store shelves. And
with the brand threatened with extinction, Bernard bought the
company back with the help of SMS Brands, a venture capital firm
that buys distressed snack companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took it over, there were no sales, no shelf space, no
distribution,'' Fantegrossi said. ``Our plant had been shut down
for a couple months. It was exactly at ground zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod hired back some of its old employees, and in five years
built the company back up, claiming more than $30 million in annual
sales and distribution network that spanned the country, Canada and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Lance executives floated the idea of an acquisition,
Cape Cod executives said they couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we didn't know what to make of it,'' Fantegrossi
said. ``But after we met with them, we saw this thing really makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, Cape Cod Potato Chips will have the
benefit of Lance's fleet of 2,000 trucks, 65,000 vending machines
and 1 million square feet of manufacturing space, Fantegrossi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building they repair their vending machines in is bigger
than our plant here on the Cape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks and vending machines translate to a doubling of Cape
Cod Chips' distribution capacity and could mean sales growth of 15
percent to 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   And despite that kind of potential growth, Fantegrossi assured,
``it'll still be the same old chips.''

IMAGES OF ETHNIC PURGING IN SERBIA SEEN FROM A BUS WINDOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Serbia _ The evidence of ethnic purging here in Kosovo
is written upon the doorposts of their houses and upon their gates.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of this quiet, modest city in southern Kosovo,
many doors and storefronts bear a spray painted Christian cross
with a Cyrillic ``C'' in each quadrant _ the ``S'' of roman script
_ a widely understood sign that the owners and occupants are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The four letters stand for an ancient Serb slogan: ``Samo Sloga
Srbina Spasava'' _ only unity will save the Serbs. Out here it is
also a mark to ensure that when Yugoslav security forces and
paramilitary units sweep through in search of Albanians the angel
of death will know which homes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians have been forced from
their homes in these sweeps, either to flee abroad, or to wander
furtively within Kosovo, or sometimes to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav Army took reporters on a long bus journey through
eastern and southern Kosovo to show them the carnage from an
apparently errant NATO air attack on one such column of ethnic
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities apparently believed that the terrible
images of the bombing would overwhelm the evidence of their own
activities. But the most overpowering impression, even on a trip
organized and controlled by an army at war, was of an organized
campaign to evict Albanians from large parts of Kosovo and to burn
down their businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   While that is the essence of countless refugee accounts garnered
and retold by Western journalists along Kosovo's borders, in
Macedonia and Albania, it was still extraordinary to see the
effects on the ground inside Kosovo, even from the windows of a bus
that only stopped when and where the Yugoslav army chose _ and from
whose windows no one was allowed to film or photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities have variously said that ethnic Albanians
are fleeing NATO's intensifying bombing campaign, now well into its
fourth week, or that the damage is done by the bombs, or by the
insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army, or even by the ethnic Albanians
themselves, to create provocations and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale of the ``cleansing'' _ the sheer number of burned
out houses and businesses _ was unmistakable, even in regions of
Kosovo that traditionally have a smaller number of ethnic
Albanians. At last count, the Albanians numbered about 1.8 million
in Kosovo, and the Serbs 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO's leaders say they are fighting to protect and defend
the ethnic Albanians, it seems clear that much of the Serb campaign
has been completed, at least in the areas the reporters were taken
through.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road from Gnjilane to Urosevac, then south to Prizren
and northwest to Djackovica, there were many hundreds of destroyed
dwellings and looted, burned shops. Sometimes there were only a few
such houses in a village; sometimes the whole village was empty,
with farm animals wandering about and fields clearly untended for
weeks in spring planting season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yugoslav authorities are asking ethnic Albanians to
return to their homes, it is less clear where all of them would now
be expected to live.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians tend to build their homes in walled compounds, and
often there were signs of shelling first, either by tanks or the
Praga anti-aircraft guns that the Serb forces often use for
close-in artillery. The houses _ sometimes decrepit, one-story
dwellings and sometimes grand affairs of three and four stories,
with steep roofs and satellite dishes _ were invariably burned out,
with their walls still standing, blackened and charred, but as
shells only, their red tile roofs collapsed and their contents, and
their inhabitants, gone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the houses were not burned, but their walls were
crushed, as if run over by a bulldozer or a tank, with bathtubs
poking out of the rubble at weird angles, or shoes scattered atop
the broken bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, the houses were intact, but appear empty, the
doors left wide open and some personal effects, clothes and food,
scattered outside, as if the inhabitants had left in a hurry. Along
with the eerie absence of people, given the number of buildings in
the towns, there seemed to be an unusually large number of stray
and very hungry dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Any visible shop or restaurant with an Albanian name or
reference _ a restaurant called Illyria, for instance, the ancient
name for the Albanians, near Urosevac _ has been looted or burned.
</P>
<P>
   The region was by no means empty of ethnic Albanians. Groups of
them could be seen in the towns or the fields, but they were
relatively few in number compared to the past, and overwhelmingly
elderly or female. Almost no ethnic Albanian males of fighting age
were to be seen, at least not from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Prizren, an elegant old Turkish town, normally crammed with car
traffic, street vendors and numerous ethnic Albanians, was eerily
quiet and empty. Unlike Pristina, the capital, there was very
little bomb damage. But Albanian store windows had been broken and
the contents looted; Serbs on the street, asked what happened to
their neighbors, shrugged, or, as one man said simply, ``They
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Prizren is also famous for the ``League of Prizren,'' a
gathering of Albanian intellectuals in 1878 who proposed an
independent Albania free from Turkish control. But many Serbs feel
the League inspired others to ``ethnically cleanse'' Serbs from
Kosovo, and a monument to them in the town was razed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   From Urosevac, the bus was supposed to go on a more northern
route to Prizren, through Stimlje, Dulje and Suva Reka, towns that
refugees say have been throughly cleansed. But an Army media minder
said that NATO's bombing and attacks by the Kosovo Liberation Army
around Dulje had made the road unsafe, so the bus of reporters was
redirected south, through Strpce and Brezovica, a mining town and a
ski resort town in the breathtaking and still snowcapped Zegovac
mountains, along the Lepenac River.
</P>
<P>
   Even along this road, the number of burned-out houses was
impressive, and stood in such harsh contrast to the beauty of the
scenery, with grazing sheep in sunny green mountain pastures, as to
seem almost cartoonish.

UROSEVAC, Serbia: as to seem almost cartoonish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a small cafe in Strpce, at a toilet and watering stop for the
reporters, some army officers were drinking coffees and plum
brandy. Two Serbs drinking beer spoke amusingly and aggressively
about Serbia's defiance of NATO bombing and demands. Their
particular anger was directed at President Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Asked what they would do if NATO troops
invaded, one laughed and said: ``Keep drinking beer.'' He paused,
then continued: ``And then I'd pick up a rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the expulsion of Albanians, he said that no such
thing had happened. Asked why the last 10 miles of road were lined
with burned-out houses, one man said: `No, no, no. Not true. Just
write what is true.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gnjilane, where a large Yugoslav Army barracks and warehouse
were destroyed early in the air campaign, the headquarters of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which had
provided the international verifiers that monitored Kosovo until
just before the war,was also trashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo roadside was also lined with ample evidence that the
Yugoslav Army has dug itself in. There were tanks and artillery
pieces hidden deep in the woods, or parked in the garages of
civilian homes, or nestled in barns, surrounded by hay, or stuck
into hay stacks.
</P>
<P>
   No large groups of Yugoslav army troops were evident. Apparently
they have dispersed, much of their job done in this part of Kosovo,
or are basing themselves farther from the roads. Army officers
drove the streets in civilian cars, sometimes with a printed paper
taped to the the windshield with the letters VJ, for Yugoslav Army,
in a triangle to indicate their official status. Some soldiers
drove along the road crammed into the cab of a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   There were small groups of soldiers at checkpoints, walking
along the streets or sitting in cafes. They seemed confident and
generally untroubled by the NATO planes that flashed overhead, or
by the explosions that boomed and echoed through Kosovo's hills. At
every bridge, burning piles of old tires or sawdust create smoke
intended to confuse NATO pilots or munitions.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two days in Kosovo, however limited and controlled
the movements of the reporters, there was a strong sense that this
iwa a war between the ancient and the modern _ between timeless
ethnic and tribal struggles, mythologies and cruelties. and the
high-tech weapons and modern values of human rights and shared
sovereignty of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has insisted that it will keep bombing until the Serbs give
up Kosovo and let the Albanians come home. But in the tragic
wreckage of Kosovo, there was every sign that the Serbs were
prepared to stay and fight.
</P>
<P>
   Among Albanians interviewed in the Prizren hospital or along the
Djackovica-Prizren road, itself lined with burned-out houses, there
was little hope that they would come home soon, if ever. They said
they were not returning home, as the Yugoslav authorities said, but
being moved farther from the border region with Albania and
Macedonia that was their home.
</P>
<P>
   They had been on the move for more than three weeks, said one of
them, Ismet Sulja, pushed by the Yugoslav army from Molic to
Dobrosa and then farther inland, to Djakovice and then toward
Prizren, both to escape the bombing, as he said, but also, perhaps,
to clear the border in case of a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Another Albanian, when asked at one of the sites of carnage near
Bistrazin about ethnic cleansing, within the possible hearing of
Serb authorities, shook his head. ``I'm very tired,'' he said, and
turned away.

COMMENTARY: ENGINE FOR CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ ``Optimism is the engine for change,'' Nerea
Abasolo said. ``In a climate without hope _ which is where we were
in the Basque Country _ even people with money won't invest. But
when you see things are happening around you, you want to join
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abasolo is communications director of the spectacular new
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, and she was talking about the effect
of the museum on this city and region. It is a transforming effect:
economic, psychological, perhaps even political.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it worth the world's attention is that the real
engine for change, the spark for optimism, is a work of art: Frank
Gehry's museum building. Everyone has seen the pictures of the
exterior _ the curved and angular titanium-clad shapes flowing into
each other, changing color from silver to gold with the light. But
nothing prepares you for the thing itself.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is as extraordinary as the much-photographed
exterior. At its heart is an atrium half again as high as Frank
Lloyd Wright's snail-shaped Guggenheim Museum in New York. Glass
and steel and limestone soar in lines and curves to unexpected
intersections. There are galleries of traditional shape for more
traditional works, like a current show of drawings, and of
unpredictable shapes for unpredictable modernity.
</P>
<P>
   It is the great building of the 20th century, I think. And it is
attracting visitors and supporters in amazing numbers. Before it
opened, in October 1997, experts predicted that 450,000 people
would visit it the first year. The actual number was three times
that, 1.36 million. They added $160 million to the Basque Country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the intangibles are more important than the figures. That is
what Nerea Abasolo meant in her comment about optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The Basque area of northern Spain used to be a center of heavy
industry, notably steel and shipbuilding. As those industries
declined in the 1980's, it became a depressed region, further
troubled by the decades-long terrorist campaign of the Basque
separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the Basque regional administration decided that the way
out of its slough of despond was culture. It agreed with the
Guggenheim Foundation to build a museum, at a cost of $100 million,
to be managed by Guggenheim _ and to pay the running expenses
thereafter. Within a year an architectural competition had been
held and Gehry selected.
</P>
<P>
   The site was a rust-belt classic: a former factory and parking
lot on the Nervion River, just down from the old port. A green
metal highway bridge bisected it. The competing architects proposed
walling off the bridge. Frank Gehry incorporated it in his design,
with one huge wing stretching under the bridge and a tower rising
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the construction work was done by Basque companies
and individuals, so the success of its advanced technology is in a
sense a tribute to Basque skill. For example, the building has
300,000 steel beams _ in 250,000 different sizes. A
three-dimensional computer program was used for the design and then
for the fabrication of the steel and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Basques are understandably proud of the museum. And Bilbao has
undertaken other major projects with such international architects
as Sir Norman Foster and Cesar Pelli.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the ETA announced a unilateral cease-fire, which
continues to hold. It can only be speculation, but the optimism to
which the museum has contributed may play a part in the turn away
from violence.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is significant in still another respect. In the
developed world today, people want at the same time to be part of
the global society and to be attached to local roots. The museum is
a symbol of both: an institution of international standing with a
strong local attachment.
</P>
<P>
   But for me the inspiring part of the Guggenheim Bilbao story is
the function of art _ of architecture. From ancient Athens to
Angkor Wat and the great cathedrals of Europe, architecture has
expressed the highest aspirations of the human spirit. Here in
Bilbao is a glimpse of what it could be for us today.
</P>
<P>
   Inescapably, too, it speaks of the extremes of human behavior.
In another corner of Europe, people are dying because of one man's
lust for power. Here they live more fully because of an architect's
genius for beauty.

   ALVIN, Texas _ At 83 years of age, Glenna Winn would just as
soon no one make a fuss over her.
</P>
<P>
   But when you have tea at the Governor's Mansion and are
recognized as a ``Volunteer of the Year'' by the Texas Commission
on Volunteerism and Community Service, it's hard to be a
wallflower.
</P>
<P>
   She will accept the award gracefully, but she worries that the
people who make her program work _ some 25 volunteers, most of whom
are older than 70 _ might be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For her efforts in coordinating the ``Are You O.K.?'' Program in
Alvin, Winn on Monday will be recognized at the 1999 Governor's
Volunteer Awards as the state's top volunteer of the senior
division.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she'll have tea at the guv's house.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, when the governor's secretary called her at her home on
Friday to go over some last minute details about Monday's ceremony,
Winn seemed unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   She's not ungrateful. She just wants to remind everyone she
alone doesn't make the ``Are You O.K.?'' Program successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 25 volunteers in back of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers make daily contact with 175 elderly, handicapped
and homebound residents in the town of 20,000 who otherwise might
be left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They deliver fans in the summer, heaters in the winter and help
some people with their electricity bills _ all on a budget of about
$4,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been copied in 10 other towns with Winn's
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many of the people her organization serves are
younger than Winn, who turns 84 on the 4th of July.
</P>
<P>
   With a deadpan sense of humor that belies her age, Winn can be
disarmingly blunt when offering opinions on anything from TV, which
she refuses to watch because of the ``trashy'' content, to
bureaucrats, who she believes hinder more than help programs that
assist the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Winn joked that she would like to use a baseball bat on a
certain bureaucrat at the county courthouse whom she feels slighted
her program's clients last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she doesn't worry about whom she might offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like when you're as old as I am _ what can they do to
you?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A widow who still drives her 1989 blue Buick Regal around town,
Winn also doesn't shrink from criticizing the elected leaders of
Alvin for what she calls their stingy ways in aiding the ``Are You
O.K.?'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Alvin is not economical _ they're just plain
cheap,'' she said. ``They're the cheapest bunch of people you'll
ever run into.''
</P>
<P>
   With no government subsidy, she must raise money as well as run
the volunteer program, which was begun in 1992 by Police Chief Mike
Merkel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to her success has been her energy and her
enthusiasm,'' said Merkel, an unabashed fan. ``I love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn, who grew up in Centralia, Ill., as the daughter of a
railroad man, came to Texas in the 1940s to attend the University
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Alvin 35 years ago when she and her husband
William, dead now 20 years, decided to open an office supply
business.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't crazy about leaving the city for the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pitiful back then,'' she said of the Brazoria County
town's slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Today, taking another look at her town, Winn believes the
program she has coordinated has made Alvin a more comfortable place
for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days ago, she said, an Alvin woman who had undergone a
double mastectomy followed by chemotherapy found herself home alone
late one night believing some ice cream might make her feel better.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who is served by the ``Are You O.K.?'' program, she
called the police dispatcher to see if an officer could bring her
some, Winn said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher calmly explained an officer would come by as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, he did, with a quart of ice cream in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Winn relates the story with a twinkle in her eye. It's the kind
of story that makes her think back 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I couldn't imagine living in Alvin, Texas,'' she
said, ``but now I'm glad I did.''

LOGISTICS OF KOSOVO GROUND WAR POINT UP DIFFICULTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are solid reasons why NATO nations are
reluctant to send ground troops into Kosovo. As Defense Secretary
William Cohen told the Senate this week, many alliance soldiers
would die.
</P>
<P>
   For NATO leaders worried about maintaing political support, that
alone poses a major obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   But military analysts who have studied the terrain and tactics
have another reason for concern: Mounting and sustaining an
invasion, they said would be more difficult than it might look at
first glance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as NATO's bombing intensifies and Slobodan Milosevic's
troops stand their ground, more and more people, especially in
Congress, are talking about sending in the troops.
</P>
<P>
   What might a ground war in Kosovo look like? How do the troops
get there? What do they do, once they are in?
</P>
<P>
   Cohen this week referred to Pentagon studies, estimating that
30,000 to 75,000 combat troops would be needed to push the 25,000
Serbian forces out of Kosovo. As many as 200,000 might be needed if
the aim were to take control of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The map shows several ways into Kosovo, but only a few are
practical. The easiest would be from the north, across central
Europe and through Hungary. But this makes sense only if an
invasion of all of Serbia is the object. That would include
conquest of the capital, Belgrade, a step that probably exceeds
NATO's wildest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal is to liberate Kosovo, then the troops must come in
through Albania from the southwest or Macedonia from the southeast,
preferably both.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to break in from both routes simultaneously,'' said
Barry Posen, professor of strategic studies at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``You want to maximize pressure on the
Serbs, make them wonder where we're coming from, rattle their
cages.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 11,000 NATO troops are currently stationed in
Macedonia, and more on the way, the leaders of the newly
independent republic oppose letting NATO use their territory as a
staging area for an invasion. If NATO respects Macedonian wishes,
an invasion would be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   Two roads cut into Kosovo from Albania, though only one of them
is firm enough to support vehicles bigger than a four-wheel truck.
Even the one useful road runs into hills, mountains, and forests
just over the border, and it has just two lanes, which would allow
only a one-way column of military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really large forces are going to fall all over themselves,''
Posen said. ``There will be bottlenecks,'' which could make an
assault vulnerable even to beleaguered Serbian defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Posen said NATO troops would eventually push their way
in, possibly after a few days of quite intense fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After this push, the terrain opens up to plains, ideal for tanks
and other armored vehicles, assuming the roads and bridges up to
that point can support such heavy machines.
</P>
<P>
   However, a few miles farther north, the plains break up into
smaller basins surrounded by more hills, mountains, and forests.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, who asked not to be identified, said units
in one of these basins could not easily support or reinforce units
in other basins. He also expressed concern that Serbs could take
potshots from the many hiding places all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is like a medieval fortress,'' the official said.
``There are exit walls, interior walls, and compartments. Once you
penetrate the wall, you have to clean out the compartments.''
</P>
<P>
   British defense minister George Robinson, speaking at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government Friday, made the
same point: ``I would remind you that Kosovo was last successfully
invaded in 1395, because of its unique geography.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO were to attempt an invasion anyway, attack helicopters,
such as the 48 Apaches that are being sent to the region, would be
vital. They could fly across the geographic barriers and provide
additional firepower where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Air-cavalry brigades, including larger helicopters to transport
infantry troops, would also play a major role.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Serbs are still believed to have a large arsenal of
antiaircraft weapons, including shoulder-fired surface-to-air
missiles. Much of NATO's bombing campaign is designed to destroy
the Serb antiaircraft threat, but many of the weapons are small and
portable.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have said the bombing could go on for weeks or
months. Mobilizing an invasion, which involves transporting troops,
weapons, and supplies to the area, as well as expanding bases and
staging areas in the region, would itself take a month or two.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contemplate a different approach _ a bold airborne
assault-and-landing on the one airfield in Kosovo, just south of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a military specialist at the Federation of American
Scientists, a private organization, calls this tactic ``kicking the
door down.'' Just before such an assault begins, Pike speculated,
NATO attack planes would clear the area with a continuous barrage
of cluster bombs, forcing any Serbs around the airport to clear out
or take cover.
</P>
<P>
   Then transport planes _ carrying armored vehicles, weapons, and
troops _ would fly in, land at the airport, and set up an operating
base in the heart of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a week to get a brigade on the ground,'' Pike
estimated. A brigade consists of roughly 5,000 troops. Once the
base is secure, many more could fly in.
</P>
<P>
   Around Pristina, the terrain is fairly wide-open, and many roads
head wherever a commander would want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Pike noted such an operation would be ``challenging,'' likening
it to the Inchon landing in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The whole scheme _ like any scheme for a ground war _ assumes
that weeks of NATO bombardment will have reduced the Serbian forces
to a tattered, immobilized shadow of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, half the Serbs in Kosovo are army draftees, the other
half are security police. One group may not have the stomach for a
serious fight, the other may not have the training. But other
analysts worry that all these scenarios may underestimate the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon official points to an early-1950s US Army study of
the Yugoslav resistance to the Nazi juggernaut of World War II.
Hitler's generals threw well over 100,000 troops _ at one point,
over a half-million _ into Yugoslavia. For two years, until the
Allies conquered Italy, the resistance was on its own. The
partisans took heavy losses _ two-thirds of the country's males
between age 15 and 55 were killed or wounded _ but enough retreated
to the mountains or forests and returned to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the 14th century, Posen said of the Serbs, ``Their
whole mental construct involves fighting great powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Serbs, he added, may not be the fearsome warriors of
olden times, nor is today's Yugoslavia as big as it was back then.
Kosovo is tinier still _ a diamond-shaped province about 80 by 80
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even those who are optimistic about the results of a
ground war say NATO troops are bound to suffer a fair number of
casualties _ no one would guess how many _ especially in the
battle's first days, when the Serbs can be expected to haul out
everything they can muster to try to bog the Westerners down.
</P>
<P>
   This is why some analysts, particularly the military officers
who would plan an invasion, would prefer to pour in as many troops
_ and make the assault as overpowering _ as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for an all-out approach is that, even if NATO
restricted the invasion to Kosovo, commanders would want at least
to threaten Serbia _ to keep Milosevic's troops bottled up, unable
to reinforce or resupply those trapped in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Posen said one brigade might be poised on the border between
Macedonia and Serbia for this purpose. A Marine amphibious force
could anchor just off Yugoslavia's western shores, in the Adriatic
Sea, as a further threat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ground-war option in Senate hearings this week,
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said,
``It would be a long and drawn-out proposition'' _ which is why,
for the moment, within the NATO alliance, ``there's no political
support to carry it out.''

GREENSPAN DENOUNCES PROTECTIONIST PRESSURES IN TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, waded
into the escalating debate over trade policy Friday, denouncing
growing protectionist pressures and arguing that pockets of workers
sometimes had to suffer in order for the national economy to
strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Dallas, Greenspan did not directly address the
biggest question on the trade agenda, the possible entry of China
into the World Trade Organization. But he laid out a broad case for
knocking down trade barriers and warned that attempts to halt the
development of a more global economy are futile and harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's influence could be of substantial help to the
Clinton administration as it seeks to complete a deal with China
and win congressional approval for the pact.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan criticized the administration for framing the
benefits of trade in what he called the wrong way. The point of
expanding trade is not to create new jobs, Greenspan said, directly
contradicting Clinton's main argument for why the United States
should be battling to open new markets. Rather, Greenspan said,
trade forces the United States to become more competitive, and to
use its resources _ people, technology and money _ in the most
productive way.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman also took the administration and Congress to
task for taking what he called an overly narrow view of trade
relations, saying the benefits of trade to one country do not come
at the expense of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support
for free trade in this country,'' Greenspan said in a speech to
business executives and foreign ambassadors. ``Should we endeavor
to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly
slow economic growth overall and impart substantial harm to those
workers who would otherwise seek more effective longer-term job
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan spoke after 10 days of debate within the
administration and throughout Washington over how hard to push for
a deal that would bring China under the internationally agreed
rules of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton backed away from a deal with China's prime
minister, Zhu Rongji, despite sweeping concessions from the Chinese
on a variety of trade issues. Clinton concluded that he would not
be able to win approval from Congress at a time when many members
of both parties are particularly unhappy with China because of
accusations that it has violated human rights, spread nuclear
weapons and spied on American weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   But after criticism from business leaders, Clinton restarted
talks with China, and White House officials hope a deal can be
concluded swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other administration
officials who advised the president to go for a better deal,
Greenspan does not have to worry about marshaling votes for his
position. There are factions within both parties that oppose
further trade deals as unfair to American workers, and even among
those who are supportive there is a strong sense that other nations
too often fail to play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The House recently passed legislation that would restrict steel
imports from Russia and Japan, among other countries. And Clinton
has been unable to win stronger trade negotiating authority from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a deal with China said Greenspan's influence could
help in Congress, if business leaders and other groups who can
explain how more trade will help ordinary Americans also speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we have to hear from people like
Greenspan and major CEOs, as well as the president of course,''
said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But even some free trade supporters said Greenspan's absolutist
position _ he also criticized tactics like anti-dumping rules as
``simple guises for inhibiting competition'' _ failed to take
account of the effects that changing trade rules can have on
companies and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue is not free trade versus protectionism,'' said
Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``The question is the structure in which
free trade will operate, which has become an especially salient
issue as globalization integrates evolving economies.''
</P>
<P>
   As seen by Greenspan, the effects of trade on workers and
companies is part of an all-but-unstoppable cycle of ``creative
destruction.'' In his view, a vibrant economy remakes itself
constantly by giving up on activities that some other country can
do more cheaply, and takes advantage of new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of
progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of
progress,'' Greenspan said.

   MORINA BORDER POINT, Albania _ Day and night Kosovo refugees
stumbled out of their country Friday, describing tens of thousands
following them in the wake of an increasingly brutal and systematic
Serbian-led Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly international aid agencies here realized Friday they
are ill-equipped to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelter is a big problem, and hygiene and health,'' said Paul
Martin, coordinator here for the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), as he worriedly watched tractor caravans brimming with
close-packed bodies clear registration procedures at the border
checkpoint Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize. After the low numbers last week, I think
people weren't geared up for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials in Macedonia had the help of NATO troops who were
erecting thousands more tents at camps in anticipation of continued
waves of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Well more than half of Kosovo's 2.2 million population -- 90
percent which are ethnic Albanians -- is estimated to have fled
already, but that still leaves around a
</P>
<P>
   million potential refugees should the Serb juggernaut continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking at the very least tens of thousands and
possibly in the hundreds of thousands. We have no way of knowing,''
said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Skopje, the capital of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Friday about 10,000 had entered through the single
main Albania border crossing, tripling the entries of Thursday. At
least 6,000 crossed three border points into Macedonia, equalling
the number on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They face troubling situations, especially in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday morning, when the surge of refugees already had
begun crossing this border checkpoint, there were virtually no
available tents in the nearby city of Kukes where they will stay.
And many if not most of these new exiles were coming on foot,
without a car to shield them from rain or even a blanket to dull
the nighttime mountain cold.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of relief groups, water systems were reported to be
taxed to the limit in Kukes, where water already is being rationed
to a few hours a day to the permanent population.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies also reported almost no vacant, available land for
refugees coming in cars or the ubiquitous tractor-drawn wagons that
carry 15 to 40 people each.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who crossed the borders Friday came in tears and
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   They told of killings, of girls being grabbed and kept by
Serbian police and army, of family separations, beatings, theft and
the conflagrations they say Serbian authorities made of their homes
back in Kosovo when they chased them out.
</P>
<P>
   Some had walked for five days and literally staggered over the
border with the help of family into the arms of waiting medics. Old
people were pushed across in wheelbarrows, sometimes by spouses
just as old. Cars sputtered and died, as their last fumes of fuel
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   The first cases of malnutrition were seen, according to Angela
Walker, spokesperson for the World Food Program in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden influx was attributed to the rigorous ethnic
cleansing campaigns refugees said the Serbs conducted Thursday and
Friday in cities including Urosevac in southeast Kosovo and the
Mitrovice metropolitan area in central Kosovo, where as many as
180,000 Kosovar Albanians had lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the army is left now in Mitrovice, and the police,'' said
Maser Rixhebi, 40. He was driving a tractor hauling 27 people
including his family from the Mitrovice area, which he said the
Serbs have destroyed and totally depopulated of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those who may try to hide in forests or mountains,
all the people from Mitrovice will be heading into Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving in Macedonia described a two-week-long
campaign of attacks on villages by Serbian army forces, police and
masked paramilitary gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces are deliberately setting fires in the woodlands near
villages in an apparent effort to flush out hiding refugees, the
new arrivals said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials believe more than 400,000 ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo could be in hiding. But they are running low on food and
could fall victim to malnutrition and disease.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 refugees arrived Friday at the Macedonian border by
train from Urosevac, where they were allowed to pass freely by
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who came to the city, they are safe,'' said refugee
Arben Berisha, 40, who traveled with his family. ``We're worried
about our relatives and friends. There is no shelter. There is no
food, and now there are the fires. We pray for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Border scenes here in Albania were heart-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives who dragged along a teen-aged boy scarcely able to
walk said they had been hiding in the mountains for two weeks. They
described the ashen-faced boy as sick and exhausted, then rushed to
follow the medics who were taking his collapsed body for treatment
at a first aid tent.
</P>
<P>
   Zade Radce, a 50-year-old woman who looked like she could have
been 70, limped across the border with the aid of a cane. She had
been walking for five days and bore puss-filled abrasions on her
nose, cheek and upper lip, the souvenir of Serbian troops who she
said pushed her to the ground and stomped on her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten lost. I've gotten lost,'' she cried, holding the
hand of her 14-year-old stepdaughter, who clutched only a blanket.
She didn't know what had become of her husband.
</P>
<P>

   LOS ANGELES _ Jazz programs, more ``themed'' series and a stage
extension are in store for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's 1999-2000

</P>
<P>
   Music director Esa-Pekka Salonen, who made the announcement
Thursday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion along with managing
director Willem Wijnbergen, also confirmed he will take a planned
sabbatical during 2000. ``I'll do domestic things, like wash my car
... I'm also supposed to write an opera,'' Salonen deadpanned. Top
conductors, including Simon Rattle and Zubin Mehta, will fill in
for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the artistic quality will suffer at all,'' joked
Salonen of his upcoming break, saying he hoped people wouldn't
forget he existed in the interim. ``It would be nice it if suffered
a little, but I don't think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Wijnbergen, who has championed the idea of programs built around
marketable themes (such as Romantic period compositions), said next
season's schedule will be formatted in that fashion in order to
``keep all our audiences in mind ... we believe there are very
different audiences in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be five different orchestral series categories: the
Legacy series, focusing on familiar classical to late-Romantic
compositions; the Signature series, featuring 20th-century works
interwoven into programs; the Rendezvous series, featuring the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra
(in its first subscription concerts at the Music Center); the
Discovery Series, highlighting world premiere performances and
emerging artists; and Romantic Concertos, a series of popular
classics for violin and cello soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity recital highlights include violinist Christian
Tetzlaff, soprano Sylvia McNair and an all-star piano quartet made
up of Isaac Stern, Jaime Laredo, Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax.
</P>
<P>
   Wijnbergen called the upcoming year ``very much a season of
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In everything we do now, we're thinking of Disney Hall,''
Wijnbergen said, referring to the long-delayed concert hall planned
to be built across the street from the Music Center in downtown Los
Angeles. He said the latest projected opening date is fall 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a step toward the new hall, which features a seating plan
where the audience surrounds the orchestra, a stage extension next
season will bring the orchestra closer to concertgoers. Wijnbergen
quickly added that all Philharmonic subscribers are being contacted
to explain the change and invited to come to a preseason open house
where they can preview the view from their seats. An earlier
attempt at extending the stage was aborted several years ago after
some subscribers complained bitterly about poorer sight lines.
</P>
<P>
   The new jazz subscription concerts are being programmed by
artistic director John Clayton, who has performed regularly at the
Hollywood Bowl. Clayton said details on the programs were not yet
available but that Los Angeles performers should be spotlighted on
one program. He said the series ``affords us the opportunity to
play a mix of familiar jazz sounds alongside premieres.''
</P>
<P>
   No more ``Filmharmonic'' projects, which combine filmmaking and
original compositions, are currently scheduled. The first and only
of the series so far, composed by David Newman, will receive a
repeat performance at the Hollywood Bowl this summer. Salonen
admitted scheduling has been a problem, resulting in the
cancellation of a planned program next month. But he and Wijnbergen
said they hope more will be scheduled as opportunities arise.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to his sabbatical, Salonen will be busy in the
recording studio. In a drive to get several CDs ``in the can''
before his leave, the orchestra will record discs including a
Hindemith album with Emanuel Ax as piano soloist on ``The Four
Temperments,'' and a recording with Joshua Bell playing the
Sibelius and Goldmark violin concertos.
</P>
<P>
   Season tickets are now on sale. They may be charged by phone at
(323) 850-2000, by fax at (323) 962-2192, or via the Internet at
www.laphil.org; single tickets go on sale in October.

ALBANIAN REFUGEES POUR OUT OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new wave of thousands of Kosovar Albanian
refugees poured across the border Friday and a United Nations
official estimated as many as 100,000 could soon cross into
Macedonia. US officials reported fresh evidence of mass killings in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,000 refugees crossed into Macedonia on Friday, and
another 8,000 arrived in Albania by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, meanwhile, claimed one of its most punishing nights of
bombing Yugoslav targets Friday, even as the alliance faced new
questions about its accidental attack on a civilian convoy in
Kosovo and its true rate of success in destroying military sites.
</P>
<P>
   With a warning from Defense Secretary William Cohen that the air
campaign could last months, the Clinton administration Friday
prepared to call up 33,000 reservists and send Congress a request
for $5.9 billion to pay for the war effort and humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's admission that a pilot accidentally bombed a civilian
convoy in Kosovo Wednesday continued to reverberate. Serbian
authorities charged that a second NATO attack killed civilians in
Kosovo, but NATO officials said they had no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, rebuffing any suggestion that the civilian deaths would
make NATO retreat, said: ``If anything, we are more solidly
determined to continue the air campaign and to start inflicting
more and more damage upon (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic's
forces . . . in the coming weeks and months, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Thursday night bombing raids struck oil refineries,
airports, and other facilities, officials said. NATO planes also
attacked sites in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, where
President Milo Djukanovic expressed dismay at being targeted even
though ``Montenegro has contributed neither to the making nor to
the escalation of the Kosovo problem.''
</P>
<P>
   These other developments occurred Friday:
</P>
<P>
   --Ibrahim Rugova, an ethnic Albanian leader, met with Yugoslav
government officials. The Yugoslavs said Rugova discussed a peace
plan with them, but State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Rugova is being held against his will and should be allowed to
travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO officials said the Kosovo Liberation Army, made up of
ethnic Albanians, are contributing more to the fight against the
Serbs in Kosovo. A NATO spokesman said the KLA has risen ``like a
phoenix'' and is helping to put the Serbs ``in something of a
vise.''
</P>
<P>
   --President Clinton appealed to an audience in Michigan, home to
many people with roots in Serbia and Kosovo, to support his policy.
While acknowledging some protests by Serbian-Americans, Clinton
said ``our quarrel'' is with Milosevic, who ``believes it is all
right to kill people and to uproot them and to destroy their family
records and to erase any record of their presence in a land simply
because of their ethnic heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen confirmed that he is requesting the president call up a
``significant number'' of reservists, many of them from Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard units that are trained in aerial
refueling and airlift. Army Reserve specialists in civil affairs
are also expected to be activated.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said they had new evidence, which
they did not immediately provide, of ``mass killings'' in Kosovo.
``We are developing evidence that is rather compelling...that in
west central Kosovo, west of Pristina, there is evidence of mass
killings and graves associated with those mass killings,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials continued to say publicly that
there was no intention of starting a ground war. But Senator James
M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said the deployment of ground
troops into the combat zone had already begun. He cited the
announcement that 4,800 soldiers are going to staging areas in
Albania and that reserve troops are being called up.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, the debate over ground troops is
over,'' Inhofe said in a statement. ``President Clinton has always
wanted US ground troops in Kosovo, they always knew that air power
alone would not work, and now the initial deployments are going
on.'' Inhofe called the move illegal and mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the air attacks were proving successful,
especially Thursday night. ``In fact,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
said, ``it was one of the best nights thus far in our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon Friday, officials continued their daily practice
of showing video footage from NATO aircraft of successful bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After the films were run, a reporter asked the Pentagon briefer,
Major General Charles F. Wald of the US Air Force, why he wasn't
showing footage of bombs that missed their targets. A number of
military analysts have said that NATO may have a low rate of
destroying targets.
</P>
<P>
   Wald, after promising to show more videos of misses, said the
Gulf War experience showed an average of ``80 to 90 percent hits.''
Wald said he did not know if that applied to the air campaign over
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Djukanovic had harsh words for NATO attacks on
Montenegro, which is part of the Yugoslav federation but has been
relatively pro-Western.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequences of the bombing are horrific,'' Djukanovic
said at a press conference. ``Montenegro has contributed neither to
the making nor to the escalation of the Kosovo problem. However, as
a republic of Yugoslavia, it is suffering drastic consequences of
the NATO strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Military targets in Montenegro were bombed Thursday evening; no
casualties have been reported. An airfield in Montenegro has been
``extensively targeted'' because Yugoslav aircraft based there
posed an increasing threat to NATO forces in Albania, said Brig.
Gen. Guiseppe Marani, a NATO spokesman in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens blared Friday afternoon in Montenegro, and there
was a small but heated anti-NATO demonstration in front of the old
American Center offices, but no bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has been walking a thin line in the conflict, trying
to keep from provoking either the West or Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Montenegro has nonetheless been subjected to bombing, has
accepted more than 100,000 refugees, and is in an increasingly
tense situation with the Yugoslav National Army, which has 20,000
troops spread throughout Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic dismissed the possibility of a much-rumored military
coup against him. But he said he was sure Milosevic would continue
to try to inject upheaval into Montenegro ``to ensure an overthrow
of the government here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Mr. Milosevic is in power, and I hope that it will
not be for much longer, there will be an ongoing attempt by his
side to repress democracy,'' Djukanovic said. Djukanovic said the
army had a ``legitimate right'' to defend Montenegro from a NATO
assault and said he would never approve of the sending of NATO
ground troops from Montenegro to be used in neighboring Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, speaking at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government Friday, called the
NATO campaign in Kosovo ``a defining moment in the aftermath of the
Cold War.'' Democratic nations, he said, ``have to draw a clear
line against the notion that the solution to ethnic conflict is to
shift populations around as though they were worthless counters in
some elaborate board-game.''

SHAHEEN CALLS FOR INCOME TAX BILL _ SO SHE CAN VETO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N. H. _ In an angry message to the Democratically
controlled Senate she worked hard to elect, New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen Friday implored senators to pass an income tax bill
to help end the state's school funding crisis. Then, she said, she
could swifly veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen has consistently said the giving New Hampshire its first
ever income tax is not the way to fund public schools. But, two
weeks after a court-imposed deadline passed, lawmakers have yet to
find the money, and Shaheen blames income-tax advocates for the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now April 16. Many teachers have been pink slipped, our
bond rating is in jeopardy and our communities face grave financial
uncertainty. The income tax stranglehold must come to an end,''
Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Her blunt words reflect the deep frustration that has settled on
Concord. In the past week angry educators have bombarded
legislators with letters and calls; the state's capital city has
threatened a lawsuit of its own; an $825 million tax plan with
Shaheen's backing was pulled back while under attack and the mood
in the State House is uglier than anything veteran lawmakers can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   And while their debate moves in circles, Wall Street bond rating
agencies are hinting heavily that city and state credit ratings
could be downgraded, raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have time,''said Gary Mescher, a Moody's Investors
Service vice president and the company's chief New Hampshire
analyst, but ``the clock is ticking.''
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis is another step in a nationwide fight over
what critics charge is inequitable school funding. In New
Hampshire, which has until now relied mostly on local propert taxes
to pay for schools, tax rates vary by as much as fifteen-fold
between poor and wealthy communities. New Hampshire is one of 36
states where a lawsuit has challenged the old system, and one of 20
where the lawsuit was successful.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that lawsuit, the court gave lawmaker until April
1 to find a new source of funding.
</P>
<P>
   But finding a solution has proved especially complicated here
because the state has long resisted enacting a broad base sales or
income tax. The court's decision, and the ensuing political crises,
has encouraged those who want an income tax because it would make
the state's tax structure more progressive. According to a ranking
in Congressional Quarterly, the state is among the least
progressive _ 45th of 50 _ in the union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an income tax proposal died in legislative maneuvering. And
none of the many other proposals has emerged from the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse has left school districts who are trying to plan
their next year's budgets, and hire teachers, stymied. In Franklin,
the high school is on academic probation and the school boiler
won't last another winter, said school board member Donna Gilbreth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still hold classes up in the gym but they can't put too
many people in it because then the asbestos starts flaking off and
falling down on the people below,'' Gilbreth said.
</P>
<P>
   Though their paychecks will not stop until July, teachers are
finding that even a pink slip sent as a formality can have serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One teacher told me that she was asked to sign for a college
loan for her child but couldn't get a letter from her school
district saying that she had a guaranteed income. Another teacher
told me that he couldn't close on his mortgage,'' said Dennis
Murphy, spokesman for the state's largest teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Concord, tempers were so short on Thursday that
Speaker of the House Donna Sytek gave members of the finance
committee a long weekend to cool off. The House is not scheduled to
meet again until next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Senate will consider Shaheen's exasperated
request to pass on the income tax proposal. Senators will also
consider a plan crafted late Friday by 12 Democrats which would
include a capital gains tax and statewide property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with tax plans, alliances and meeting schedules changing
almost hourly anything could happen next week.
</P>
<P>
   Or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest dysfunctional famly I've ever seen,'' said
Gordon Allen, an economist and former house finance committee
member who is tracking progress for a citizens group. ``The turkey
is burned up. The family is drunk and several of the uncles are
having a fistfight in the backyard.''

ending, the number of men studying at the nation's graduate-level
seminaries to become Roman Catholic priests has risen to the
highest level in five years, according to a study by a Catholic
social science research center.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate,
at Georgetown University, found that 3,386 men in the United States
were enrolled in graduate-level theological work for the priesthood
in the current academic year, up by 228 from last year and the
highest figure since 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic officials concede that even the current numbers of
seminarians at the graduate level _ the level from which candidates
for the priesthood are ordained _ are not enough to replace the
priests who retire or die each year, a circumstance that helps
account for the sharp rise in the church's need for people to enter
lay ministries.
</P>
<P>
   But the center's findings suggest that a precipitate falloff in
the number of men preparing for the Catholic priesthood has abated
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects a general stability in enrollment,'' said Bryan
T. Froehle, the center's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Froehle and others who have studied the issue attribute the
development to the expansion of two-year pre-graduate-level
programs, largely for older men considering the priesthood; a
slight rise in the number of college-level seminarians, and
stepped-up recruitment efforts by bishops.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Raymond F. Collins, dean of the school of religious
studies at the Catholic University of America, in Washington, said
he thought that the trend toward enrollment stability was not
evenly spread among seminaries and instead reflected an increase in
enrollment at conservative institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one major factor,'' Collins said. ``It's hardly
a uniform trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant Catholics also account for an important share of
seminarians. The Rev. Timothy T. Reker, executive director of
vocations and priestly formation at the U.S. Catholic Conference,
said 24 percent of the men scheduled to graduate from seminaries in
1999 were born outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that we certainly notice this year is 5 percent were
born in Vietnam,'' Reker said. ``The next-highest would be Mexico,
3 percent this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the number of lay people enrolled in
professional-level training programs for church work like religious
education, youth ministry or parish administration had risen to
29,137 at present from 10,500 in 1985. These figures are a sign of
the church's growing demand for workers as the number of priests
declines while the Catholic population rises.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas J. Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America,
whose April 10 issue includes an article detailing the church's
need for lay staff, said, ``We're seeing today a tremendous
increase in the number of lay people involved in direct ministry in
the church, either as volunteers or paid staff people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese attributed that increase not only to the importance that
the Second Vatican Council placed on the laity's role but also to
the decline in the number of the nation's Roman Catholic priests:
from over 60,000 to under 50,000 in the last three decades, during
which the Catholic population in the United States has risen above
61 million.
</P>
<P>
   That drop in the number of priests is reflected in the long
downward trend in seminary enrollment. The number of young men
enrolled in graduate level, college and high school seminary
programs topped 30,000 in the late 1960s, more than five times the
current level. ``The attrition,'' Froehle said, ``was always
greatest in the high schools and colleges,'' which fed seminarians
to the graduate level.
</P>
<P>
   What has helped bolster the graduate-level ranks, Froehle said,
is the expansion of ``pre-theology'' programs directed at older
men, college graduates who do not have the training in philosophy,
theology and spiritual direction needed for a graduate-level,
four-year seminary.
</P>
<P>
   The number of students enrolled in such pre-theology programs,
who were counted in the new study, has risen fourfold since 1980,
to 635. (Some say, on the other hand, that the larger number of
older candidates for the priesthood means that the church is
relying on men whose active service will be shorter, perhaps by a
decade or more, than the customary candidate who enters the
seminary straight from preparatory study in college.)
</P>
<P>
   Reker said this year's increase among graduate-level seminarians
was also at least partly a result of a greater involvement by
American bishops in talking to men about entering the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, anecdotal evidence from seminaries suggests that
there is ``a great deal of hope'' for enrollments next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is a corner has been turned,'' he said, ``and the
outlook is more positive again.''

WELFARE REFORM STUDY   PAINTS ROSY PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' first long-term study of life after
welfare, released Friday, indicates former recipients have higher
incomes now, and feel better about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A year after leaving welfare in early 1997, about 71 percent of
those families who responded to the survey had full-time members
earning an average gross monthly wage of $1,400, more than double
the typical $579 cash grant on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after leaving welfare in 1997, nearly half of those
who had jobs also reported having health insurance through their
employer. And after a year, half of those who responded to the
survey reported that the state was still subsidizing their child
care.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study showed about 18 percent of the households
interviewed had returned to welfare within three months after
leaving, and about 21 percent had gone back on the rolls within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform critics pounded the study Friday, saying the
results were skewed by small interview samples of people who left
welfare before they were forced off by time limits. Those people,
critics say, were better prepared to work and do not represent the
hard-core welfare cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study has rose-tinted glasses on,'' said Mac D'Alessandro,
coordinator of the Family Economic Initiative, a coalition of
advocates and organizations working with poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even state officials balked at statistics showing
that only one in five eligible families was receiving federal Food
Stamps three months after leaving the rolls, even though more
families reported going hungry right after they left the welfare
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition is not easy for everyone,'' said State
Department of Transitional Assistance Commissioner Claire McIntire
Friday. ``We have to, and will, do a better job of making former
recipients aware of their availability.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McIntire called the study ``encouraging,'' and said it
bolstered the department's philosophy that jobs are the key to
ending dependence on government aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly reinforces our philosphy that full-time work is
a critical step in escaping the clutches of poverty,'' McIntire
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Harris, a lawyer with the Massachusetts Law reform
Institute, said the survey response was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 647 randomly selected cases, only about half of them
responded to the first round of surveys. By the fourth round of
surveys, participation had dropped to about a third of those
households.
</P>
<P>
   Harris argued that many of those who answered all three rounds
of the surveys were those families who were still doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more likely to respond if they're feeling good,''
she said. ``People feeling hostile are less likely to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Sifting through the numbers, advocates for welfare families said
that only 56 percent of all families who were interviewed a year
after leaving welfare actually had a member who worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best of the bunch,'' said Randy Albelda, a labor
economist at the University of Massachusetts/Boston, who studies
poverty. ``These aren't folks forced off. This is the best face of
the impact of welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Albelda, the co-author of a May 1998 study of welfare time
limits, pointed out that, even by the survey's own data, families
of four making $1,399 a month earn just slightly more than $16,450
a year _ the current federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state's welfare reform legislation was signed into law
in February 1995, the rolls have dropped from 102,993 families to
53,818 families, according to state figures.
</P>
<P>
   In Dec. 1, 1998, 5,100 families _ each typically consisting of a
mother with two children over age 2 _ began to see their cash
benefits run out. Of those families, 2,800 applied for last-minute
extensions because they could not find a job or child care.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, of the 2,220 extension requests reviewed so far,
state officials had approved only about 12 percent, making
Massachusetts one of the strictest in the nation in adhering to
time-limited cash aid.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the new survey were gleaned from two sets of
interviews of 341 families who left welfare in the first half of
1997. Welfare workers conducted one set of interviews three months
after the families left welfare, and the other was done a year
after, with 210 of the same families interviewed for both.
</P>
<P>
   In other survey findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-three percent of those who had jobs said they were a
little better off since leaving welfare, while 26 percent said they
were much better off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 95 percent of those surveyed said their children had
MassHealth or some other kind of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly half of all the families reported using friends and
relatives for child care, instead of licensed centers or family day
care.

IS GATES POURING FUEL ON HIS RIVALS' FIRE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The worthies of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology had just finished thanking William H. Gates profusely
for paying for a planned new computer science building with a
handwritten personal check for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Gates walked out the door last week than a
procession of leading researchers at the university's renowned
Laboratory for Computer Science sketched out projects and visions
of the technological future that all headed in one direction: away
from the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   In a talk called ``The Post PC Internet,'' David Clark, an MIT
computer scientist, described a world in which the personal
computer is less important because everything _ TV, wristwatch,
eyeglasses, toaster _ has a computer-on-a-chip and ``everything is
going to be connected to the Internet.'' For example, a watch face
might temporarily become a tiny screen displaying your appointments
for the day, information sent wirelessly to the watch from its
storage folder on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of computing is inevitably heterogeneous,'' Clark
asserted. ``Get used to it.'' He means technologically
heterogeneous, not ruled, as PCs are, by a dominant technology
standard like Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Shrink-wrapped software will go the way of the buggy whip,
according to the MIT computer experts. Consumers will be given
computers _ ``information appliances'' in the new world _ free, or
more accurately, bundled into a monthly service charge, on the
model of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Much of corporate computing, predicts Hal Abelson, an MIT
professor, will shift to the service model as well. The large
computer installations at companies that run their own Web sites
will be replaced by centralized hosting services. The analogy is
with electricity: in the 19th century, factories had their own
generators, but with the rise of electric utilities, manufacturers
left power generation to the specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Abelson expects that even storage of corporate data, from
procurement orders to customer records, will be handled by outside
service suppliers. ``You'll see the market for disks being replaced
by storage services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark summarized with this forecast: ``What does the future look
like? Well, it's a network full of services.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Gates supporting a computer lab dedicated to the
destruction of Microsoft's world? After all, many of the
pronouncements heard last week at the conference marking the 35th
anniversary of the MIT computer lab _ an incubator for pioneering
work ranging from word processing and spreadsheet software to PC
networking and e-mail _ sound strikingly like the marketing slogans
of Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The network is king? The mantra of Sun Microsystems is ``The
network is the computer.'' Big iron at the hub of hosting
operations and Internet services as the business of the future? Key
chapters in the IBM playbook of Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, resists the notion of the post-PC era. An
unrivaled marketer, Microsoft knows the opinion-shaping power of a
deftly phrased concept, and buying patterns tend to follow ideas.
But mostly, the company seems to object to the term post-PC;
failing to counterattack when the demise of your lifeblood business
is heralded would be a strategic mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft itself is moving toward the future foreseen at
MIT. Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, described a
reorganization last month as the ``renewal of our vision'' to put a
``PC on every desk and in every home.'' But now, Ballmer says: ``We
want to extend that notion. While the PC will stay central, we
realize there is demand for computing on non-PC devices.''
Translation: The only religion at Microsoft is winning. And the
Windows CE operating system is its bid to get its software into
these non-PC devices.
</P>
<P>
   If the lucrative commodity of the future is Internet services
sold by subscription, that is fine with Gates. He just calls it by
a different name: software. In a question-and-answer session in
Technology Review with Michael Dertouzos, director of the MIT
computer lab, Gates said, ``Software will evolve into even more of
a service business than it already is, and in the long term there
will probably be a move toward a subscription-style model.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high in the future shape of the information
economy, and not just for Microsoft. That makes some people
suspicious that Gates is trying to buy the future, by using big
donations to computer science departments at MIT, Stanford, Harvard
and Cambridge to bend academic research in Microsoft-friendly
directions.
</P>
<P>
   But Dertouzos, at least, has demonstrated independence of mind.
He was briefly on the list of witnesses Microsoft planned to call
in its antitrust trial, but according to colleagues, he agreed to
testify as an expert witness on one condition: no coaching from the
Microsoft legal staff. He was soon dropped as a witness when his
deposition testimony did not echo Microsoft's defense.
</P>
<P>
   A towering man, Dertouzos issues an emphatic declaration of
academic independence. ``Nobody has bought me yet,'' he said, ``and
I'll cripple anyone who claims they have.''

TELEPHONE CALL WAS A CON GAME FROM JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NEIL MODIE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One of the nice things about telemarketing is that you
can do it from home _ even when home is the King County jail.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Nelson, a retiree who lives near Burien, a suburb of
Seattle, said Thursday that a telemarketer called last Saturday
night with this pitch: earn $25 by accessing a casino's Internet
Web site and completing a survey there about gambling preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson declined. But after hanging up, he noticed his phone's
caller ID said the pitch came from a jail inmate telephone.
Puzzled, he notified authorities, who traced it to a phone
accessible to 64 inmates at the Kent Regional Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jailers noted that one of those inmates gave his occupation as
``telemarketer'' when he was booked March 31 on two counts of check
forgery in Tukwila, Wash. He has a 10-year record of arrests for
other forgeries, burglary, theft, possession of stolen property and
other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the inmate denies making the call, and his former employer
says he wasn't continuing to make calls on any of its accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Center Commander Ray Coleman said Thursday that
investigators can't prove which inmate was involved. And while
telemarketing from behind bars may be tacky, it's legal. Coleman
said the casino Web site seems legitimate, though the investigation
continues.
</P>
<P>
   The silver lining in the incident, Coleman said, is that it
proved the jail's sophisticated caller ID system works _ sort of.
To protect crime victims and witnesses from harassment, anyone
receiving a call from a jail phone hears a recording saying where
the call is coming from and what inmate is making it.
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing inmate, however, got around the recording by
going through a third party, a jail rule violation punishable by
loss of privileges. But at least caller ID gave the inmate away,
Coleman noted.
</P>
<P>
   And lest there are any doubts, Coleman emphasized the jail ``is
in no way conducting any telemarketing.''

 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a headhunter called him in 1986 to ask if he
wanted to become house manager for the Met, James H. Naples Jr.
immediately thought of shortstops at Shea Stadium, not coloraturas
at Lincoln Center. At the time, Naples, then 35, was in charge of a
staff of 900 as manager of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If the offer was out of left field, the destination wasn't. The
recruiter told him that the Metropolitan Opera House had gone
through 22 house managers in 20 years and that ``anyone who can
last 10 years with George Steinbrenner can do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Naples accepted the offer and, like legions of other workers in
an age of ever-changing career paths, demonstrated that his skills
were indeed portable. Economists note that despite low unemployment
today, the labor force is still churning with workers losing,
changing and gaining jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skills are becoming increasingly transferable from job to job
and industry to industry,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the
Institute for the Future, a forecasting and research firm in Menlo
Park, Calif. ``While expertise may be limited, an individual's
skills may be very transferable.''
</P>
<P>
   Naples developed many skills in his Yankee Stadium job. In
addition to overseeing all home games, he was in charge of
high-pressure events like four World Series, the 1976 championship
fight between Muhammad Ali and Ken Norton and a Mass celebrated by
Pope John Paul II in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   For that one, Naples remembers praying for a logistical miracle;
he had to coordinate communion logistics for 80,000 people _ 23,000
more than the stadium usually holds.
</P>
<P>
   The job, of course, had rewards. At the Mass, he escorted the
pope onto the field as they chatted. After-hours during baseball
season, he passed the time with the likes of Billy Martin, the
often fired and rehired manager. The most memorable night was at
Jimmy Weston's restaurant in Manhattan, talking baseball with Frank
Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his love of the game, Naples eventually heeded the
recruiter. Managing Yankee Stadium required up to 100 hours a week.
Having married two years earlier, he had a 1-year-old daughter whom
he hardly had time to see. Working for the Yankees was ``a dream
job for someone who's single,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Offered a better compensation package and a more sensible
schedule, Naples traded himself to the Met, where he has stayed 13
years. He manages 13 departments and 250 people, who work under
several labor contracts he helps to negotiate. He is in charge of
the building, security, the box office, the cleaning crews and the
ushers. And not just during the opera season, since the Met plays
host to groups including the American Ballet Theater and the Kirov
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually not that different from my old job,'' he said.
``There we were presenting baseball and here we're presenting
opera.'' His workweek, however, is more manageable; he works about
50 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But how does a guy who was a pre-law student at Canisius College
in Buffalo _and who never took a business class _ become a
businessman, manager and negotiator?
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about people from my father,'' he said. ``He owned a
bar in Buffalo where I worked as a kid, and you figure out pretty
quick who is real and who you want to emulate and, conversely, whom
you don't want to be like.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Naples got to know Steinbrenner, who was a frequent
patron of the bar in the late 1960s, when he traveled to Buffalo on
business for his family's shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner later took control of the Yankees. In 1976, after
the renovation of Yankee Stadium, he asked Naples, then 25, to
oversee the ball park's concessions and luxury suites at a starting
salary of $16,000. After a year, Naples became assistant stadium
manager; in 1980, he became manager and in 1984 he received the
additional title of vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Naples also relied on lessons learned from watching an uncle,
Max Margulis, a Buffalo nightclub impresario, handle not only his
staff but also stars like Mel Torme and Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   What about his own management techniques? ``I'm in touch with
all department heads almost daily and my door is always open,''
Naples said. ``The minute I get to work there are eight people with
eight problems. Solving them is like winning, and I love winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He has learned his negotiating skills on the job. Steinbrenner
and Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Met, ``are not only
visionaries in their respective fields but sagacious negotiators,''
Naples said. ``I've learned from them how to make both sides feel
like they've accomplished something.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent surge in matters operatic has not hurt Naples's career.
The Met has added performances, television broadcasts and
recordings; attendance has risen and deficits have vanished. A
survey by the National Endowment for the Arts shows that opera
attendance rose 12.5 percent nationwide between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And in saying goodbye to World Series rings and hello to
Wagner's, Naples has found more time to spend with his wife, Nancy,
and their children, Nicole, 14; Jimmy, 11, and Gavin, 5. Though he
hasn't chatted with the pope recently, Naples talked with President
Clinton at opening night last fall.

   CONCORD, Mass. _ At first glance it seems pretty simple. A food
processing company with a strong brand in a relatively narrow niche
finds the competition toughening and the niche's sales trend
flattening.
</P>
<P>
   To grow, it needs to extend its brand to new product categories,
to make acquisitions, or both. That calls for a big financial
commitment, which most companies can raise by tapping capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch Foods isn't most companies: it is owned by a farmers'
cooperative, the National Grape Cooperative Association. And that
makes meeting its competitive challenges anything but
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   With roots in 19th century agrarian socialism, co-ops can seem a
quaint counterpoint to the unbridled capitalism energizing most of
the economy. But they play a huge role in American agriculture. And
the value-added co-ops _ the ones like National Grape that process
members' produce into consumer products rather than just handling
bulk commodities _ own more well-known supermarket brands than many
consumers realize.
</P>
<P>
   Co-ops help farmers by assuring that each year's harvest will be
bought at predictable prices and by sharing profits, expertise and
purchasing muscle. But the ownership structure can also be a
significant competitive handicap.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, a co-op cannot sell stock or use it to pay for
acquisitions, or even build a war chest of cash from retained
earnings; profits must be distributed to the members each year. So
co-ops often have a difficult time financing major expansion,
unless they borrow or merge with other co-ops, as many dairy co-ops
have been doing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, National Grape has managed to find steady if
unspectacular growth by aggressively marketing the Welch's line of
juices, jellies and related products, whose sales topped $600
million in 1998. But against increased competition from publicly
traded companies with formidable marketing and financial strengths,
Welch's now needs to look further afield.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the capability to get beyond the billion-dollar mark
in sales,'' said Ted Dardani, a principal with BT Capital Partners,
a unit of Bankers Trust, who has worked with Welch's on acquisition
and joint venture ideas. ``They have done a very good job of
building their brands back. The point now is, how can Welch's take
all that brand equity and expertise and do some other product lines
that make sense?''
</P>
<P>
   Welch's now finds its longtime strength, an undistracted focus
on jelly and juice, turning into a shortcoming, as ever more rushed
Americans skip eating a traditional breakfast and demand sags.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after the co-op acquired it in 1945, Welch's did
well by remaining steadfastly grape-centric and conservative. It
shunned new product development and avoided advertising spending
like a bad grape disease. But by 1983, that strategy was flagging,
and the co-op was in danger of reneging on its promise to buy 70
percent of its members' ever-growing harvests, according to Daniel
P. Dillon, the president of Welch's, who joined the company around
that time as a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's management overcame initial resistance from the growers
and shifted gears, stepping up marketing to rebuild demand through
new TV advertising and a revival of the cartoon-character jelly
glasses that were a 1960s hit.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid for and trumpeted a study that concluded,
somewhat controversially, that white grape juice is better than
apple juice for babies and toddlers suffering from diarrhea because
it is lower in sorbitol. It seized on studies in France finding
that red wine helps control cholesterol, hoping that they would rub
off on grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   And it stretched the juice line any way it could, with new
blends like pineapple-banana, frozen smoothies, concentrates that
don't require refrigeration and, briefly, kosher grape juice. A new
research center tests innovations like a plastic can for frozen
juice that can be thawed in a microwave. And there are plans for
more single-serving items, an area where Ocean Spray (another
co-op) has made great strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``To really push ahead in the juice business, you have to
deliver more than one kind of juice,'' said Kevin Murphy, chief
operating officer of Ocean Spray, which recently bought a big stake
in Nantucket Nectars. ``I don't think Welch has been aggressive in
that regard. They've really tried to stretch grape juice out.''
Murphy questioned whether Welch's should use scarce resources to
chase growth in a shrinking category like frozen concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   But moving beyond grape juices means tangling with the likes of
Pepsico's Tropicana, Coca-Cola and Cadbury-Schweppes, a league in
which Welch's is at a distinct disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My competition isn't the local cooperative down the road,''
said Joe Falcone, a National Grape board member and
fourth-generation grape farmer. ``It's Nestle, and Pepsi, and big
companies like that,'' which can raise capital faster and more
flexibly. Still, co-ops can take advantage of low-interest loans
from the National Cooperative Bank, a $19 billion entity that lends
only to them.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what has kept Welch's intact can also hold it back. With
grape farmers for owners, ``it's a conservative environment,'' said
Rex Green, a managing director at Advest, a Boston investment bank
that has advised Welch's. ``These are men and women of the soil,
rather than day traders. They look at their company and their
stewardship of Welch's in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for Welch's seems to be acquiring or pursuing
joint ventures with companies that make other kinds of consumer
packaged foods. Executives were quiet about specific plans.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching such ventures slowly works in Welch's favor, Green
said. ``They have an excellent record of not launching failed
products,'' he said. ``They can't afford to invest the capital, and
then not have it work. That absolutely reflects being in the
environment of a co-op.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Latest AIDS treatment gets FDA approval
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a
new AIDS drug, the latest in the class of powerful medications that
has revolutionized HIV/AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Agenerase, also known as amprenavir, received the FDA's approval
in an accelerated process aimed at getting new AIDS drugs onto the
market as quickly as possible. Discovered by Vertex Pharmaceuticals
and licensed to Glaxo Wellcome, the leader in HIV drug development,
Agenerase brings the total number of approved AIDS drugs to 15.
</P>
<P>
   The drug belongs to the class called protease inhibitors, named
for the way in which they cripple the reproduction of HIV, the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Agenerase has an advantage over the other five protease
inhibitors on the market: It has no food restrictions and has to be
taken only twice daily, compared to three times for the others.
With eight capsules per dose, it's still a cumbersome medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry of the molecule required that we have a very
sophisticated formulation that would facilitate absorption of
amprenavir into the body,'' said Mike Rogers, Glaxo Wellcome's
project leader for Agenerase.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years ago, when protease inhibitors were
introduced, they dramatically improved the life expectancy and
quality of life for many with HIV. Terminally ill patients made
deathbed recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, that optimism was tempered by the
realization that protease inhibitors weren't as effective long-term
as researchers had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients developed resistance to the drugs, as HIV swiftly
mutated into less vulnerable forms. All AIDS drugs have severe side
effects, but those accompanying protease inhibitors proved to be
the harshest: diabetes, life-threateningly high cholesterol levels
and a bizarre condition called lipodystrophy, in which body fat is
redistributed to the stomach and back.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term results from extensive human trials of Agenerase
indicate it is fairly well tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Another major selling point of Agenerase is that it doesn't
appear to be cross-resistant with other protease inhibitors,
providing a new, much-needed option to patients who already have
developed drug resistance. Like other AIDS drugs, Agenerase is
extremely costly: $16.80 per day, or $6,132 per year. Protease
inhibitors range in price from $5,220 to $7,344 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually at the low end _ not that I'm endorsing the
price, because all of them are priced too high,'' said Dan Dunable,
the treatment resource specialist at AIDS Survival Project in
Midtown.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Magnet pain relief attracting more patients

   ATLANTA _ The Browns' vacation was less than ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were in picturesque Hilton Head Island, S.C.,
Charles Brown spent most of his time on a couch _ the result of
pulling his back while playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``And although we can laugh about it now,'' said his wife,
Leigh, ``it really was not much fun at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they came home, the Browns bought two therapeutic
magnets from Smart Solutions, a home health equipment store, and
within a day, they were off to Panama City _ for a much better
round of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unreal how fast they worked,'' said Charles Brown.
``Now we use them all the time, and we loan them to friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic magnets have been around for more than six decades
in Asia and Europe. In Japan, the No. 1 therapeutic magnet company,
Nikken, has gross sales of more than $10 billion. In the United
States, however, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved
their use, but it hasn't banned them either. Instead, they've been
treated as a harmless form of fringe treatment _ up there with
herbal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past five years, doctors and biophysicists have been
giving magnets another look, especially since companies selling
magnetic products are finally subjecting the treatment to rigorous
clinical studies. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn., and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
doctors testing magnetic products for pain relief are convinced
that magnets are producing dramatic results.
</P>
<P>
   At Baylor, for instance, researchers found magnet therapy eased
the pain in 76 percent of patients with post-polio syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetherapy Inc., founded in 1995, reports $25 million in
sales. It plans to submit several clinical studies for FDA review
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have some good double-blind studies, this is what
we can safely say: Magnetics can reduce pain. If you've got an achy
joint or lower back pain, magnets could help,'' said Dr. Arthur
Pilla, director of the Bioelectrochemistry Laboratory at the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Pilla also is the chairman of
the scientific and medical advisory committee for Magnetherapy Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, how it works is a mystery. Magnets may somehow
trigger the healing action of cells at a molecular level, changing
the oxygen and nutrient level of the tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Pilla said that magnets may merely trigger the body to do what
it's supposed to do. ``These magnetic signals are very weak,'' he
said. ``But it might be like a pacemaker, which triggers the heart
muscle to pump but doesn't provide the energy for the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors, however, are still unknown. For example, most
therapeutic magnets fall within the range of 50 to 1,000 gauss, the
measure by which magnetism is calculated. A refrigerator magnet has
a power of about 50 gauss. But doctors don't know if that range is
really the most effective or not, because few scientific studies
have been done on the health benefits of magnet therapies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nonprofit organizations, long known as an invisible sector in
the economy, have grown rapidly over the last two decades, now
accounting for 8 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the rising demand for trained leaders for these groups,
a number of universities are offering graduate programs in
nonprofit management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to only want to do good; you have to do good
well,'' said Michael Seltzer, acting chairman of the master's
program in nonprofit management at the New School University in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of charitable nonprofit groups grew from 82,000 in
1975 to 181,000 in 1995, the most recent data available, according
to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last decade, the number of American universities
offering three or more graduate courses in nonprofit management has
grown from 17 to 82, say researchers at Seton Hall University,
which offers a program of its own. Other universities with big
nonprofit programs include Auburn, Boston University, De Paul and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The programs do have their critics, who contend, among other
things, that they have too narrow a focus for students who may
switch fields later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the surge in degree programs reflects rising competition
for support from foundations, corporations and government, which
increasingly expect nonprofits to be more professional, said Alan
J. Abramson, director of the Nonprofit Sector Research Fund of the
Aspen Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   People who move to nonprofit work from business or government
jobs may have leadership experience, Abramson said, but they may
want more training in nonprofit issues.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jeff Aulenbach. Two years ago, he worked for the mental
health department in New York City, managing contracts with
nonprofit groups. He wanted to work for a nonprofit, but lacked the
skills he thought necessary. So he enrolled part-time in the
master's program at the New School.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, while still taking classes, he landed a job as
executive director of the Variety Boys and Girls Club of Queens.
``I could not have gotten the job without the program,'' Aulenbach
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he moved to a larger organization, as assistant
executive director of the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club in the
Bronx. He expects to finish the New School program next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aulenbach said classes on topics like financial planning and
marketing taught him ``every issue that an executive director needs
to deal with.'' At Gloria Wise, he applies lessons of his
leadership class to help program directors work together after a
string of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students are nonprofit managers who take classes
part-time, with assignments often focusing on their real jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was in classes with nonprofit managers all the time,
I understood what the day-to-day challenges of working in a
nonprofit were like,'' said Armanda Famiglietti, a 1993 New School
graduate who manages grants for the Carnegie Corp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed with a nonprofit-management degree.
Peter Dobkin Hall, director of Yale Divinity School's program on
nonprofit organizations, called the credential ``a degree of
unproven and dubious value,'' explaining, ``there is no such thing
as generic nonprofit management.'' His program focuses on research
rather than on teaching management skills.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate job-switching, he said, ``you want to give people
portable skills, skills that are as applicable to the public sector
as to the business sector or the nonprofit sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Eisenberg, senior fellow at the Georgetown University
Public Policy Institute, said nonprofit graduate programs tend to
focus on internal issues like fund-raising and accounting, not on
external issues like collaboration with business and government.
``Most of them are really creating technicians, '' Eisenberg said.
The programs do not address a ``crisis of leadership,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents like Seltzer of the New School say the curriculum is
guided by student demand. This semester, he is teaching a course in
advocacy, public policy and social change. This fall, he plans to
begin training nonprofit managers to make better use of computers
and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The field of nonprofit studies is still relatively young. But
some pioneers who have built their careers on such training now
recommend it to others.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Needles, now vice president for finance and administration
at the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, has used the skills he learned at
the University of San Francisco to manage organizations in the
arts, international development and education. ``Having that degree
definitely helps in opening doors,'' he said. ``Going through a
program like that gave me a sound footing.''

   Perhaps Only Death Is Really Inevitable &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Predicting where its business will be expanding, the Internal
Revenue Service projects that the number of dead people who pay
taxes will rise more than seven times as fast as the number of
living taxpayers. Part of the reason may be that living Americans
are not using opportunities to make gifts to children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS projected that the number of individual tax returns
would grow to 135.2 million in 2005 from 120.7 million in 1997, an
increase of 12 percent. But estate tax returns, which apply only to
the richest 1 percent or so of those who die, were expected to grow
to 195,000 from 102,000, a 90.5 percent climb.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is projected despite a federal law that gradually
increases the amount one can leave without owing estate taxes to $1
million in 2006, from $600,000 in 1997. Assets are growing faster
than the exemption because of the run-up in stocks and a rebound in
housing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Living taxpayers are not moving swiftly, however, to pass along
their wealth. From 1997 to 2005, the IRS foresees only a 40 percent
increase in gift tax returns, filed when taxpayers make gifts of
more than $10,000 ($20,000 for married couples) to individuals. No
tax is actually due unless the total amount given exceeds the
taxpayer's estate tax exemption, and using trusts can further cut
the obligation.

   Digging for Scholarship Gold &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a new addition to the many Web sites for high school
seniors and college students seeking scholarships for the fall
semester. While Collegenet (www.collegenet.com) does not have the
largest data base of scholarships, it also does not sell
demographic information to finance its operations, as some sites
do. The search portion of the site, called Mach 25, has information
on 7,000 scholarships and a simple series of filters to narrow the
visitor's search.
</P>
<P>
   A search of categories yields groupings like academics,
ethnicity, business, age and sports, and these have their own
sub-categories. A keyword search can narrow the selections quickly
_ and turn up some obscure awards. Students who loved glass-blowing
at summer camp, for instance, can find two arts scholarships by
entering the word ``glass.'' Sometimes the awards may be too
specific for most students. To qualify for the $1,200 scholarship
from the Northern Virginia Handcrafters Guild, for example,
applicants must live within a 60-mile radius of Merrifield, Va.

 &HT;    Gretzky makes it official
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Gretzky asked everyone to view it as a
celebration _ but the constant pauses and the way his voice cracked
indicated that even he didn't buy that part.
</P>
<P>
   Saying goodbye to a game he revolutionized and a league that
owes him as no other league owes an athlete, Gretzky officially
announced Friday his retirement from hockey, although his legend
will live for years in NHL record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have highs and lows in life,'' Gretzky said in a packed
theater adjacent to Madison Square Garden, where he will play his
final game Sunday with the New York Rangers against the Pittsburgh
Penguins. ``Unfortunately sometimes we go to funerals. Fortunately,
sometimes we go to weddings. To me this is a party, it's a
celebration. I look upon the next few days as something to really
enjoy. ... Obviously, today I'm officially retired.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was the first time Gretzky had mentioned the ``R'' word
since news first broke of his impending decision earlier in the
week. Gretzky had serious thoughts before the season that this
might be his final year and had pretty much decided by Christmas
that 1999 would be it for No. 99. In recent weeks, he withstood
attempts by his wife, Janet, long-time agent Michael Barnett, coach
John Muckler and several friends and teammates to talk him out of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who struggled this season, conceded that he ``started
to feel the fatigue mentally and physically that I've never felt
before. I started to question myself about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old, who always said he would play as long as hockey
was still enjoyable, then added, ``From the mental standpoint, I
just didn't have the passion anymore to put in the two hours a day
it would've taken to get ready for next season. I knew it at the
beginning of this year; I knew it all during the year. This
decision wasn't made this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky holds 61 NHL records, including career marks in goals
(894), assists (1,962) and points (2,856) in 20 NHL seasons. His
legendary achievements include three 200-point years in a row,
eight consecutive seasons with 50 or more goals, a 92-goal season,
nine MVP awards, 10 scoring titles and four Stanley Cup rings, all
with Edmonton, his first of four teams.
</P>
<P>
   Often, opponents seemed in such awe of him that they couldn't
bring themselves to body check him. Others who tried to knock him
off the puck couldn't; it was like checking a ghost. He was great
not because he skated or shot a puck at warp speed but because of
his vision. He saw the ice as no other player in history. He
anticipated where teammates _ and opponents _ would be even before
they did. He anticipated open spaces. The only thing more dangerous
than Gretzky in front of the net was Gretzky behind it. The keys to
his success were the same as that of any in the martial arts:
balance, focus and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Off the ice, the trading of Gretzky from Edmonton to Los Angeles
in 1988 helped the growth of the NHL in the Sunbelt. NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman turned to him early in the news
conference and said, ``No person has done as much for their sport
as you have for ours.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's highlight was limited to MVP of the All-Star Game.
This season, Gretzky missed more games (11) with a neck injury than
he had goals (nine).
</P>
<P>
   He required two steroid injections in his neck last month and
probably will need another this summer. The hits he used to
anticipate and avoid became prevalent, and the wear and tear took a
toll. Equally contributing to Gretzky's decision was that the
rebuilding Rangers have missed the playoffs two seasons in a row
and are at least two years away from competing for the Stanley Cup,
the primary reason Gretzky would extend his career. But he had no
desire to play elsewhere nor for a ``farewell tour'' next season.
``That wouldn't be fair to my teammates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always say, `Just one more year.' But I'm at peace of
mind. This was the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked his feelings about his eventual induction in the Hall of
Fame, Gretzky smiled and said, ``I try to never get too
egotistical. But I guess it's safe to say I'll probably get in
there.

PATRIOTS NEED TO FOCUS ON CORNERBACK, RUNNING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In the past two drafts, the Patriots have
addressed their areas of most critical need _ cornerback and
running back _ on the first round, using three No. 1 picks to solve
those problems. So what do they need most in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   A cornerback and a running back.
</P>
<P>
   Those are not good signs for the future because that part of
their future was supposed to have been taken care of. Because it is
not leaves New England with many drafting options in a year when
they have 11 picks, including three of the first 52 and five of the
top 91. But it also means they have more holes to fill than they
should have.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring of the moment is running back, and that problem
was simply a case of bad luck. Nothing the Patriots could have done
short of locking Robert Edwards in his room could have prevented
the likely career-ending knee injury he suffered on a beach in
Honolulu in February. But it serves to highlight the consequences
of not taking care of the little things they did have control of
the last two years. If they had, when the inevitable struck _
unexpected disaster _ management could have reacted far differently
than now.
</P>
<P>
   New England has made 19 selections in the last two drafts and
thus far netted only one starter, and he is on crutches. What makes
matters worse is that New England retained 18 of those players (the
list is now down to 17 with Scott Rehberg having been selected by
Cleveland in the expansion draft) and most of them have watched
more than played.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Green Bay Packers, New England's opponent in
the Super Bowl three years ago, has made 16 selections over the
same time period, retained only seven but netted three starters,
which is a strong testimony to Ron Wolf's growing legend as a
selector of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Patriot personnel guru Bobby Grier knows he
cannot gamble on players with the infamous (and oft overused)
``upside potential'' this year. When he picks at 20 and 28, Grier
needs to come away with players coach Pete Carroll can put on the
field now because every team in his division has gotten stronger,
most noticeably Miami and Indianapolis, while the Patriots have not
kept pace. That is why Grier will continue to try and trade up with
St. Louis or Chicago in hope of landing Miami running back Edgerrin
James.
</P>
<P>
   The trade Thursday of Marshall Faulk to the Rams actually has
made that possibility more likely because it means Colts general
manager Bill Polian is sure quarterbacks will go in the first three
slots in the draft, leaving him free to take Texas running back
Ricky Williams with the fourth pick and allowing St. Louis to
ignore James.
</P>
<P>
   The belief here is Washington will grab Champ Bailey if it has
an ounce of sense (which is open to debate) even though head coach
Norv Turner's offense could use a productive back. The Rams will
then come back and take North Carolina State receiver Torry Holt
despite all their talk of now going for defensive help, leaving
James still available when the Bears are ready to make their
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has many ways to go with that No. 7 pick and surely will
talk with both New England and New Orleans, although the Saints are
nowhere near as interested in James as they were in Williams and
may stand pat at No. 12 and hope to get a receiver like Ohio
State's David Boston there.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are rumored to want out of the seventh spot if they
can't get one of the top three quarterbacks and with all their
problems would look favorably on a New England offer of both its
ones plus perhaps a two and a three. This would allow Grier to make
his move but would also put all his eggs in one basket, which is
always a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gamble New England should take and will if the
possibility is there but failing that (and one must remember a lot
more trades are talked about than made), the Patriots will stand
pat, make their two picks and go on with life. If the draft board
falls the way most projections go, they could stay there and solve
a serious but less-talked-about problem with their first pick by
grabbing LSU defensive tackle Anthony McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the defensive linemen available, McFarland is the most
ready to play in the NFL, a point of some import to a staff that
knows it has to win this year if it wants to be in position to be
picking anything next April, and he would fill a need on the inside
that has never been fully taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's strapping defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban and
Tennessee's Patrick Kerney are also possibilities, as would one of
the top linebacker prospects if they slide this far, but Ekuban is
a project and the Patriots already have a playroom full of such
young players with Tebucky Jones leading that class, and they
really can't afford to do that again if they are wise.
</P>
<P>
   They could also go for an offensive lineman here, either BC
center Damien Woody or someone with the potential to replace
perennial All-Pro left tackle Bruce Armstrong down the road. That
would eliminate a player such as Aaron Gibson if he's still
available because he'll never be a left tackle in the NFL but would
make Lonnie Shelton or John Tait attractive. Only problem is both
those players are so attractive they won't be around when the
Patriots select.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there has already been a run on most of the top offensive
linemen (which is unlikely), New England will go for defensive line
help first and work under the assumption they can still get a solid
offensive lineman such as Georgia's Matt Stinchcomb, West
Virginia's Solomon Page, or Michigan's Jon Jansen with the 28th
pick.
</P>
<P>
   If they do that, you say, where's their running back? On the
second round, which is where all the guys behind Williams and James
belong. New England makes the 52d pick then and should still have
its choice of several backs who could help (although not as much as
James would), including West Virginia's short but sturdy Amos
Zereoue, Michigan State's Sedrick Irvin, BC's Mike Cloud (forget
about it) and if they are lucky perhaps James Johnson or Kevin
Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to believe both Faulk and Johnson would
be there but if New England wants one of them, it could still try
to work a trade up to the top of the second round. Either way,
that's most likely where the Patriots' running back will come from,
failing a deal to get to the sixth or seventh spot in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   After that, New England still needs a young cornerback because
its entire secondary's contracts run out at the end of this season
and they can't posibly re-sign Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, Steve Israel,
and Willie Clay and there is little reason to believe Chris Canty
(who had to be browbeaten into coming to the offseason workout
program by Carroll) or Chris Carter (who is back in college and
that's frankly where his future lies) will help much there. Jones
remains a wild card in that area but if he doesn't end up as a
safety rather than a corner there will be a lot of shocked
personnel people and scouts throughout the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only weakness left to address, however. The
Patriots could be tempted early by Woody at No. 20 in hopes of
plugging the hole left by Dave Wohlabaugh's defection. That would
allow Heath Irwin to shift to guard and compete with Todd Rucci and
Max Lane, one of whom's salary will not be around by September.
</P>
<P>
   If those needs can be taken care of they would then search for
an outside linebacker with speed and size in case undersized Tedy
Bruschi proves he isn't capable of playing full time in place of
departed free agent Todd Collins and every team is always searching
for some kind of pass-rushing prospect with the proverbial ``upside
potential'' New England has fallen in love with the last two
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots solve half of these problems they will have done
a good job but if they don't find a back early that they can put on
the field and a lineman who can open holes for him, the rest of
this draft may not matter much in the long run to Grier or Carroll
because they won't be around to watch these guys play.

DO THE RIGHT THING, JERRY, LET LOOSE OF LETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say goodbye, Leon. And make it your final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   You will tell him just that, right, Jerry Jones? Tell Mr. Lett
to take his stupidity, his drug problem, and his days of
embarrassing the organization, and be gone immediately. Never to
return.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not even remotely about the NFL substance-abuse
program catching Lett once again with his nose packed. Nor is it
about another league-ordained suspension of one year, minimum, if
Lett's feeble appeal fails, which it will.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones has been shooting straight, he will beat the league
office to the suspension punch. That means going beyond the
harshest penalty the NFL can hand down _ an indefinite suspension
of at least a year for a third-time offender.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will slap a lifetime Valley Ranch ban on Lett.
</P>
<P>
   In his well-documented clean-up-the-Cowboys campaign that began
two years ago, Jones has sent both subtle and strong signals about
being serious. A nobody named Kendall Watkins defied the team ban
on a local bar, and was booted. There is also suspicion that when
Shante Carver suddenly disappeared from Valley Ranch, it had to do
with him being a repeat offender of the new Jones law.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry delivered the hammer a year ago when the Cowboys
allowed receiver Randy Moss to slide by in the draft.
Football-wise, it was a huge mistake. But credibility-wise, Jones
came across as a standup guy. Moss' reputation did not fit the
clean-up-the-Cowboys campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, comes the ultimate credibility test with Lett,
although maybe not as ultimate as Lett's football credentials
suggest. Once considered among the league's premier defensive
tackles, Lett was a shadow of his old self last season. Lett being
voted to the Pro Bowl was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Suspensions and personal problems appear to have finally caught
up with Lett, who at age 30 should be in the prime of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But even if star-status with Lett was still prevalent, Jones set
up the new team guidelines to be strict when it comes to violations
of character and doing right.
</P>
<P>
   Lett no longer qualifies for Valley Ranch membership under those
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he now faces at least another full-season suspension, and
at best won't play again in the NFL until a month or so before his
32nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it was known within the Valley Ranch walls that Lett
had failed another drug test and probably would not be available
for the 1999 season, if ever again.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones refused comment on the Lett situation yesterday, his
choice to remain mum was wise. Jones reached a low point three
years ago when he was caught lying about an upcoming Lett
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But there were league-wide whispers yesterday about the Cowboys
having spent the last several weeks preparing for Lett's bye-bye.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other coaches from NFL teams said the Cowboys have
been attempting to set up a scenario for today's college draft
where they land LSU defensive tackle Anthony McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   In most mock drafts, McFarland is projected as middle of the
first round. Dallas has the 22th pick. There has been speculation
McFarland could slide to the Cowboys, but that's doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys want McFarland to serve as a Lett replacement,
they will probably have to trade up to at least the 15th spot.
</P>
<P>
   One source from another NFL club said the Cowboys will have a
team representative ``baby-sitting'' today at McFarland's home. But
that also will happen with several players expected to go in the
middle of the first round, including receiver Troy Edwards of
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle, however, has suddenly become a depth hole for
the Cowboys. Remember that both Hurvin McCormack and Antonio
Anderson were lost in the expansion draft. Even a fading Lett was
easily the team's best at the position. The other starter, Chad
Hennings, had his worst season from a production standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   None of this excuses the fact Lett must be removed quickly and
permanently from Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   In vowing to put the ``Evil Empire'' days behind the franchise,
Jones couldn't promise the organization would be trouble-free. But
he did give a blood oath to react swiftly if the image of the team
was again soiled.
</P>
<P>
   This is your chance, Jerry. Don't blow it.

<P>
   Almost every guarantee of investment performance isn't worth the
paper on which it's printed. But there is an exception: the
guarantee that comes with the strategy called dollar cost
averaging. People who use this approach know that in at least one
respect, they will always do better than average.
</P>
<P>
   With dollar cost averaging, you don't invest all at once.
Instead, you invest gradually _ in equal amounts at regular
intervals. There is no single formula; you can choose the number of
installments you want.
</P>
<P>
   Many people use dollar cost averaging out of necessity. They may
have only $100 a month to invest, for example, so they sign up with
a mutual fund to have that amount drawn directly from their
checking accounts every 30 days. But some people use dollar cost
averaging when they already have a big chunk of money in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Say you have $30,000 and want to invest it in IBM stock in three
$10,000 installments over the next year _ today, six months from
now and 12 months from now. Let's further assume that six months
from now, IBM is trading at $220.625 a share, up from $170.625 last
Friday, and at $270.625 a year from now. The average of those three
prices is $220.625 a share. Yet your average purchase price will be
$212.94, or $7.69 less.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers might look like strange alchemy, but they aren't.
That's because dollar cost averaging lets you buy more shares when
I.B.M. is trading at $170.625 and fewer shares when it is at
$270.625. The same goes for all variations on the strategy: Your
average purchase price will always be lower than the stock's
average price.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds wonderful, but it doesn't mean you should use dollar
cost averaging for all your investments. The guarantee of
below-average prices notwithstanding, you often can do better by
investing in a lump sum.
</P>
<P>
   Under what circumstances should you invest in one leap, instead
of intervals? Of course, the answer can be known only in hindsight;
it depends on whether the value of the asset rises or falls over
the period in question. If it rises, you will be better off buying
in a lump sum at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Again using the IBM example, let's say that instead of
averaging, you make your entire investment today; the average
purchase price will be $170.625 _ far better than the $212.94
average above. The only scenario in which dollar cost averaging
comes out ahead of lump-sum investing is when the asset declines in
value over the investment period.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, dollar cost averaging is an implicit bet on such
a decline over the time you invest. That may come as a shock to
proponents of the strategy, who typically portray it as an
alternative to market timing. But at its core, dollar cost
averaging is little more than a bearish market-timing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't necessarily a criticism. There is nothing wrong with
being a market timer per se, or with being bearish. But if you
think that an asset is going to decline, why buy any of it now? Why
not wait?
</P>
<P>
   I concede that I'm not being entirely fair in my analysis. We
don't know in advance how an investment will perform in the
short-term. Many people probably use dollar cost averaging simply
because of that uncertainty _ and want to reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the strategy reduces risk over the period in
which you invest. Yet even as a risk reducer, dollar cost averaging
in any form comes up wanting, according to a recent study by Moshe
Arye Milevsky, a professor of finance at York University in
Toronto, and Steven E. Posner, vice president in charge of
quantitative modeling at Marsh &AMP; McClennan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, they found, you will make more money, with no
more risk, by simply investing about one-half of a lump sum right
away and placing the rest in cash until the end of the period over
which you would otherwise be dollar cost averaging.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, dollar cost averaging is an expensive way to
reduce risk. If that's your goal, don't wait: Take half of what you
plan to invest and buy the asset today. &QL;

COHEN BERATES MILOSEVIC FOR REMARKS ON CONVOY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen accused Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Friday of an ``Orwellian twisting
of language and logic'' to describe the bombing of a Kosovo refugee
convoy on Wednesday, while ``not allowing his people to see the
kind of horrific damage that he is causing to hundreds of thousands
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen _ speaking after a Pentagon ceremony Friday morning with
the Italian defense minister, Carlo Scognamiglio _ was responding
to questions from reporters who asked why the Pentagon and NATO did
not release more information about the attack, including videotape
footage from the Air Force jet that may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombing of Yugoslavia began last month, NATO forces
have been reluctant to make public detailed after-action reports of
the sort that the public grew accustomed to seeing during the
Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, in fact, during Pentagon and NATO briefings,
officers and officials have declined to say how many attack
missions have been launched, how many have been completed, how many
bombs have been dropped or what the bombs may have hit.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the situation has improved somewhat. On Friday
afternoon the Pentagon showed videotape from half a dozen attacks
on Thursday night and announced that the allies had launched more
than 400 aircraft overnight, although many of them flew support
missions and not all of the attack aircraft completed their
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, detailed information of that sort was not made
public. But Cohen argued that the refugee convoy was a special
case. For now, at least, he would not make any new information
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most appropriate thing,'' he said, would be to complete
the investigation of the incident before releasing new information.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the attack, Pentagon and NATO officials offered
several conflicting accounts of what had occurred. ``I think that
the most important thing to do is to get our facts straight so that
there is not conflicting statements coming out of one source or
another,'' Cohen said. ``We have an obligation to be answerable to
the American people and to our NATO allies, and indeed we will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no consideration given to trying to conceal
anything,'' he added. ``We want to make sure we don't get hammered
by the press as such, for putting out different conflicting
statements as to what happened. And we are trying to avoid that
because we think it is important that we be accountable and we be
accountable based on the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen clearly felt that it was illogical _ or worse _ to
respond to accusations from the Yugoslav president about the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the audacity to stand up and say that NATO has
deliberately targeted innocent civilians,'' he said. ``It is a
calumny; it is an outrage. It is a grotesque indulgent practice of
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone to accept the notion that allied forces would
deliberately target the very people that we are trying to save, I
think, can only be a testament to the kind of manipulation of
language and of logic that Milosevic, as a dictator, can engage
in.''

VALUE IS SUDDENLY LOOKING NIFTY

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, stock market investors have resembled the
fellow Oscar Wilde once described as knowing the price of
everything and the value of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, value suddenly mattered again to investors.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone in value stocks, a rally has been a long time in
coming. These companies have severely underperformed compared with
their growth-stock brethren since the middle of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, the trend turned. Assets flew out of stock
market darlings like Pfizer, Wal-Mart and Dell Computer and headed
directly for former duds like Caterpillar, DuPont, even Eastman
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking on Monday, the Standard &AMP; Poor's Barra Growth
index lost 6.2 percent by week's end. But the S&AMP;P Barra Value index
gained 1.9 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face was all the more remarkable in that it was not
caused by a market correction. Byron R. Wien, United States
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, says it
usually takes a market fall to shock investors into value havens.
</P>
<P>
   So what scared investors out of growth stocks? Wien cites two
events: the European central bank's interest-rate cut on April 8
and Compaq Computer's warning last Monday that its first-quarter
earnings would be half what analysts were expecting. ``Compaq's
announcement reminded people that there can be disappointments even
in technology,'' Wien said. ``And the ECB cutting interest rates
reminded people that policy makers are determined to keep the world
on a growth path.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they celebrate, value investors may be wondering whether
the sudden shift is just a cruel head fake to an already
beleaguered bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan Securities, thinks the value story has staying power. One
reason is an upswing in global earnings that he expects during the
next 6 to 12 months as economies around the world emerge from the
doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, will help value stocks stay strong. When world
economic growth is falling, Cliggott noted, growth stocks win. ``In
periods of slow economic growth, earnings growth is scarce, so
those companies that can demonstrate growth tend to get very high
multiples put on those earnings,'' he explained. As growth
accelerates, paying up for earnings makes less sense, and value
shares typically rally.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising that the value rebound is happening
now. Such sentiment shifts often occur after the last diehard
investor _ in this case a value type _ has thrown in the towel.
This year, 98 percent of net inflows into equity mutual funds have
gone to growth managers.
</P>
<P>
   To investors who think that growth stocks always bounce back,
Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward D. Jones in St.
Louis, says history shows the perils of such faith.
</P>
<P>
   Harkening back to 1972, the last time that a small group of
growth stocks _ the Nifty 50 _ so dominated the investment scene,
Skrainka looked at the performance of that era's four top
technology stocks: Texas Instruments, IBM, Xerox and Polaroid. The
shares, he found, fetched 40 to 95 times earnings in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   But then the bear market of 1974 hammered them. And by 1982, the
former leaders had not yet recovered; their average annualized
returns for the 10-year period ending in 1982 were well below that
of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Market leadership, once it has been unseated, can take a long
time to return.

CHRISTY O'CONNOR JR.   PLAYS THROUGH THE ROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ The shot was struck nearly 10 years
ago, a 2-iron that was so splendid, so stunning, that he still gets
asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't let you forget, on either side of the water,''
said Christy O'Connor Jr., with a smile. It is a wonderful sight,
this smile that belongs to one of golf's great characters. Sadly,
it is a smile seen less frequently than in days gone by, for
O'Connor is a man living with an agonizing pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm after a dreadful tragedy. My son was taken from us,
unfortunately,'' said O'Connor. ``That's really the worst thing
now, to be honest with you. I find it very, very difficult to even
play.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, he couldn't. But he has decided to return to
competition, taking advantage of an invitation to play in this
week's PGA Seniors' Championship, his first as a member of the
over-50 crowd. Every day is a new test of strength. O'Connor
three-putted four times on the back side in Thursday's 76 and he
shook his head. He returned with a spring in his step Friday, shot
71, and easily made it into weekend play.
</P>
<P>
   This spirited Irishman, whose approach to the 18th at the Belfry
in 1989 stunned Fred Couples and will live forever in Ryder Cup
folklore, had grand plans in anticipation of his 50th birthday last
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole plan was to bring my son over here (the United
States) and hopefully get him a scholarship.'' And it would afford
O'Connor the chance to make his debut as a senior golfer. ``We
would have him here with us. Anyway, that was our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip never came to be. Darren O'Connor was just 17 when he
was killed last September in a car crash not far from the family
home in Galway. He had recently been crowned Ireland's junior
champion and had nearly won the under-21 title, too. He was a
2-handicap with impeccable golfing genes _ his father was a legend;
his father's uncle, Christy O'Connor Sr., was a notch above legend.
He was simply Himself.
</P>
<P>
   But that was golf, so unimportant in the face of this reality:
Darren O'Connor was the youngest of three children he adores. Stand
over a putt with that in the back of your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that very hard, to be honest with you, on the golf
course,'' said O'Connor. ``I can't stop thinking about it. I feel I
shouldn't be out there. I feel I'm neglecting the others . . . it's
stupid, I know, but that's how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor is a man saturated in charisma, a lively spirit who has
been known to lead a sing-a-long and join in celebratory affairs
after a round of golf. For close to 30 years he has been putting
his golf talents on public display in Europe. He is a national
treasure in his homeland and if America's only knowledge of him is
that 2-iron in 1989, that's quite a way to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right place at the right time,'' said O'Connor, again flashing
that smile from beneath his trademark cap. ``My lie was a tight
one, which I like, seeing that it was like a seaside lie. The green
had three tiers and I was going in low with a 2-iron to run up to
the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those brilliant moments in golf, when the shot
came off perfectly. O'Connor, all square in his match against the
heavily favored Couples, watched as his shot from 221 yards came to
rest some 2 feet from the pin. Standing 60 yards down the fairway,
a 9-iron in his hands, Couples was in shock. He blew the easy shot
way right and never had a chance to make par. The pro-European
crowd was wild as Couples conceded the birdie that gave the match
to O'Connor and was the key to Europe's 14-14 tie that retained the
Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   If there is regret, he said, it is that people overlook the fact
``that for 17 holes before that I hit a lot of good shots.'' He
would have had a medal score of 66 that day and as a way of
vindicating his stirring victory, O'Connor points with pride to his
Dunhill Cup match a few weeks later. His foe? Couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really nice. I think if I had lost that match everyone
would have said, `Well, the first one was sort of a fluke.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Only the ignorant would consider his win over Couples a fluke or
his only career highlight. ``Because of intense pressure, the Ryder
Cup is something special, watched by millions of viewers
world-wide,'' said O'Connor. ``But I won the Kenya Open (1990) in
front of all my family. The British Masters (1992). It was
beautiful. The Irish Open (1975), winning at home is a fantastic
thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   He is far from home right now, but his infectious Irish
character has attracted a loyal gallery. O'Connor said he is
committed to giving senior golf a try. He has an exemption into
next week's stop in Charlotte, N.C., where his wife will join him,
and he may try Alabama the week after that. He is without status,
of course, and sponsor's exemptions are like gold. ``I understand
it's very difficult, because there are so very few invites
available.''
</P>
<P>
   He would be a natural for the BankBoston Classic in August,
someone suggested. ``I would love to be there,'' said O'Connor,
``because Boston is like being home.'' His eyes had a glitter to
them and he smiled. Again.

WELFARE REPORTS FIND CRACKS IN THE PICTURES OF SUCCESS

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ From Idaho to South Carolina, a growing collection of
state reports are coalescing into a preliminary but increasingly
suggestive picture of the fates of the millions of Americans who
have left the welfare rolls under new restrictions, from the
success many have at finding jobs to the hunger some endure.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the average hourly wage is close to $6;
elsewhere a median wage may run as high as $7.40. In Kentucky,
welfare ``leavers'' tend to work in retail or service jobs; in
Maryland, both wholesale and retail trade dominate among new
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, according to the early and by no means
conclusive glimpse these studies offer of life months after
welfare, about two-thirds of former recipients find jobs and about
one-fifth find themselves worse off than before.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest such detailed study to come out in Massachusetts,
a report released Friday found that a year out, 71 percent of
people who got off and stayed off welfare reported that someone in
their household was working, and 86 percent reported that their
families were at least as well off as in their welfare days. Among
those working full time after a year here, the average weekly
earnings were $323.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``is very, very good news,'' said Claire McIntire,
the state commissioner of what used to be called public welfare and
now is called transitional assistance. But it also ``clearly points
out areas we need to keep working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Those areas included findings on hunger and food-stamp use, she
acknowledged. The study found that three months after leaving
welfare, about 10 percent of former recipients had gone hungry
recently, the same percentage as reported having gone hungry while
still on welfare. But though the number didn't change, the length
of time they said they went without food grew.
</P>
<P>
   Also, food stamp usage, in keeping with a national phenomenon,
looked low: A year out, only 6.5 percent of the households still
off welfare were receiving food stamps, even though many more were
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Such studies tend to present an overly rosy picture, officials
acknowledge, because they depend on a small sample _ 210
households, in the case of Massachusetts _ of welfare recipients
willing to be interviewed, and the hardest cases are by nature
tougher to find and less willing to talk. Nonetheless, they present
strong evidence that the pattern of widespread deprivation feared
by critics of welfare changes has not materialized, though they
also document a measurable minority that is clearly worse off.
</P>
<P>
   Like many reports on welfare reform, the Massachusetts study
``is a case of whether the glass is two-thirds full or one-third
empty,'' said Lawrence Bailis, a poverty and welfare expert at
Brandeis University. Some people are clearly better off, he said,
``but our data and the welfare department data showed there are
people falling through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the main thing to keep in mind about such reports
is that they are essentially best-case scenarios, cautioned Deborah
Harris, a staff attorney for the Massachusetts Law Reform
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what happens in a booming economy, when the people
who are most likely to be able to survive without welfare leave
welfare, and are not being forced off by a time limit,'' she said.
``And even so,'' she added, interpreting data from the innards of
the 61-page report, ``only slightly more than half had family
income from earnings after a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts economy is indeed booming, with the latest
unemployment rate at 2.8 percent. But the state's welfare numbers
are much the same as those turning up elsewhere, said Sheldon
Danziger, a professor of social work and public policy at the
University of Michigan who is working on Michigan's tracking of
former welfare recipients. In particular, the finding that about
two-thirds of former recipients are working is about par, he said,
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would say is that there are no longer people on welfare
who were the stereotypical case that upset the public, that is,
people who could have gotten jobs but stayed on welfare, because
all those people have been pushed off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So now, the two-thirds proportion many researchers are finding
``raises the issue of whether there are people who are `truly
needy' who are not getting anything under the new system,'' he
said. ``My own view is that some recipients being forced off the
rolls are going to need some sort of guaranteed
work-for-your-welfare position of last resort'' in a sheltered
environment, because private employers will not hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Massachusetts, time limits on certain welfare recipients
have begun to kick in, and thousands have exhausted their two-year
maximum and are being knocked off the welfare rolls. Advocates for
the poor complain that the state is unusually tough about granting
extensions to those who apply.
</P>
<P>
   Intentionally, Ms. McIntyre said. Otherwise, ``We wouldn't have
a time limit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report, advocates said, highlights the kinds of troubles
awaiting those who lose their welfare benefits now. The report
showed that about one-quarter of those who left welfare got back on
it, Ms. Harris pointed out. Other states have shown similar
numbers, with 24 percent of families returning to welfare within
three months in Michigan, and 19 percent in Maryland and 38 percent
in New Jersey, according to a compilation by the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But with the new time limits, many would lose that option, Ms.
Harris and other advocates emphasized. And those who remain on the
rolls are likelier to be in more difficult situations than those
who promptly leave.

<P>
   Brian Flynn, an attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services,
offered as an example his client, Rene Marvel, whose request to get
back on welfare after she lost her job was recently denied. She was
told, she said, that she could not get food stamps without welfare.
So, though she is scraping by raising a family of five children and
sometimes goes hungry, she has not applied, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They referred me to the food pantry,'' she said. ``They don't
tell you what you really need to know. They tell you what they want
you to know, which is that you've been on assistance for this
amount of time, you need to find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McIntire said Massachusetts officials are investigating why
the rate of food-stamps is so low, and will not tolerate hunger in
the state. They are gathering more data and looking into programs
to increase information about food stamps among welfare recipients
who do not realize it is a separate program with separate
eligibility, and will also move to make the stamps easier to apply
for, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Massachusetts report highlighted an array of
other telling aspects of life after welfare. It found, for example,
that a year out, nearly 18 percent of respondents reported
exceeding $500 a week, while 12 percent reported income below $150.
Households also reported greater debt a year out than earlier on,
with an even fifth reporting debt of over $10,000, compared with 17
percent after three months.
</P>
<P>
   What the report did not answer, however, was a central mystery
of welfare reform: how many thousands of people who dropped off the
welfare rolls but were not working were managing to support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts report, Ms. Harris said, ``23 percent were
off welfare and not working, and we have no idea what their sources
of income were.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Lawrence Bailis of Brandeis, the bottom line of
the report must be that ``even if most are better off, we as a
society have a concern for people who are in trouble, and our data
and these data showed hungry kids. I know the commonwealth has
planned all kinds of steps to make sure people don't fall through
the cracks but this is suggesting that even more may be needed.''

GRETZKY MAKES IT OFFICIAL: HE'LL RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Magician, craftsman and master of the unexpected,
Wayne Gretzky for once in his career did what everyone anticipated
Friday, announcing that he will make Sunday the last game of his
illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been asking me why,'' said the
38-year-old Gretzky, owner of virtually every offensive record in
the National Hockey League, without question the game's icon around
the world. ``It's a gut feel, something I believe is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart, my gut is telling me this is it -- it's time. I'm
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Word began circulating last weekend that Gretzky, hindered this
season by a bulging cervical disk, would end his 20-year NHL career
when the Pittsburgh Penguins faced his Rangers at Madison Square
Garden. Gretzky all but confirmed the speculation after the
Blueshirts' game Thursday night in Ottawa, where he said, barring a
miracle, he would announce his retirement the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 4 p.m., inside Madison Square Garden's packed
Parmount Room, the Great One said goodbye. But earlier in the day,
he phoned home to Brantford, Ontario, and threw Phyllis Gretzky one
last deke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' said the world's greatest hockey-playing son, ``it's a
miracle! I'm not retiring. ... April Fool's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne,'' said his mom, ``you're a (jerk).''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his wife, two sons, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and
a string of Ranger and MSG officials, including his long-time coach
John Muckler, Gretzky spent some 50 minutes explainining why it was
time for him to walk away. It wasn't injury, he said. It wasn't any
one thing, but more a concert of feelings, all adding up to the
inevitable conclusion that it was time to give up the game he
loved. He told his Ranger teammates before Thursday's game that his
mind was made up. He called his long-time teammate and cohort, Mark
Messier, and broke the news to him after the game in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Good for you, if that's your decision,' '' said
Gretzky, whose final game, televised in the United Stats via the
Fox network, will undoubtedly draw the highest-rated viewership in
hockey history. ``I hate to be repetitive about this. ... I love
the game ... but it's just part of it. Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the Paramount Room was eerily funereal at the
start. A bouquet of flowers fronted the podium, the predominant
colors orange and yellow, far more autumn than spring.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the somber-looking Gretzky appeared, all his
Ranger teammates shuffled silently into the room and dutifly took
seats in an area that had been cordoned off from reporters and
photographers. Dressed in their best road suits, many of them
multimillionaires, they added to a scene that conjured images of
paying last respects at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sports, you go through all these highs and lows,'' Gretzky
began, his voice quaking slightly, his eyes glistening.
``Unfortunately, sometimes you go to funerals. Fortunately,
sometimes you go to weddings. To me, this is a celebration, I hope
you understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did his whole career on the ice, Gretzky maintained his
composure throughout his farewell address and the followup session
of questions and answers. He never once bristled. He answered every
question, thoughtfully, graciously, and with humility when
required.
</P>
<P>
   When he pulls off his skates, where will they go?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, when I was 12 and 13 years old,'' he reminisced, ``a
guy at the Hall of Fame used to let me go in, and I'd just stand
there for hours and stare. If the NHL wants (the skates) for the
Hall of Fame, that's where they'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's widely considered that Gretzky will be immediately inducted
into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, the customary three-year
waiting period to be waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's safe to say, that I'm probably going to get in
there -- now that I'm retired I can say that,'' he said, again
flashing his humility. Asked what team sweater he would prefer his
likeness to wear in the Hall, he added, ``Somehow, some way, I will
be part of all of those teams in the Hall of Fame, but I'll always
be remembered that I retired a Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky began to make up his mind about retiring at mid-season
and told his wife, actress Janet Jones. She told him to wait, be
certain, and he said he fought off a temptation to make his
decision public after a mid-winter stop in Edmonton, the city where
he won his four Stanley Cups with the greatest offensive team ever
assembeled.
</P>
<P>
   Some three weeks ago he called his long-time agent, Mike
Barnett, and told him that he thought it was time to retire. When
the two met, Barnett realized there wasn't much to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more a case of me listening; his mind was made up,''
said Barnett. ``I saw it in his eyes. I heard it. His inner voice
served him well, as it has throughout his career. Just as that
voice always told him to jump to the hole, to shoot the puck, go
for the wraparound ... that same clear voice was there again and he
wasn't going to go against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue was a factor, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started to feel fatigue -- mentally and physically --
that I never felt before,'' said Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky had another year under contract with the Blueshirts, for
which he would have earned $5 million. He will collect what amounts
to a $500,000 retirement bonus. He said he will remain involved in
hockey, but he won't begin to formulate post-career plans until
after at least a one-year rest. He has played professionaly for 21
years -- including a first season with Indianapolis in the World
Hockey Association -- and he has been living the dream of playing
since age 3.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't sound as if he'll join Barnett as an agent with IMG.
``No, I don't think so,'' said Barnett. ``He'd more likely buy
IMG.''
</P>
<P>
   Team ownership could be in the Great One's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so intelligent,'' said Barnett, asked if the high cost of
an NHL club might be beyond even Gretzky's means. ``He knows he'd
be better to have strategic partners than do it on his own. That
opportunity will present itself, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Gretzky is going home, although he's not sure what that
means, because he doesn't know where to call home. He has loved his
time in Manhattan and his three children -- Paulina, Trevor and Ty
-- like their schools and have their friends. He said he didn't
know if home eventually will be in the United States or Canada.

ANALYSIS: PILOTS LOSE A BATTLE, NOT THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge's decision Thursday to order the pilots union at
American Airlines to pay the carrier more than $45 million in
damages is hardly the end of the conflict between the union and the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers and academics said Friday that the award was the
largest such assessment against a union that they could recall. It
amounts to about $5,000 for each of the 9,200 members of the Allied
Pilots Association, the independent union that represents the
pilots. It is also more than the union's $38 million cash reserves,
raising the issue of whether the union will survive and whether
individual pilots will have to write out checks to meet the union's
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   The union has 15 days to appeal the judge's decision, and it
said it planned to do so. Some labor lawyers said the union had a
strong case for either reducing the damage award or having it
overthrown. But others suggested that they might have a difficult
time on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the process will take months, if not years.
Meanwhile, American, which is the country's second-largest carrier,
and its pilots still have to work out their differences or the
airline could face more disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this fine does not put us one step closer to
what both APA and management need,'' said Richard T. Lavoy, the
union's president.
</P>
<P>
   That, he added, is a negotiated settlement to the dispute, which
began in December after AMR Corp., American's parent, bought Reno
Air, a small airline in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The union said the acquisition of Reno Air violated its
contract, which guarantees that APA members will fly all large jets
at the company. But what they really want is for the company to
acknowledge the violation and agree to a procedure for any future
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The company countered that it had not violated the contract and
that it planned to integrate Reno into American over 18 months. It
also said it was eager to conclude an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The situation boiled over in early February, when frustrated
pilots began to call in sick, crippling American's operations. The
airline was forced to cancel more than 6,600 flights over 10 days,
inconveniencing more than 600,000 passengers during the busy
Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's request, Judge Joe Kendall of the U.S. District
Court in Dallas ordered the pilots back to work. But operations did
not return to normal until the judge cited the union and its
president and vice president for contempt. Thursday's award was
based on his assessment of the damage suffered by American in the
three days after he issued his restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the union and American have engaged in several
rounds of talks with a federal mediator in an attempt to resolve
the dispute. But so far the talks have not yielded much. It is hard
to imagine that the company's apparent attempt to bankrupt the
union is going to help the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, American's public comments appear designed to drive a
wedge between APA members and their leaders. Chris Chiames, an AMR
spokesman, said after the damage award was announced that ``It is a
shame that the APA is dominated by a leadership that is only
interested in confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence the union is already divided. A vote in March
to elect the union chief representing the pilots in Chicago pitted
the incumbent, who is sympathetic to the union's current
leadership, against a challenger who campaigned for closer
relations with management. The incumbent won by just 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the daylights out of me,'' one pilot who backs the
leadership and insisted on anonymity said of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to overthrow the union leadership is a risky strategy.
It's three top officers still have two years left in their terms.
Impeachment requires a majority vote of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the union's current officers does not necessarily mean
that rank-and-file pilots sympathize with management. A second
pilot who took part in the sickout and spoke on condition of
anonymity said he believed he was misled by the union. ``We were
led to believe that we had run out of options, that the only thing
left to do was vote with our feet,'' he said. Now he is convinced
that the leadership should have pursued other, legal alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time management's refusal to come around has
convinced the pilot that the company is planning to make more
acquisitions that will threaten pilot jobs. ``All we really wanted
was for the company to acknowledge that they need APA permission,''
he said, referring to the Reno Air deal. ``That American was
prepared to take a major financial hit on this to me means that
this is a lot more important to American than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the APA has strike insurance, but Steve
Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, an
industry trade group, said that because the union was found guilty
of breaking the law an insurer would not be required to make a
payout.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat to the union posed by the damage award may not be
as dire as it appears. Pilots are highly paid and their union dues
are only 1 percent of their salaries, a relatively small figure
compared with other unions. An APA spokesman said the damage award
would not affect its daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   However, some pilots are wondering whether it makes sense for
their union to remain independent. When the pilots struck two years
ago, President Clinton used his executive powers to order them back
to work after only a few minutes. But Clinton did not intervene
last summer when pilots at Northwest Airlines, who are represented
by the Air Line Pilots Association, which is affiliated with the
AFL-CIO, went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, American pilots are talking about joining ALPA or somehow
allying with a national union that would give them more clout.
``Crandall always liked the fact that there were no AFL-CIO unions
on the property,'' said a labor lawyer active in the airline
industry who insisted on anonymity, referring to former AMR chief
executive Robert Crandall. ``I don't know how management would feel
about driving the pilots into the arms of ALPA.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMR rose $2 Friday, to $68.25, on the New York Stock
Exchange.

   For the second time, Richard D. Parsons, president of Time
Warner, has succeeded in recruiting Deborah C. Wright away from
himself. New York's Carver Bancorp, the nation's largest bank
controlled by blacks, announced last week that she would become its
new chief executive June 1. She is now president of the Upper
Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a community development group where
Parsons is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, when Parsons was running the Dime Savings
Bank, he planned to hire Ms. Wright, an investment banker by trade,
to run a new unit for local projects. But when Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani named Parsons, his former law partner, to manage his
transition team, Parsons instead asked her to take charge of the
city Department of Housing, Preservation and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons is one of those who fault Carver for not reinvesting
deposits in the inner city. He wrote Ms. Wright a recommendation of
several single-spaced pages and then spent hours persuading board
members that they needed someone experienced in community
development rather than commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie has the skills, commitment and vision,'' Parsons said.
``She has a sense of how to put money out into the community that
Carver serves.'' Her other backers included Henry Kravis, who has
also become a promoter of inner city investment. As for Parsons, he
is now hunting for a new empowerment-zone &QL; 
chief.

   With even Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. going public, executives at other
private partnerships are often asked when they will follow suit. At
least for Andersen Consulting, the global techology giant, selling
shares is not in the plans.
</P>
<P>
   George T. Shaheen, the firm's chairman, told journalists in New
York last week that going public might make his partners just too
fat and happy to care about the business. The consultants would end
up buying toys like yachts and two-seater Mercedes, he said, and
then go gallivanting about. Pointing to a colleague, Shaheen said,
``He's going to get divorced, and he's not going to come to work.''

   A talent for economics and a way with words coexist as rarely
as, say, welfare states and low taxes. During their single meeting,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was nettled by John Maynard Keynes'
failure to communicate clearly, accusing the century's greatest
economist of sounding like a mathematician. Nobel Laureate Wassily
Leontief claimed that Keynes' influence was due largely to prose
that required deciphering by legions of disciples.

met with Ross Perot, the company founder, for a dinner lasting
several hours in the private back room of a Dallas restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Perot Systems, the computer services company Perot currently
runs, is an EDS competitor. But Perot, no fan of the executives who
were deposed to make way for Brown, was evidently flattered to be
asked for tips on turning this struggling company around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of people who will explain EDS to me,'' Brown, a
telecommunications industry veteran, told him. ``So talk to me
about change.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Brown and Perot have a lot in common: bluntness,
notorious impatience and contempt for bureaucratic procedure. Brown
loves to annoy the EDS security force by hitchhiking around the
company's campus and holding impromptu parking-lot conferences.

TOM PATTEN, 73, SCIENTIST WHO HELPED UNLOCK NORTH SEA OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Patten, a British marine scientist and offshore engineer
who played a key role in unlocking the gas and oil deposits beneath
the North Sea, died April 10 at a hospital in Edinburgh, where he
lived. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Patten realized that there was wealth buried
deep below the North Sea's rough surface. At the time, he was a
senior lecturer in mechanical sciences at the University of
Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation was pending in Britain to deal with the traces of
gas that had previously been spotted. Patten was among the first to
recognize the huge potential looming behind those traces, and he
resolutely followed up on his conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled the world, to Houston and wherever else he found
oilmen who knew how to pump the black gold from the earth's crust.
And for the next three decades his engineering expertise made him
an important figure in the exploration and production of oil and
gas from the drilling platforms that rose above those storm-swept
waters in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Patten moved easily between academic and business lives. He
retired in 1982 as head of the mechanical engineering department
and professor emeritus of the Institute of Offshore Engineering at
Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He became a private consultant for industry and government, and
at his death was chairman of Marine Technology Directorate Ltd. One
of his interests was the security of oil rigs, on which he advised
Britain's Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Patten was born in Ford, Northumberland, near the Scottish
border and just 50 miles southeast of Edinburgh. He graduated from
the University of Edinburgh, where he also earned a doctorate in
engineering.
</P>
<P>

BURNS LOOKS TO KHRISTICH FOR THAT SOMETHING EXTRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Everyone can agree the Bruins have been playing very
well of late. However, with two games left in the regular season,
including Saturday's matinee against the Buffalo Sabres, and the
playoffs looming, coach Pat Burns said one player he needs more
from is right wing Dmitri Khristich. Khristich is the
second-leading scorer on the team with 71 points, true. But
Khristich has only one goal in his last eight games and a total of
four points.
</P>
<P>
   According to the coach, that just isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed and I think he knows I'm disappointed,''
said Burns. ``When he's skating and on his game, he's been a
productive player. He's been a strong player for us all year but in
the last while, he hasn't been there for us. If we intend to go a
long way in the playoffs, Dmitri Khristich has to stand up and be
counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been a master at pushing his players' buttons in the
two seasons he's been here. From Jason Allison to Joe Thornton to
Sergei Samsonov, Burns always seems to have the right thing to say
to light a fire under whatever player happens to be slumping. In
this case, Burns said his fervent hope is to stop Khristich from
standing still.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said that unlike Steve Heinze, who is widely considered a
streaky offensive player, he wouldn't consider Khristich streaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be a steady, steady player if he wants throughout the
year and probably get a lot of points and he did,'' Burns said.
``When he's on his game, I'll put him in a defensive situation and
make him kill penalties but when he's not skating, he's not getting
that. Forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich has been playing with Samsonov and Thornton of late
and Burns said he doesn't buy that he misses Allison as his
centerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's been playing great lately,'' said the coach. ``We're not
here to say, `I want to play with this guy or that guy.' We're
going to play the guys together we feel are going to make a winner
or make the team better. There's not a player who's going to come
in and say, `I don't want to play with him.' Goodbye. That's not
the way it works. Everybody has to have some kind of contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dmitri is on his game, he plays center, he plays on the
wing, he gets tons of ice time. When he's not skating, he's not
going to get the ice time.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Allison, who played a terrific game against the Penguins
Thursday and tallied one goal and two assists, Burns said he had
one word for him, ``Shoot!''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the game, Allison had a two-on-one break with
Anson Carter and passed up the shot to try to force the puck to
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always trying to make the pass,'' said Burns. ``If I was
a defenseman, at 48 years old, I'd take 15 two-on-ones against him.
I'd just go to the other guy. Let him go because he's not going to
shoot it. I understand he doesn't always want to shoot it. When
he's skating and making the right decisions, like he did behind the
net (that led to his goal), he's a horse. He's a strong man. Dmitri
is a strong man on skates. In today's game, if you don't skate,
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Tim Taylor stayed off the ice at Friday's practice in
Wilmington because of a groin strain, suffered in the first period
of Thursday's game against Pittsburgh. Taylor played the entire
contest, keeping his shifts short against the Penguins, and said he
will play Saturday ... Shawn Bates also missed the skate because of
a hamstring pull and won't be in the lineup against the Sabres ...
Burns' club is 0-4-0 against Buffalo this year and they will try to
change that in their final meeting Saturday. ``They've been a
puzzle to us,'' said Burns. ``They play hard. I thought (former
UMass-Lowell goalie Dwayne Roloson) had a great game against New
Jersey. They play tough, close, tight, in your face. They're a
tough team to play.''

WILLIAMS, JAMES AT THE TOP OF MANY WISH LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Williams and Edgerrin James. By now the names have been
heard, seen, and read ad nauseam. That's because in Saturday's
draft they are the filet mignon of running backs _ two very
talented young men whom the Patriots would give a small fortune for
and may indeed try to position themselves to select.
</P>
<P>
   There's supposedly a great dropoff in talent after those two,
but experience says that the success of running backs is much too
difficult to predict. Prime examples of that include sixth-rounder
Terrell Davis, third- rounder Curtis Martin, fourth-rounder Jamal
Anderson, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, according to New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka, is
``the next Earl Campbell.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who also doubled as a baseball player in the
Philadelphia Phillies organization, gained an amazing 2,124 yards
and scored 27 touchdowns his senior year. He started his career at
Texas as a fullback, but it was soon evident Williams had the
talent to be the featured back, and the 5-foot-11-inch, 235-pounder
went on to rush for 6,279 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Williams runs a 4.5 40-yard dash, sheds tacklers, runs through
people, can turn the corner, and leave defenders in the dust. He
has great balance, body control, and a general knack for getting it
done.
</P>
<P>
   James, at 6 feet, 216 pounds, is a smoother runner, running for
1,416 yards at the University of Miami. He has deceptive 4.4 speed
and is elusive. James drew major attention after gaining 299 yards
and three touchdowns against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Williams and James, among those to watch are Mississippi
State's James Johnson, LSU's Kevin Faulk, West Virginia's Amos
Zereoue, Michigan's Sedrick Irvin, Tennessee's Shawn Bryson, Boston
College's Mike Cloud, and UNH's Jerry Azumah. McNeese State's Cecil
Collins might be the third best runner in the draft, but he comes
with much personal baggage, which has gotten him kicked out of two
schools and facing two felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, if they chose not to move, may very well settle
for Johnson, a 6-1, 227-pound runner who will be 24 by summer camp.
Johnson spent three years in the Navy and is a very mature kid who
could develop into a solid runner. If the Patriots want more flash,
they'll take a chance on Faulk, who is only 5-8, but weighs 201
pounds and could be an effective returner. He gained 1,282 yards on
247 carries with 13 TDs and is considered an excellent receiver. He
may be too small to be the every-down back.
</P>
<P>
   Zereoue is also short on size at 5-7 1/2, 203 pounds, but many
describe him as a young Joe Morris, with a low center of gravity
and able to move his feet quickly in close quarters. Irvin, who is
Dallas receiver Michael Irvin's cousin, is a little bigger at 5-11,
223, but he's not one of the faster high-echelon backs. Much like
his cousin, Irvin is a brash, cocky kid who might prove himself to
be a big-time player because of his attitude. Bryson is a tweener
at 6-1, 232, but is a very intriguing runner who runs hard and is
very tough.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud's status became clearer with his great Senior Bowl
performance. Patriots vice president Bobby Grier has watched
Cloud's career closely and loves his game. At 5-10, 202 pounds, the
Rhode Island native could be the Patriots' pick if they decide not
to take a back in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Azumah, who had a record vertical leap of 43 1/2 inches at the
Scouting Combine, also enhanced his draft stature and may go in the
third or fourth round as a third-down back who can return. He may
be better than that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Other sleepers include Colorado's Marlon Barnes, Emporia State's
Brian Shay, Oklahoma's De'Mond Parker and Missouri's Devin West.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's Rob Konrad leads the crop of fullbacks. Konrad may
not be a pure fullback, as teams see him as a possible feature back
or even a tight end. Oklahoma's Jermaine Fazande, Nebraska's Joel
Makovicka, and Arizona State's Jeff Paulk are other possible
fullback choices.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanley Sheinbaum, the publisher of New
Perspectives Quarterly, was standing by the window lamenting the
lack of ideological commitment among Hollywood executives. ``They
give their money away purely for ego rather than because they
identify with any particular cause,'' he said, his black turtleneck
setting off his white hair.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Wiener, a history professor, was waiting in line for a
sandwich and arguing about loyalty and betrayal in Washington. At
another table a discussion was starting about whether Mike Davis'
apocalyptic book on Los Angeles, ``Ecology of Fear,'' was fair to
their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   These 45 Angelenos had ventured out for their newest biweekly
tradition: a meeting of the Los Angeles Institute for the
Humanities, a group of writers, academics and intellectuals who
meet at the Faculty Center of the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   On this warm Friday they got to eat ham and turkey sandwiches
and listen to Ronald Steel, a professor and author, discuss his
forthcoming biography of Robert F. Kennedy. Also seated in the
standard-issue college dining room were Dagmar Barnouw, a
historian; Russell Jacoby, who wrote a book on public
intellectuals; the conservative columnist Arianna Huffington, and
David Schweitzer, a theater director.
</P>
<P>
   This is Los Angeles' intellectual life.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like an oxymoron. After all, the notion that Los
Angeles has no brain is about as old as the city itself. Not even
its residents tend to think otherwise. ``That this city is so much
more complex than `Baywatch' is a fact too infrequently experienced
by its own residents,'' said Steve Wasserman editor of The Los
Angeles Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the city's public and private universities, a slate of
Nobel Prize winners, some of the country's most creative artistic
talent, a reservoir of scientific expertise at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, these
stereotypes were always more alive in the imagination, particularly
on the East Coast, than in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, writers and scholars are now saying that a new influx
of institutions and art museums has helped make intellectual life
more vital than in any other period in this city's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the West Side of Los Angeles there is now an intellectual
and cultural life that is easily comparable to that of New York or
Boston,'' said Davis, the historian, whose book is causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Harding, the director of the Center for the Study of
Women at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed: ``Los
Angeles intellectual life is thriving. At the same time it is less
elitist and no one is intimidated by the big names.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the seven-month-old Institute for the Humanities
there is the new Institute for Art and Cultures at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, which sponsors lectures. Over the past year
59 Americans and Europeans, like the cultural critic Elaine Scarry
and the video artist Bill Viola, have come to study at the Bel Air
campus of the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and
the Humanities. The area's universities regularly attract visiting
lecturers like the European philosophers Jacques Derrida and Jurgen
Habermas.
</P>
<P>
   Informal seminars and literary gatherings are becoming frequent
fixtures. On a recent Sunday night more than 80 people came to a
monthly literary salon at Le Coloniale, a West Hollywood
restaurant. For $20 you could get a buffet dinner and listen to
four writers read from new work. On this night DeLaune Michel,
whose one-woman show ``Southern Gothic'' played here last year, was
one of the attractions. ``There's a real desire out there to be
part of some greater literary community,'' said Charlie Otto, who
directed the reading.
</P>
<P>
   Books are a growth industry here. Last April 110,000 people
bought tickets to the third annual Los Angeles Times Book Fair.
``The greater Los Angeles area is the No. 1 book market in the
country,'' said Joseph Tosney, the regional manager of Borders
Books and Music.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even the intellectuals don't try to claim that
cultivating the body never takes precedence over developing the
mind, or that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
doesn't generate more interest than the academy.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis explained, ``This city has always been dominated by a
dictatorship of the boosters who were duly intolerant of the
intellectuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's geography hasn't helped. UCLA is more than 40 miles
from the Claremont Colleges. Driving is not only time consuming,
but it also works against spontaneous meetings and discussions.
``There's a vast intellectual audience out there,'' said Ruth
Seymour, the general manager of KCRW, the National Public Radio
station in Santa Monica. ``But it's much more hermetically
sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are simply learning to work around such drawbacks. ``We do
not compete with the big gorilla,'' said Michael S. Roth, the
director of the Scholars and Seminars Program at the Getty Research
Institute, referring to Hollywood. ``We are not trying to make
money on ideas. We're here to demonstrate that ideas have
consequences on their own accord.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, technology has helped. The Southern California
Science Writers Group, frustrated by failed attempts to meet in
person, now plan to hold meetings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To what extent the isolation and narrowness is self-imposed is a
matter of debate, however. Chon Noriega, the editor of Aztlan: A
Journal of Chicano Studies, said that in a city that is 43 percent
Hispanic and 10 percent Asian the big new, largely white
intellectual institutions on the West Side ``do not represent the
population changes that have already occurred in this city.'' He
continued, ``What were once called minority writers are now on the
front lines of the new thinking about Los Angeles because it's they
who are grappling with the greatest range of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   One subject that seems to interest those inside and outside the
intellectual establishment is Los Angeles itself. ``The city is as
self-conscious about itself and generating as much literature about
itself as any other city in the world, including New York,'' said
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   If the subject matter is different here, so is the style of
discourse. Davis said there was a ``much tougher intellectual
climate in New York'' that ``arises from that city's political,
Jewish and radical traditions. Without that, it's more difficult in
a place like Los Angeles to get a harsh, critical discourse
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Winer, a former drama critic at The Times, said, ``If you
get into an argument here, people's first instinct is to smooth it
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, smoothing over isn't necessarily a bad idea. So many
people showed up for a recent 40-minute lecture by the American
painter R.B. Kitaj at the Institute for Art and Cultures that 300
of them _ including three museum trustees and the actor Michael
York _ had to be turned away amid angry complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the organizers figured out how to defuse the
lecture-hungry crowd: Pipe the lecture through a loudspeaker on the
plaza and pass out glasses of free wine. That's an idea that even a
New York intellectual could love.

FOR BETTER OR WORSE, SCREEN STARS FLOCK TO STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Sunday, April 18 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What overpriced coffee is to Seattle and windbag
speeches are to Washington, D.C., movies and television are to Los
Angeles. They're the fuel that keeps the whole show running.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hollywood actors, in this most caste-conscious of
company towns, opting to perform in a real, live play can be like
trying to sell abacuses in Silicon Valley. No one's going to stop
you, certainly, but you may get a few quizzical stares from
friends, colleagues and your agent.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to explain the recent convergence of so many big-name
TV and movie stars on L.A. stages? A list of the marquee talent
that has graced local playhouses in the past year or so would
include Alan Alda, Debbie Allen, Christine Baranski, Annette
Bening, Carol Burnett, Jenna Elfman, Danny Glover, Kelsey Grammer,
Teri Hatcher, Jack Klugman, Frank Langella, Ian McKellen,
Christopher Plummer and Molly Ringwald.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come this season are Linda Lavin, who'll star in the
Geffen Playhouse production of Donald Margulies' ``Collected
Stories,'' opening next month, and two plays at the Mark Taper
Forum: Donald Sutherland in the U.S. premiere of ``Enigma
Variations,'' by the French playwright Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, in
May and June; and Al Pacino, who'll direct and act in his Los
Angeles stage debut in Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie,'' which opens in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Some performers, like Bening _ who cut her theatrical teeth in
New York and San Francisco in the early '80s _ are experienced
stage actors, returning to the boards after lengthy, klieg-lit
sabbaticals. Others like Hatcher, the slenderized half of TV's
``Lois &AMP; Clark,'' are taking their first plunge before a live,
seated audience. Still others, like McKellen, are seasoned stage
pros who've been shuttling between theater and film for years.
</P>
<P>
   Juiced up by celebrity wattage and buoyed by mostly good
reviews, some of these star-driven shows have been palpable hits.
Yasmina Rehza's internationally acclaimed ``Art,'' with a cast that
included Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, ran 12 weeks at the
Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood last winter. Bening's current
five-week run in the title role of Henrik Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler''
at the 498-seat Geffen has become L.A.'s toughest ticket, with most
performances completely sold out, according to publicist Gary
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, two-way traffic between Hollywood and the theater is
nothing new. Ever since New York vaudevillians began migrating west
to make silent films, Hollywood has been raiding theatrical talent,
whether it's Marlon Brando or Martin Short. Theater producers, for
their part, have been all too happy to boost their box office by
occasionally offering matinee idols to their subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   And in an increasingly fluid and inter-dependent entertainment
universe, the days have long since passed when (ITALICS
START)thea-tuh(ITALICS END) mavens could afford to look down their
noses at the studio philistines.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of those who've been doing theater here longest
say they've seldom seen so much prominent industry talent on
display in its own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not premeditated, but there is a sudden influx or
increase in the number of star performers, at least on the Los
Angeles stages,'' says Gordon Davidson, producing artistic director
of the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   What has brought so many prominent stars into alignment this
season? More significantly, what's to keep them _ not to mention
their audiences _ coming back to L.A. theaters in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, some producers say, the current star-crossed season
coincides with changing conditions that have made recruiting
Hollywood talent harder than ever. With today's year-round
production schedules and proliferating cable outlets and TV pilots,
the summertime ``hiatus'' that used to free up actors for a period
of a few weeks ``has essentially disappeared,'' says Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Cates, artistic director of the Geffen, says that when the
studio system prevailed, it was easier for actors to take time off
to work on plays. Now, few are willing to commit to a play for more
than six or eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the conundrum,'' Cates explains. ``If we wouldn't
prepare a season, if we would just be going play by play, it'd be
easier to get stars. Because what would happen is we'd say, OK,
after we do `Collected Stories' let's do Arthur Miller's `The
Price.' Let's start rehearsing in June. Let's see who's available
in June. Maybe Dustin Hoffman's available in June, or maybe Al
Pacino. And you know something? If they're available in June, then
we got 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if you want to do a season you say, OK, we need him
available in March 2000. You go through two reactions. The first
reaction is usually from the representative: `Are you out of your
(expletive) mind?' And the second reaction is, `OK, but you know
you run the risk of something coming up.'''
</P>
<P>
   What's a theater to do? Some simply try to keep their industry
contacts open so stars will come to them with projects. The more
flexible a theater can be in scheduling, and the shorter a
commitment it requires, the better its chances of success. For
instance, the Reprise! series of staged concert musicals was able
to snag Kelsey Grammer for its recent production of ``Sweeney Todd,
the Demon Barber of Fleet Street'' by squeezing rehearsals into the
``Frasier'' star's television shooting schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson is fond of quoting one Hollywood agent who told him,
``OK, my client wants to be in your show, but what if he or she
gets a job?''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson responded, `What do you think I've been offering? It's
a job!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Hollywood actors do show up, seats fill up a lot
faster. When the Mark Taper Forum added the Sutherland and Pacino
shows to the second half of its season _ both as replacements for
previously scheduled shows _ its midseason subscriptions shot up
``on the order of five or six thousand,'' about double the number
for a typical year, Davidson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's helpful, because we want to convert those people into
regular theater-goers.
</P>
<P>
   An old truism holds that theater-going in L.A. still is not an
ingrained cultural habit, as it is in New York or Chicago. Rather,
in an area where beaches and sunsets are pretty much free for the
taking, theater is simply one of a zillion entertainment options
clamoring for consumers' disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special thing to go to the theater, whereas I think it
should be an everyday thing,'' says Jenna Elfman, who took time off
from her hit series ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' last winter to perform in a
tiny Los Feliz theater in ``Visions and Lovers: Variations on a
Theme,'' a double bill of one-acts about modern relationships by
acting teacher Milton Katselas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids should grow up with theater and art, know that
there is more and know that they can create anything that they
want, as opposed to, `There's McDonald's' and `Let's go to Pic 'n'
Save,''' Elfman says.
</P>
<P>
   While established theaters like the Geffen, the Taper and the
Ahmanson get the lion's share of publicity _ both from local and
national media _ Los Angeles also is home to perhaps the largest
concentration of small and midsize theaters outside New York City.
Many of these are low-budget, storefront operations with fewer than
99 seats, producing everything from Shakespeare and Neil Simon to
experimental theater, gay theater and improvisational comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these smaller theaters have expressed frustration at the
attention paid to the big Hollywood names and the theaters that
most consistently employ them. The Geffen, in fashionable Westwood,
is sometimes grumblingly referred to by less well-endowed rivals as
``Hollywood's community theater'' _ an epithet that, not
surprisingly, irritates Geffen staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain cynicism that is out there from people who
toil at the smaller theaters forever trying to build an audience,
and they do great work, but you've got to get an audience in the
seats,'' says publicist Murphy. ``But my theory is that what's good
for one is good for all, and that trickle-down theory should
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Murphy's boss, Gil Cates, says that while he's been
extremely pleased to present actors like Nicol Williamson and
Brendan Frasier at the Geffen, he has ``mixed feelings about having
the audience dependent upon stars to go to the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's nice occasionally to have a star in a play that's
attractive to an audience,'' he says, ``but I think that to create
an audience that only goes to the theater because there's a star in
the play ... it's really playing with fire, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, dealing with Hollywood stars and their retinues of
handlers can be draining, some theater staffers confide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder,'' says one staffer who asked for anonymity.
``It's people who've worked in a different world and have a
different expectation of how things operate. I think people who
work only in theater are more community-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   But others believe Hollywood actors need more encouragement from
the theater community if they're going to perform here regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Jon Voight, doing ``Streetcar'' in L.A.,'' says
playwright Katselas, ``and I thought critics and everyone should
welcome them (Hollywood stars who do theater) and really give them
a fanfare that really invites them and others to come in. I think
that it also is our duty as people who love theater to excite them
and pave the way for them _ not to tell them they're good when
they're not, but to aid them and help them.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems to be the consensus is that the more Hollywood actors
are willing to play to the hometown crowd, the more it will
legitimize L.A. theater in general and persuade more of their
colleagues to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before ``Hedda Gabler'' opened, Annette
Bening said her Hollywood friends were ``all really interested,
very much so, very supportive'' of her return to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while somebody'll say, `What play are you
doing?' And when I say, `Hedda Gabler,' they'll kind of look at me
like, `What?!''' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most people, of course, know the play, and they're like,
`Oh, wow, that's cool. Good for you.' ''

MORAL LEADERS NEED TO ADDRESS THE WAR IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Skedded earlier as RELIGION-COLUMN)  
(DW) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles W. Colson, once a proud tough guy for the Nixon
administration but for many years now a prominent conservative
religious leader, says NATO's air war against Serbia fails to meet
the traditional Christian criteria for a morally just war.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics and
Religious Liberty Commission, another conservative religious leader
who stands arm in arm with Colson on many public issues, cites the
same criteria for considering the same NATO campaign morally
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, religious leaders and ethicists, both religious and
secular, are struggling with the question of a war, and once again
they disagree. That of course is neither surprising nor, in itself,
distressing. What is surprising is the new patterns of alignment in
the religious world as in the political one, of defenders and
critics of an American military venture.
</P>
<P>
   What is distressing is how often the moral pronouncements offer
only the surface of a position without following that line of
thought through to its logical conclusions or its rock-bottom
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, people have to assess the facts for themselves and
consult their consciences. What they need from moral leaders is not
so much unanimity but clarity, and certainly not the same vague
generalities favored by politicians and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO-led intervention,'' leaders of the World Council of
Churches and other international Christian groups declared in late
March, ``manifests the failure of the international community to
achieve a credible negotiated solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it take a conclave of religious leaders to notice that? Was
anyone arguing the absurdity that the resort to arms manifested the
success of negotiations?
</P>
<P>
   So what, really, is the point of that statement _ except to link
the words ``NATO-led intervention'' and ``failure'' in the same
sentence and to place responsibility for the horror on ``the
international community''?
</P>
<P>
   Many statements from religious leaders, either for or against
the current intervention, have been more nuanced and faithful to
the complexities than that one. To the extent that moral
conclusions may depend on facts that are swiftly changing or
obscure, whether in the Balkans, the planning rooms of NATO or the
corridors of diplomacy, one has to sympathize with those trying to
give moral guidance.
</P>
<P>
   But two dividing lines have emerged across the whole spectrum of
moral analyses. One has to do with the relative moral weight of
countering the systematic expulsion of the Albanian population in
Kosovo and of avoiding the destruction and destabilization of a
prolonged war. The other has to do with the leap into the unknown
that warfare almost inevitably entails. Is such a leap moral
foolhardiness, the historical equivalent of opening Pandora's box?
Or is it an unavoidable feature of a national life not doomed to
moral abdication?
</P>
<P>
   Both points of division could be addressed more directly.
</P>
<P>
   All participants in this debate, for instance, deplore both the
destruction of war and the Serbian policy of ``ethnic cleansing,''
and they are understandably reluctant to acknowledge which they
deplore more. But a choice may have to be made.
</P>
<P>
   It is fine for advocates of a cease-fire, like Pope John Paul II
and the leading Roman Catholic bishops in the United States, to
pray that an end to the bombardment might lead to a settlement in
which President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, having defied
NATO and achieved much of an Albanian-free Kosovo, would somehow
accept what he refused earlier. But if he does not?
</P>
<P>
   What if the choice gets down to this, as it very realistically
might: prolonging, even widening the war, or adding the Albanian
Kosovars to history's long list of permanently displaced
populations, to be aided and resettled but never to return to their
homeland? It is not unthinkable that these religious leaders truly
believe the latter to be the more moral outcome. Shouldn't they say
so candidly?
</P>
<P>
   A parallel question can also be put to those who clearly believe
that restoring the Albanian Kosovars and definitively punishing
Milosevic's systematic campaign of terror, murder and expulsion is
worth a prolonged and extended battle. Shouldn't they say how
prolonged, how extended? Shouldn't they give at least some rough
order of the magnitude, in numbers of casualties or years of
military presence, that they think the cause is worth?
</P>
<P>
   The other new divide in the moral debate turns on what moral
stance to take when uncertainty about those questions is great and
cannot realistically be narrowed. It seems clear that one basis for
the pope's and the Catholic bishops' preference for pursuing even
the most unlikely wisp of a diplomatic settlement, rather than
prosecuting the war, is their conviction that war has a terrible
momentum of its own and is enormously unpredictable in its
consequences. So when in doubt, don't.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing position is often more implied than articulated,
but it has been eloquently expounded by Leon Wieseltier in an essay
in the current issue of The New Republic. Wieseltier is writing
about the Kosovo conflict in a secular political rather than a
religious framework, but in terms that are none the less moral. He
vehemently criticizes the now conventional American demand for an
``exit strategy,'' which he says ``fundamentally misunderstands the
nature of war and, more generally, the nature of historical
action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of caution, it denies the contingency of human
affairs,'' Wieseltier says, adding: ``We cannot completely predict
or completely determine the outcome of our best endeavors, though
our ignorance of their outcome does not make them less necessary or
less just. No great deed, private or public, has even been
undertaken in a bliss of certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The new threshold of certainty ``is a scruple about the use of
force itself,'' he says, something that the Vatican might agree
with. ``It rigs the discussion about military power,'' Wieseltier
contends, in a way that would have prevented the United States from
undertaking any of the military actions that have proved most
``essential to the protection of our values and our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe religious leaders and moral thinkers only need more time
to clarify their views on Kosovo. Unfortunately, it appears that
they will have more time than anyone wants.

U.N. AGENCY SAYS BELGRADE SEEKS TO EXPEL ALL ETHNIC ALBANIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The U.N. refugee agency accused Yugoslavia Friday of
trying to expel the entire ethnic Albanian population from Kosovo,
where Albanians had made up 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12,000 people had fled the province to Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro in the previous 24 hours, said Kris
Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. high commission for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expulsions, which were put on hold or slowed down over the
last two weeks, have now resumed with full force,'' Janowski said
at a briefing. ``The effort by the Serb authorities to expel the
entire ethnic population of Kosovo is again under way.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few months ago, he said, ``it would have seemed
unbelievable to the civilized world that the Serbs would actually
expel the entire civilian population, but that seems to be the
reality now.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission estimated that more than 700,000 people had fled
Kosovo in the last year, with 70,000 going to Montenegro, the
smaller republic in Yugoslavia; 120,000 to Macedonia; 320,000 to
Albania, and 32,000 to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rest have moved
on to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Janowski said the commission did not know how many Albanians
remained in Kosovo, but estimated the number at 400,000. That
figure is hard to calculate because ethnic Albanians did not
cooperate with the most recent Yugoslav census in Kosovo and
because the registration of those fleeing is incomplete, he said.
The province had 1.8 million people before the recent exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cannot offer any solution to aid those in Kosovo,
Janowski said, although it is clear from refugees' statements that
``terrible things are happening in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are telling us stories about their men being tortured
and shot,'' he said. ``It's a brutal expulsion. It's completely out
of control and blessed, we have to assume, by the authorities in
Belgrade, whose duty it is to protect the civilian population.''

IN PARCHED FLORIDA, BRUSH FIRES BURN DOZENS OF HOMES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Severe drought, coupled with record high
temperatures and high winds, have fueled dozens of fires across
Florida this month. Several were still burning late Friday, and
officials expected more fires over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday alone, 51 brush fires consumed nearly 5,816 acres.
The worst blaze was in Port St. Lucie, 45 miles up the coast from
West Palm Beach. Dozens of families were left homeless in Port St.
Lucie after fire destroyed 45 homes and severely damaged 25 others
as it consumed 2,400 acres before being brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very devastating,'' said a worker at a Port St. Lucie
community shelter where some of those burned out of their homes
were staying. ``They have nothing left but their clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified construction worker was credited with saving 10
houses when he dug a trench around a subdivision as 10-foot-high
flames threatened them.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, fire officials said two major brush fires had
burned 1,500 acres near here in Osceola County, forcing dozens of
people to evacuate their houses though none were destroyed. The
fires were under control but still burning, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   In Putnam County, 50 homes were evacuated and a mobile home
destroyed when a fire set by an arsonist burned 325 acres before it
was put out. Seven helicopters and three tanker planes are being
used to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Since early January, the Florida Division of Forestry said there
have been more than 2,417 fires that destroyed 57,000 acres and
caused several million dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are praying we only have another month and half of this,''
said James Brenner, fire management administrator for the forestry
division. ``This kind of fire season concerns us. We knew it was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the state have gone 80 days without rain and while
rain was forecast for the weekend, the long-term outlook was for
continued high temperatures and dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   The temperatures on Thursday reached a record high 95 degrees
here, and the drought index went above 600 in several counties. By
comparison, a rating of 400 this time of year can create a serious
potential for fires, according the index, which is determined by
analyzing rainfall, humidity, temperatures and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency,
allowing the Florida National Guard to help fight the fires. It
immediately sent two Black Hawk helicopters with 700-gallon buckets
on cables to fight the blaze in Port St. Lucie, a town of about
56,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's outbreak of 2,300 fires destroyed 500,000 acres,
300 homes, several businesses and caused more than $300 million in
damage. Since then, Florida has begun a controlled burning program
to east the fire danger.

EDITORIAL: CHILE AND THE PINOCHET CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 17:
</P>
<P>
   The case of Gen. Augusto Pinochet has left a lasting imprint on
international law. England's decision in March that even former
heads of state may be tried anywhere for torture committed at home
is a landmark, and now Britain's home secretary has ruled that
Spain can keep seeking Pinochet's extradition. But the case has
also exposed how Chile's military has limited its new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The home secretary's decision was correct. The Law Lords had
ruled that Pinochet could not be extradited for any crimes
committed before 1988, when Britain ratified the Torture
Convention. That left only three of the original charges standing,
but Spain has since added new ones and deserves the chance to prove
its case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try Pinochet in Spain will also benefit Chile.
The Chilean government, a coalition of parties opposed to Pinochet,
has asked for him to face justice in Chile. But privately,
officials admit they do not want him back. While 70 percent of
Chileans want to see him tried, few think the military would allow
it. The government would have to choose between a sham trial and
conflicts with the military.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chile's military has been restrained. But it could not
have hoped to influence Britain, and Chile's government was taking
Pinochet's side. That restraint could vanish if he came home. In
1993, when a judge investigated army payments to Pinochet's son,
the military sent troops into the streets. The case was quickly
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinochet case has reopened a debate on Chile's failure to
deal with past crimes. Less noted, though just as important, is
Pinochet's undemocratic Constitution, which limits the president's
power to dismiss military chiefs and grants military influence over
presidential decisions. Election rules give an unfair edge to
Pinochet's supporters, as does a lifelong Senate seat for Pinochet
and the military's ability to appoint senators. This has allowed
the right to block needed reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's civilian government is not in danger of being
overthrown. A military coup would win little support among a
population that has enjoyed years of economic growth. But less
dramatic insubordination is possible, which has persuaded the
government to limit its efforts to restore the freedoms Chile
enjoyed before Pinochet's rule. Thanks to his case, Chileans are
coming to realize how much of their democracy has been lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the wrenching scenes of Kosovo refugees and burning
buildings, of starched military men talking damage assessment, of
monochromatic video clips of exploding targets, the bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia was beginning to fade to a remote
concern for many people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the news that up to 33,000 reservists may be called up for
service in the Balkans, a portent of widening American involvement,
has brought the war back into sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, a Vietnam veteran who works for the Westchester
County government, is angry and fearful that each new escalation
will spawn another. ``We can supply them ammunition and planes and
everything, but why do we have to get more involved?'' he asked
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Martha McCauley, a retired office worker, was half-expecting a
call-up and even the deployment of ground troops, but is still
exasperated that no end to the war is in sight. ``That guy is never
going to give in,'' she said of President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia. ``I wish somebody would go over there and take that guy
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dilia Theodosakia, a former secretary who is starting a new
career as a nutritionist, is disgusted at what she has come to
regard as NATO's ruthless pummeling of Serbian cities. ``They keep
pounding these people, throwing all these weapons on them, and they
have no way of defending themselves,'' she said. ``It's the
powerful taking advantage of the weak.''
</P>
<P>
   A note of alarm has crept into conversations with Clark, Mrs.
McCauley and Mrs. Theodosakia. They are among a dozen people who
live and work in White Plains, N.Y., who were interviewed several
times since March 24, when NATO first bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The idealistic notion that the United States and its allies are
pursuing a just, moral course _ saving an ethnic minority in Kosovo
_ still captivates many people. But for those who had doubts about
the credibility of President Clinton in particular, the government
in general, and the news media overall, events of the past week
have only deepened their unease.
</P>
<P>
   David Gammons, a 59-year-old painter and retired art teacher,
kept the television tuned to CNN nearly all the time in the early
days of the air attacks. But he confessed that he is now feeling
more and more detached. ``I'm getting very fatigued with the
story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of ragged and frightened Kosovo refugees still stir
his sympathy. The policy debate has begun to sound repetitive, even
boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been listening to some of the argument about sending
ground troops and not sending ground troops,'' Gammons said. ``It's
getting to be like Monica Lewinsky. It goes on and on, and here I
am, disconnected, trying to paint and live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the bombing, there was more wonder than fatigue
when Gammons spoke of the lack of connection between the easy
routines of his life and the drama unfolding at the borders of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like in the movies,'' he said last month, after a
few days of watching television reports on the exodus of ethnic
Albanians. ``There they are leaving these places _ there was one
elderly lady carrying a child on her back, papoose style _ and here
I sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Gammons said, he started to ask himself whether he could
fairly judge the situation from so great a distance, in terms of
miles and personal experience. ``In my suburban mentality, yes, we
should help them,'' he said. ``A lot of us say, `Yes, go and bomb.'
But they're not bombing my house, my yard. We sit and watch it on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, if NATO believes that Milosevic is the problem,
as allied leaders are constantly saying, then they should go after
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got angry one day last week,'' said Gammons, who is a native
of Tennessee. ``I was watching television, and there was Milosevic
at a very nice table in a suit and tie. And I surmised that he had
had two lovely meals and a home to sleep in at night and has no one
shooting at him, while somebody else from Kosovo is out there, is
dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why _ and maybe this is the hillbilly redneck in me _ why
doesn't somebody go and shoot the bugger?''
</P>
<P>
   The same question occurs to Mrs. McCauley, who retired from IBM
and now, at 69, volunteers as a teacher's aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we can get out of this thing unless they get
him to sign something or do something, or do something to him,''
she said. ``The problem is, they don't trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been doggedly supportive of what the United States and
NATO are doing. Disabling the Yugoslav president, she said, is a
moral obligation for the United States, a mission as honorable as
the one her father carried out as an American soldier fighting Nazi
Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, she went to the theater to see ``Camelot'' and
found herself defending that position when two of her friends
argued that the United States has no business being part of a war
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel that we are always interfering in all wars,'' Mrs.
McCauley recalled. ``But I said to them all, `We don't want to be
embarrassed like after the Holocaust.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Theodosakia, there is nothing clear-cut anymore in
connection with Yugoslavia and certainly no heroes. To her, the
Serbs have become more sympathetic, the Kosovo Albanians more
complicated and the NATO campaign more cruel as the weeks of
bombing passed.
</P>
<P>
   An avid reader of The New York Times and The Washington Post,
she has veered sharply away from her initial confident support of
the allies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, she saw the ethnic Albanians as absolute underdogs.
Then she read about the Kosovo Liberation Army, the separatist
militia that has been fighting the Serbs for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of problems with this bombing operation,'' Mrs.
Theodosakia said. ``Sometimes I feel it's the right thing because I
feel sorry for these poor people, these refugees, because they had
to leave Kosovo. Then you hear stories that they were fighting for
independence and were very pushy.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, she saw the Serbs as absolute oppressors. Then, the
other night, she watched ``CNN World Report,'' which featured a
report by Serbian television on the bombing from the Serbian point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad I listened to these people,'' she said. ``They
are so bitter about the U.S. They were talking about their capital.
They have beautiful, magnificent buildings that they kept beautiful
and they are so afraid that they will all be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the Serbians, too. They are people. And
that's their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her reading and research, Mrs. Theodosakia, 57, who was
born in Puerto Rico, has come to trust more in her emotions on the
issue of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter turning point came when she saw that NATO did not pause
in its bombing last Sunday, Orthodox Easter. ``They didn't stop,
even though Clinton did that for the problem they had in Iraq,''
she said, referring to the debate within the administration in
December 1998 over whether to continue bombing Iraq during the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Theodosakia said she can not help but feel an affinity for
the Serbs because she, too, is an Orthodox Christian, while most
Kosovo Albanians are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't misunderstand me. I feel every religion should practice
what they believe in,'' she said. ``But this religion that the
Albanians practice _ we Americans have a lot of problems with these
people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   She also described herself as a political conservative with a
distrust of President Clinton that has only deepened as the bombing
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to judge the president, because I don't know
what's going through his mind,'' she said. ``But I don't trust him
anymore. I don't believe him. Does he do this because he cares
about the people in Kosovo, or for his own ego?
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Rwanda? What did he do about those problems? I was
listening to the radio _ I don't remember which program _ but they
were asking, `Is it because the Rwandans were black that we didn't
help them?' What's the difference? Are we going to help every
nation or are we are going to pick the ones we want to help? Why
these people?''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the Vietnam veteran, said he is just as disturbed by
reports of atrocities in Kosovo. But until the United States or its
interests are directly threatened, he added, American soldiers and
civilians should stay out.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard Friday morning that reservists might be called up,
the 58-year-old former Marine shed some of the courtly ambivalence
that he had shown in discussing the situation over the past six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good move,'' Clark said forcefully. ``I don't think
it's necessary.'' There is no threat to American interests in
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled a trip he made to visit his family in Panama, where
he was born, after the U.S. invasion there in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they hit strategic sites in Panama,'' he said.
``Yeah, strategic sites _ the neighborhood I grew up in. But that's
basically what goes on. Civilians get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, he added, news of a possible call-up upsets him so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we send our civilians in there and they get killed, then
people are going to say we've got to really go in there in force
and get engaged,'' Clark said. ``And then they are going to send in
ground troops, and if they start to die, sooner or later you've got
to send more and then more, and it could end up being another
Vietnam.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MORE THAN A CATCHY PHRASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He would have been The Great Jones or The Great Napier or The
Great Swenson. His name just happened to be Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   He was the greatest player in the history of his sport, perhaps
the single most innovative North American athlete since Babe Ruth.
He changed his game.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky displayed graceful creativity amidst the macho
muggers of professional hockey. He validated intuition and touch.
He found openings in defenses that nobody had ever found before.
</P>
<P>
   Even the goons of his business tended not to punish him, the
same way American Football League defensive tackles once protected
Joe Namath as their meal ticket.
</P>
<P>
   He was a skinny kid with big ears from Ontario. Because of him,
more than any other factor, the league could beam the Canadian
sport into virgin territory in Dallas and Miami and the lunar
rubble landscape of Phoenix, for goodness' sakes.
</P>
<P>
   He could see things behind him. He played catch with himself,
flicking the puck off the net, hypnotizing defenders. He carried
the puck behind the net, setting up there and making the rink even
larger for him. He whacked the puck off the sideboards, slipping
into holes nobody could imagine. He faked Russians right out of
their skates in Canada Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   He played 21 years, one in a renegade league, the rest in the
National Hockey League, and Friday he announced his retirement from
the New York Rangers, his last club, after the season finale
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He holds 61 league scoring records, and they came from something
more than endurance or power or mulish persistence. He smiled at a
tape of his career highlights Friday, the way he pranced around the
ice after Stanley Cup goals, milestone goals. He is studiously
modest, but not so modest that he could not enjoy the sight of
himself celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his goals. He was willowy when he started, at 6 feet
tall and 185 pounds, and now he is almost frail-looking in
comparison to the agile brutes who play this game.
</P>
<P>
   As an athlete, in terms of touch and feel, he was most
comparable to John McEnroe. However, McEnroe never had to take a
hipcheck from the defense (not that it wouldn't have been a bad
idea) whereas Gretzky played a sport in which strapping western
Canadians were instructed to beat the stuffing out of hipper-dipper
French Canadians and later the Europeans. The kid from Ontario
avoided the posse, and the sport thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing was, Gretzky did not measure up to a superstar
on the computer printouts. His first team _ and let's get serious,
he should go into the Hall of Fame in an Edmonton uniform _ was in
the vanguard of physical tests. Among the young Oilers of 1981,
Gretzky finished dead last in just about every measurable category
_ weights, speed, eyesight, reflexes. His teammates ragged on him,
and he set a record of 164 points that year, and he would surpass
that total seven different seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him abusing the Flyers,'' said Mike Richter, the
Rangers' goalie, who comes from Philadelphia. ``What impressed me
most was how often he played at the top of the game, his
resiliency. His tongue would be hanging out but he'd be tugging at
the coach's elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a few more gears than the average player,'' Richter
said. ``He could hold the puck longer than anybody I ever saw. He
had ridiculous endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also the Great Gretzky because he recognized his role. He
never bleated - as athletes do - that nobody understands the
terrible pressure he's under. He would come into town, his normal
pasty complexion appearing downright anemic, his minimal shoulders
slumped like Willie Loman's after a bad road trip, but he would be
available to the media and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   The league's best asset was the skinny guy with 99 on his back.
(If the league does not officially retire his number, every
equipment manager could forget to issue it, year after year.)
</P>
<P>
   Now he is going, and good for him. He's been a hockey player for
35 of his 38 years. He cannot carry this transitional team, and the
occasional punk was starting to take a shot at him. He would smile
wanly and say, ``nice hit'' but he had to wonder where Dave Semenko
was when he needed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to get out, while he was still in the Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar range, diminished but regal, before he became Willie
Mays, an aging genius stumbling over second base.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guidebook for the proper way for the great ones to
bow out. Babe Ruth virtually invented the home run with his lusty
swings, but finished up as a befuddled Boston Brave.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player, but his
mission was made easier by peers named Erving, Abdul-Jabbar, Bird
and Johnson. Gretzky said Friday that he regretted Jordan's
retirement _ because his kids loved watching Jordan play.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown had the best football retirement. Nine seasons. Led
the league in rushing. And out. Chris Evert quit tennis because she
loathed becoming a quarterfinalist.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky doesn't need money. What's the sense in having a
beautiful wife and three nice kids if your neck is in a cast?
</P>
<P>
   In life as in hockey, Wayne Gretzky could see the entire rink.
It was time to retire while he was still The Great One _ not
because of alliteration but because of excellence.

LEWIS AND HOLYFIELD OFFER DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THEIR DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, the two
participants in last month's controversial heavyweight championship
bout at Madison Square Garden, gave testimony in Manhattan on
Friday before the New York state Senate Committee on
Investigations. About the only thing the boxers could agree on was
that legislative reforms were needed to clean up the sport.
</P>
<P>
   They disagreed on the issue that sparked this hearing. Each
fighter said he thought he had won the March 13 bout, which was
ruled a draw after one judge scored the fight for Holyfield, one
had Lewis winning and one said it was even.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield appeared with his lawyer Jim Thomas before state Sen.
Roy Goodman's committee, which is looking into reforms in boxing.
Holyfield said Lewis did not do enough to win the fight. Regarding
the fifth round, when Lewis hurt him with a shot to the back of the
head, Holyfield said Lewis should have tried to finish him off.
Eugenia Williams, one of the bout's three judges, called the round
in Holyfield's favor, differing from the other two fight judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That great fifth round that Lennox had lasted 45 seconds,''
Holyfield said. ``In the fifth round, if I had been in trouble, he
would have been able to knock me out. The fact is that he did score
more and I will give him the fifth round.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman asked Holyfield if he was surprised Williams gave him
that round. ``No, it's a matter of opinion,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, whose testimony was presented on videotape, called
Williams ``clueless'' and said he thought he had clearly won the
fifth round and some other rounds that she scored for Holyfield.
Lewis said judges, in general, can be influenced by promoters and
sanctioning organizations, but that is difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can influence them by wearing the right type of jewelry
and clothes,'' Lewis said. ``They're definitely swayed by that sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Lewis was in favor of getting rid of the sanctioning
organizations, Holyfield was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy for me to say get rid of all the belts, but
the belts have allowed me to make $200 million,'' Holyfield said.
``And if I say all of a sudden, get rid of all the belts, then I'm
a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   A rematch between Holyfield and Lewis has been scheduled for
Nov. 6 or Nov. 13, either in Las Vegas or back at Madison Square
Garden. &QL;

 &HT;    Wilson does legend proud in homage to Miles Davis
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 15 minutes into a telephone conversation from
her Columbus, Ohio, hotel room, Cassandra Wilson allows that
something else has been diverting her attention.
</P>
<P>
   She's been watching ``Days of Wine and Roses,'' the 1962 movie
starring Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick. More importantly, she's become
a little entranced by the film's theme song, written by those
``Moon River'' guys, Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. ``It's not
like these big Hollywood movies these days with these huge
orchestral pieces,'' says Wilson, a few days into a tour that
brings her to Variety Playhouse on Thursday. ``It's one tune that
you hear throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   It reminds Wilson, 43, of a comment someone once made to her.
``They felt I was singing the same song, that every tune I write
seems to be the same song.'' This was meant as a compliment, of
course: that the singer, whose contralto is so often described as
``smoky'' or ``sultry,'' brings coherence to her material, which
springs up from a consistent core of feeling. It's part of what has
allowed the Jackson, Miss., native to venture so far afoot from the
sometimes narrow expectations of a traditional jazz career.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning variations on blues and folk themes, steeping them in a
strong feminine identity infused with Yoruba spiritualism and jazz
lore, Wilson has been widely acknowledged as the next important
jazz vocalist _ a 1990s inheritor of Billie Holiday and Betty
Carter. Yet, she's also reimagined what that can mean. On such
recent albums as ``Blue Light 'Til Dawn'' (1993) and ``New Moon
Daughter'' (1995), and especially the new ``Traveling Miles'' (all
on the Blue Note label) _ a tribute to the music of Miles Davis _
the singer explores an expanded vocabulary of band arrangements and
song material that is beginning to sound exclusively her own.
</P>
<P>
   And like Davis, the mythic jazz trumpeter and band leader who
died in 1991, Wilson is fearless about experimentation, about
crossing musical boundaries, about messing with the rules. Yet, as
jazz scholar Robert G. O'Meally observed recently in The New York
Times, there is an even more explicit connection:
</P>
<P>
   ``The debt Wilson owes Davis is apparent in her singing: the
weight, and yet the delicacy, of her voice, the breathy flight
above and behind the beat, the insistence on melody in
improvisation and, most strikingly, the art by subtraction, the
creation of spaces between bursts of sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Such creative kinship is a major part of what makes ``Traveling
Miles'' a rich and compelling project. The 12-track CD features
music from the chilled-out, acoustic Davis of the 1950s and '60s
but also prominent material from the '70s and '80s, when the
trumpeter's forays into a funk-driven electric sound sparked
controversy (and record sales). Except when the songs were already
borrowed (Cyndi Lauper's ``Time After Time,'' ``Someday My Prince
Will Come''), Wilson adds her own lyrics, and performs three songs
of her own. Though the vocalist insists she wasn't trying to claim
Davis' music, but rather honor it, she thoroughly succeeds in
personalizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Miles' music was too heavy for some people, Cassandra's
arrangements have a quality that draws you in,'' says Regina
Carter, the violinist who performs on ``Traveling Miles'' and was
on the bandstand when the concept was staged last year by Jazz at
Lincoln Center. ``When she arranges, she thinks more of a scenario
or a feeling. We were working on a piece, and she told me to think
of when I was a little girl, and my music box was broken and it
played the same thing over and over. After I heard the tune, it
totally made sense. When you hear it, it's very fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea came about two years ago when Wilson was invited by
Jazz at Lincoln Center to do a few concerts, following her
extensive tour with Wynton Marsalis and the JALC orchestra for the
slavery epic ``Blood on the Fields.'' But the project was clearly
something Wilson had been working up to her whole life. She
remembers being 6 or 7 years old and fishing out the Davis-Gil
Evans orchestral collaboration ``Sketches of Spain'' from her
father's record collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the contrast between that and the rest of the
music that was in his collection,'' she says. ``I realized even at
that age that there was some sort of hybridization that was
happening on that album. It intrigued me. It was very evocative.
It's very broad, very expansive, the kind of music you can walk
inside of and actually inhabit. And for a child, it's a great place
for a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, whose current tour with a sextet offers yet another spin
on the ``Traveling Miles'' songbook, invited a string quartet to
join her at Lincoln Center, but otherwise has avoided anything
remotely as orchestral as ``Sketches.'' Instead, she's intensely
focused on the way stringed instruments, especially guitars, can
interact, creating a sound at once rhythmic and lyrical.
Noticeably, horns are absent from the album, save the first and
last cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to be really preoccupied with guitar for some reason
these days,'' says Wilson, who grew up under the influence of her
jazz bassist father and the folk music of Joni Mitchell and Judy
Collins, ``and probably need to go see a therapist to understand
why. I had all kinds of visions about guitars, different kinds of
guitars and the textures they create.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, I was just remembering my first experience with a
guitar, when I was very small and I used to play with the part of
guitar between the bridge and the endpiece. The string overlaps,
and it make this `ting ting' sound. Actually, that's the harmonics.
I used to play with that. And you wonder why you end up at certain
places in music. There's something in your childhood.''

 &HT;    Pulitzer win third for women composers
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's Pulitzer Prize in music went to Melinda Wagner, born
in 1957 in Philadelphia. Her ``Concerto for Flute, Strings and
Percussion,'' commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra, was
premiered in Purchase, N.Y., in May 1998 by the Westchester (N.Y.)
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is the third woman to win the Pulitzer for music since
the award was instituted in 1943. The others were Ellen Taaffe
Zwilich of New York in 1983 and Shulamit Ran, an Israeli composer
teaching at the University of Chicago, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   This year's jury for music was made up of composers Gunther
Schuller, Leslie Bassett and Wayne Peterson, all previous Pulitzer
winners; jazz-based composer John Lewis, who has worked with the
Modern Jazz Quartet; and Tim Page, Pulitzer Prize-winning music
critic for The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Other finalists for the music prize were ``Persistent Memory''
by David Rakowski and ``Concerto for Orchestra'' by
composer-conductor Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, who teaches at the
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the American Composers Orchestra Web site
(americancomposers.org), Wagner talked about commissioning programs
such as that of the ACO for giving young composers a chance to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to make the next century possible for us,'' she
said. ``Before that, you had to have gotten your Pulitzer Prize to
get a major orchestra to play your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now she has. And she gets $5,000, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  IN A NUTSHELL: This is positively the last thing you'll read
here about the $150,000 ``Rhapsody'' piano, a decorator instrument
_ midnight blue glossy finish embedded with mother-of-pearl stars _
that Steinway &AMP; Sons has created to honor the centenary of George
Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Pianist Marcus Roberts played ``Rhapsody in Blue'' on it last
weekend with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The finest thumbnail description came from ASO artistic
administrator J. Frank Dans, who said: ``The perfect thing to play
on it would be `Le Tombeau de Liberace.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's a real piece, by camp composer Michael Daugherty,
who has written symphonies on such pop culture icons as Marilyn
Monroe and Elvis, as well as a mock homage to J. Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NEW BATON: Julian Shew has been named director of university
orchestras at Georgia State University, succeeding interim director
Gregory Pritchard, who has held the job for the past academic year.
A native of Nanking, China, Shew holds advanced degrees from the
University of Missouri at Kansas City and the University of Kansas.
He comes to Georgia State from Gustavus Adolphus College in
Minnesota. He has a long track record with student and youth
orchestras in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  GLASS SLIPPERS: Atlanta Ballet will field three couples in the
lead roles for its May 6-16 production of ``Cinderella'': Christine
Winkler and John Welker, who are set to tie the knot in real life
on May 28; Julianne Kepley and Wei Dongsheng; and Hye-Young Kim and
Joe Roesner. There will be two truly homely pairs of stepsisters:
Jim Stein and Rodolfo Patella, and Xiao Chen and Damien Highfield.

 &HT;    In its 30 years, the New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage Festival has
become one of the country's premier cultural events
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Thirty years ago, 300 musicians performed for a
handful of people in a park on the edge of the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington was there; so were Mahalia Jackson and Fats
Domino. Woody Allen took a break from filming ``Bananas'' to play
the clarinet with a Dixieland jazz band. Gospel music, propelled by
a piano plunked down in the grass, emanated from a small tent.
Local artists sold paintings and crafts, and 20 food booths served
regional specialties. Throughout the New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage
Festival's first five days, performers outnumbered the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Also there was Quint Davis, a 19-year-old Tulane University
student hired by festival creator George Wein to scout out bands.
Davis, who had been working in the Tulane Jazz Archives, knew more
about the local music scene than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''George's idea was to create a festival where New Orleans could
trumpet its birthright, its place in the cultural world and in
jazz,'' Davis said of Wein, a Bostonian who also founded the
Newport Jazz Festival. ''It would have night concerts and a
heritage fair. It had all the same elements the festival now has.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started,'' Davis remembers, ``there were a lot
of reasons people thought this thing was a hopeless failure. They
said, `You can't mix all these people _ old people, young people,
white people, black people, rich people, poor people.''' In 1970,
integration was still relatively new in the South; having black and
white musicians play for mixed audiences still seemed novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had a theory,'' Davis says, ``that if you show people
what each other eats and what each other dances to, it'd be all
right. We were right; it works.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work right away. The first few years were such a flop
that the festival's board of directors tried to persuade Wein to do
away with the outdoor Louisiana Heritage Fair and just stage the
Evening Concert Series, with big-name acts. Davis' father, a
successful architect, kept his son's venture afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Davis never finished college. Instead, he stayed with Wein and
the festival, turning it into one of the most respected and
well-known cultural events in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Jazz &AMP; Heritage Festival, called Jazz Fest for
short, will be celebrated for the 30th time beginning Friday. While
it retains the same elements as that first year, it has become a
very different event.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 musicians, artists and food vendors will descend on
the sprawling Fair Grounds Race Track, home of the gathering since
the early 1970s. Bands will play on 12 stages for seven days over
two weekends; 74 vendors will sell food. And if the weather is
good, attendance could total 500,000 before the festival ends May
2.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its size, the original spirit of this ``indigenous
self-celebration by a culture'' remains. Unlike other festivals,
where musicians, artists and food vendors are mostly out-of-towners
who travel around the country, Jazz Fest is primarily local.
Performers and vendors are chosen to reflect some aspect of New
Orleans or Louisiana culture, as are the folks who demonstrate such
traditional Cajun skills as boat-building and accordion-making.
</P>
<P>
   And although the festival always features big-name, out-of-town
bands _ this year's include Widespread Panic and Santana _ the vast
majority are New Orleans regulars. While Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish
entertain the masses May 1 on the largest stage, local heroes
Kermit Ruffins &AMP; the Barbecue Swingers will play classic jazz on a
smaller stage to a crowd more reminiscent of earlier festivals.
Other hometown favorites that day will include Nathan &AMP; the Zydeco
Cha-Chas, Ellis Marsalis and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.
</P>
<P>
   Getting `pre-thrilled'
</P>
<P>
   Although crowds wouldn't come if the music and the food weren't
world class, what makes Jazz Fest special is harder to describe.
Davis recalls one year when tornadoes knocked down many of the
tents and the festival was closed for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we were cleaning up, people started showing up,
festivalgoers, to rebuild,'' he said. ``That's something you never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   While some critics charge that Jazz Fest has gotten too large
and that corporate sponsorship has ruined the grass-roots feel of
the early days, Davis brushes such talk aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate sponsorship is not a problem for us,'' he said.
``It's a form of security. The fact that we have a Sprint stage
allows us to have a great communications system we could never
afford, but they don't put singing operators onstage. They don't
interfere with the fest's integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit event costs $1 million a day to put on, and that
kind of price tag requires not only corporate sponsors, but also,
at least backstage, a corporate attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a homemade, hand-built festival with a country fair
ambience,'' Davis said. ``But underneath it's complex and highly
polished.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his favorite moment during the last 29
festivals, Davis couldn't name one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exciting moments, the thrilling moments, the memorable
moments are the ones that haven't come yet,'' he said. Thinking of
some of the acts he's most excited to see this year _ Dr. John, Ray
Charles and Fats Domino together for the first time; Fred Hammond
and Radical for Christ in the Gospel Tent; Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish on
one of the big stages _ he said simply, ``I get pre-thrilled.''
Davis is so devoted to music that he zooms around the fairgrounds
in a personalized golf cart, making it his mission to see every
band, at least for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many local musicians that Quint isn't on a
first-name basis with,'' said George Porter Jr., bass player for
the funky Meters and for Runnin' Pardners. ``I can't remember when
he wasn't a part of our lives.''

 &HT;    THE BEST OF SPOLETO
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spoleto Festival USA, which runs May 28-June 13 in Charleston,
S.C., functions like a shopping mart for arts lovers. This year's
opera and theater offerings look particularly strong, while the
literary series is conspicuously absent. As always, the chamber and
new-music series are well worth a listen. Our guide to some of the
best options (tickets, 843-723-0402; brochures, 843-722-2764):
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Il Trittico.'' Director Nigel Redden won't even say how much
the fest is spending on this lavish triple bill of Puccini
one-acts. Count on about 3 1/2 hours of costume-drama overload and
gorgeous singing. May 28 and 31; June 5 and 11. $15-$75. Gaillard
Municipal Auditorium,
</P>
<P>
   77 Calhoun St.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC THEATER
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick.'' The performance artist
Laurie Anderson assumes a new persona: talking book. For her new
visual and aural meditation on the Melville classic, she'll use an
ensemble of musicians instead of the usual symphony of one. June
3-4. $10-$45. Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, 77 Calhoun St.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mamba's Daughters.'' With some 16 cast members, including
the mesmeric Heather Gillespie in the central role, this 1939 work
is the sort of old-fashioned melodrama that no one does anymore.
Set in Charleston and the surrounding islands, it's got big-voiced
Gullah spirituals and a heart-breaking Jerome Kern chestnut. May
27-31; June 2-6; June 8-13. $35. Dock Street Theatre, 133 Church
St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Kwaidan.'' After its premiere last year at Atlanta's Center
for Puppetry Arts, Journal-Constitution theater critic Dan Hulbert
called this rendering of three Japanese ghost tales ``stage magic
at its most sublime.'' Directed by New York artist Ping Chong. June
4-8, 10-13. $30. Emmett Robinson Theatre, Albert Simons Center,
College of Charleston, 54 St. Philip St.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Miami City Ballet. Dancing Balanchine classics and resident
choreographer Jimmy Gamonet De Los Heros' swingy ``The Big Band
SUPERMEGA-
</P>
<P>
   TROID,'' this impeccably trained company looks especially strong
these days. May 29-30. $15-$60. Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, 77
Calhoun St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quasar Companhia de Danca. This anatomically powerful
contemporary Brazilian company uses humor and body sculpture to
evoke lines that are as erotic as the tribal tattoos painted on
their chests. The kind of choreography that R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe
might dream up. May 29-31. $25. Garden Theatre, 371 King St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ron Brown/Evidence. Combining demanding physicality with
loosey-goosey technique, Brown is leading the pack of the younger
generation of African-American choreographers. A youthful, highly
energetic ensemble. June 10-13. $25. Garden Theatre, 371 King St.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sonny Rollins. Always all over the place, the great tenor sax
player remains consistently in the groove, with a style that's as
well clipped as his salt-and-pepper beard. June 12. $10-$40. North
Charleston Coliseum, 5001 Coliseum Drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Denise Jannah. Critics, particularly the one who produced this
vocalist's first album, have made a big fuss over Jannah's
classical sensibilities _ comparing her to Sarah, Ella and Carmen
McRae. It's much too early for such lavish praise, but she's
awfully nice to come home to. May 29. $25. The Cistern, College of
Charleston, 66 George St.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frank Emilio Flynn. Whether playing solo or with his
seven-piece Havana combo, the septuagenarian Cuban pianist never
loses his playful touch. Rarely heard in the States, he'll play
from Cuban composer Ernesto Lecuona's eponymous, Afro-Cuban bag of
tricks. June 4 at East Beach Conference Center, Kiawah Island
Resort; June 5 at the Cistern, 66 George St.. $25 each.

 &HT;    At century's end, furniture styles take glance back
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ A new century, like a new year, presents a
new start, and if you're thinking of redecorating your home,
furniture designers say to think clean, casual and curvy.
</P>
<P>
   Clean as in the simple lines of contemporary. Casual as in a
less fussy French. And curvy as in 1920s, '30s and '40s modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we close the book on this century and head into a new
millennium, there's going to be a lot of looking back to the past
for inspiration for the future. The important styles we thought had
been put to bed have been brought back to life as a punctuation
mark on the century,'' interior and furniture designer Jena Hall
said during Thursday's opening of the world's largest furniture
market.
</P>
<P>
   The 90th International Home Furnishings Market is a weeklong
wholesale preview of what should appear in stores by fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, along with designers Vladimir Kagan and Bob Mackie, says
the new emphasis will be on:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  French elegance that's less ornate and more casual.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Asian themes that are clean and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A nostalgic revival of art moderne's curvy shapes and sleek
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things we're seeing is what we're calling
the `French Evolution,' like a casual cottage look turning very
romantic and elegant,'' said Mark McMenamin, an editor for the
trade journal Home Accents Today. ``At the other end, formal French
styles like Louis XV are turning softer.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Mary Bairstow Designs, a high-end manufacturer of
French furnishings, is introducing a line of hand-painted tables
and chairs called ``Colors of Provence,'' available exclusively
over the Internet. By selling directly to consumers, the company
eliminates the middle-man retailer, which typically doubles or
triples the wholesale price. The company's 18th-century
reproduction chairs are hand-painted in one of 10 finishes and
accented with a floral motif by two French artists in Atlanta. The
chairs are priced at $250 and the round pedestal table at $750.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-priced furnishings also target consumers aiming to mix new
pieces with other furnishings for an eclectic look, as the
Europeans blend traditional and contemporary. ``That way you get
the casualness everyone wants with a little elegance thrown in,''
Bairstow said.
</P>
<P>
   The same approach is making Asian-inspired furnishings,
headlining the past several markets, soar at this venue.
</P>
<P>
   What's different at this market is that manufacturers have
scaled down pieces to create cleaner, simpler lines, an Asian
minimalism that emphasizes ``less is more.'' High-lacquered
finishes and ornate Chinese chinoiserie will always be popular
among traditional high-end consumers, but modern and casual have
become the driving force, McMenamin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fabulous thing is you don't have to have all Chinese.
Oriental is so different that you can change the look of any room
by simply adding one or two pieces, just as accents,'' said Paige
Smith of PierceMartin, an Atlanta manufacturer of wicker, rattan
and iron.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaner, simpler lines also are returning in styles such as art
moderne _ the retro influence as designers close the books on a
century of design. Designer Larry Laslo has expanded his Moderne
Collection for Bexley Heath that recalls late-'40s France. And
Raphael Zenie has created the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Collection for
Classic Leather, which draws on the simple but glamorous
furnishings of Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retro is the most beautiful, modern things we've done in the
past,'' said Mackie, known for clothing Cher and Carol Burnett and
now designing furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, like MGM, retro roars at High Point.
</P>
<P>
   NEW CENTURY COLORS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gray becomes the neutral in home decor, from pearl gray to
gunmetal, especially in paints.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Green, reflecting the gardening motif, shows up on fabrics in
shades of sage, spruce, kiwi and lime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Honey-toned, weathered or crackled finishes remain popular in
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Deep, rich earth tones, such as burnished browns and paprika,
enrich leather upholstery.

 &HT;    A priest celebrates 50 years in the pulpit _ and nearly as many
in league with the law
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can call the Rev. R. Donald Kiernan ``monsignor,''
the honorary title awarded by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Atlanta for special service. You can call him ``captain,'' the rank
he holds with the Georgia State Patrol. You can call him
``colonel,'' his rank in the DeKalb County (Ga.) police department.
Or, you can call him ``doctor'' for the honorary criminal justice
degree he received from Georgia State University last year.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, Kiernan will celebrate 50 years as a Roman Catholic
priest and 50 years as a Georgian. Both Kiernan's fellow priests
and his fellow police officers are looking forward to the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a hell of a party,'' says Lt. Ric Clark of
DeKalb County's north police precinct. There will also be a Mass at
7 p.m. at the 3,300-family All Saints Catholic Church in Dunwoody
(Ga.), where Kiernan is pastor.
</P>
<P>
   He was ordained in Boston for the Diocese of Savannah (Ga.)_
which then covered all of Georgia _ in 1949. After half a century
in Georgia, he still maintains his Massachusetts accent.
</P>
<P>
   His record in law enforcement rivals his record in the church:
He was a founder of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police and
the organization's director and chaplain, and has served as
chaplain of the International Association of Chiefs of Police,
Georgia State Patrol, DeKalb County police department, Georgia
Bureau of Investigation, Atlanta office of the U.S. Treasury's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Metropol, a
cooperative agency of local police and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In the archdiocese, he has pastored churches in Savannah,
LaGrange (Ga.) and throughout North Georgia, was editor of The
Georgia Bulletin archdiocesan newspaper for 13 years, and now
serves as a member of the marriage tribunal, considering
applications for annulment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most popular priests in the whole
archdiocese,'' says Archbishop John F. Donoghue. ``He's very
well-respected by priests and laity alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan won't give his age, but the archbishop lets slip that he
is the oldest active priest in the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with law enforcement began in the early 1950s
with a call to Atlanta police about a prowler in the basement of
Atlanta's Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, where he was
assistant pastor. Two young officers, M.C. Faulkner and A.L. Posey
_ Kiernan remembers their names immediately _ responded and asked
the equally young priest to ride along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure 'nuff, the next night they came around and asked me
again,'' says Kiernan. And again, and again.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan met sergeants, lieutenants and the then-Atlanta police
chief, the late Herbert Jenkins, who became a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   When assigned to a church in Cedartown, Kiernan realized there
was no state police academy to train officers in small towns. He
set up training for North Georgia officers, with help from Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, while pastor of St. Michael's Church in Gainesville, he
helped found the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police because he
saw a need for heads of law enforcement agencies to be able to work
together and learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
   He's been a member of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police since the 1950s, riding to meetings held in the United
States because he will not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gene Moss, commander of DeKalb County's north police
precinct, drove Kiernan to a meeting in Florida in 1997. ``There
were 16,000 people,'' says Moss. ``I may be exaggerating some, but
I really believe he knew 15,000 of them by first name. I have never
seen anybody know so many police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Police Chief Bobby Moody met Kiernan shortly after he
became police chief in Covington in 1978 when he was 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally took me by the hand at a Metropol meeting, the
first one my wife and I went to, and introduced us to everybody,''
says Moody. ``For me, it was a bit of culture shock as a little
country boy from Covington to meet chiefs from Atlanta and Fulton
County.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Baptist, Moody said he also experienced a bit of culture
shock watching Kiernan play host and bartender in the hotel's
hospitality suite. ``I was mesmerized by this little priest running
around taking care of people,'' says Moody.
</P>
<P>
   Moody says he feels very close to Kiernan. ``I seek out the
monsignor when I need somebody I can just talk to,'' he says. ``We
play golf together. He's not the best golfer in the world and wants
to use an eraser on the score card, but as far as I'm concerned,
the monsignor gets any score he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan's reputation extends even to officers who don't know him
personally. He tells this story on himself:
</P>
<P>
   Driving to Gainesville one day, Kiernan was pulled over by a
Gwinnett County deputy who began, typically, ``Do you know how fast
you were going?''
</P>
<P>
   ``83,'' said Kiernan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't clock you that fast,'' said the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the blue light and slowed down,'' said the monsignor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure are an honest man,'' said the deputy. ``What are
those antennas on your car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chaplain for the Georgia State Patrol,'' said the
monsignor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you're the masseur, aren't you?'' said the deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan got off with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kiernan clearly enjoys his relationship with police
officers, some of his duties with them are deadly serious. He
accompanies officials to inform family members of deaths, performs
funerals for officers who are not affiliated with a church, and
counsels police struggling with family and spiritual concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan expresses great admiration for police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any job in the world where you have to wear a
bulletproof vest to work should be better compensated,'' he says.
``In business today, you find dog-eat-dog. What attracts me to them
is they care for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kiernan says he has no desire to be an amateur investigator
himself, in the tradition of fictional priest-detectives such as
Andrew Greeley's Father Blackie Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a parish and I'm busy,'' he says. ``I don't know how
Father Ryan has the time.''

   An Unexpected Detour Into the Balkan War &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The errant phone calls are beginning to tail off, but he still
gets dozens a day, and Steve Penisten wonders what his next phone
bill will look like.
</P>
<P>
   Penisten owns Helco Manufacturing, a small company in Sioux
Falls, S.D., that makes fancy stainless-steel barbecue tools and
sells them mainly to distributors and to companies that want their
logos engraved on the handles.
</P>
<P>
   Though he rarely deals directly with the public, he has an
easy-to-remember toll-free number, (800) USA-CHEF, and that's where
the trouble started.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kosovo refugee crisis erupted, a toll-free line was
widely publicized that the public could call to contribute to
relief efforts: (800) USAID-RELIEF. But many people dial (800)
USA-AIDE-RELIEF by mistake, which works out to (800) 872-2433 _
Helco's number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell right away when a caller is confused,'' said
Penisten, who said Kosovo-related calls still far outnumber calls
from his customers and often fill his voice mailbox to overflowing
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off the business disruptions, saying they were
trivial compared with the refugees' hardships and the perils for
American military personnel in the Balkans. He said he explains the
mix-up to callers and offers to mail catalogs to any who show
interest in his products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might make a sale or two; you never know,'' he said. ``After
all, I am paying for the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick J. Lyons &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Applied Whimsy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies have long had a taste for fanciful names
like General Magic and U.S. Robotics that perhaps say more about
the founders' teen-age reading habits than about their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   An Austin, Texas, company, still in the venture capital stage
but presumably aspiring to an eventual public offering, would seem
to be in that category with its chosen name: Applied Science
Fiction. It develops digital image technology and licenses it to
camera and scanner makers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, the name came from an offhand remark: One of
the founding engineers, trying to summarize for an early investor
what the company does, pointed to its chief scientist, Albert D.
Edgar, and said, ``He thinks of the science fiction, and we try to
apply it,'' according to Mary E. Browning, the company's director
of marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   From her description, Edgar might be a science-fiction scientist
himself, from the eyeglasses held together with duct tape to the
homemade ink he whips up for his inkjet printer. (On weekends he
photographs weddings.)
</P>
<P>
   Do investors find such a nonserious name at all off-putting?
``Maybe 10 years ago they might have,'' Ms. Browning said. ``But
now? When there's a company called Yahoo?''

 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Ga. _ Dr. Robert E. Jennings took care of folks in
this one-red-light South Georgia town for 39 years, delivering
their babies, sewing up their chain-saw wounds and even treating
the occasional snakebit dog.
</P>
<P>
   When his patients needed help after 5 p.m., they'd call him at
home. Or drop by.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't go to the emergency room,'' says his daughter
Felicia Alexander. ``They'd just knock on the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   For years the tall, broad-shouldered physician and his family
lived in a yellow-brick ranch house across the street from the
hospital, so finding the doctor was easy. Finding a replacement
won't be.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings died last fall at age 65, leaving the 1,200 residents
of Arlington in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a piece of this hospital is just broke off,'' says
Vivian Whitaker, director of nurses at Calhoun Memorial Hospital,
where Jennings was not only chief of staff but half the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town like to have folded,'' says David Simpson, who runs
the Arlington Rexall Pharmacy. ``Everything that went on in this
town, he was a part of. It wasn't just medicine. He was a
counselor, a physician, a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, patients and friends from throughout the farming country
of Calhoun, Early, Baker, Clay and Randolph counties will gather in
Arlington to pay tribute to the bearish doctor with the giant-size
heart. During the proceedings, the city will officially rename a
street and a clinic in his honor. Henceforward, Calhoun Memorial
Hospital's official address will be 209 R.E. Jennings Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to remember him when they ride down that street
in front of the hospital,'' says Peggy Pierce, Calhoun Memorial's
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kelly may remember Jennings every time he takes a breath. The
owner of Kelly Construction was experiencing an allergic reaction
to penicillin, and rapidly sinking into anaphylactic shock, when a
quick-thinking Jennings administered the antidote. ``He was just
about dead,'' says Kelly's wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to the rescue
</P>
<P>
   The town itself was in a similar medical emergency when Jennings
arrived in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   There was no doctor in Arlington. The hospital had closed. For
Arlington's 1,400 souls, the nearest physicians were nine miles
away in Edison and 20 miles the other way in Blakely.
</P>
<P>
   A state-funded scholarship brought Jennings, a native of
Atlanta, and Dr. Homer L. Lassiter to the rescue. As a condition of
the scholarship, after graduating from the Medical College of
Georgia, Jennings, then 26, and Lassiter, 25, were obliged to
practice in an underserved Georgia community of 5,000 or fewer
people.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Arlington were overjoyed at the doctors'
arrival, and suspicious only of their youth. Arlington was a small
town where the peanut fields started just a few blocks from the
depot, and a small-town doctor has to handle every illness or
catastrophe that comes through the door _ which suited Jennings and
former partner Lassiter fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved all kinds of lives,'' says pharmacist Simpson,
``especially heart attack victims that wouldn't have made it to
Albany.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings would see between 28 and 50 patients a day and was on
call every other night. As his practice grew, so did his family. He
and wife Pauline had four children; they moved from the house
across the street from the hospital to one farther away, with a
pool and a pond. And Jennings joined City Council and even served
as mayor for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the same as being a doctor,'' says Pauline of his
public service. ``They called on him for any little problem: My
water doesn't have pressure; there's a dog barking next door to me;
somebody's cow got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional stress came when Jennings and Lassiter, two very
different personality types, split up their practice in 1981. Two
years later, Robert and Pauline Jennings were divorced. A smoker
and a non-exerciser, Jennings also suffered the first of two heart
attacks around the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun Memorial nurse Susie Peterson accompanied Jennings
during his ambulance ride to Albany after his second heart attack,
praying all along that she wouldn't accidentally kill Arlington's
beloved doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything went wrong, I think I would have shot myself,''
Peterson says. ``I wouldn't have come back to this town, that's for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing you could do'
</P>
<P>
   Jennings survived. In 1993, he married Delores Fallin and bought
Clyde, a baby African Gray parrot, whom he fed through a syringe.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings and Clyde became inseparable, says Delores, and every
morning the two shared a cup of coffee. When the doctor napped on
the sofa after lunch, Clyde would nap on his shoulder, his head
under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jenningses went out to dinner on Saturday, Sept. 19, and
returned that evening to be greeted, as usual, by their two
Rottweilers and by Clyde. In the early morning hours, the time when
Jennings had risen so often to treat emergencies or scrub for labor
and delivery, he died. Dr. David Wetherby of nearby Fort Gaines
says the cause was probably a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, the nursing staff assembled at the hospital,
not knowing why, except to mourn. ``We all came in crying, thinking
that if we could be together, it would go away,'' says Pierce, the
hospital CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kocherla of Albany has been taking care of Jennings'
patients. Lassiter moved to Albany last year, leaving Arlington
without a resident M.D.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings delivered Vivian Temple's daughter Wilma in 1963 and
her granddaughter April in 1980. And Temple, as she stood outside
the Arlington pharmacy talking about her favorite doctor, said
she's all for naming the street after him. ``They need to honor him
some way, and that would be a way that everyone could see. But
there's no kind of expression, no kind of nothing you could do,
that could ever match Dr. Jennings.''

 &HT;    Updated 1939 play of African-American women, from `Porgy and
Bess' team, gets its Charleston premiere
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, an experimental downtown director gave a
gangly, unknown British actress a pair of 6-inch platform shoes and
cast her as the tragic heroine of ``Mamba's Daughters,'' a play
created for legendary Broadway belter Ethel Waters by the
Charleston, S.C., couple who wrote ``Porgy.''
</P>
<P>
   And to nearly everyone's surprise, the updated version of the
1939 play by DuBose Heyward and his wife, Dorothy, was everything
the original Broadway production was not.
</P>
<P>
   It got rave reviews in The New York Times and The New Yorker. It
won two prestigious Obies, the off-Broadway equivalent of the Tony,
for director David Herskovits and star Heather Gillespie. And now,
after a circuitous, 60-year journey, ``Mamba's Daughters'' is
coming to Charleston for the first time, as the centerpiece
theatrical event of Spoleto Festival USA, beginning May 27 at the
historic Dock Street Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   With a stellar lineup of opera, dance, music and theater, this
year's $5.5 million festival looks particularly exciting. A magnet
for music lovers of every stripe, Spoleto is boasting a costly,
original production of Puccini's three-part opera ``Il Trittico''
and the U.S. premiere of Kurt Weill's opera ``Die Burgschaft.''
Nigel Redden, the festival's general director, says that ticket
sales are up 50 percent over 1998. And some offerings _ including
the one-man show ``Ricky Jay and His 52 Assistants,'' directed by
David Mamet, and a 70th birthday tribute to chamber music
impresario Charles Wads-
</P>
<P>
   worth _ have already sold out.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the home-grown ``Mamba's Daughters'' _ a tragic tale of
three generations of African-American women who are nearly engulfed
by racism and their own internal conflicts _ that seems to have all
of Charleston on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because DuBose Heyward and Catfish Row are to Charleston
what Margaret Mitchell and Tara are to Atlanta. Just down the
street from the Dock Street, at 76 Church St., is the home where
Heyward's autobiographical 1929 novel, ``Mamba's Daughters,'' on
which the play was based, was set. A plaque outside identifies it
as the DuBose Heyward House. And after a long and storied
theatrical career, including an affiliation with the Dock Street,
the Heywards were buried at nearby St. Philip's Episcopal Church _
he in 1940, she in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the big immortals in South Carolina, because
`Porgy and Bess' really took Charleston around the world,'' says
Charleston literary historian Harlan Greene, remembering the
historic moment in 1970 when a ``60 Minutes'' crew turned up to
tape the local premiere of ``Porgy and Bess,'' the Gershwin opera
based on the play. ``He's up there with the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mamba's Daughters'' _ which pivots on the central
character, Hagar; her mother, Mamba; and her daughter, Lissa _
Herskovits has found a play that illumines the human condition, a
story that in some ways seems more alive today than when it was
written.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that DuBose Heyward was not Eugene O'Neill,''
says Herskovits, artistic director of New York's Target Margin
Theater, which staged ``Mamba's'' revival last year as part of an
ongoing mission to present lost masterpieces. ``But I think it's
safe to say that his and his wife's work and its impact extend far
beyond `Porgy and Bess.' I hope we can bring what is interesting
and rich about that work back to the people. I think the people
need to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   That Heyward was a white man writing about a black man's culture
has been the subject of some debate. Yet it is his particular sort
of empathy that has endeared him to certain members of the black
intelligentsia _ from the poet Langston Hughes to Waters to
Gillespie, who plays Hagar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, many people are eager to dismiss the contributions of a
person if he is writing about materials that are not readily of his
culture,'' says Gillespie, a fine-boned 32-year-old who speaks in a
lovely British accent that dances with the singsong rhythms of her
Jamaican ancestry. ``But I think you lose the point in taking up
these arguments. We love to pontificate on the question of race,
and really it's not a question of racism. It's a play about love,
or the scarcity of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters was already an established blues singer when she met the
Heywards at a ``Porgy'' cast party in 1935. As legend has it,
during a chance encounter she told Dorothy Heyward that she had
been gripped by the novel, a sort of upstairs-downstairs account of
a progressive, well-to-do white family and their servants. Right
then and there, the playwright declared to turn the novel into a
dramatic vehicle for Waters, focusing on Hagar.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 1939 would be a watershed moment for blacks in
the entertainment industry.

<P>
   NEW YORK: the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American to win an
Oscar, for ``Gone With the Wind.'' Marian Anderson was refused
entry to Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the
American Revolution, an event that began the slow thaw of
segregation. And though ``Mamba's Daughters'' failed to achieve
mainstream success, it became legendary in black circles _ not only
as Waters' first dramatic part, but as one of the first Broadway
productions to afford numerous major parts to a mostly black cast.
Waters said that Hagar represented ``all Negro women lost and
lonely in the white man's antagonistic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Waters' mantle was a source of both terror and joy for
Gillespie, who arrived in New York only four years ago and is much
better versed in the ways of London than the Lowcountry. But her
rewards came quick and fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man came up, and he had tears in his eyes,'' says
Gillespie, ``and I remember towering above him. And he said, `Ethel
Waters was my friend, and I know she was here tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-8, Gillespie bears a much stronger resemblance to
supermodel Naomi Campbell than she does the ample-bodied Waters,
who took on the role at 38 and was known in her twilight years for
her animated rendering of ``His Eye Is on the Sparrow'' on the
broadcasts of televangelist Billy Graham. After Herskovits and his
costume designer dressed Gillespie in the thick-soled platform
shoes that became emblematic of her outsize performance, Times
critic Peter Marks wrote that she was ``in every sense the play's
walking monument.''
</P>
<P>
   The role was as demanding physically as it was emotionally,
Gillespie says. After opening night, ``I crawled into my bed
convinced I would die and not be able to do the play the next day.
I had given my blood and my bone. And for the first time in my
professional career, I was at the point where I wondered if I had
given too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A girlfriend rang me up in the morning, and I couldn't hear a
word she was saying. She was screaming down the phone: `Times!
Times! Times! Review!' And then she said little excerpts of it over
the phone, and I said, `Could you just' _ this is so British _
`could you just hold the phone for a moment?' And I put down the
phone and I bawled my eyes out. I just cried, raged, because it was
the most painful thing I ever had to give.''
</P>
<P>
   When Redden saw the play, he was so blown away that he decided
to stage it at Spoleto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas Ethel Waters is larger than life, in some ways Heather
Gillespie seems longer than life,'' says Redden. ``She's a tall
woman, and she seems to be walking on a tightrope throughout the
performance. She seems more in touch with life's dilemmas than any
other actress I can imagine doing that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Herskovits: ``I think Heather is a genius. I really did
have the feeling of having discovered this person before anybody
else did. She was pretty much fresh off the boat from England, and
sure enough, she went out and won an Obie for the part.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mamba's,'' which runs the gamut musically from authentic
Gullah spirituals to modern jazz added by Herskovits, Gillespie
sings the Jerome Kern ballad ``Lonesome Walls'' in a voice that is
more honey than husk. As Hagar, she is exiled to a sea island
plantation for committing a petty crime. Mamba, her mother, is left
to raise Hagar's daughter, Lissa. Alternating between innocence and
rage, Hagar is the emotional core of the drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to slow right down for Hagar, because I'm pretty
mercurial,'' says Gillespie, digging into spicy chicken, collards
and sweet potatoes at Jezebel, a Southern restaurant in the heart
of New York's theater district. ``I sliver all about the place, and
I operate on 10 planes of existence at the same time, and I live in
a multiple reality.'' Indeed, in a two-hour conversation, she
regales a listener with stories from enough past lives to do
Shirley MacLaine proud, and says it is that accumulated experience
that has enabled her to evoke parts as disparate as Josephine Baker
and the nurse in Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gillespie admits to being absolutely mortified at the
thought of following in Waters' footsteps. ``I wanted to be a jazz
singer, and I sang jazz to get my Equity card (in London). But my
confidence in my singing is more in my interpretation than having
this amazing voice that can go up and down the scale and 'round the
house and through the back door and lie down in your bed,'' she
says, in one of her endlessly cascading, endlessly philosophical,
spoken riffs. ``I tell a story and that is my gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Herskovits says he'd like to see the play go full circle _ back
to Broadway, where it started 60 years ago. ``That's the funny
thing. We are a little experimental theater in downtown New York,
and we have brought back this play, which is a completely
mainstream drama with music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'd love to see it go to other places. I'd love to
see it go to Atlanta. I'd love to see it done everywhere,
especially in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   With 16 performances spread out over Spoleto's 18-day run,
``Mamba's Daughters'' is likely to be welcomed home to Charleston
like an old family member _ and in the end, the catharsis may
outjump the catfish.

BRENTWOOD, N.Y.: like wildfire.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free the Children hopes to raise enough money over the next two
years to build 100 schools overseas, one-room buildings costing
$2,000 each. The group has spent $200,000 to build and staff a more
ambitious school and rehabilitation center in India, where more
than 100 former child laborers each year learn a trade.
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of Free the Children, Craig has visited Asia,
Africa and Latin America and has met with Nelson Mandela, Mother
Teresa, the Dalai Lama and the Pope. When he shows schoolchildren
slides from those trips, many are shocked to discover that child
labor exists, and many come away vowing to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brentwood library, Craig showed slides of Philippine
children scavenging through garbage piles to find things to sell,
and an 8-year-old girl in India whose job was dismantling a pile of
used syringes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her, isn't she worried about getting AIDS from the
needles?'' Craig told the students. ``She gave me a blank stare.
She didn't even know what AIDS is.''
</P>
<P>
   When the slide show was over, one student, Malcolm Moore, stood
up and challenged Craig. ``How come you don't get involved in
fighting racism?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   After hesitating a few seconds, Craig responded that there are
many issues out there, and that he has chosen to focus on child
labor. He told Malcolm that if racism was his issue, then he should
stand up against it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, addressing the class, Craig said, ``If racism is important
to you, please stand up with Malcolm.'' Almost all the students
stood up.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do,'' Craig continued, ``is have the courage
to ask people to stand with you.''

CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR DUCKED AID ISSUE BY DEFERRING TO MEDIATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after Gov. Gray Davis asked a federal court
to mediate a dispute over a ballot measure that would end
government services to illegal immigrants and their children, some
advocates for immigrants expressed their dismay, contending that
the governor had taken the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the governor's decision,'' Genethia
Hayes, executive director of the Greater Los Angeles Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and a Davis supporter, said Friday.
``This is a way for him not to really have to make a tough
decision, and making tough decisions is why we worked so hard to
get him elected.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Davis announced that he was asking a federal
appeals court to mediate the five-year-old legal fight over the
ballot measure, Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, one of the most divisive ballot initiatives in the
state's history, passed by nearly 60 percent of the vote in 1994,
although 77 percent of Hispanic voters and more than 50 percent of
blacks voted against it. Opponents of the measure sued almost as
soon as the polls closed, and it has been tied up in court ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, opponents had a victory of sorts when a federal court
ruled much of the proposition unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Davis faced a deadline next month over whether to appeal that
decision or drop the matter entirely. Proponents of the proposition
argued that he was compelled by his job as governor to seek the
appeal of a measure approved by voters, while opponents _ many of
whom supported Davis in his quest for the governor's office _ urged
him to let the proposition die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he rushed to the middle, searching for a compromise, by
asking the appeals court to try to find a solution acceptable to
both sides, an outcome considered unlikely by many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was in a political bind,'' said Sharon Browne, a
lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which represents the
authors and sponsors of the initiative. ``You had on the one side
Latino groups who really wanted him to drop the appeal, and on the
other side proponents and more than five million voters who had
voted for 187. This is a way he's trying to duck the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the first Democratic governor in California in 16 years,
opposed Proposition 187 when he was lieutenant governor under Gov.
Pete Wilson. Davis said he thought the measure was
unconstitutional, and in his own campaign for the top job, in which
he received overwhelming support from minorities, he pledged to end
divisive ``wedge issue'' politics.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, shortly after Davis announced his plans to seek
mediation instead of dismissal of the appeal, Lt. Gov. Cruz M.
Bustamante said he, too, was disappointed by the governor's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think Proposition 187 is morally or legally
defensible,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis did receive some words of encouragement. Representative
Xavier Becerra, a Democrat from Los Angeles and a plaintiff in one
of the lawsuits against the proposition, had urged Davis to dismiss
the appeal. But he said he recognized the dueling priorities Davis
faced as the governor of all Californians and ``not just those who
voted for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Becerra said he believed that mediation was a ``legitimate step
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to avoid this from becoming a political
decision, or from being viewed as a political decision,'' Becerra
said. ``The problem is, whichever way he cuts it, it's going to
look like a political decision to the people who lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which
represents several groups and individuals seeking to overturn the
proposition, issued a statement saying that it ``welcomed'' Davis'
decision to enter into formal settlement talks through a mediation
program offered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the Southern California branch
of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has also been fighting
the proposition in court, said that the plaintiffs would be willing
to discuss a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not going to surrender,'' Rosenbaum said, ``we're
not going to agree to any offer which removes a kid from a
classroom or denies social services to needy individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdi Soltani, an organizer of Californians for Justice, a
statewide grass-roots group that was founded in response to the
Proposition 187 campaign, said that Davis' decision not to dismiss
the appeal ``calls into question his overall commitment to racial
justice and building one California for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our communities elected Gray Davis to put a stop to the
politics of division,'' Soltani said. ``He had the legal authority
to stop 187 outright and he passed the buck.''

U.S. LETS 3 LABS RESTART SECRET COMPUTER NETWORKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has authorized the
resumption of work on computer networks containing the nation's
most sensitive nuclear secrets, two weeks after he ordered them
shut down over concerns about lax security at weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson gave the green light to restart the classified
computer networks at the three major nuclear-weapons laboratories
on Thursday night, after he was convinced that security and
counterintelligence programs at the laboratories had been
strengthened, he said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three labs, Los Alamos, Sandia and
Lawrence-Livermore, are carrying out new programs to improve
security training for employees, have developed new
electronic-security measures and are beginning to pay more
attention to counterintelligence than they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Systems that had been shut down are now undergoing a phased
resumption of operations, and will be fully operational again
within the next few days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's order shutting down the classified computer
networks at the labs was one of the most striking actions taken in
response to the furor over allegations that China had stolen
nuclear secrets from the labs. The administration has been under
fire for not acting more aggressively to tighten security.
</P>
<P>
   One of the longstanding security concerns about the laboratories
has been the possibility of transferring nuclear secrets from
classified computer networks into unclassified computers in the
labs. While the classified computer network is not linked to the
Internet, those unclassified computer networks can be reached from
outside through e-mail links.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the new security measures focused on electronic
security. By May 1, the labs are planning to install new systems
that will be able to scan the unclassified computer networks and
outgoing e-mail messages continuously to see if they contain
classified material, according to Energy Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists and other researchers at the three labs
were affected by the computer shutdown; virtually no research work
related to nuclear weapons could be conducted. All the scientists
who have access to the classified network were ordered to attend
security training sessions while the systems were overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is still analyzing
notebooks, computer files and other documents seized in the house
of Wen Ho Lee, a computer scientist who was fired from his job at
Los Alamos in March in connection with the investigation of
possible Chinese espionage. Lee has not been charged in the case,
and officials said there has not been any conclusion yet on the
significance of the files seized. &QL;

ACROSS ASIA, SIGNS OF SPRING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economics is not accounting, but the sense seems to be spreading
that Asia may be the FIFO region of the developing world: First in,
first out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly two years since bad times swept first through
Thailand and then the rest of East Asia. But now there are some
signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Growth estimates in countries like South Korea, Malaysia and
India are being raised. Risk premiums on corporate and sovereign _
or government _ debt are shrinking. And equity markets are starting
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two quarters, Morgan Stanley's EMF Asia index, which
covers nine markets, has risen 48 percent. But it still has much
ground to make up, as do all emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Pelosky Jr., global emerging markets strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to discuss
signs of spring in Asia, as well as other exotic precincts of the
world. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Some specialists in the emerging markets look at the
recovery in certain stock markets and see a dead-cat bounce. Is
that what you see?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Our feeling is that emerging markets in general are turning
and that we are at the beginning of a new cycle for these markets _
one that has three stages. The value stage, which is where we are
today and have been for some time, is first.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a growth phase, in terms of improved economic
activity and corporate profitability. The third stage is momentum,
which takes place as perceptions of risk decline, multiples improve
and a broader spectrum of investors return to the investment class.
</P>
<P>
   Asia had its dead-cat bounce a year ago, in the first quarter of
1998, when markets had a powerful rally and then petered out. The
big question we have about Asia now is if the region can stage a
broad-based recovery without a recovering Japan. We are
increasingly of the opinion that Japan is recovering. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Aren't economic conditions improving in some
countries without a vibrant Japan?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It does seem that some parts of the region have started to
recover. We recently have raised our 1999 growth forecasts for
South Korea, Malaysia and India. And in terms of financial market
performance, South Korea, Taiwan and India have been doing well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is the risk if Japan doesn't come back as
strongly as you hope?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the late 1980s, Asia was a leveraged play on
developed-country growth because these countries were basically
export platforms to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been an increase in inter-Asian trade,
which is where Japan comes in. If a Japanese recovery is generated
by an aggressive monetary policy, then the risk is the yen will
weaken. The question then will be if financial markets look through
the negative implications of a weak yen to the positives of a
Japanese economic recovery, one that would lead to greater demand
for Asian exports. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)A year ago, many were worried that China would do
further damage to the overall economic picture by devaluing the
yuan. At this point, how much harm would it do?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The possibility of a devaluation has already been discounted
by financial markets. But we feel the case for a significant
Chinese devaluation is just not that strong.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese exports are more demand-dependent than price-dependent.
Last year, the Chinese didn't lose a lot of market share even
though the currencies of their competitors in Asia fell sharply. If
the United States is going to continue to have growth of around 4
percent, if Europe is bottoming and if emerging markets are
bottoming, then demand for Chinese exports will pick up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)It would seem that Latin America, which felt the
impact of the world financial crisis well after Asia, would take
longer to recover. Is that how it will play out?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We are starting to make the case that Latin America will
recover more quickly than people think because the shock there was
a secondary shock and because a lot of restructuring in that part
of the world has been going on since 1994, when the region was also
gripped with a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the American economy remains vibrant is a big
positive for Mexico. And the Brazilian devaluation, when it came,
was not a huge surprise. If interest rates in Brazil continue to
decline, then the region can recover more quickly than people
think. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You mentioned the cycle that emerging markets are
entering. How long will it take?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would prefer to see a steady recovery rather than a big
spike upwards because volatility in these markets has been what has
kept most investors away. I think this is a one-to-three-year kind
of cycle. I think the growth stage will play out in 2000 and 2001,
with the momentum stage following after that.

CLINTON DEFENDS GORE TO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton sent environmental groups a
letter Friday that aggressively defends Vice President Al Gore's
record on their issues _ a highly unusual move that underscores the
president's commitment to boosting Gore's presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was responding to a letter to Gore earlier this week
from several environmental groups who accused the president and
vice president of breaking their pledge to reduce pollutants that
cause global warming. White House aides said they could not recall
a similar instance where Clinton felt so moved to publicly aid
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has done more over the past decade to mobilize action
against climate change than Vice President Gore,'' Clinton wrote in
the three-page letter. ``And no one can more effectively lead this
effort in the decade ahead. We must not allow our frustration over
the real obstacles we face to distract us from our common goals.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``We must pursue sound strategies, not proposals
that risk eroding the support so vital to our success.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's effort demonstrates the degree to which he is
determined to help his vice president by trying to smooth relations
with environmental groups on what could be an important issue in
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Clinton's letter is particularly helpful; Thursday
will be Earth Day, a time when the administration will draw
significant publicity on its environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental groups' letter to Gore, who has long cast
himself as an environmental champion, was surprisingly combative.
``We are writing,'' it complained, ``to voice deep disappointment
with the lack of an administration proposal to require significant
reductions in global warming pollution. We are particularly
frustrated that the administration has not sought meaningful
emission reductions from either power plants or passenger
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   In his reply, Clinton recited the administration's environmental
accomplishments in the face of ``the most anti-environmental
Congress ever.'' Throughout the letter, he lauded Gore's ``vision
and leadership.'' He said Gore had ``led the charge'' on a number
of fronts. He also wrote, ``The vice president and I have sought at
every opportunity to highlight the mounting scientific evidence
that global warming is a threat to this and future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto treaty intended to reduce global emissions was
negotiated in Japan in 1997 and signed by the administration last
year. But it was not presented to the Senate for ratification
because it faced strong opposition from industry groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of nine
groups that signed the original letter, said of the response, ``It
is a valid defense of what the administration has done to date. The
letter is fundamentally silent on the question of when the
administration will take the next step: insisting that the auto
industry and the public utilities start cleaning up their
greenhouse emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hansen, executive director of the Izaak Walton League of
America, another person who signed the letter, said, ``The
president makes a good point _ that we need to try to work
together.'' Even so, he said, it still does not take away from the
deficiencies in the administration's record.
</P>
<P>
   Another who signed the letter, National Environmental Trust
president Philip Clapp, said Clinton ``feels it necessary to cast
his and the vice president's inaction in the best political
light.'' He added: ``This is calculated to defend the vice
president from potential criticism between now and the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he was disturbed that a colleague had given the
letter to the press. ``I'm extremely unhappy about that,'' he said.
``We thought this was an exchange of views _ not a political
stone-throwing contest.'' But Clapp insisted that ``this letter was
quite specifically a public letter.''

`THE WAR ON BOYS:' AN IDEOLOGICAL MISSION  
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a twist on the sexual harassment charges that
provide television with a steady stream of horror stories, the
participants in ``The War on Boys,'' Sunday's edition of ``National
Desk,'' make a case that boys are being maltreated by women. In
feminists' drive for ``gender equity,'' these cheer leaders for
masculinity charge, fundamental differences between boys and girls
are being ignored to the detriment of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherded by Fred Barnes, they maintain that while girls are
doing relatively well in classrooms, the misunderstood and
neglected boys are being driven to violence and crime, not to
mention suicide. These days, as one critic puts it, ``Masculinity
is politically incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence to the contrary by groups like the American Association
of University Women is dismissed as ``advocacy research'' in the
service of an ideological mission. ``The War on Boys,'' which
invites suspicions of an ideological mission of its own, comes down
particularly hard on those who are quick to label restless lads as
suffering from attention deficit disorders and in need of quieting
drugs like Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   The three-part program, supported by conservative foundations,
goes on in coming weeks to assertions that America's armed services
and college athletics are also being subverted by liberal social
agendas. Although the arguments could benefit from more rigor and
fewer anecdotes, they are presented with passion and can be counted
on to add fuel to battles over family values.

`GROWING UP IN THE CITY:' NOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE 
</HEADLINE>

 By WALTER GOODMAN

<P>
   NEW YORK_ In this second of three earnest and generally upbeat
reports, John Merrow talks about race with pupils at Middle School
44, an open-enrollment school, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
At this West 77th Street school, which pupils may attend without
living in the neighborhood, Merrow finds that the situation is not
strictly a case of black and white. Since the school is made up
largely of Hispanic adolescents, their shadings, both of color and
ethnic derivation, complicate matters. The mixture can be
perplexing to teen-agers, but the program suggests that theirs may
be a model for a changing America.
</P>
<P>
   Merrow discovers that despite the existing racial gaps, when the
youngsters are brought together, they get along comfortably. A
Russian emigre known as Sasha to his hockey pals says, ``Color
doesn't mean nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the rare white students, whose mother took her out of
private school and sent her to Middle School 44 to give her ``an
opportunity to be a minority,'' has had some difficult moments, but
she seems to have settled in, and her mother remains enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Merrow acknowledges that the school is pretty special, but he is
left with the impression that given support from teachers and
especially from parents prospects for amity around New York are
brighter than they sometimes seem to adults.

UNWELCOME REFUGEES FLOOD MACEDONIA AFTER FLEEING SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ Ten days ago, thousands had suddenly
disappeared. After waiting days at a border crossing near here to
enter Macedonia from Kosovo, ethnic Albanians had been rousted from
their hillside camps, from their cars and their tractors and
ordered by Serbian forces back into the war zone they were trying
to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as the flow of ethnic Albanians into Macedonia surged,
they appeared again telling tales of being beaten, taking shelter
with strangers and waiting patiently for the right moment to
attempt again to flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Albanians arriving here _ some 12,000 in 24 hours _
had been ordered away from the border last week and herded back
into Kosovo after President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia had
announced a unilateral ``cease-fire.'' Many had been waiting at
border crossing here for days and then had vanished mysteriously
one night last week.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the refugee camp here Friday, exhausted refugees
told of expulsions that began three weeks ago in the three largest
towns in southeastern Kosovo and their frantic efforts to make it
to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, on the final leg of their odyssey, fights broke
out among hundreds of people clamoring to board a train from the
town of Urosevac in Kosovo to the Macedonia border, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   A haggard Qazim Hoti, 50, a physical education teacher who
arrived here Friday with his exhausted wife, two daughters and son,
said their flight from Kosovo began three weeks ago, after Serbian
paramilitary forces expelled them from their home in Pristina.
Driving to the Macedonian border in search of safety, they found a
mob of refugees already there.
</P>
<P>
   After spending six days and five nights camping in their Opel
sedan waiting to cross the border, Hoti and his family were among
the thousands ordered back into Kosovo after Milosevic declared the
cease-fire on April 6. Hoti said he was beaten by a Serbian
policeman in the chaos as the Albanians tried to reverse their cars
on the crowded roadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me and then let me get in the car,'' he said. ``Some
of the people from my neighborhood were there. I don't know where
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hoti said he followed orders to drive north but was stopped
at a Serbian checkpoint and told to turn east, away from Pristina,
his hometown. He then headed toward the small town of Shterpce near
the Macedonian border. Deciding it would be safest to follow local
villagers into the hills, he and his family abandoned their car and
hiked to the small village of Gocke.
</P>
<P>
   There, a stranger took the family into his home, he said.
Relative quiet ensued for the rest of the week as they waited for
the border with Macedonia to reopen. But early last week, gunfire
erupted in the village where they were hiding. In a series of
attacks described by other refugees, Serbian forces had begun
systematically expelling Albanians from the area.
</P>
<P>
   When word came that the border had reopened, Hoti and his family
decided to risk the journey. They walked first to Urosevac on
Thursday. Friday, they arrived at the railway station at 7:30 A.M.
hoping to take the daily train to the border, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But they found several thousand others already waiting to board.
As Serbian policemen stood by, chaos erupted when the train
arrived, with frantic people climbing into the train through its
windows and pulling each others from its doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were old women and kids being crushed,'' Hoti said.
``The people were not thinking of anything else, just getting on
that train.''
</P>
<P>
   Packed in so tightly that he was forced to stand on one foot for
the all of the 30-minute ride, he watched a landscape of
devastation roll by him where nearly every ethnic Albanian village
was deserted and partly burned. In one town, several hundred
Albanians waiting to get on the train were left behind because
there was no more room.
</P>
<P>
   Hoti said he did not know what became of the thousands of others
who were turned back at the border with his family 10 days ago. But
Miran Latifi, a 38-year-old lawyer who arrived Thursday from a
village near Urosevac with his wife and two sons, said several
thousand people from Pristina who were turned back at the border
were in villages in southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hiding there and running out of food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden surge in arriving refugees suggests that a second
wave is heading for Macedonia, whose own fragile ethnic balance is
being sorely tested by the Balkan crisis. Another large influx is
likely to put even more pressure on a society where tensions are
simmering between ethnic Macedonians, who make up two-thirds of the
population, and the country's ethnic Albanian minority.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers fear that the Macedonian government could again
resort to a de facto closing of the border or forced expulsions as
it did earlier to limit the number of Albanians entering.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonians, for their part, fear that Western countries will
fail to airlift refugees to third countries as promised and that
they will soon find themselves a minority in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between refugees and Macedonian police continued to
rise here Friday. Refugees who said they were expelled from their
village in Kosovo four days ago and forced by Serbian policemen to
try to enter Macedonia from an unofficial border crossing bitterly
complained about the Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
   Hajredin Hajredini said 3,000 refugees spent three days this
week in a no-man's land on the border because the Macedonian police
refused to allow them to enter. ``They shouted at us and ordered us
to leave and go back to Serbia,'' he said. ``But we wouldn't
move.''
</P>
<P>
   After pressure from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the
group was finally allowed to cross Thursday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inside the refugee camps here, tensions between refugees and the
Macedonian police, who have been accused of beatings and callous
treatment of ethnic Albanians, have risen. NATO troops who built
several of the camps are scheduled to withdraw all but a skeleton
staff this weekend and many refugees fear that without a NATO
presence, the situation will worsen.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials have defended the police conduct and say
that the complaints from refugees are exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   But as the number of refugees in the crowded camps rises _ many
new arrivals are sleeping on the ground because of a shortage of
tents _ and the NATO presence in the camp recedes, both sides are
increasingly on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept it,'' said Sali Aliu, a 28-year-old
refugee. ``We are not safe with them here.''

 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sport often stereotyped for brute force and
violent intimidation, Wayne Gretzky was a hockey artist who used
his stick as a paint brush and his skates as dance slippers. With
grace and creativity, he became the National Hockey League's career
leader in points and goals, a nine-time most valuable player who
not only dominated his sport competitively but helped spread its
popularity past the borders of his native Canada to new markets in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After 21 years as a professional _ the last 20 in the NHL and
the last three as a New York Ranger _ Gretzky announced his
retirement Friday afternoon in a news conference at Madison Square
Garden. His final game will be on Sunday afternoon at the Garden
against the Pittsburgh Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done,'' Gretzky said, speaking from a dais, his family
alongside him, surrounded by photographs of himself in various
uniforms of several teams. ``It's just time. Of course I'm sad.
I've played hockey for 35 years, since I was three years old. I'm
going to miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was known as The Great One, and it was not just a pun on
his name. In his sport, he, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr are generally
regarded as the very best players in its history.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison to other team sports, Gretzky will be remembered
at the level of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb in baseball or Michael Jordan
and Wilt Chamberlain in basketball. He won 10 scoring titles, as
did Jordan, and his nine MVP awards are four more than Jordan won
in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of marketing, Gretzky is often credited with stirring
interest in his cold-weather sport so that it was able to expand to
southern cities such as Tampa, Miami, Dallas and San Jose. When he
was dealt from Edmonton to Los Angeles in 1988 in a deal that
involved many players and much money, the move left Gretzky in
tears and was treated as a tragic day in Canadian history. But it
helped spur interest in professional hockey in Southern California,
and Gretzky's presence there at that time is widely thought to have
contributed to creation of the Disney-backed expansion franchise
called The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   He played one season as a 17-year-old in the World Hockey
Association, and his presence and potential with the Edmonton
Oilers helped spur a merger in 1979, officially called an
expansion, that created one major-league circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly shorter and much more slender than the average player,
Gretzky nevertheless holds 61 NHL scoring records, and appeared in
18 All-Star Games. He won four Lady Byng trophies for
sportsmanship, the most recent in 1994. In NHL regular-season games
alone, he has scored 894 goals; Howe is second with 801. In
regular-season assists, Gretzky leads with 1,962; Paul Coffey is
second with 1,102. In total points in regular season play, Gretzky
leads with 2,856; Howe is second with 1,850.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, in both the National Hockey League and World Hockey
Association, Gretzky has scored 1,072 goals, just one more than
Howe scored in both leagues during both regular season and playoff
games. No player has scored more. Howe was Gretzky's idol when
Gretzky grew up in Brantford, Ontario. Soon, Gretzky is expected to
join Howe in the Hockey Hall of Fame. Gretzky recalled Friday how
he used to visit the Hall as a boy because a friendly worker would
let him in. He said he would stand around in awe, looking at the
pictures and the mementos on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's safe to say I'm going to probably get in there,''
Gretzky said. ``Now that I'm retired, I can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No person in sports has done as much for their sport as you
have been able to do for ours,'' NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said
at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute that acknowledged Gretzky's status as a national
hero in Canada, Prime Minister Jean Chretien said in a statement:
``This is truly a bittersweet moment. One of the greatest players
ever to play our national game has decided to hang up his skates
... . But we can take heart from the endless, magical memories he
has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 38 years old, Gretzky's announcement ended a dramatic week
of public and private speculation involving Gretkzy, his family,
his friends and his fans. He declined a contract offer to play one
more season for $5 million. His skills have been reduced by a
nagging injury to a neck disk and by age. In his best season for
goals, 1981-82 Gretzky scored an astounding 92 _ by contrast, this
year's leader has 47 _ but this season he has only 9. In his best
season for assists, Gretzky had 163, but this season has only 52.
In his best years, as an Edmonton Oiler, Gretzky dominated the
sport and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships in nine
seasons. He has had less success with the Los Angeles Kings, the
St. Louis Blues and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gretzky insisted for most of this season that this
would not be his last, he revealed Friday that he began to
contemplate retirement around Christmas, when he ``started to feel
the fatigue, mentally and physically, that I've never felt
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the season, particularly in the second half, he was
hit harder by opposing checkers than had been the case in the past.
In his youth, checking Gretzky was like stopping a puff a smoke,
and he would materialize in open spaces like a mist rising from the
ice. This season, he was noticeably less elusive, and he rejected
pleas from his wife, agent, coach and general manager to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I know I've made the right decision,'' Gretzky
said. ``This is the right time. I'm at peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When people reminisce about the Gretzky era, as they surely will
for many decades, they will recall a playing style that was unlike
any other, even those of the other great ones. Howe, who began his
career shortly after World War II, was hockey's Paul Bunyan, a
mythic man, large for his era, tough for any age, a force through
several decades. Some thought he played for too long, retiring at
age 52 in 1980. Orr was a comet from the late 1960s and early
1970s, who played hockey the way Jimi Hendrix played guitar, with
elan that could not be copied.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was different and appropriate for his era. As his league
began importing increasing numbers of players from Europe, he
played what is now recognized as a European style. Although not
particularly speedy, Gretzky was a nimble skater who could stop,
collect a moving puck on his stick blade, look around and pass it
to an open teammate, seemingly in one motion, the components of the
flowing act not discernible as they are with most players. At other
times, Gretzky would carry the puck, stop suddenly and delay the
play a half-beat while letting others thunder by. Then he would
pass or shoot through openings, often against the grain, that only
he seemed to see.

SENATOR DERAILS AGENCY'S THREAT TO FIRE IRS WHISTLE-BLOWER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent
from Houston who blew the whistle on the agency during explosive
Senate hearings a year and a half ago, is fighting for her job.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15 _ tax filing day _ managers in the IRS's Houston
office handed the 15-year veteran a letter threatening to fire her
unless her job performance improved.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who chaired the Senate
hearings, accused the Houston office of retaliating against Long
for testifying about alleged abuses at the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of the IRS management in the Houston office are
outrageous,'' Roth said. ``They are a direct affront to Congress
and to the new IRS commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many taxpayers' calls and questions in Houston went
unanswered (Thursday) _ tax filing day _ because the IRS was busy
retaliating against its own?''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar prompted IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti to
dispatch the No. 2 man at the agency _ Deputy Commissioner Bob
Wenzel _ to Houston to review the case. He also called on the
Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration to
investigate, while Roth's office promised to focus on Houston in
future hearings.
</P>
<P>
   All of this prompted Long's managers to call her back in late
Friday to rescind the termination threat, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been the wildest thing you've ever seen,'' Long said
in a telephone interview. ``It was really cute _ April 15. That was
real funny. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said she believes the quick withdrawal of the termination
threat means ``they are going to continue to do the same things to
me. ... I know this trick very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, in a written statement Friday, said: ``I am extremely
disturbed that we may have taken an action that could be
retaliatory. As I have said before, I will not tolerate retaliation
against employees who came forward to testify before the Senate
Finance Committee or who come forward to report any allegations of
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston IRS officials declined to comment beyond Rossotti's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The action against Long may _ in one, fell swoop _ eradicate the
success the IRS has had rebuilding its image with the public since
the highly publicized Senate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the new-and-improved IRS that we heard so much
about this week is up to its old tricks again,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appalled that the IRS would take such action against
someone who has served the public as Ms. Long has,'' said the
congressman from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   William Nixon, Roth's executive assistant and co-author of the
book ``The Power to Destroy: How the IRS Became America's Most
Powerful Agency; How Congress is Taking Control and What You Do to
Protect Yourself Under the Law,'' said a movie producer in
Hollywood would never consider a script like this one.
``Retaliating against a Senate witness on tax day when chaos reigns
around you just boggles the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Long became something of a local folk hero in September 1997
when she publicly accused the IRS of abusing taxpayers. Long's
behavior was in sharp contrast to many of her colleagues, who
agreed to testify only if their identities were concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Long accused the Houston IRS office of singling out taxpayers
too poor to afford air conditioning and avoiding managers' friends
when selecting returns to audit. She also said she knew of five
taxpayers who had committed suicide, in part, because of pressure
imposed by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of Long, her colleagues and the agency's alleged
victims helped ensure passage of sweeping new legislation designed
to rein in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent investigation by the Treasury inspector general's
office discounted many of Long's more spectacular allegations. But
the probe did raise concerns that supervisors could harass their
employees and then retaliate against any who protested.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Long was given a 13-page memo by group manager
Karie Gulley detailing her ``unacceptable'' performance and
threatening possible removal within 68 days if she did not improve.
</P>
<P>
   The memo _ a copy of which was obtained by the Chronicle _
criticized Long for failing to plan effectively, set priorities,
manage her work load, conduct audits accurately and fill out forms
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Long was taken to task for deciding to drive to a taxpayer's
location to conduct an audit, which required driving three to four
hours a day, which the manager described as an inefficient use of
her time.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Long failed to fully investigate the assets a
taxpayer had in 11 different bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You looked at four of them and did not know what he was doing
at the other seven,'' the memo said. Long also was criticized for
working on more recent cases when an older case was still
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Gulley offered to help Long improve her job performance with
bi-weekly counseling sessions, planned to discuss each case Long
was working on and indicated she might make unscheduled visits when
Long was conducting on-site audits.
</P>
<P>
   Long described the problems as ``just nit-picky things'' and
violations of procedures that no one is used to because they have
been newly implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Roth noted that prior to testifying before the Senate hearings,
Long had received a grade of ``fully successful'' on her employee
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he called half a dozen IRS employees in Houston about
Long after receiving word about the memo. Long's colleagues, he
said, insisted she demonstrated a strong work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some in Houston who want to make her out to
be a difficult employee,'' Nixon said. ``But ... did she become
difficult the day after she testified before Congress?''

 &HT;    Bengals hope to gain a quarterback
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ After studying Oregon quarterback Akili Smith at a
workout before the East-West Shrine Game in Palo Alto, Calif.,
Bengals President Mike Brown made a telephone call before catching
a red-eye flight from San Francisco to Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You're right. He is borderline special,''' recalled
Jim Lippincott, the team's director of pro/college personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and offensive coordinator Ken Anderson then climbed aboard
that Florida-bound jet. Landing at 8 a.m., they went to watch
Central Florida quarterback Daunte Culpepper practice.
</P>
<P>
   That story, more than any, illustrates Brown's urgency to find a
player who can help turn the Bengals' franchise around.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he gets blown away by a trade offer, Brown will select a
quarterback with the No. 3 overall pick in the 64th NFL Draft
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have targeted the top quarterback prospects _ Smith,
Kentucky's Tim Couch and Syracuse's Donovan McNabb _ and aim to get
one.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Philadelphia pick first and second, respectively.
Barring any snags, they'll probably select quarterbacks too, and
decide who's left for the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wouldn't reveal his order of preference Friday, but he's
excited about the opportunity to get the position resolved for the
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance, and a good chance,'' Brown said. ``I'm not sure
I can quantify it in terms of percentage. The answer is: Nobody
knows. None of them are sure shots. Nobody ever is, or rarely is.
They all have a good chance at it, though, and that's a hard thing
to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious when you can hit on a quarterback, you really can
make things work the way you want. You can hit on an offensive
guard. You can hit on a cornerback. You can hit on an offensive
tackle. All those things are helpful. But none are anywhere near as
helpful as if you hit on a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the hub of the wheel ... like a queen on a chessboard.
These other guys are like rooks or bishops or other pieces that are
not quite as valuable. Some are more valuable than others. That's
just a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the offseason unfold, Lippincott noticed Brown's
renewed vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting my eighth year here and I've never seen Mike be
as aggressive at the all-star games as he was,'' Lippincott said.
``He saw Akili, took the red-eye from San Francisco to Orlando and
watched Culpepper practice. He's never done that. So the urgency is
exhibited right there.''
</P>
<P>
   It stems from having the worst record in the NFL since 1991 _
39-89 with no winning seasons since 1990; the fact that incumbent
QB Jeff Blake is entering the final year of his contract; and the
new Paul Brown Stadium will be ready in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Brown feels the dismal decade can be traced to the lack of a
franchise quarterback. The glory days of the late 1980s with Boomer
Esiason spilled into the frustrating 1990s with David Klingler,
Blake and Neil O'Donnell. Now it's someone else's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the NFL these days, the teams that have
productive quarterbacks all win,'' Brown said. ``Of the teams that
do not win, the thing they all have in common is quarterback
situations that are not productive. So everyone is looking to get a
quarterback. That's why teams run a risk in the draft to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also need a cornerback and help on the offensive and
defensive lines. Wide receiver Carl Pickens is threatening to sit
out if he isn't traded, so that position must be addressed. But
quarterback is the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Joe Montanas and the Kenny Andersons of the world aren't
out there anymore,'' head coach Bruce Coslet said. ``You don't see
'em. I see (John) Elway, Dan Marino, (Drew) Bledsoe, (Troy) Aikman,
Steve Young _ all high, high No. 1 draft choices. And the teams
that don't have those type of guys, they struggle. That's where we
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't try; if ou don't take the chance; if you
say, `Oh, it might be David Klingler again,' well, do you want to
go through life just scared to death all the time? We've got to
take the chance. We've got to try.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year was a good one for plenty of newly released wines,
from Oregon pinot noirs to Napa chardonnays. For investors in
wine-company stocks, however, 1998 left a generally unpleasant
aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities Wine Index, which tracks
three wine-related stocks _ Robert Mondavi Winery, Beringer Wine
Estates, and Canandaigua Brands _ rose just 4.9 percent last year,
compared with a 26.7 percent gain for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
And the wine index has tumbled 13.5 percent so far this year
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But David Goldman, a Montgomery analyst, says winery stocks have
been held down by fears, some of them unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors feared a grape shortage from heavy rains in 1998,
while others feared a glut as large amounts of vineyard acreage
entered production during the year; neither came to pass. More
broadly, worries about an imminent recession have also been
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Worries remain, however, that a new excise tax could be placed
on alcohol. And small- to mid-cap stocks of all types continue to
languish.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things won't always be true,'' Goldman said. He
predicted 9 percent to 12 percent growth in sales volume, with
higher growth in revenues as consumption continues to shift to
better, pricier wines. ``Bottom-line earnings growth looks like it
will be 15 to 20 percent for the next few years,'' he said.
``Lastly, there is a certain sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter factor has long been the main reason to like the
Chalone Wine Group, a maker of many high-end wines. The company
went public in 1984 at $9 a share; 15 years later it is trading at
$8.375, despite sales growth that has been in the double digits
throughout the 1990s. (Investors who hold at least 100 shares,
however, enjoy a 25 percent discount on Chalone wines.)
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi went public in 1993 at $13.50 a share; it closed on
Friday at $32.25 but has traded as high as $42.75 in the last 52
weeks. Beringer went public in 1997 at $26; it is now at $38.375,
down from a 52-week high of $54.75.
</P>
<P>
   Two smaller wineries, R.H. Phillips and Willamette Valley
Vineyard, are also publicly traded, as is Golden State Vintners,
which makes wines sold under various labels. Canandaigua, a huge
producer of lower-priced wines, made news this month by agreeing to
buy the premium Simi Winery of California from LVMH Moet-Hennessey
Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is especially bullish on Mondavi and Beringer, which he
expects to hit $47 and $55, respectively, over the next 12 months.
He is cautious about Ravenswood Winery, which sold one million
shares at $10.50 each over the World Wide Web on April 9, through
W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., in an online auction without traditional
underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the company _ they have a real success story,'' Goldman
said. ``My only concern is that Ravenswood will end up on the dark
side of the moon in terms of analyst coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has much company in recommending Mondavi and Beringer.
Both have known brands and prime, extensive acreage in California.
Mondavi had some earnings shortfalls last year, which it attributed
to a shortage of grapes for its low-end Woodbridge chardonnay.
Beringer has enjoyed steady sales and earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Neill, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown upgraded Mondavi to a
buy in January, after the company announced a restructuring that
trimmed the work force by 4 percent and refocused attention on core
brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structural change indicated the company will be more
profit-focused,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   At Beringer, he said, a new line of $8 to $10 wines, Beringer
Founders Estate, should increase sales volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice S. Behar, manager of the John Hancock Emerging Growth
fund, said of Beringer: ``The growth rate is there, and the demand
is still pretty high. We continue to believe Beringer is the
best-managed company in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the doubters of Mondavi and Beringer is Tom Pirko,
president of Bevmark Inc., a beverage industry consulting firm
based in New York. He likes Beringer's management and the Mondavi
family, but he does not believe either company should be public.
``All these projects are the province of private equity deals,'' he
said. ``I don't know of any that really qualifies for a public
offering.''

 &HT;    First pick still unknown _ even to Browns
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ University of Oregon quarterback Akili Smith,
perhaps a trifle annoyed by the drama, said Thursday he was ``in
the dark'' about how the expansion Cleveland Browns plan to use the
first pick in today's NFL Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Join the crowd, Akili.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the Browns, the hierarchy is huddled over
breakfast this morning sifting through last-minute data in hopes of
choosing properly among Smith, Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch and
Texas running back Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Browns have 14 selections this weekend as the
orderly reincarnation process continues nearly four years after Art
Modell snuck off to Baltimore with the original franchise. And now,
officially, they are on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   With three players deemed worthy of being chosen, the Browns
spent the past couple of days determining which one would sign a
contract with the least amount of struggle. They are said to be
offering a seven-year deal worth about $52 million, plus a $13
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of teams remain interested in moving up. New
Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka, for example, has offered the
Browns and the Bengals his entire draft for the No. 1 pick, with
which he would take Williams. Ditka tried a similar gambit last
year and was rebuffed in efforts to land quarterback Ryan Leaf, who
went to San Diego with the second pick.
</P>
<P>
   The poker-faced, bunkered Browns say they are keeping their
options open, but it looks like Ditka once again will go away
frustrated and that Williams will go fourth to the Indianapolis
Colts, who made room in the backfield Thursday by trading Marshall
Faulk to the St. Louis Rams for a second-round choice and a
fifth-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia drafts second, Cincinnati third. Both teams are
prepared to select quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Based on television polls and radio talk shows, Browns fans
clearly favor Williams over any quarterback. The draft is
quarterback-rich, they argue, so a serviceable one _ Ohio State's
Joe Germaine? _ surely can be found in later rounds. If not,
there's always Warren Moon, currently a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Browns want a franchise QB and, in this draft, only
Couch and Smith seem to match that definition in the mind of head
coach Chris Palmer. A well-respected guru of the position, Palmer
has developed Jacksonville's Mark Brunell and is credited with
helping the New England Patriots correctly decide on Drew Bledsoe
over Rick Mirer.
</P>
<P>
   The power-armed Smith caught Palmer's eye early, but Couch
rallied with last Sunday's workout in front of 11 members of the
front office, including owner Al Lerner. Today will end months of
suspense, speculation and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate making a decision on the pick until
Saturday morning,'' Browns spokesman Alex Martins kept saying all
week.
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Smith is older but less experienced than Couch, who is
skipping his senior season after thriving for three years in
Kentucky's wing-and-a-prayer offense. Smith, while undeniably
talented, is coming off his only full season of taking snaps at the
Division I level. ``From what I understand, Tim Couch didn't blow
them away with his workout,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas the Browns hope to address are wide receiver,
defensive line, linebacker and overall team speed. Free agency and
the expansion draft yielded several pieces to the puzzle, including
linebacker Chris Spielman and an offensive line, anchored by former
Browns tackle Orlando Brown, that threatens to be respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many needs,'' said Dwight Clark, director of
football operations. ``I would say defensive line and linebacker
would be the top two.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Browns had a rich history of draft-day blundering that
only the occasional first-round bonanza _ amazingly, Ozzie Newsome
and Clay Matthews both arrived in 1978 _ could offset. Who can
forget when coach Bill Belichick, unnerved by the New York Jets'
choice of tight end Kyle Brady, threw his hands in the air, gave up
and chose Ohio State linebacker Craig Powell. No linebackers are on
the Browns' short list of candidates for the No. 1 pick. There is,
therefore, no danger of another Powell, Mike Junkin or Clifford
Charlton, disasters all.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Clark will be looking to rehabilitate his image as a
talent-evaluator over the next two days. With San Francisco, Clark
orchestrated running back Ricky Watters' unpopular exit and
probably won't be forgiven anytime soon in the Bay Area for last
year's ill-fated decision to draft Jim Druckenmiller over Jake
Plummer.

 &HT;    Freaknik comes to life, but slower than in years past
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Freaknik showed signs of life Friday, as men with
video cameras, women with short skirts, and cars with stereos
blasting began filling Peachtree Street shortly after noon.
</P>
<P>
   But even before darkness fell on the first day of the annual
Black College Spring Break, some of its negative side could be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Near Woodruff Park, a young man pulled down a woman's stretch
pants, and then quickly ran away.
</P>
<P>
   Two local girls who would not give their names said they were
skipping high school classes to stroll around Underground Atlanta
during Freaknik. They said they were 17 and 18 years old. But an
Atlanta police detective said truancy was not a serious problem on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Freaknik appears to remain a draw for college students.
Angie Pearson, a 21-year-old University of Florida student, said
she's heard ``the horror stories, how derogatory it is, the lack of
respect. But you never really know until you try it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson and her friends were dressed relatively conservatively,
wearing blue jeans and sweaters as a chilly wind whipped past them.
Pearson's friend, Maneka Smith, 20, said the way women dress can
have an impact on how they are treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you carry yourself with a lack of respect, then that's the
way people treat you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The women, almost in unison, said they came to Atlanta to
``party, get drunk, club and meet men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, clean, wholesome college fun,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Technical school student Jay Scott, 20, of Detroit summed up
what Freaknik is all about for him and his friends in a few words:
``Females. We're just trying to see some females.''
</P>
<P>
   As they walked around Underground Atlanta, Mark McLaughlin, 18,
said ``It's boring. This ain't nothing compared to '97. It was way
live then.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Sims, 18, pointed his hand-held camcorder at some women
across the street, shouting, ``Say something for D-town!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of fellas back home anticipating some pictures,''
Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown streets were thick with Atlanta police SWAT and Red Dog
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police set up an impromptu command center at Walton and
Peachtree streets and began stopping cruising drivers. Tow trucks
were lined up and waiting. Between 5 and 6 p.m. Friday, 15 cars
were impounded, said Lt. Larry Gilbert, assistant commander of
downtown's Zone 5 precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``If cars stop, if their radios are too loud, and if anybody's
hanging out of a car, they're getting pulled over, cited and their
cars are being impounded,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   One group videotaped a friend being arrested and handcuffed for
having no driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Near Woodruff Park on Friday afternoon, 42-year-old Ernest
Maiden, of southwest Atlanta, filmed a woman shaking her rear for
his video camera. Maiden said he was gathering footage for a friend
of his who is a college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like being part of the Olympics,'' Maiden said.
``But it seems like there's more policemen out here than people
enjoying the festivities.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt out of place among younger partygoers,
Maiden said, ``You're never too old to party. They have the Oscars
every year, and they put on fancy dresses and arrive in fancy
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   On Auburn Avenue, meanwhile, dozens of vendors were busy setting
up booths featuring African artifacts, handbags, watches, jewelry,
sunglasses and food.
</P>
<P>
   A festival planned along the historic black avenue is one of
only two events sanctioned by the city of Atlanta this year; a job
fair at the World Congress Center today is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollard, 24, drove down to the festival from Columbia, S.C.,
to sell T-shirts and handbags. He sat alone in front of his table
Friday afternoon waiting for the crowds he said would pick up by
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we'll just have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Last
year, we did great. Hopefully we'll do better this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the party doesn't truly kick into high gear until
Saturday, some of the traditional hot spots were quiet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic around Grant and Piedmont parks, as well as Greenbriar,
Lenox and West End malls was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many downtown office workers left early. Georgia
State University canceled classes after noon, state employees were
allowed to go home at 3 p.m., and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals
offices were closed at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Gwinnett and Cobb counties said they did not stop an
unusually high number of speeders coming to Atlanta along
Interstate 75 and I-85 as they have done in past years. Officials
at both departments said they generally weren't stopping cars
unless they were going over 80 miles per hour or driving
dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anywhere like it has been in the past,''
said Lt. George Hatfield, head of special operations for the Cobb
County Police Department. ``I don't think it's going to be that big
of a deal. Either that, or they're better behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordy Wright, spokesman for the Georgia State Patrol, said, ``At
this time last year, we had at least seen some evidence of a
Freaknik. But this is probably the lightest traffic along the
interstate that I've seen since 1994.''

you think? Teens and young adults do, too, because they've been
building customized Honda Civics for a bunch of years.

yesterday did with muscle cars and old Chevys, making them go

 &HT;    BellSouth tries flat-rate plan for wireless service
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth has begun bidding to compete with the
national wireless companies, offering flat-rate plans that charge
nothing extra for long-distance or roaming calls.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are an implicit admission that the company has lost
some big-spending customers to the likes of Sprint and AT&AMP;T, which
have similar one-rate plans pitched to travelers who are also heavy
wireless users. But the move is also something of a gamble, because
BellSouth could lose money providing service to travelers whose
phones are connecting to another company's network.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth offers 600 minutes of use for $90 a month and 1,000
minutes for $120. A customer who stayed within those time limits
would know in advance how much the bill will be, and would not pay
per-minute charges for ``roaming'' outside BellSouth's service
area.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth would still have to pay other carriers each time a
customer roamed _ almost certainly paying more than the customer on
a one-rate plan pays for an average minute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential loss on roaming, the company needs to keep
those high-end customers, said Perry Walter, analyst for
Robinson-Humphrey. Although BellSouth can offer wireless
long-distance, it cannot yet offer long-distance to wire line
customers in its nine-state region. The loss of wireless customers
to national companies will threaten the company's ability to be a
complete carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defensive strategy,'' Walter said. ``They've got to
defend their turf in long-distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of charging one rate for all wireless calls, regardless
of where they are made, got its first push from Sprint and Nextel,
then won the embrace of AT&AMP;T. BellSouth had long shrugged off the
suggestion that it needed a national wireless strategy, arguing
that most customers do not roam and if they do, they stay in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one-quarter of BellSouth's wireless customers use the
phone outside the region, but they tend to be customers who use a
lot of telecommunications services. BellSouth users who traveled
have often found themselves paying exorbitant fees, and _ for at
least some users _ the one-rate drumbeat was apparently making a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers may have perceived that we were not as full a
provider as our competition,'' said BellSouth spokeswoman Kathy
Curtin.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth hopes that introduction of the flat-rate plans will
keep customers with the company, and persuade others to use their
phones more when they do travel.
</P>
<P>
   However, to use the plan, a customer needs a dual-band, dual
mode phone. The phone can work on a system that's analog or
digital; it can also work in the 800 megaherz bandwidth or in the
1,900 megaherz range. BellSouth is offering phones made by Nokia
and Ericsson, $99 to $199.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike BellSouth, the national providers can offer customers
phones that link to a network with one type of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using a single technology in 285 major markets,'' said
Sprint spokesman Dan Wilensky. ``We think that gives us an
advantage. I'm standing here in Nashville talking to you, and my
phone works the same as in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth officials scoffed at that idea, arguing that the
phones make the transition from one technology to another invisible
to the user. But, they agreed there would be a glitch if a customer
_ say in a car _ passes from a system using a high bandwidth to the
lower one or vice versa while on the phone. That call would almost
certainly be disconnected.

 &HT;    Delta's alliance with KAL suspended
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines on Friday suspended its marketing
alliance with Korean Air Lines because of safety concerns
heightened by this week's crash of a KAL cargo plane in China.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta, which has also been a safety consultant to
KAL since last fall, said it will conduct ``a thorough review'' of
the carrier's operations before deciding whether to renew the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, Delta had booked passengers on KAL flights from
11 U.S. cities to Seoul and three other Korean destinations. The
arrangement, known as code-sharing, has become a common means of
service expansion among international carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The KAL suspension leaves Delta with only one minor alliance in
Asia. This winter it started a new code-share deal with China
Southern Airlines. Two years ago, Singapore Airlines jilted Delta
for a different alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it will make other travel arrangements for passengers
it had booked on future KAL flights. Delta will still carry KAL
passengers on some of its own flights.
</P>
<P>
   In this week's crash, an MD-11 freighter went down shortly after
takeoff from Shanghai for Seoul. Nine people were reported dead,
including the three-member crew and six people in an industrial
park where the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   KAL had suffered several other recent accidents, the worst a 747
crash on Guam in 1997 that killed 226 people. In March, a KAL MD-83
overran a runway at a Korean airport, injuring dozens.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier began a sweeping safety campaign after the Guam
crash and hired Delta last October to conduct a three-year, $20
million safety audit. Delta said that work will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``KAL has made a major commitment to improving its operations to
world-class standards and has made substantial progress in that
work,'' Delta said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which has numerous European code-share alliances, booked
53 passengers on the Swissair MD-11 that crashed last summer near
Nova Scotia, killing all 229 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Delta faces lawsuits from that crash but has made no changes in
its alliance with Swissair.

the expected weather or the amount of fuel necessary. Such
decisions, they said, should be made by the captain alone.

 &HT;    Pilots urge Delta to drop Comair plans
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In another sign of chilled relations between Delta Air
Lines and its pilots, their union is demanding that the carrier
scrap plans to use regional affiliate Comair as part of the Delta
Shuttle operation in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Air Lines Pilots Association leaders, after a special meeting on
the matter, passed a resolution threatening to sue Delta unless it
complies.
</P>
<P>
   Delta plans to add nonstop Washington-Boston flights June 1 to
its Shuttle operation, which now flies hourly between Washington
and New York, and New York and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ten daily flights will be flown by Delta jets, but another six
are to be flown by Comair, using small jets.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it had to use Comair on the route because of
congestion at Washington-Reagan National Airport, where airlines
are limited to a certain number of flight ``slots.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta had only enough slots for two aircraft, but the airline
needed one more to have enough daily flights to compete with rival
US Airways, which is also expanding on the route.
</P>
<P>
   Delta asked Cincinnati-based Comair to use one of its slots to
provide extra flights temporarily, a Delta spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the move isn't prohibited under ALPA's contract, the
union resolution said it violates ``the spirit and intent'' of its
pact.
</P>
<P>
   As a branded Delta product, the union said, Shuttle flights
should be operated solely by Delta pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint reflects general concern among major airline
pilots that carriers can effectively outsource flying to lower-paid
crews through greater cooperation with their commuter affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   That concern is expected to be an issue in new contract talks
this fall between Delta and ALPA.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Delta cut the number of Boeing 777s it's
buying, saying it feared having to park the big jets because of a
stalemate in talks with ALPA about pay rates for the planes.

 &HT;    Economic recruitment heads in new directions
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two decades ago, economic recruitment in the South
revolved around a simple equation: cheap land plus cheap labor
equals new industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the arithmetic has changed became clear to the 115
economic developers who trained in a sort of boot camp this week at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Towns and cities ``recruit, recruit, recruit,'' but for many of
them economic prizes will never come, says J. Mac Holladay,
``because their product isn't any good if the community doesn't
look nice and the kids aren't smart.'' Holladay, the former chief
operating officer of the Governor's Development Council under
former Gov. Zell Miller, is now a private economic development
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in attendance have been in their jobs only a few
months. They represent the latest generation of recruiters that
Southern chambers of commerce and economic development agencies
rely on to keep their business fires stoked.
</P>
<P>
   So, as you would expect, participants in the annual, weeklong
course heard about ways to court businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But they also heard about measuring their success through
reduced teen pregnancies, infant mortality and high school dropout
rates. A project manager from the Nature Conservancy told them to
protect the environment if they want to keep their economies
healthy. And she said they need to study wetlands regulations,
stream buffer laws and a host of other regulatory issues.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that recruiting traditional manufacturers is a bit
passe. Instead, they heard ideas for keeping existing businesses
happy, bolstering start-up companies, attracting high-tech firms,
tapping tourism and thinking about downtown development.
</P>
<P>
   Statements that would have been heresy just a few years ago were
tossed around all week in course seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people whose entire economic development program is
trying to attract Fortune 500 companies,'' Holladay says. ``That's
stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been measuring the wrong things for a long time,'' he
says. ``It is about wealth creation for everybody. It's about
higher per capita income and lower infant mortality rates. It's
about things that make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers echo the advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the illusion that all you need to be worried about
are jobs,'' says Jack Bundy, a long-time chamber executive who now
heads Healthy Spartanburg!, an initiative tackling a range of
health and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters didn't used to hear this kind of talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long this field of economic development has been too
narrowly defined as new business attraction,'' said Rick Duke,
director of the economic development course at Georgia Tech and the
university's Center for Economic Development Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to the late '80s and even early '90s, what we
now call economic development was called industrial development.
... almost everything revolved around industrial recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The South pursued manufacturers with the best it had to offer:
inexpensive land and plenty of unskilled labor willing to work
cheap. Economic developers often considered word-of-mouth referrals
their best sales strategy. The job wasn't easy, but neither was it
particularly complex.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers considering Southern communities often asked for
little information about the local work force beyond a head count,
said Bob Cassell, who started Georgia Tech's economic development
course 32 years ago and is now director emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   An evolving economy changed that. International markets grew
dramatically in importance. Technology changed the workplace and
reduced the economic significance of unskilled workers. Companies _
facing more competition and narrowing windows before product
equipment obsolescence _ are making location decisions faster and
demanding more from communities.
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes the job of the South's economic developers
increasingly complex. Yet Duke said the profession is still in the
midst of transition. Too many economic developers, he said, have
yet to recognize and react to the new demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities have thought, `If we acquire property, if we
run water and sewer and erect buildings, prospects will locate in
our community.' They have not thought broadly about the strengths
and weaknesses of their community.''
</P>
<P>
   They should be thinking about issues like schools, crime and
health care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those in attendance say they've already recognized the
new equation for economic development. ``You just don't sell one
little area,'' says Carmen Cole, a manager at the Liberty County
Development Authority in Hinesville. ``You sell the whole
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting company executives ask detailed questions about the
quality of local schools and overall living conditions, Cole said.
But that's usually after officials are satisfied with more basic
infrastr

 &HT;    NATO GIVING GROUND TROOPS 'CONSIDERATION' FOR CREATING SAFE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO ground forces could be sent into Kosovo to
carve out a corridor of territory the alliance would control, under
one of three options NATO officials are considering to rescue
ethnic Albanians trapped inside the embattled Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said Friday that NATO has
made no decision on the options, which also include air drops and
the insertion of humanitarian aid groups under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon stressed that all three choices are fraught with peril,
that there's no guarantee NATO would select any of them and that he
personally regards the corridor option as ``unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement, however, marked the first time the Clinton
administration has formally acknowledged any active consideration
of inserting ground forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no NATO plans to open a corridor. It remains an
option that's under consideration,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a corridor would require some sort of ground
placement,'' Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon, ``but NATO has
made no decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's remarks came as NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia
stretched toward day 25 with fresh strikes early Saturday, and
humanitarian aid groups struggled to assist tens of thousands of
Kosovar Albanian refugees flooding the Albania and Macedonia
borders in the wake of an increasingly brutal and systematic
Serbian-led Yugoslav campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Relief groups reported water systems to be taxed to the limit in
Kukes, where water already is being rationed to a few hours a day
to the permanent population.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies also reported almost no vacant, available land for
refugees coming in cars or the ubiquitous tractor-drawn wagons that
carry 15 to 40 people each.
</P>
<P>
   The influx, which is expected to increase over the coming days,
is putting even more pressure on NATO allies to find a quicker
solution that the daily drumbeat of bombs on Yugoslav forces and
other military targets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and allied pilots dropped laser-guided bombs, cluster bombs
and other munitions on 57 major targets -- including radar sites,
anti-aircraft missiles, bridges, fuel and ammunition supplies --
across Yugoslavia on Friday and Thursday, in addition to armored
personnel carriers, troop transport trucks and more than a dozen
tanks deployed inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Warplanes flying off of the U.S.S. Roosevelt aircraft carrier
near the Adriatic Sea attacked a military airfield in Montenegro --
along with Serbia, one of two states making up the rump Yugoslavia.
NATO officials said Yugoslav warplanes had been flying from the
field on quick missions into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, U.S. and allied pilots had flown more than 8,000
sorties in the campaign -- designed to punish Yugoslavia for
repressive activities that have forced as many as 1.5 million
ethnic Albanians to flee their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO armada had risen to 653 aircraft, the Pentagon said,
including 463 U.S. warplanes, refueling tankers and reconnaissance
craft. The NATO supreme allied commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley
Clark, has requested 300 additional planes, and a Pentagon decision
on that is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 22,500 NATO ground troops either posted near
Kosovo's borders or scheduled to arrive over the next week or so,
some analysts said that carving out a humanitarian corridor could
be a first step toward the launch of a ground offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corridor is nothing more than an avenue of approach for
ground forces,'' said one military officer with extensive Balkans
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get 30,000 troops on the ground inside Kosovo and
they're NATO troops and they've got a staging area and it's
protected, it's obviously a place you could use to fly in more
military people,'' said Balkans analyst Michael O'Hanlon of the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. ``You've also
crossed a certain policy line, in saying you're willing to put
troops on the ground in a non-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the principals on his national security team have
repeatedly said there is ``no plan,'' or ``no intention'' to place
ground troops in Kosovo, except as peacekeepers permitted under an
agreement with Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia. Clinton has been careful, however, not to rule out the
use of ground troops altogether, in both his public remarks and his
closed-door consultations with congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 700,000 ethnic Albanians holed up in remote
mountainous regions with little or no food and shelter, NATO is
under pressure to augment its air war -- now in its fourth
inconclusive week -- with some direct assistance for the
beleaguered refugees trapped inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that NATO is addressing with some urgency,''
Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon. He made no prediction on how
soon a decision might come. ``The problem is, it's a big problem
and there is no easy solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's announcement came as 24 U.S. Army Apache combat
helicopters were scheduled to arrive by Monday in Albania, backed
by a ground force of some 2,500 U.S. infantrymen and 18 long-range
battlefield rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those forces, roughly 8,000 troops from Italy and
other NATO countries are gathering in Albania over the coming week
or so -- many have already arrived -- and there are 12,000 NATO
troops on the ground in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, those 20,000 troops are focused on providing
humanitarian assistance to refugees in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   They could, however, quickly be assigned to a combat mission.
The 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia have been stationed there as
the forward force that would lead a larger NATO peacekeeping
mission into Kosovo, should Yugoslavia accede to the alliance's
demand that the force be permitted into the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Friday in Brussels that the
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, has managed to carve out and
control a small pocket of territory in southwest Kosovo
</P>
<P>
   near the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has no contacts -- official contacts -- with the KLA,''
said Shea. ``Obviously we know that they have been operating along
the border between Albania and Kosovo. They have even been
successful at opening a corridor. And that may have helped, indeed,
many refugees to enter Albania that might have otherwise been
prevented from doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, NATO is considering combining its air
strength with ground forces to carve out an area of control of its
own. Bacon would not say whether the plan envisioned building onto
the territory the KLA controls, but he said NATO's air strikes
against Serb forces on the ground have aided KLA efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the realities is that as the Serb forces become weaker,
the KLA forces will become stronger,'' Bacon said. ``And we've seen
evidence of that over the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three options being weighed by NATO's political arm
-- the North Atlantic Council, or NAC -- would pose enormous risks.
</P>
<P>
   Air drops would expose lumbering NATO cargo planes flying low
and slow to enemy fire. The food they might drop, moreover, could
wind up in the hands of the very Serb troops and police that NATO's
air campaign is targeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sending in so-called non-governmental organizations, known as
NGOs, is another option. The government of Greece has been in
intensive contact with Belgrade in recent days to try to win
Serbian safety guarantees for Greek-backed NGO convoys to ferry aid
into ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has doubts that Serbs would honor such guarantees -- Serb
forces compiled a long record of hijacking and other abuses of such
missions in the 3 1/2-year war in neighboring Bosnia. This option
would also further complicate what is already a very difficult NATO
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To facilitate aid convoys moving through Kosovo would require
NATO to suspend air strikes along those routes. That would, in
effect, create a safe zone in which Serbian forces might also have
room to maneuver, confounding NATO's military aims.
</P>
<P>
   The use of air power alone to try to protect NGOs from hostile
Serbs would be dangerous, said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a
combat pilot who flew similar missions to try to defend United
Nations-designated ``safe areas,'' in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would, personally, say that's not a great idea,'' said Wald.
``It didn't work that great in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains the corridor option.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems is that to get NGOs in there you probably
would have to open a corridor, so two of the plans might actually
conflate into one plan,'' Bacon said. ``There is a limited number
of options to deal with this problem, and as I've tried to stress,
no option is particularly easy and inviting.''

HOUSTON IRS OFFICE TRIES BUT FAILS TO FIRE WHISTLEBLOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As millions of Americans were filing their returns on tax day,
the Houston office of the IRS was in the process of firing the
first internal revenue agent to publicly blow the whistle about
agency abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The action was halted when the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., protested to the new tax
commissioner, Charles Rossotti, about retaliation against the
agent, Jennifer Long.
</P>
<P>
   Long, a career tax auditor and the daughter of two career tax
agency employees, was the star of hearings before the Finance
Committee in September 1997 that focused on accusations that
taxpayers were abused by the IRS. She was the only one of seven IRS
agents who did not sit behind a curtain and use a voice distortion
mask to hide her identity when she testified. Mrs. Long said the
agency preys on taxpayers it thinks are weak and lack the power to
fight an audit, while ignoring cheating by those with either the
resources to fight back or with friends in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Long, a career tax auditor who for 15 years was rated
``fully successful,'' said that on Thursday she was within an hour
of completing an audit when her manager, Karie Gulley, telephoned
and ordered her to return to the IRS office immediately.
</P>
<P>
   There Mrs. Long was served with formal notice that her work was
so bad that she had 60 days to straighten up or she was out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fired once they give you that letter,'' Mrs. Long said.
``They just have to give you 60 days' notice.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday afternoon, 23 hours later, the letter was
withdrawn after Roth intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keith, a spokesman in Washington for the tax agency, said
that Mrs. Long was served with the notice and then reinstated.
Beyond that, he said, ``by law, the IRS is prohibited from
responding.'' He added that managers in the Houston office were not
available to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who gave up a lucrative career as an executive to try
and remake the IRS into a customer-friendly organization, was said
by both his aides and those of Roth to be furious.
</P>
<P>
   After Rossotti learned of the firing, in a call from one of
Roth's staff, he assigned subordinates to call Michael Greenspan,
the acting director of the Houston district. Several hours later
Mrs. Long was called into Ms. Gulley's office and told that the
60-day letter was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mrs. Long said, the withdrawal of the letter was
accompanied by stern words from Ms. Gulley and her boss, a group
manager, Dianne Jones, and a load of work that was to be turned in
by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The moves against Mrs. Long came one day after Roth, at a
followup to his two rounds of hearings on IRS abuses, had pressed
the tax commissioner for assurances that whistleblowers would be
protected and that errant executives and managers would be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti noted that he had reprimanded 12 executives for
improperly rating IRS employees on the basis of how much money they
brought in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely disturbed,'' Rossotti said in a statement,
``that we may have taken action that is retaliatory.'' He said that
on Monday the deputy commissioner, James Wenzel, will go to Houston
to pursue the matter and that he had ordered an inquiry by his
agency's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, through his aides, said the letter to Mrs. Long amounted
to ``contempt of Congress.'' But after speaking by telephone with
Rossotti, the senator reiterated his ``complete faith in the
commissioner's sincerity'' and ability to remake the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's executive assistant, William Nixon, who with the senator
wrote a new book that is sharply critical of the IRS, ``The Power
to Destroy,'' said the firing of Mrs. Long showed how determined
many career IRS executives are to defeat the reforms Congress
ordered last year when it passed a law restructuring the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened here,'' Nixon said, ``is really a pathology of
an ingrained culture. The IRS Houston district is a nest of
vipers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Roth has collected information on at least a dozen other
auditors who are being harassed because they have either disclosed
improper actions, refused to act improperly or have been friendly
with those who are, like Mrs. Long, out of favor with management in
the Houston district.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Long was served with a list of 33 alleged shortcomings,
including both a failure to seek help from others and a failure to
be sufficiently independent. She was also criticized for driving to
conduct an audit three or four hours away from the office, an audit
that she said was indeed outside of the Houston district but that
was assigned to her by Ms. Gulley.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed list of improvements was included in the 60-day
notice, which specified precisely how Mrs. Long was to fill out her
appointment book, down to what shorthand she must use to specify
whether appointments with taxpayers were tentative or confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   She said that ever since her testimony she has been harassed and
her work subjected to picayune examination. ``On Monday when I came
to work every single manager was in my face with, `You're not a
team player,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is over,'' she said. ``But tonight I'm
going dancing.''

ALCOA TO CUT EMISSIONS, BOOSTING BUSH'S VOLUNTARY PROGRAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's drive for a voluntary
program to reduce grandfathered air emissions gained support Friday
with a major new corporate commitment and a House committee vote.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa said it would voluntarily acquire a new-style state permit
and cut emissions at its Rockdale, Texas, aluminum plant, the
state's largest source of grandfathered air emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier legislative testimony, the company said it might have
to shut down the plant, about 50 miles northeast of Austin, if it
were required to get a traditional permit, which would mandate
bigger emission cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the House Environmental Regulation Committee approved
an amended version of a bill, already passed by the full Senate, to
let grandfathered industries acquire new-style permits and cut
emissions voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Grandfathered plants, accounting for about a third of industrial
air emissions in Texas, are older facilities exempt from
traditional emission permits since 1971. Permits generally require
stricter pollution controls and subject plants to greater
regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, backed by industry groups, advocates letting grandfathered
plants cut their emissions voluntarily, while environmentalists
support a mandatory end to their permit exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the governor, said the Alcoa
announcement, added to previous commitments from 48 other
companies, indicates Bush's voluntary initiative is working.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary permit program, if approved by the Legislature,
would enlist still more grandfathered plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Kramer, state director of the Sierra Club, said the
Alcoa announcement and House panel vote appeared ``carefully
orchestrated'' to rebut growing calls by environmentalists _ and
recent editorials in Texas' five largest newspapers, including the
Houston Chronicle _ for a mandatory end to the grandfathered
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the House panel came amid indications that
lawmakers will consider how to strengthen the pollution-reducing
potential of a voluntary permit program for grandfathered plants.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of emission reductions achievable through a voluntary
program, as currently embodied in pending legislation, has been a
major point of debate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Senate and House panel would allow plants
getting new, voluntary permits to use pollution controls considered
``best'' 10 years ago. Traditional permits, required at new and
substantially modified plants, mandate controls that are now
considered the best technology.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa made its commitment because of the flexibility that
provision allows, spokesman Jim Hodson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company cannot estimate the amount of emissions it will
eliminate with a voluntary permit, but there will be substantial
reductions in some pollutant categories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa earlier said it would get a permit for part of its
Rockdale plant, and the Friday announcement extended that
commitment to the rest of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Marquez, a Bush appointee to the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, said the company's expanded promise is
``very significant,'' because it means companies responsible for 63
percent of the state's grandfathered emissions have volunteered to
reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those companies will get traditional permits, while some
intend to apply for new-style voluntary permits that pending
legislation would authorize, Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies will erase its grandfathered emissions
entirely, he said, and reductions will vary from plant to plant,
depending on circumstances.

   KUKES, Albania _ The shelling of the outskirts of this city full
of Kosovo refugees and the increasingly bold presence of the Kosovo
Liberation Army here have raised concerns that the city itself may
come under attack by Serb shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Five Serb rocket-fired cluster bombs presumably aimed at an
encampment of the rebel group west of Kukes fell on farm fields
four miles from the city on Thursday afternoon. A young goatherd
hit by shrapnel had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The daylight bombing, along with a series of other cross-border
shellings in the last week in the cities of Tropoja and Kruma, has
the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees working on
contingency plans to handle casualties if a bomb were to strike the
city, which is now home to more than 75,000 refugees and 20,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors, who confirmed the attack, say they
believe that as many refugees as possible should be encouraged, or
even forced, to leave the city, which is only 10 miles from the
border, for safer exile farther away from the war front.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
identified the bombs as 262-millimeter cluster bombs, self-guided
rockets that are not very accurate but that can be rigged to
explode in the air and shower the ground with many small explosives
or deadly mines.
</P>
<P>
   Kukes is within range of Serb rockets, and the European security
organization fears that the rebel encampment in the city will be
targeted sooner or later. ``It's a probability that can't be ruled
out,'' said Eugene O'Sullivan, a spokesman for the organization.
``The Serbians appear to be well informed about the movements and
actions of the KLA''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian farmers in the lakeside hamlet of Kolsh reported seeing
the rockets come over the mountains and head toward them around
5:30 on Thursday afternoon. Shaban Gika, 12, said he was playing
near his father's car when he heard the first rocket explode as it
hit the ground. The others detonated in the air, he said, and threw
out many small bombs that are now hidden in the underbrush on his
father's farm.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin Bilbil, 19, was tending his goats when he was hit in
the chest, arms and legs, by shrapnel from one of the bombs. He was
taken to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Xhyle Doqi, a 40-year-old woman who lives with her six
children in an old stone farmhouse on a verdant hillside facing
Kukes, said she saw dark smoke after the first bomb fell and that
made her afraid.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew that there was a rebel camp nearby, but, she
said, ``they are on the other side of the hill.'' She didn't know
how many members of the separatist militia were there, but she
thought there were many more men than a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, a disorganized and often undisciplined fighting group,
has sent out a worldwide call for volunteers. Many ethnic Albanians
who left Kosovo in the last decade for the United States, Canada
and a number of European countries have come flooding to Albania
with the intention of volunteering.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them end up in this area. The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe believes that the encampment near Kolsh
is newly built but has expanded considerably since the NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Within Kukes itself, the Kosovo rebel army has taken over an
industrial compound and is using it as a boot camp where young
recruits, and possibly men who are forced into volunteering, are
given uniforms, guns and some training before being dispatched to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The local commander, a stocky man in fatigues who is referred to
only as Rushdi, came out of his office but refused to give any
details about the rebel operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have directives not to say anything to the press right
now,'' he said. ``Maybe in a few days, but not now.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which is coordinating a large part of the
relief effort for the 75,000 refugees who remain in Kukes, along
with 25,000 in the region and the thousands who stream across the
border every day _ (more than 9,000 Friday) _ has been aware of the
danger from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Kamil, the security adviser to the United Nations in
Kukes, said the organization's own guidelines call for settling
refugees at least 30 miles away from a war front. But there has
been little realistic alternative to using Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning we said the refugees should not remain
in Kukes because the area has a limited capacity and because of
security concerns for the refugees,'' Kamil said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clear danger, the United Nations cannot force
refugees to move on, even for their own safety. ``After all, the
refugees came by their own means and they can move if they want
to,'' Kamil said, ``but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be at least two primary reasons why so many
Kosovo refugees have remained in Kukes. Many believe they will
return to their homes in Kosovo, and want to remain close to the
border. And despite the language they share with Albanians, many
Kosovars feel lost in this country, with nowhere to go.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is the case even though almost any place would seem to have
more to offer than this city, with its questionable safety and
fragile network of services.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the soaring, snow-covered mountains that form a
picturesque background behind it, this city is harsh. Almost
nothing works. The potholes in the streets exceed the areas that
retain their asphalt. Garbage is rarely picked up, the streets are
scoured by dusty winds, and rainwater turns stagnant and evaporates
before it drains away.
</P>
<P>
   Adding almost 100,000 refugees and their thousands of tractors
has only made things worse. People live in the town park and around
the striking white Mosque of Salim Ben Mahfuz, which stands on the
edge of a cliff overlooking the river. Any stairwell or wall that
offers even the suggestion of privacy has been used as a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the dreadful conditions, the dangerous presence of
the Kosovo rebel army, and the recent bombings that most refugees
saw, there is no rush to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least here we are near Kosovo and if this is all settled we
can just go back,'' said Sevdie Rafshi, 41, who arrived here with
her family from Dulje in western Kosovo 10 days ago. They live on a
tractor that has been rigged with plastic sheets and old grain
sacks to keep out some of the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovars rode on their tractors when they left their land,
and the thought of leaving them behind to go to Tirana, the
Albanian capital, or other places is simply unthinkable, even if it
means avoiding the danger of being bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We escaped from the war once and now the war is finding us
again,'' said Berisha Sagit, 24, who came from Peje on her family's
tractor. ``So we'll stay here, where we will be closer to Kosovo,
and if they bomb us it's nothing big because we're used to it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Leonard Riggio was a night student at New York
University, he coped with the droning tedium of business lectures
by snatching a strategic seat behind a student with a broad back
and, he says, losing himself in the pages of the ``History of the
Peloponnesian War.''
</P>
<P>
   He found the classes in business policy and management so dull,
in fact, that he dropped out in 1965. But life is a circle and now
Riggio's $3 billion company _ engaged in its own battles _ is a
case study for first-year M.B.A. students at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   The graduate students are pondering the rise of Riggio, a
Brooklyn-bred entrepreneur, from bored student to chief executive
of Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookselling chain. And for
their final exam in April, they will try to answer the very
question that confronts the complex and restless Riggio:
</P>
<P>
   In an industry roiled by technological advances, with
bookselling reduced to bits and bytes and two-day delivery and
profits a distant concern for the company's most worrisome
competitor, what exactly is Barnes &AMP; Noble's future?
</P>
<P>
   As he searches for answers, the chief executive may want to crib
the students' notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in my lifetime, I can't see five years
ahead the way I used to,'' Riggio said, both of the book business
and retailing in general. ``I can't see it clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   At 58, with salt-and-pepper hair and Brooklyn still in his
voice, Riggio has presided over so many transformations in his 30
years of bookselling that it seems no surprise that he says one of
his favorite books is ``The Metamorphosis'' by Franz Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio was largely responsible for the book industry's last
metamorphosis _ the advent of the superstore, which in the '90s has
come to dominate the literary landscape with airy temples of
titles, comfortable chairs and the fragrance of espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Riggio is navigating his New York-based company through
another metamorphosis. A pioneer among big, traditional retailers,
he is taking his online business, Barnesandnoble.com, public, as
Amazon.com and the Internet spin their web around eager investors
and growing numbers of book customers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the challenges and risks are greater than ever for a
man who considers himself at his core a shopkeeper _ albeit one
with a private jet, a de Kooning bronze on the three-acre lawn of
his Hamptons estate and a Picasso displayed in his Manhattan
townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   With his industry's future in flux, Riggio is hedging his bets,
anticipating that customers will feel equally comfortable lingering
in superstores to scan the latest hardcovers, or shopping for
exotic titles on line or downloading a bestseller from a home
computer into a 22-ounce electronic reader. As in many of his
transforming acts, he is building on others' early work _ in this
case Amazon's, much as he did before by following Borders Group
with a cafe or expanding on Bookstop's development of the
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period at the beginning of the Internet where I
didn't get it. Most people didn't get it,'' Riggio said in one of a
series of interviews over the last few months. ``I came to it at
first slowly, and then very, very quickly.'' Ultimately, he said,
``we jumped into the Internet business head first; we made big
investments in capital, big investments in organization, big
personal commitments to the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Man of Metamorphoses
</P>
<P>
   His first transformation came almost 35 years ago, when, as a
24-year-old dropout, he invested $5,000 of borrowed money in a
bookstore called Student Book Exchange near the NYU campus. Six
years later, in 1971, he bought Barnes &AMP; Noble, then a floundering
bookstore in Manhattan's Flatiron district.
</P>
<P>
   Later Riggio expanded into popular books, buying the B. Dalton
mall store chain in 1986. And today, his more than 520 superstores
plus 500 mall stores are so much a part of the landscape _ and seen
as so threatening by independent booksellers _ that the conflict
provided the story line for the recent movie, ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Riggio has seen the film. There's little spare time in
his life for movies or the novel that he's been promising to write
for some 10 years. He dutifully clears his schedule for his
15-year-old daughter's basketball games, but his chip shot is
languishing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his mind is on the hazy tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the changes in the book business, it's the
changes in retail, the changes in the way we live,'' Riggio said.
With the Internet revolution, he said, sometimes ``I wake up and
say that any business created before 1997 is going to be a fossil
by the year 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid collector of late 20th-century art, Riggio compares the
fluid future to a Fred Sandback art installation _ two strings
suspended from ceiling to floor. The gap between them is like
everything that existed before and after the Internet, Riggio said;
successful people will understand intuitively, he said, that the
space is ``real and not imaginary, yet be able to walk through it,
whole, on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics may look at the strings and see just strings. But
Riggio is trying to lead his company on both sides of the divide,
steadily building new superstores into a chain that he expects
could eventually number 1,000 (though the expansion has slowed to
about 50 this year from about 90 a year) while investing heavily in
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company said that it would make a $200 million
initial public offering of shares in Barnesandnoble.com; an
offering announced in September was postponed because Bertelsmann
AG bought a 50 percent stake in the electronic venture. The intent
is to spend much of the proceeds to market the Web site, which had
online sales of $70.2 million for the year, versus $610 million at
Amazon.com and $4.6 million at Borders. (Barnes &AMP; Noble has a
business tie to The New York Times, selling books through links
from the newspaper's Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, of course, is that Amazon unabashedly declares that
it loses money on every sale as it grabs market share from Barnes &AMP;
Noble and other traditional bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts estimate that by the end of this year, online
sales will account for about 5 percent of the popular book market.
And while it is still not clear what percentage of customers are
shifting their purchases to the Internet, projections show sales
growth online far exceeding gains at superstores over the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   For industry experts that raises the question of whether
Riggio's electronic offspring will only speed the process,
cannibalizing sales from his bricks-and-mortar outlets _ a scenario
that could place some of his superstores in the same jeopardy as
the independent bookstores forced to close when they could no
longer compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting in a Citicorp building with a Barnes &AMP; Noble in
the building, and I just feel like it's throwing away money to buy
a book in their store, because it's cheaper and easier to find a
book on line,'' said Craig Bibb, a managing partner at Jasper
Funds, a hedge fund that has sold its Barnes &AMP; Noble's holdings.
``You're already seeing a market-share shift, and to reduce that
difference, they're going to have to cut prices at the stores,
which could have a tremendous negative effect on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   (Indeed, by offering discounts up to 40 percent on hardcover
books and 20 percent on paperbacks, Barnesandnoble.com is already
undercutting the superstores, although shipping and handling fees
narrow the price difference.)
</P>
<P>
   Other investors seem anxious, too. Barnes &AMP; Noble stock rose
more than 20 percent on the news of the planned Internet spin-off,
but at a Friday close of $36, the shares are still down 15 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Amazon, which closed the week at $190, is up 77
percent for the year. And while the No. 2 bookseller, Borders
Group, got a nice bounce in the market last week when executives
made clear that they planned to concentrate on terra firma, not the
Internet, its stock has fared even worse than Barnes &AMP; Noble's.
(Borders closed Friday at $17.1875, down 31 percent for the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Riggio has a much more expansive view of the horizon. Electronic
commerce, he said, will become a seamless part of his empire,
ultimately increasing the amount of purchases per customer.
</P>
<P>
   He is reluctant to talk in any detail about Barnesandnoble.com
because the company has entered the quiet period after the
registration of its public offering. But in general, he said that
``there's no question that the book market is expanding _ rapidly
expanding _ because of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, it seems as if he is still getting accustomed
to the new world.
</P>
<P>
   During the rollout of the superstores in the early '90s, he was
known to calculate where the sunlight would fall on a potential
real estate location or demand a sudden change in lighting at 4
a.m. before a store opening.
</P>
<P>
   He is leaving those kinds of details to others at
Barnesandnoble.com, where he is chairman. Though Riggio has dreamed
up some of the Internet unit's bold advertising, he says he has
time to log onto the Web site itself only about once every two
weeks. Earlier in April, his secretary asked that an e-mail for
Riggio be sent to her; his computer had crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal, But Prickly
</P>
<P>
   But Riggio is a man of many contradictions _ tough, yet shy;
generous with charities and his employees, yet prickly about
criticism, whether it comes in news articles or Wall Street analyst
reports or the public comments of publishers and literary agents.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 18 years, Louise Riggio, says her husband keeps to
himself because ``it's his way of functioning.'' That private
nature is reflected in the couple's low-key approach to charity.
They recently donated more than $700,000 to the Children's Defense
Fund to create a library on the farm of the late author Alex Haley
in Tennessee. Instead of placing their names on the building, they
suggested the poet Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of a dressmaker and a cabdriver, Riggio grew up
in Bensonhurst. He skipped two grades, and says that he hustled at
sports to make up for being younger than his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a neighborhood of southern Italian immigrants where
``everyone was poor, but was not aware of that fact,'' recalled one
boyhood friend, Angelo Volpe, president of Tennessee Tech
University, in Cookeville. Volpe remembered games of stickball,
sandlot baseball and afternoons spent lingering outside Tony
Millaci's Candy Store. ``Almost everyone had a name which ended in
ee: Johnny, Jimmy, Patsy, Joey, Vinnie, Albie, Angie and, of
course, Lenny.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Riggio is known as Lenny at corporate headquarters
on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in Manhattan, across from the
original Barnes &AMP; Noble store. His youngest brother, who is vice
chairman of the company and presides over Internet and retail
acquisitions, is Stevie. The middle brother, Jimi, works for a
trucking company that provides services to Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees have worked with Riggio for decades _ and
benefitted from his generosity in giving stock options to
lower-level workers when he took Barnes &AMP; Noble public in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They have also benefited from his loyalty. Bill Maloney, a
senior vice president at Riggio's privately held Barnes &AMP; Noble
College Bookstores, has worked his entire 28-year career for the
company. Five of Maloney's relatives also work in Barnes &AMP; Noble
stores. Twelve years ago, when Maloney's wife was dying of cancer,
Riggio visited her in the hospital to promise that he would pay for
her children's college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny does some of the most thoughtful things,'' Maloney said.
``He stopped and thought of what would be on this woman's mind
beyond getting well. And he just wanted to take those things off
her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggio can become emotional discussing the mentors in his life _
among them his father, Steve, whom he describes as ``a
highly-ranked prizefighter whose claim to fame was in twice
defeating Rocky Graziano, which had never happened before.'' So it
is no surprise that Riggio's soft side is balanced by a sharp edge
readily exposed to counterparts in negotiations or conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to have his way,'' said one publisher who has
encountered Riggio's fixed stares during discussions about sales
terms. ``He looks across the table and says, `Let me get this
straight: After all the money I've invested in these stores, and
all the sales increases you've had since, you want to come in my
office and say you're changing your terms? I don't think you want
to do it and I'm not going to accept it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even partners pick their words carefully in describing Riggio.
Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas Middelhoff declined to talk
about him for this article, instead issuing a brief statement.
Riggio's ``energy and vision,'' it said, have ``been a tremendous
source of inspiration for those who are serious about the book
business.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ingram, chief executive of the Ingram Book Group, a
wholesaler that Barnes &AMP; Noble is acquiring for $600 million as a
back office for its Internet push, was even more circumspect. ``He
is fair and consistent in his views,'' Ingram said repeatedly,
preferring not to say more.
</P>
<P>
   Not Ancient History
</P>
<P>
   When NYU's new class of 400 business students started examining
Riggio's book empire this year, some did so with the zest that he
says he once applied, at roughly the same age, to reading
Thucydides.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing into more than 70 teams, they studied census figures to
determine customer growth and to calculate the total book-buying
population. They examined competitors' strategies. They considered
electronic devices, like the $500 Rocket E-books made by Nuvo
Media, in which Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble have invested.
Essentially, these are miniature computers with enough memory to
download about 10 books.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have not delivered their presentations yet. But one
group has decided that Riggio needs to make some of the choices
that he so far has avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many strong competitors on too many fronts, and
the Internet is such a risky undertaking,'' said Jenny Rigg, a
25-year-old student from Boston. ``Barnes &AMP; Noble needs to make a
decision to streamline their business. They have to decide whether
it's a superstore or an Internet company.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wall Street's analysts, the students questioned whether
there would be enough growth in book sales to sustain both the
online explosion and the steady addition of new superstores. Ms.
Rigg's team favored pursuing electronic commerce but tapering off
the construction of new superstores to as few as six in 2003 and
taking steps to make stores indispensable to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Professional analysts have arrived at similar conclusions. Of
all booksellers, ``the big-box superstores are the most at risk,''
said Kate Delhagen, who tracks Internet commerce for Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   But however daunting the future seems, Riggio is not prepared to
concede anything. Certainly not the online market. The Internet, he
said, is the ``most exciting thing that ever happened _ not only in
our industry, but I do believe in our lifetime, and sometimes, I
believe, in the history of human affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   And he isn't going to retreat from the brick-and-bookshelf
world, either. He said Barnes &AMP; Noble was working to make stores
more efficient. But he is reluctant to say more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time from which you say you are going to do something and
it is copied, is like that,'' Riggio said with a snap of his
fingers. ``So I don't want to say anything. I just want to do it.''

ROBERT SACHS, THEORETICAL PHYSICIST, DIES AT 82  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md., Mass.)   By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert G. Sachs, a theoretical physicist who once served as
director of the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, died on
Wednesday at the University of Chicago Medical Center. He was 82
and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from surgery, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs was known for playing an important role in his field both
as administrator and policy maker, and as a theorist who,
especially in later years, tried to explain some of the more
mystifying behavior of subatomic particles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 and 1947, he helped to create Argonne, a research
laboratory owned by the government and managed by the University of
Chicago. He was a director at the university's Metallurgical
Laboratory, which in 1942 created the first controlled nuclear
chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as associate director of Argonne from 1964 to 1968, Sachs
helped determine which scientists would be able to make use of the
lab's new particle accelerator, the zero gradient synchotron.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs returned to teaching in 1968. Although his early work had
been in nuclear physics _ his 1953 book, ``Nuclear Theory,'' was
considered a standard text for years _ he later devoted himself to
the study of particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially interested in developing theories about the
asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe, and the
physics of what scientists refer to as ``time reversal.'' In that
field, the behavior of subatomic particles is examined for clues
to, among other things, the nature of time.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who study time reversal often use the example of two
billiard balls on a table to explain their theories. If a film is
made of the balls colliding, they note, a viewer would see nothing
amiss if it was shown to them running backward: the same physical
laws seem to apply, in other words, whichever direction time is
running.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists have known for more than three decades that with
certain particles, the rules appear different. It is as if two and
two were added together to make four, but when two was then
subtracted from the sum, the result was not the expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would like to have a theory of elementary particles that
essentially explains everything that they do,'' said Roger
Hildebrand, a physicist who worked with Sachs for decades. ``We
come very close to that. But there are some things that just don't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs' last book, published in 1987 by the University of Chicago
Press, was ``The Physics of Time Reversal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also credited with creating a new division at the
American Physical Society, the principal professional society for
physicists, for scientists studying particles and fields.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Green Sachs was born on May 4, 1916, in Hagerstown, Md.
He received his doctorate in 1939 from Johns Hopkins University and
began teaching. Among his students was Hyman G. Rickover, who later
established the Navy's nuclear submarine program. After teaching
for three years, Sachs joined the Ballistic Research Laboratory at
the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs was hired by the University of Chicago in 1964, and
directed the Argonne lab from 1973 to 1979. He was also director of
the university's Enrico Fermi Institute from 1968 to 1973, and from
1983 to 1986, when he became professor emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said that Sachs, who was also a dedicated sailor,
remained active in his field until his death.
</P>
<P>

MARY LUTYENS, ENGLISH EDITOR, NOVELIST AND BIOGRAPHER, DIES AT 90  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Great Britain)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Lutyens, a well-born English biographer and novelist who
was applauded by critics on both side of the Atlantic, died on
April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English
county of Dorset.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin
Landseer Lutyens, the British architect who planned New Delhi and
many of its government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace.
Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the first earl of
Lytton, a poet and a viceroy of India.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary.
In London, The Independent noted, ``She was famous for her dry
martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to
Cole Porter for exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of
her biographies, which included ``Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968).
Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter
and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John
Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose
wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun
noted: ``Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for
the editing of Victorian letters _ a trophy long in American hands.
In `Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with
editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many
previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a
passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to
the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general
reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection
of letters, ``Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in
The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ``admirably
and discreetly edited.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the
Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They
include ``Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ``Cleo'' (1974),
which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ``flawless
tour de force.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before
attending Queens College, London. She became a writer in her early
20s.
</P>
<P>
   She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced
in 1945. Later that year she married J.G. Links, an art expert
known as Joe, who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.

SOME MARINE FLIGHT TRAINING TO BE MOVED FROM ITALY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the United States strictly observing Italian
rules on low-altitude flights since a Marine jet severed a ski
gondola cable last year, killing 20 people, Italy is now unsuitable
for some essential training, an American admiral said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, Joseph Prueher, who disclosed part of a report on
new flight rules that he wrote with Lt. Gen. Leonardo Tricarico of
the Italian Air Force, said the United States is looking for other
training sites, including in Tunisia and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Italian rules require a minimum altitude of 2,000 feet above the
ground, and that is too high to practice ``terrain masking,'' or
sneaking into the battle theater between the mountains, the
technique that the EA-6B Prowler was practicing at the time of the
gondola accident, Prueher said.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian official, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Bernardis, speaking at
the same briefing, said that his country, too, was looking for new
sites for low-level training; most of the Italian training is done
in Nevada, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the report, made public Friday, calls for a variety
of steps to improve adherence to Italian rules. The full report was
not released.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains information that conforms with previous
military investigations that say the primary cause of the accident
was error by the crew. The pilot and navigator testified that they
thought they were supposed to stay at 1,000 feet above the ground;
the cable they struck was at about 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also faulted other officers, saying that ``the
primary guarantor of flight safety is unit/command leadership that
demands thoughtful, disciplined adherence to established
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``Supervisory error occurred with the air
crew's chain of command.'' Prueher noted that the squadron
commander and safety officer had been relieved of command after the
crash, which occurred on Feb. 3, 1998. The pilot was acquitted of
negligence but faces charges of obstruction of justice; the
navigator was convicted of that charge and faces expulsion from the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, which Defense Secretary William Cohen and
Defense Minister Carlo Scognamiglio of Italy signed at a Pentagon
ceremony Friday morning and sent on to President Clinton and Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema, would designate an American commander at
each Italian air base to assure that American crews were fully
cognizant of all local rules.
</P>
<P>
   The report does not call for fixing American navigation charts
that omit the gondola cables and scores of similar obstructions in
Italy, but Prueher said that such materials would be available to
crews, as part of improved briefing procedures.

THE GREAT SCHMOOZE: DAVIDSON DIDN'T ASK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Davidson, the Rangers' MSG Network and Fox
analyst, never asked Wayne Gretzky about retiring. Three times
since last week, Davidson told television audiences with increasing
certainty that the end was near for Gretzky's career. He said on
Fox last Sunday that retirement was an 80 percent possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Davidson, the former Rangers goaltender who flies on the
team charter and usually sits with Gretzky, never directly asked
Gretzky the retirement question. Their relationship is not quite
journalistic; instead, it is a bond between a former and a current
player, a connection between two savvy National Hockey League
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to put him on the spot,'' Davidson said Friday,
when he was host for Gretzky's retirement news conference at
Madison Square Garden. ``I thought it was an invasion of his
privacy to ask. I'm not sure when he became 100 percent. But it was
up to him to tell the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time Davidson aired his reports about the retirement, he
called Gretzky, who never warned him off.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said the signals were evident. Gretzky's father,
Walter, said his son was considering retirement. Davidson watched
Gretzky crying on the bench in last Wednesday's game at Chicago. He
heard Gretzky was collecting pucks and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing hints,'' Davidson said. ``A lot of people said
he was leaning toward retiring, including his father. I wanted to
alert people that the greatest player ever might retire. But I
wasn't looking for a scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said Gretzky was unaware of how intense the coverage
would become once fans and the news media learned he was
considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell him, `If you're leaving, it's going to cause a
lot of interest,''' Davidson said. ``I don't think he understood
how big it would become.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the charter flight home Thursday night from Ottawa,
where Gretzky played his final game in Canada, the talk was not
about retirement, but about Gretzky's elation about having played
well in the Rangers' 2-2 tie against the senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, he threw a pass to a winger that was one of the
best he'd ever made,'' Davidson said. ``No one could pass the puck
like him and still, there are very few who can pass the puck as
well as he does now.''
</P>
<P>
   The in-flight banter between Gretzky and Davidson centers on
hockey. ``We schmooze,'' Davidson said. ``When we're on charters or
on Tarmacs, we talk about hockey in this city or that, hockey
issues, rules changes, the stuff I pull off the Internet. And when
we play golf, we talk hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky usually sits in the middle area of the plane, with the
broadcasters, public relations staff and the team trainer. The news
media following the Rangers do not fly on the charter, giving
Davidson access that no beat reporter possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rosen, Davidson's MSG partner, described the
Gretzky-Davidson relationship as very close.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's been close to a lot of players,'' Rosen said. ``He's
respected as a former player and a top broadcaster. Players know if
there's something they say that they don't want getting out, he
won't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said during his conversations with Gretzky, he caught
himself starting to talk his friend out of retiring. ``But I caught
myself,'' Davidson said. ``Who am I to tell him or ask him what to
do? I could have said, `We could use you next year, and imagine the
farewell tour.' But that's not for him emotionally. He can still
play. He knows he's pretty good some nights, but not as good other
nights. It drives him nuts. It gets him frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson was a Rangers goaltender when he first encountered
Gretzky, then a young Edmonton Oiler, in the early 1980s. ``I think
I played him only three times,'' Davidson said. ``He had some
assists. I remember one game in Edmonton, he was flattened on a
play, but came back and assisted on the game-winner. At that time,
I had a personal 10-game winning streak and that stopped that.''
</P>
<P>
   After his own retirement following the 1982-83 season, Davidson
got to know Gretzky and Mark Messier, his Edmonton teammate, when
he broadcast Oilers games for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later, Davidson, along with Mike Emrick, will
describe Gretzky's farewell game. Tomorrow afternoon's
Rangers-Penguins game will be carried partly on the Fox-owned
Channel 5 (after the Yankees game ends) and in its entirety on MSG.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done seventh games of Stanley Cup finals, the Olympics,
All-Star Games, the World Cup, but this may be the topper for me,''
Davidson said.

HOW BEST TO HITCH A RIDE ON A HIGHFLYING INDEX? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, April 18.) 
 By ALISON ROGERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a flurry of newspaper advertisements and cable television
commercials, the Nasdaq-100 Shares unit trust made its debut last
month, and it is now safe to call it a major marketing hit. The
trust, listed on the American Stock Exchange, trades an average of
over 4 million shares a day, making it the most successful product
rollout in Amex history in terms of volume.
</P>
<P>
   The shares are perhaps the simplest way for investors to trade
the sizzling Nasdaq 100 Composite index, that amalgam of growth
stocks that has skyrocketed as investors flock to the technology,
telecommunications and consumer growth stocks it contains, from
Cisco Systems to MCI Worldcom to Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   As with other such unit investment trusts, there is little
management involved: stocks are bought and sold only to match the
index.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq 100 index zoomed 85.3 percent last year, and is up
13.6 per cent this year. But investors who bought into the index
believing it to be a relatively broad-based benchmark _ similar,
say, to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index _ are mistaken. It is
the Nasdaq 100's concentration on a few favored stocks that has
made it such an outstanding performer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest five stocks in the index _ Microsoft, Intel, Cisco
Systems, MCI Worldcom, and Dell Computer, account for 40 percent of
its value. (Microsoft alone is 16 percent.) By comparison, the five
largest stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 account for just 13 percent of that
benchmark's value.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no arguing with the Nasdaq 100's results. For
investors who want to buy into the index, the question is whether
the Nasdaq-100 Shares trust makes more sense than other paths with
similar goals.
</P>
<P>
   Two mutual funds, Rydex OTC and Profunds Ultra OTC, track the
index, but in quite different ways. The Rydex fund is an index fund
explicitly tied to the Nasdaq 100. The Profunds Ultra OTC uses
futures and options to magnify the index's returns.
</P>
<P>
   There are other variables, too. The Nasdaq-100 Shares trust
allows for much smaller minimum investments: An investor can buy a
lone share, which closed on Friday at $103.9375. An investor can
buy a lone share, which closed on Friday at $103.9375. By contrast,
the minimum investment is $25,000 for the Rydex OTC fund and
$15,000 for Profunds Ultra OTC.
</P>
<P>
   The unit trust's expenses are lower, too, at 0.18 percent of
assets under management, versus 1.1 percent for Rydex OTC and 1.07
percent for Ultra OTC. While such differences may seem minor when
an index is climbing 86 percent a year, they assume greater
importance if returns fall. Investors trading trust shares,
however, have to pay brokerage commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steele, vice president of the Rydex Series Trust, based
in Rockville, Md., said investors might face larger spreads _ the
differences between the bid and offered prices _ on unit trust
trades than they would through a fund, especially in periods of
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may want to base their decision on liquidity _ how
quickly they want to accumulate or sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   James Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Barrington, Ill.,
points out that an investor can buy or sell the unit trust at the
current price of the index throughout the trading day. When buying
or selling shares of a mutual fund, you almost always get the
closing price for that trading day, or the final price the next
day, if the order is placed after the close.
</P>
<P>
   That could leave you open to price swings of 10 percent or more
in an index as volatile as the Nasdaq 100. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SOUND IDEAS FOR POLICE REFORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 17:
</P>
<P>
   The marchers at Thursday's rally on police reform in New York
City used the event to promote a 10-point plan for improving police
policies first proposed by a group of community and business
leaders last month. While we differ on some details, the plan is a
useful outline for change. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani should welcome a
serious dialogue on its principles, several of which were
recommended by a task force on police conduct that he himself
appointed after the attack on Abner Louima in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has instituted part of the 10-point agenda, increasing
minority recruitment efforts and training for the Street Crime
unit. But in the past he has opposed or brushed aside other
elements that deserve support.
</P>
<P>
   A primary purpose of the agenda is to improve oversight of
police conduct and internal investigations, a departmental weakness
long evident to community leaders and criminal justice experts. The
plan rightly calls for the creation of an independent audit panel,
as recommended by the Mollen Commission, with full power to issue
subpoenas and investigate police corruption and brutality. The
Police Department would still have primary responsibility for
detecting and preventing corruption and misconduct, but the panel
would be a credible external monitoring force.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has fought this idea, and has tied up City Council
legislation creating such a panel in two separate lawsuits. But the
lack of faith, particularly in minority communities, in the
department's ability to police itself makes an independent review
function more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would strengthen and increase funding for the Civilian
Complaint Review Board, which would still be needed to investigate
individual misconduct complaints by members of the public. It also
proposes a special prosecutor for police brutality and corruption
cases, which should not be necessary if the independent panel can
refer findings of criminal activity directly to prosecuting
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's own task force had already recommended three
important elements of the plan. One would end the 48-hour rule that
now gives officers charged with violations of department rules two
days before they are questioned by investigators. That right, which
should be deleted from the next labor contract, makes it too easy
for officers to cover up misdeeds by giving them time to concoct a
story. A second would increase pay for officers.
</P>
<P>
   A third would impose a a city residency requirement, although
this would require a change in state law. Since that is likely to
be politically difficult, it may be more productive to provide
further incentives to entice officers to live in the city. In
addition, the plan appropriately urges periodic review of police
weapons and tactics, such as the use of hollow-point bullets.
</P>
<P>
   None of these proposals need diminish the mayor's power to run
the Police Department. Giuliani may well be able to improve on
elements of the plan, but it looks to be a sensible place to start.

EDITORIAL: THE GENEROSITY OF JOHN SINGER SARGENT  
DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 17: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a room full of John Singer Sargent's portraits, a certain
augustness smites the viewer. The figures of Lord Dalhousie and
Lord Ribblesdale, of Sir Frank Swettenham and Madame X form a
striking assembly. They could not, at first glance, be more unlike
the casual crowd that wanders, in the loose clothing and
comfortable shoes of resolute sightseers, through the National
Gallery in Washington, where the Sargent exhibition is on display
until May 31. No matter how you dress, there is something a little
intimidating about Dalhousie, Ribblesdale et al., even if it is
nothing more than the height at which they hang from the walls, a
height that forces them to look down upon you.
</P>
<P>
   But Sargent does not seem to buy the augustness of these
figures. The faces and the postures are too revealing. It is as
though Sargent has caught each of his subjects in a mirror-image of
their own making, a moment when they are left alone to contemplate
themselves. Sargent seems to engulf these figures in his own
virtuosity, the disparity between the substance of these wealthy
men and women and their heirs and the imaginative power of mere
pigment and brushwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Carl Meyer and Her Children,'' for instance, is nothing
less than a fantasy on the premise of portraiture. The three faces
in this painting, which Sargent created in 1896, practically quiver
with identity. To everything else in the room _ the profusion of
satin Mrs. Meyer wears, the book flung beside her on the sofa, the
sofa itself _ Sargent has brought the intensity of his own focus in
brush strokes that, seen up close, look almost ephemeral, just the
residue of his touch. But that is Sargent. He appears to be a
genius of visage, when in fact he is a genius of light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of exhibition where a viewer feels the loss as
each picture is left behind. That is especially true of several
paintings that are not portraits _ ``Capri'' (1878), ``In the
Luxembourg Gardens'' (1879), ``Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose''
(1885-6), and ``Home Fields'' (about 1885). In these works the
viewer is allowed to stand within the light surrounding Sargent at
his easel, or more accurately the light filling Sargent's mind as
he put brush to canvas. It is not the light before you that you
sense but the light that would enfold you if the painting's horizon
reached behind you. These works evoke the quality that allows a
viewer to love even the austere facade of Ribblesdale or Henry
James. What we see, first and last, is the visual warmth, as well
as the insurrection, of Sargent's generosity. &QL;

ESPN TURNED DRAFT INTO GRIPPING TV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN's NFL draft TV marathon featuring Mel Kiper Jr. has proven
so popular with viewers that the network ought to consider a
spin-off sports program.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative title: The ESPN Major League Baseball Draft featuring
... who else? Duane Kuiper.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants second
baseman doesn't have Kiper's hair, but he's got his name, or at
least one with the same pronunciation. He's broadcast-friendly,
too, having gone on to a sports announcing career when his playing
days were finished.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kuiper can turn the baseball draft into the same sort of
edge-of-your-seat spectacle the football pickfest has become thanks
in large measure to Kiper and his know-it-all exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think this a joke, be advised that back before ESPN
started its pro football draft coverage 20 years ago the event was
conducted on a Tuesday morning, and the only media present were the
local beat writers and a stray camera crew expecting a slow day.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when ESPN begins its coverage at 11 a.m., it will have a
nationwide TV audience, cameras inside the ``war rooms'' of four
NFL teams and video conferencing hook-ups with 20 other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a benchload of ex-jocks around to do
player-by-player and team-by-team analysis in the New York and
Bristol, Conn., studios, plus field reporters reporting from
selected cities.
</P>
<P>
   With all that technology and staffing available, ESPN will need
hours and hours of air time to make full use of it. And they'll
have the time. Coverage on ESPN runs to 6 p.m. today, when it
switches over to ESPN2, which will run with the ball until 9 p.m.
ESPN picks things back up at 10 a.m. tomorrow and carries Day Two
of the draft until noon. ESPN2 takes it home to 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing ESPN's always been is thorough,'' understated
ESPN draft-day host Chris Berman. ``Technology's allowed us to
branch out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be easy to go in there and sit down in a chair, roll
highlights and talk, then go to a commercial and come back and do
the same thing,'' said the show's producer, Jay Rothman. ``But our
viewers have an expectation. Our viewers have a thirst, really, for
who this player is and how \Rchoosing him\s affects their team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will get the video-conferencing treatment this
weekend, allowing for live, one-on-one interviews with Dallas
coaches and personnel. The network will not have a reporter on site
at Valley Ranch, however, or a war-room camera.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Jerry Jones era, ESPN has been all over the
Cowboys on draft day with a war-room camera in place and reporter
Chris Myers on the scene. Myers, who had developed a comfortable
relationship with Jones and company, has moved on to Fox, though,
and the Cowboys have lost some of their luster thanks to a lower
draft slot.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN executives would like to have a camera in every team's war
room and a reporter at every draft site, but that's not
economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of resources,'' Rothman explained. ``It's
really a financial or budget issue.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, war-room cameras will be located at draft
headquarters in Cleveland, Miami, Minnesota and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   Why, Jimmy Johnson, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy's the best,'' Rothman said. ``I think he might help us
in terms of where to place the camera. He's always made great
television for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those Valley Ranch days, that is.
</P>
<P>
   While some clubs enjoy the network's attention, others such as
the San Diego Chargers have asked for some peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some teams obviously respond differently to it,'' Rothman said
of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you've drafted like the Chargers have in recent
years, you probably don't want anybody watching.

 &HT;    Doolittle Raiders hold first reunion
 &HT;    By Derek Ali
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ 1st Lt. James H. Macia never imagined the hero
status members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders earned after
successfully attacking Japan on April 18, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Macia doubted the squadron of 16 B-25 bombers would
survive _ seven men died on the mission and 12 more died before the
war ended.
</P>
<P>
   On their way, the U.S. fleet transporting the bombers sank a
Japanese ship and it was believed the ship sent out a radio message
warning the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking those guys knew we were coming,'' Macia said.
That thinking triggered a pre-mature launch of the B-25s, 200 miles
farther out than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated counterattack from Japanese fighter planes never
happened. The Raiders successfully attacked their targets and
brought hope at time when Japan appeared invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Macia and 17 of the 19 surviving pilots, gunners, navigators and
bombardiers who flew with Lt. Co. Jimmy Doolittle on the daring
daylight bombing raid are holding their first reunion at the USAF
Museum since the 1960s this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Raiders signed autographs and shared stories with the
curious in the Kettering Hall, near the museum's B-25 exhibit. In
honor of the 57th anniversary of the Raider's mission, the museum
is hosting a Day with Heroes, with a Memorial Dedication in the
museum's Memorial Park, at 10 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Macia, a retired colonel, said he was the last of Doolittle's
Raiders to retire from active duty in 1973. However, Macia
continues to share stories with the inquisitive and hugs with
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Darke County's Kevan Dilworth, a 12-year-old flight fanatic and
benefactor of a Macia hug, said, ``I want to be a pilot later on. I
find it fascinating, the technology, what we're capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevan counted his meeting with Macia and other members of the
Raiders as an historic event. ``I'm very excited about it. It's a
once in a life time experience and something you want to tell your
kids about. It's being a part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Thatcher, a staff sergeant who served as a gunner on the
bombing mission, was an active part of the history. After the
bombing, his B-25 crashed landed on the China coast. ``It took us a
month to get to Kung King.'' They traveled by train, sedan chairs
and rickshaw. ``The Chinese had blown up all the roads to slow the
advance of the Japanese. All there was was trails down through rice
patties.''

NATO CLAIMS `ONE OF THE BEST NIGHTS' FOR BOMBINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO pilots claimed one of their most successful
nights in the air campaign against Yugoslavia, destroying several
tanks and artillery sites and damaging a large air base on Thursday
night. The warplanes also gathered new photographic evidence to
back up reports of mass killings of Kosovo refugees, NATO and
Clinton administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said relatively clear skies over the Balkans from Thursday
night to Friday morning made it possible for the planes to attack
targets that included an SA-6 surface-to-air missile site near
Belgrade, an ammunition plant, the headquarters of several Serbian
army and policy units and a military airfield in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reported that a total of 57 targets were hit
Thursday and Friday, suggesting that NATO planes were far more
successful than earlier in the campaign, when as few as 12 targets
were hit each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we had some notable successes,'' NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``In fact, it was one of the best nights thus far in
our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that life is becoming increasingly unpleasant for
Serb forces inside Kosovo,'' he added at a news conference at NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Pentagon announced that Kosovar rebels had
seized a Yugoslav army lieutenant in Kosovo and that he was in
American custody as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials acknowledged that despite success in the air,
they had received reports of new atrocities by Serb forces against
Kosovo Albanians uprooted from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic was another step
closer to what appears to be his ultimate goal in Kosovo, the
forced depopulation of the province of what had been its Albanian
majority. Thousands of refugees poured across the borders into
Albania and Montenegro Friday, putting the total number of refugees
reported along Kosovo's borders at more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trickle of refugees that had been going into Albania and
Macedonia has now become a flow,'' said State Department spokesman
James Rubin. ``This is something that greatly troubles us. There
may be up to 50,000 people who are backed up at the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the renewed flood of refugees was explained in part
by reports of a new round of terror by Serbian forces. ``We have
developed new evidence, independently corroborated by refugee
interviews, about mass killings in west-central Kosovo,'' he said.
``This new information about mass killings is another example of
the fact that President Milosevic's policies are aimed toward
killing civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rubin would not describe the evidence in detail, other
administration officials said that photographs taken by American
spy satellites showed rows of freshly dug mass graves west of
Pristina, the provincial capital, and that refugee accounts from
the region suggested that Serbian forces had executed hundreds of
people there in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton rerouted Air Force One Friday on a Democratic
Party fund-raising tour to stop at Selfridge Air National Guard
Base, Mich., to meet 50 volunteer reservists who were scheduled to
leave Friday night for Europe to support the NATO effort.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, Clinton also met privately the family of Staff Sgt.
Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., one of the three
American servicemen whom Serb forces took prisoner last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Friday in metropolitan Detroit, a region where the
president noted that 40,000 Albanian-Americans lived, Clinton said
the United States should help rebuild the Balkans, much as it had
helped rebuild Western Europe with the Marshall Plan after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do for southeastern Europe, including the Balkans,
what was done for Central Europe after the Cold War and for the
battleground nations of Europe after World War II,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said that air strikes were being
conducted around the clock and that they were planning for the
heavy bombing of Yugoslav targets Friday night and early Saturday
morning, in an effort to beat the forecast of heavy clouds for the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Tanjung news agency in Yugoslavia reported that
the main Kosovo airport outside Pristina, Slatino, was hit Friday
night for the fifth time, along with mountaintop radio transmitters
northeast and south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   An wave of NATO attacks before dawn Friday focused on a military
airfield and airport just outside Podgorica, capital of Montenegro,
the smaller republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Western Montenegro government has accused Belgrade of
trying to draw NATO attacks against Serb targets in Montenegran
territory.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Friday that several Yugoslav naval vessels
docked in Montenegro ports had fired on NATO aircraft but that NATO
planes had not fired back so far.
</P>
<P>
   Also reported hit by NATO planes was the largest oil refinery in
Serbia and a bridge over the Danube southeast of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   To cover the costs of the American part of the operation, the
White House is generally expected to ask Congress early next week
for $5.9 billion in emergency spending.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which covers projected spending through the fiscal
year that ends on Sept. 30, includes $5.5 billion for the Pentagon
and $500 million for the State Department, a senior administration
official said. Of that, $650 million to $700 million is focused on
relief aid.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the request was enough ``to sustain the
current forces through the rest of the year.'' That force, the
official said, includes the 48 Apache attack helicopters en route
to Albania, the 300 additional aircraft that Gen. Wesley Clark, the
NATO commander, has requested and the costs of calling as many as
33,000 reservists to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   The first Apache helicopters are now expected to reach Tirana,
Albania, this weekend. The full fleet is not expected to be ready
for combat for several weeks, the Pentagon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Administration official said the appropriation request would not
cover the cost of ground forces, including 4,000 troops that the
United States has promised to a peacekeeping force that would work
in Kosovo under a negotiated settlement.

YUGOSLAV OFFICER, CAUGHT BY KLA, IS IN U.S. CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Albanian rebels in Kosovo have captured a Yugoslav
Army officer and turned him over to Albania, which Friday turned
him over to the U.S. Army in Albania's capital, the Pentagon
announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon immediately declared the officer a prisoner of war.
Eager to draw a distinction with Yugoslavia's treatment of three
American soldiers captured along Macedonia's border on March 31,
officials here emphasized that the officer would be treated in
accordance with the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, a lieutenant whose name was not disclosed, was
captured by fighters with the Kosovo Liberation Army near Junik,
Kosovo, late Tuesday or early Wednesday, a statement by the
Pentagon said. The rebels secreted the lieutenant across the border
to Albania and turned him over to authorities there.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently eager to transfer him to NATO's jurisdiction, the
Albanian government quickly alerted American military officers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Army helicopter flew to an undisclosed spot in remote
northern Albania and returned the officer, evidently unharmed, to
Tirana, the capital, where he remains in American custody, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   At the nascent American base in Tirana, the officer was examined
by a doctor and ``found to be in good condition,'' the statement
said. The Pentagon said arrangements had already been made with the
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the food, shelter and medical care being
provided, religious counseling is being coordinated for him,'' the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of a Yugoslav officer immediately raised the
prospect of a prisoner exchange, though it is not clear whether any
diplomatic channels exist for such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said an exchange was a
possibility but added that it was premature to discuss it. ``The
rules of the Geneva Convention are pretty clear,'' Bacon said.
``He'll remain in our custody until the hostilities end. I don't
think it's time to speculate about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The three American soldiers have been held in Yugoslavia since
their capture in unclear circumstances along the
Yugoslavia-Macedonia border. The three _ Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez,
24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths
Creek, Mich., and Spc. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas
_were among 350 American troops in Macedonia as part of a U.N.
observer mission.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their capture, they were shown on Yugoslav
television, evidently beaten and bruised. After initially
threatening to submit them to a military trial, in violation of the
Geneva Convention, the Yugoslav government declared that it would
treat them as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to free them by the acting president of Cyprus
collapsed a week ago when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
balked, citing the intensification of NATO's bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains that the three were illegally seized
by Yugoslav forces inside Macedonia, though officials concede that
they do not yet know all the circumstances of their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said the captured officer, who was born in
1978, commanded a unit of about 20 men. His unit _ identified in
Serbo-Croatian as the 1st Platoon, 2nd Battalion _ was part of a
larger force conducting operations near Junik, in a valley that has
been the scene of intense fighting throughout the yearlong
separatist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the Yugoslav force included 300 army troops
and 100 paramilitary police. It was not clear how the Kosovar
rebels managed to separate the lieutenant from the rest of his
platoon.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was likely he would be transferred out of
Albania as soon as Saturday, possibly to Italy. In a potentially
awkward legal complication, the Geneva Convention requires nations
to provide protections for prisoners, but makes no explicit
allowance for alliances like NATO's, one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's statement said the prisoner would have the right
to send and receive mail and ``communicate any complaints'' to his
captors.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Clinton administration have stepped up their praise
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, an organization harshly criticized
by the State Department only several months ago as ``terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a phoenix which rises from the ashes, the Kosovo
Liberation Army is able to mount a number of attacks still inside
Kosovo,'' NATO's spokesman, Jamie Shea, said Friday before the
capture was announced.

HALT FOR WAR OVER, CLINTON RESUMES FUND-RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTON, Mass. _ Ending his self-imposed moratorium on
fund-raising, President Clinton was back on the money circuit
Friday after 23 days, bringing in $1.3 million for Democratic
candidates at two events.
</P>
<P>
   The president, his party's top cash draw, suspended his
fund-raising activities March 24, when NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
began. Now, with the war grinding through its fourth week, the
Clinton administration has decided that the image of the
president's raising money for political purposes is less
detrimental than any image of a president paralyzed in Washington
by a foreign policy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president as president has an obligation to both manage
any foreign policy crisis that's going on as well as continue to
pursue his domestic agenda,'' said Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what the president does is serve as the party leader,
and part of that process is to raise money,'' Lockhart added.
``He's fully able to execute his job as commander in chief
consistent with his duties as well as work on a domestic agenda,
and I think the American people expect the president to be able to
do both.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the president added several war-related activities
to his long-planned fund-raising schedule Friday. After speaking to
250 people in Dearborn, Mich., who paid $1,500 each for lunch with
him at the Fairlane Club, he remained in the Detroit area to
address about 300 officials of various refugee relief organizations
and also meet privately with seven Albanian-Americans who have
relatives in the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
   And on his way Friday night to this Boston suburb, where he was
joined for dinner at the home of former Democratic finance chairman
Alan Solomont by 80 people who paid $10,000 apiece for the
privilege, he met with personnel at Hanscom Air Force Base in the
nearby town of Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   In his talks Friday, Clinton emphasized U.S. relief efforts
directed at helping the many thousands of refugees streaming out of
Kosovo. In his remarks to the aid organizations, he noted that the
Detroit area was home to 40,000 Albanian-Americans and to thousands
of Serbian-Americans, and said it was important that the nation not
blame Serbs for the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them don't even know what has been done in their name
in Kosovo,'' he said, ``because the state-run media has covered it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, hundreds of demonstrators outside endured a steady
rain and a raw wind to hoist banners and chant against the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Until the war began, the president had been on a fund-raising
spree, pulling in more than $9 million for the party in about two
months. As the headliner at two events in Washington on March 23,
the night before the bombing began, he raised more than $1 million.
Those were his last fund-raisers until Friday. He canceled three,
in Ohio, Nevada and California, that had been scheduled for March
25.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday he was in California, to speak to the American Society
of Newspaper Editors in San Francisco, but attended no
fund-raisers. He spent most of the day with his daughter, Chelsea,
who came up from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the situation abroad, the 2000 elections still loom,
and candidates still need to raise money for them. The Democrats
are determined to take back the House, and the cash that the
president raised Friday is to go to both House and Senate
Democratic campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at his fund-raisers Friday by several
prominent Democrats. In Michigan, most of the state's Democratic
congressional delegation attended, as did House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt, who hopes to become speaker after the 2000
congressional elections. In Massachusetts, both of that state's
senators, Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, joined the president,
as did Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   And in both Michigan and Massachusetts, Clinton was joined by
Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who is spearheading the House
Democrats' fund-raising drive and is so eager for it to be
successful that he is opening his family's renowned compound in
Hyannis Port to big donors.

<P>
   The cover of Revlon Inc.'s latest annual report could easily be
mistaken for the front of a glamour magazine, with the model Cindy
Crawford and the actress Cybill Shepherd looking flawless in the
company's ``tawny'' blush and ``hot cocoa'' lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of Revlon's majority owner, the billionaire Ronald
O. Perelman, is anything but unblemished. A 1980s-style deal maker
with a passion for the high life, Perelman is known for bailing out
of ventures in the nick of time. There have been fiascos _ for
public shareholders, at least _ at Marvel Entertainment, Coleman,
Consolidated Cigar and Sunbeam, all of which lost money and
accumulated debt on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon, though, has been the crown jewel of his portfolio _
glamorous, with strong cash flow, a business that held his interest
and bore his fingerprints. Only weeks ago, it seemed inconceivable
that he would consider selling this, his core asset. But now he has
declared himself ready to unload it.
</P>
<P>
   What changed? Analysts, fund managers and industry experts say
Perelman has toted up Revlon's huge debts, gauged its slipping
competitive stance and concluded that the picture is unlikely to
brighten anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a decent price for all or part of Revlon, they say, is
his best route to salvaging at least part of his reputation as
something more than a corporate raider. Saving face ``is his
biggest problem,'' said Andrew Shore, an analyst at Paine Webber.
``Everybody wants to see how he handles it. He's got a lot on the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Perelman's closest confidants dismisses this reading of
his motives, saying the financier is simply frustrated by
investors' overreaction to the company's recent dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe Revlon is too highly leveraged, but the
investing public thinks so,'' said Howard Gittis, vice chairman and
chief operating officer of Perelman's holding company, MacAndrews &AMP;
Forbes. ``That is why we are considering selling. You can't keep
fighting the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the time since Perelman bought it in a leveraged
buyout in 1985, Revlon _ whose brands include the Almay, Ultima II
and Revlon lines of blush, lipstick and eye shadow _ seemed to be
the exception to his investment pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon dominated the cosmetics and toiletry aisles in drugstores
and discount chains. And until the second half of last year it was
posting respectable financial results, which management still likes
to characterize as spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the unexpected _ disappointments in earnings and a
decline in sales. Profits from continuing operations tumbled 83
percent in the third quarter and continued to fall in the fourth,
to $6.5 million from $36.6 million in the corresponding quarter a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed its reversals of fortune on weakened consumer
buying power abroad and on inventory cutbacks in American
drugstores; it expects the latter to continue into the second half
of this year. At the same time, management faces formidable new
competition, even as Revlon sags under so much debt that analysts
say there is too little cash left for a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The interest on Revlon's $1.7 billion in debt exceeded its
operating income last year. By contrast, interest payments consumed
just 9 percent of operating income at Procter &AMP; Gamble, which is
fast emerging as a key Revlon competitor, and 6 percent at Avon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company with less debt is by definition somewhat more
flexible in their ability to spend,'' said Heather Hay, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch. ``The industry in general is one that tends to
need a lot of resources to really be able to fund the business and
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three months ago, after Revlon took a $50 million charge
against earnings for restructuring, the company had to ask lenders
to ease up on some terms of its credit agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview last week, George Fellows, Revlon's chief
executive, said too much had been made of the balance-sheet issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people may be concerned that our level of debt may seem
to impair our ability to perform, but I can absolutely assure you
that it doesn't,'' Fellows said. Revlon, he added, remains a leader
in research and development. He pointed to its Colorstay line of
long-lasting makeup and the success of its ``age-defying'' skin
products, and he predicted another hit in a line of lipstick using
new technology and due out in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last five years, we have represented approximately 50
percent of the growth in the color cosmetics category in the mass
market,'' he said. ``I will be perfectly happy to let the results
of this company through this year, once we get by this difficult
period, speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Revlon's immediate problems were not enough to
prompt Perelman to consider bailing out, another largely overlooked
factor is probably adding to the urgency: Unless he finds a quick
fix or moves on, he could lose half his shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that more debt is lurking in Perelman's complex
corporate swirl. He issued zero-coupon bonds in 1998 through Revlon
Worldwide, the cosmetics company's privately held parent, that come
due on March 15, 2001 _ bonds that are secured by 20 million of his
shares. When the bonds mature, holders will be owed $770 million.
</P>
<P>
   So, analysts say, Perelman faces a choice: If he wants to roll
over the bonds, he must begin to clean up Revlon to attract new
investors. If he wants to pay off the bonds, he must raise money to
come up with the cash _ by selling all or part of Revlon or some
other holding.
</P>
<P>
   (Perelman could also reap millions from a federal judge's
decision this month ordering the government to pay $908.9 million
to one of the California savings institutions in which he is a
controlling shareholder _ although that money is bound to be tied
up in lengthy appeals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his empire's fairly leveraged status, the fact that the
business isn't getting any less competitive at this juncture and
that the zeros additionally loom on the horizon, it makes sense
that he would approach this process earlier, as opposed to the 11th
hour,'' said Stephen Weiss, a director in the corporate bond
research group of Salomon Smith Barney. ``He's got to come to grips
with how to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gittis said that raising cash to pay off the bonds did not
figure into the company's desire to sell the business. ``We've had
zeros out against Revlon stock now since the early '90's,'' he
added. ``That has never been a problem for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, by Revlon's own admission, the market does not hold the
company in high regard these days. So any move to refinance the
zero-coupon issue could get a chilly reception, said Terrence
Dwyer, a fixed-income analyst with KDP Investment Advisors. ``No
investor is going to touch it, whether it's a public or private
deal, unless they are certain that the cash flow will be there,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Perelman faces more immediate challenges with
Revlon. The company manufactured its products in too much abundance
last year, at a time when drugstore chains were consolidating, said
Allan Mottus, an industry consultant who publishes The
Informationist, a trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Mottus said, Revlon has not had a big hit since the
introduction in 1996 of the Colorstay products _ which competitors
copied quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, rivals with much deeper pockets are squeezing
in on the already crowded shelf space in the drugstores and
discount chains where Revlon competes.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows says that competition is nothing new to Revlon and that
it can hold its own. Still, in direct threats to its Almay brand,
Procter &AMP; Gamble is rolling out Oil of Olay cosmetics in the United
States and Johnson &AMP; Johnson is adding makeup to its Neutrogena
line of face-cleansing products.
</P>
<P>
   So Perelman, in opening Revlon's doors to suitors even as
management struggles to fend off new competition, is hardly
operating from a position of strength, Mottus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the competition knows the status of your company as well
as these people do, they can make adjustments and load up on brands
to take market share,'' Mottus said. ``They realize the company is
wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Burdened by its heavy debts, analysts say, Revlon has not made
the kinds of investments that have enabled other large cosmetics
concerns to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Estee Lauder, for example, has become a global juggernaut by
using its stock and cash to diversify not only its product lines
but also its distribution channels. While it once sold makeup
almost exclusively in department stores, Lauder now generates more
revenues through mass-market stores and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was once seen as selling products that appealed
strictly to the well-to-do woman, it now owns the trendy Bobbi
Brown line; the Jane line, geared toward teen-agers, and Origins, a
brand intended to project a wholesome image.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows says focusing on the mass market remains a smart
strategy; he believes that it will continue to grow, drug-chain
mergers or not.
</P>
<P>
   Gittis dismissed as ``quite off the mark'' any criticism that
Revlon's management might not be adequately committed to investing
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining silent for weeks amid speculation that it was
about to be sold, Revlon announced early this month that it had
hired Goldman Sachs and Lazard Freres to explore its options. Two
companies mentioned as likely buyers are Unilever, the Dutch
consumer products giant, and L'Oreal, whose chief executive said
last week that it was, indeed, seeking acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon stock rose more than 60 percent in just two days on
anticipation that the company might be put up for sale _ and an
additional 18 percent when it confirmed the rumors. The shares
closed at $25.375 on Friday, 55 percent below the price a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the run-up, analysts say, Revlon's name alone would
command a premium in a sale. But the company's highly publicized
problems, they add, are sure to hurt in negotiations, with bidders
likely to think that Perelman is desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Gittis said, ``If Ronald doesn't get a premium price he won't
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   One mutual fund manager said Revlon was regarded as ``one of the
blue-chip credits in the high-yield market'' two years ago, ``but
it literally crashed in the second half of 1998.'' The manager, who
recently dumped Revlon's bonds, spoke on condition of anonymity
because his firm has a policy of not commenting on holdings it has
shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has some real fundamental problems,'' he said.
``You have to throw on top of that the proverbial Perelman wild
card, which is always an issue when you're investing in his
companies,'' he added, in a reference to Perelman's spotty history
as a corporate manager.
</P>
<P>
   As if his Revlon problems were not enough, Perelman also faces
daunting challenges with some other holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he tried to shed one headache by selling the
money-losing Coleman Co., a maker of camping gear, to the Sunbeam
Corp. for stock. But within months, that deal left him the
second-largest shareholder of a company in the midst of an
accounting and management nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, it turned out, had exaggerated its earnings by tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the investment problems, Perelman is in the midst of a
divorce battle that is playing out in the tabloids and could soon
leave him in need of more cash. He and his third ex-wife, Patricia
Duff, are arguing over issues like bodyguards and their 4-year-old
daughter's nap time as well as basics of alimony, child support and
child custody.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming, as his confidants do, that holders of the
zero-coupon bonds won't end up with half his Revlon shares _ and
that he will sell only at a premium _ it seems clear that Perelman
won't take a powder on any deal. But with the shares selling at
roughly the same price as at their initial offering three years
ago, and steeply below their peak, public investors will be looking
for a buyer to give Revlon a face lift.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Perelman watchers are familiar with such circumstances.
He took Consolidated Cigar public in 1996 at $23 a share, or more
than 14 times his purchase price. The company was sold late last
year for $17.85 a share after trend-chasers moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman bought Marvel Entertainment Group for $82.5 million in
1989, putting up only $10 million of his own money and financing
the rest with debt. Two years later, he took the company public,
but the business eventually collapsed, and by December 1996 it had
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Perelman, though,
walked away with a $50 million profit, largely from selling bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon executives talk of selling ``dreams in a bottle.'' Revlon
investors can only hope to wake up from their nightmare.

CLINTON WEIGHS PARK   AIR MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a clear day, Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park may be
the single best place to view the rugged Maine coast. From the
highest seaboard perch in the Northeast, visitors can see across
the wooded islands of Penobscot Bay to the gentle Camden Hills 40
miles off.
</P>
<P>
   But when summer winds blows from the southwest, the scenery
disappears behind a haze of air pollution carried from Midwestern
coal-burning plants and distant cities. On those days, even Blue
Hill, just 12 miles away, becomes a faint blur in the sulfate-laden
mist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, President Clinton is weighing a controversial new rule to
gradually restore the view at national parks from Acadia to the
Grand Canyon in Arizona. Spurred on by environmentalists who see
the chance for a victory over the coal industry, the administration
may announce a plan next week that would virtually ban air
pollution in parks within 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Though the timetable is uncommonly generous, the rule would
force states to begin addressing park visibility during the next
decade. Just as important, it would hand environmental groups a new
tool in their broader attack on big coal-burning power plants from
Pennsylvania to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the rule is far too weak, but it sets a goal to get
the parks back to pristine air quality, not just manageable air
quality,'' said Armond Cohen of the Boston-based Clean Air Task
Force. ``People think they are going to Acadia or Shenandoah or the
Adirondacks to get away from the dirty air.''
</P>
<P>
   Utilities that own coal-burning plants insist that they, too,
want a grand view from Cadillac Mountain, but they complain that
the Clinton proposal may be too fast, adding to the already
substantial cost of meeting rules to reduce other kinds of air
pollution such as smog and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's okay to have a national visibility program. The question
is, what are the requirements?'' said Paul Bailey of the Edison
Electric Institute, a utility trade group in Washington. ``We would
like to see a program that leaves it essentially up to the states
along with the other stakeholders'' to decide how quickly the
cleanup should occur.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the White House and the US Environmental Protection
Agency aren't commenting, but sources say the White House is
considering an announcement next Thursday, on Earth Day, either by
Vice President Al Gore or Clinton himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the battle over America's scenic vistas is the
unfinished business from a 1977 act of Congress that called for
``no manmade impairment'' of visibility in national parks. At the
time, landmarks such as the Grand Canyon and the Great Smoky
Mountains in Tennessee often had worse air than many cities due to
winds that carried pollution hundreds of miles from its source.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, federal and state regulators have clamped down on
various air pollutants, including some chemicals that reduce
visibility in national parks. Most importantly, national releases
of sulfur dioxide released from coal-burning and other activities
have dropped by almost 25 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But summertime visibility remains up to 80 percent less than it
was 50 years ago in some national parks. At Acadia, where average
visibility is up to 50 percent below what it once was, park
officials say they have seen some improvement in recent years, but
the poor visibility days are as bad as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, explains National Park Service biologist Bob Breen,
is that the air over Acadia is full of sulfates, chemicals related
to sulfur dioxide that are produced from coal-burning and other
combustion. The sulfates readily combine with the moisture in
summertime air to create haze, usually accompanied by high ozone
that makes breathing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   And almost none of the pollution comes from the little towns
around Acadia, said Breen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the bad days . . . when we have prevailing winds from .
. . many of the pollution sources of the upper Midwest and the
Eastern seaboard upwind of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The poignance of air pollution at national monuments has played
nicely into environmental groups' crusade against coal-burning,
especially older coal plants that are exempted from many federal
pollution requirements and equipped with tall smokestacks to
disperse pollution over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   And both the electric utilities and the coal mining industry
have found it impossible to oppose the goal. ``It's apple pie and
motherhood,'' Bailey of the Edison Electric Institute said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But clearing the air at the 156 far-flung parks entitled to
pristine visibility under the 1977 law requires a national attack
that could touch power plants and coal mines everywhere. As a
result, industry groups as well as coal power states pressed for
more time to meet the law, with some industry officials advocating
a 200 year cleanup timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking about what period of time is reasonable to
reach that goal,'' said Bailey who, along with states such as
Virginia, prefers no fixed cleanup timetable at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, environmentalists say they, too, are settling for
less, since they preferred a faster 50-year cleanup schedule. But
the suffering is relative, they admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like you order up an ice cream sundae and you get
just the ice cream,'' said Bruce Hill, a scientist at the
Appalachian Mountain Club in New Hampshire.

FERTILITY TREATMENT RESULTS `HARD TO PREDICT' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release, Sunday, April 18, 1999) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Nkem Chukwu's babies were born, people asked: How
did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a doctor from her fertility clinic offered the first
public insight into that question.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, no one could have predicted Chukwu's conception
of octuplets. Fertility treatment is, at its best, an imprecise
science, but even at that, doctors believe Chukwu's ovaries
functioned in a highly unusual way.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu was receiving fertility treatment at MacGregor Medical
Association in Houston when she became pregnant with eight babies.
Chukwu and her husband refuse to discuss details, and a MacGregor
spokeswoman says the family requested that the clinic not give out
any information about them.
</P>
<P>
   But a fertility specialist with MacGregor, Dr. Milton McNichol,
talked in general terms last week about the type of treatment
Chukwu received.
</P>
<P>
   Two hormones are used, the first administered daily, through an
injection to the muscles near the hip, to stimulate the development
of eggs on the ovaries. The second hormone causes the eggs to pop
off the ovary and enter the fallopian tube, where sperm can
fertilize them.
</P>
<P>
   McNichol said the effects of the first hormone are closely
followed for several days by testing levels of estrogen and viewing
the ovaries by ultrasound. Based on what doctors see, the hormone
dosage may vary. A patient who has no results at first may respond
vigorously to the next level of dosage the following month.
</P>
<P>
   Before patients get the second hormone, doctors discuss the
number of mature follicles, each of which contains an egg, that are
present on the ovaries. They counsel couples on the odds of
conceiving multiples _ or not conceiving at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some patients who might have five follicles and they
don't get pregnant. We counsel them, you have a 25 percent chance
of having twins, a 5 to 10 percent chance of having three or
more,'' McNichol said. ``Perhaps the most common outcome is to not
get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a high number of follicles present on the ovary,
patients can forgo the second hormone or abstain from sex. McNichol
said if a woman has four or more mature follicles on her ovary
``that's a danger flag,'' partly because there is a slight risk
that smaller, less-mature follicles also present on the ovary may
ovulate as well.
</P>
<P>
   But patients often choose to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it in perspective, a patient spends $3,000 to $4,000 on
medication before that second dose,'' McNichol said. ``For a couple
that's had a long history of infertility and invested lots of money
and time to get to that stage, it's hard to make a clearly
objective decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nkem's case, McNichol believes the unforeseen ovulation of
immature follicles was what led to her conceiving octuplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's informed medicine,'' he said. ``But it is hard to
predict.''

GRETZKY MADE BIG IMPACT IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ He began his legendary NHL career in the Western
Canadian outpost of Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   He ended it in New York, the largest media market in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne Gretzky's impact on the sport he loved and dominated
was never greater - locally and nationally - than it was during the
time he spent in Los Angeles with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   In seven-plus seasons as a King, Gretzky's magnetism, charisma
and unprecedented skill attracted fans to the Forum to watch hockey
in numbers not seen before - or since.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Gretzky - who announced Friday that he will
conclude his remarkable 20-year career following the New York
Rangers' game Sunday against Pittsburgh - paved the way for
franchises in such warm-weather climes as Anaheim, North Carolina,
Dallas, Miami, Nashville, Phoenix, San Jose, Tampa and, next
season, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's meant more to the game than any single player,'' said
Kings general manager Dave Taylor, a teammate of Gretzky's for six
seasons. ``A lot of teams wouldn't be there if Wayne hadn't come to
Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps paradoxically, Gretzky's greatest allure was his seeming
ordinariness, his otherworldly gifts wrapped in a boy-next-door
package. He wasn't known as the fastest skater, or the player with
the hardest shot. Certainly, at 6 feet, 185 pounds, he wasn't
exceptionally big.
</P>
<P>
   But as with former Laker Magic Johnson, the man he shared the
Forum spotlight with for several seasons, Gretzky always made the
pass no one else saw to make, and in his prime he could elevate his
game whenever the situation demanded he do so. Completing the
package was his public image: soft-spoken modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as an ambassador, you'd never hear him say a bad
word,'' Taylor said. ``He was very humble. And he's the kind of
guy, if it's 6-1, he wants to make it 7-1 or 8-1. He doesn't let
up. And he reached levels people never thought would be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the one player who could attract the uninterested to his
sport for the Kings' attendance to reach levels never thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987-88, the year before the Kings acquired Gretzky from
Edmonton in one of sports' biggest blockbuster deals, the Kings
averaged 11,667 fans at their home games. In 1996-97, the first
full season after the Kings traded Gretzky to St. Louis, they
averaged 12,297.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seven-plus years Gretzky was a King, the team
averaged 15,417 at its regular-season games in the 16,005-seat
Forum and had 212 sellouts. In the 24-plus years the Kings have
been without Gretzky, they've sold out only 79 regular-season
games, including only four this year. In 1991-92, the Kings sold
out the entire season, the only professional team in Los Angeles
sports history to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one player able to transcend the sport,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, there was the hockey.
</P>
<P>
   With Gretzky, the Kings won the only division title in franchise
history in 1990-91, and made their only trip to the Stanley Cup
Finals two years later. And in 1988-89, his first year with the
Kings, Gretzky had 168 points, a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   For those who played with Gretzky, it was an unforgettable
experience. ``The first day, I couldn't sleep all day,'' former
King Tony Granato recalled Friday in the San Jose Sharks' dressing
room. ``I was still a young kid. They said, `OK, you're playing
with Gretzky tonight.' For a hockey player, getting that
opportunity you were scared, excited, and didn't want to blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings left wing Luc Robitaille added, ``If you got him the puck
and you got open, he found you. He was the greatest goal scorer of
all-time, and then he became the greatest playmaker of all-time.
... No matter what, this is the greatest player ever to play the
game. When 100 points was huge, he came in and scored 200. He was
the hardest-working superstar people had ever seen. He always
wanted more.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a criticism of Gretzky, it was that his role
with the Kings exceeded a player's boundaries. Gretzky was believed
to have been involved in several personnel moves, including the
1990 trade that sent Bernie Nicholls to the Rangers for Granato and
Tomas Sandstrom, and the 1994 trade in which Robitaille went to
Pittsburgh for Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a hand in it,'' said Nicholls, now an assistant coach
with the Sharks. ``There wasn't anything that went on in L.A. that
Wayne didn't have a hand in. He talked to (former owner Bruce
McNall) every day. ... There were hard feelings at the time because
I was traded and didn't want to leave. The hard feelings were more
toward the owner. I've got no hard feelings toward Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Granato said, ``If I've got the greatest player in my sport in
my locker room and I'm the general manager, no one knows the game
better than Wayne, so I would think the general manager was someone
who was very egotistical if he didn't use the input he had. Why
wouldn't you want Wayne's opinion and advice?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gretzky's retirement, Granato said, ``I'd love to see him
play for another 10 years, but that can't happen. I knew this day
would come. I was hoping it would be down the road. But it's here.
It's going to be sad that he's out of the game. On the other hand,
we should celebrate and be thankful we had 20 years of nothing but
the best he had.''

   AMERICAN-ART-CENTURY (Undated) _ Art-wise, was this really the
American century? We take the cliche for granted because, well,
because we are so arrogant. Never mind that its just a catch phrase
cooked up in 1941 by Henry Luce, the most thoroughly
unreconstructed of American chauvinists, partly out of missionary
zeal and partly to sell his magazine. The American Century is the
title of what looks to be an immense two-part survey at the Whitney
Museum of American Art, the first part of which, covering the years
1900 to 1950, will open Friday. It's one of several century-ending
extravaganzas (the Modern is planning another). And no doubt they
all, to some degree, will confront the cliche of American
predominance in visual art, deciding what it means and whether it
really makes sense. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved). Photo.

   60s-FILMS (Undated) _ A whiff of incense mixed with marijuana
smoke drifts through two recent movies, ``Hideous Kinky'' and ``A
Walk on the Moon,'' both of which conjure an era that Hollywood, in
its devotion to snugly happy endings, has largely avoided. By
Stephen Holden. (Moved).

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   JUDSON-DANCE (New York) _ In the not too distant past it was my
good fortune to chance upon the performance of an arresting,
unconventional work. A luminous fabric comprising music both vocal
and instrumental, literary fragments from varied centuries and
civilizations, and everyday movement functioning as dance, it
projected an irresistible aura of good will and celebrated the
wonderful power of artistic persuasion. And, for the best of
reasons, it reminded me instantly of the Judson Dance Theater, that
whirlpool of restless creative spirits performing at Judson
Memorial Church at Washington Square in the 1960s. Now, 37 years
after they first began enjoying Judson's hospitality, a group of
those formerly young would-be creators, who found performance and
exhibition space when they needed it most, are expressing their
gratitude in ``No Limits _ A Celebration of Freedom and Art to
Benefit Judson Memorial Church.'' Some 75 dancers/choreographers,
poets, painters and sculptors are expected to participate in events
that began at the church last Friday and will run through this
Saturday. By Allen Hughes. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NOBREGA-DANCE (Undated) _ Antonio Nobrega, a Brazilian performer
who will be making his United States debut at the Kennedy Center's
American Dance Festival April 27 through 29, trots out a variety of
characters in ``Figural,'' the one-man show he will use to greet
North American audiences. The figures he conjures, through mime,
dance, music and acrobatics, are not simply creatures of the
artist's fancy but a string of types meant as a showcase for
Brazil's culturally rich northeast. By Diana Jean Schemo. (Moved).

<P>
   THEATER-NIGHTCLUB (New York) _ Coaxing nightclubs from
legitimate theaters is not unheard of. Florenz Ziegfeld found room
for one in 1915 atop his New Amsterdam Theater on West 42d Street.
Throughout the life span of Ziegfeld's ``Follies,'' the New
Amsterdam roof was the toniest nightspot in New York. But Joe's Pub
on Lafayette Street, is a much less lofty enterprise, carved as it
is from ground-floor back-office space at the theater. The $2.35
million club is the result, in part, of a construction and
renovation grant to the Public from city capital funds that
includes refurbishment of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
There were some doubters when the Pub opened in October about
whether the Public Theater could make a theater-night life alliance
work. Six months later, according to George C. Wolfe, the producer
of the Public Theater, Joe's Pub ``is actually doing better than I
thought it would.'' By Barry Singer. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   CIVIL-WAR-MUSICAL (Undated) _ A wall of cannons atop a grassy,
open slope. Forty thousand men killed or wounded in three days near
Gettysburg, Pa. It was the numbers that got to Frank Wildhorn, the
composer of ``The Civil War,'' the new Broadway musical opening on
Thursday at the St. James Theater. At a time when Broadway is
devoted to revivals of American classics _ both straight plays and
musicals _ and imports from London, Wildhorn is one of the few
composers creating musicals that are new, American and popular with
audiences. By Roxane Orgill. (Moved). Photo.

   GOERNE-MUSIC (New York) _ The German baritone, Matthias Goerne,
along with his new recital partner, the Austrian pianist Alfred
Brendel, will present Schubert's ``Winterreise'' on Thursday
evening at Carnegie Hall. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HISTORIC-RELEASES (Undated) _ Anyone who gets anywhere near a
record store or catalogue knows that ``historic'' releases are
coming from every direction. Legitimate enterprises like Nimbus's
``Grand Piano'' series and Philips's giant new survey of the
century's best pianists compete with pirate tapes of murky
legitimacy. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Going to a contemporary-music
concert in the 1970s to hear new works by young Americans could
often be a discombobulating experience. The composers were
baby-boomers who had grown up with Motown, rhythm-and-blues and 60s
rock. Yet from some of the music they composed, you would have
thought that they had been living in gas-lit garrets in Vienna
during the 1920s, completely in thrall to the radical 12-tone works
of Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARTISTS (New York) _ What defines a New York artist at the
end of the 20th century? The question surfaced with the
announcement that the works to be exhibited at the next Whitney
Biennial would be chosen by a team of art professionals who neither
work at the museum nor live in New York. Maxwell L. Anderson, the
museum's director, spoke of giving the show a ``national
perspective.'' After 25 years of having New Yorkers select the
show, it could be interesting to reverse the gaze, as theorists
might say, and see what non-New Yorkers come up with. By Roberta
Smith. (Moved).

<P>
   BROADWAY-THEATER-ARCHIVE (New York) _ A venture called the
Broadway Theater Archive will digitize the vast video library of
Public Broadcasting System's WNET (local Channel 13), chronicling
some 40 years of the best of the American stage. WNET will
rebroadcast some of the productions as ``Treasures From the
Archive'' in a new series ``Stage on Screen,'' to begin next
Saturday. By Ralph Blumenthal. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-WILL-AND-GRACE (Los Angeles) _ Last fall, when ``Will and
Grace'' had its premiere, television pundits took up column space
debating whether America was ready for a show about the sometimes
touching and always complicated intimacy between best-friend
roommates, one of whom is openly homosexual (Will) and the other, a
love-hungry heterosexual career gal (Debra Messing's Grace). But
viewers pronounced the discussion moot by declaring their love for
Sean Hayes's role as Jack McFarland. After three episodes, the NBC
promotions department decided to use Hayes's breakout status to
hype the show by broadcasting a 30-second Jack spot, complete with
a fever-pitch montage of Jack footage and a goofy Jack theme song.
By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHANDELIER-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The Age of Reason was also the
Age of Reflection. Chandeliers dripped with cut-glass lusters,
moldings glimmered with gold leaf. Mirrors were placed behind
blazing candles and opposite sunny, full-length windows. And
surprisingly, at least some chimney pieces of the day were
literally architectural jewels, studded, paved and highlighted with
paste diamonds (in other words, rhinestones). ``There was such a
need to magnify the light candles gave out,'' said William Jay
Iselin, a former Christie's associate who now works with the
eminent Paris antiquary Ariane Dandois. ``Anything that could
refract light, to up the candle power, so to speak, was embraced.''
Recently exhibited at the Palm Beach International Art and Antiques
Fair, one of Iselin and Ms. Dandois's most spectacular finds is a
formally carved, rhinestone-studded chimney piece, circa 1790. The
chandelier, which is about 12 feet high and 14 feet wide, is for
sale at $95,000. By Mitchell Owens. (Moved).

EDITORIAL: A LIMIT ON JURY SEQUESTRATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, April 17: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new study by New York's Office of Court Administration
provides ample justification for abandoning the state's foolish
policy of requiring the sequestration of deliberating jurors in all
trials involving violent crimes. That policy, ostensibly designed
to insure the integrity of criminal proceedings, requires that
jurors be housed overnight and guarded round the clock even in
low-profile cases where there is scant danger of outside pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The study finds that a temporary law approved by the state
Legislature four years ago to allow jurors in lower-level felony
cases to go home during deliberations has saved the state $3.5
million in security and lodging costs without producing any
increase in mistrials or allegations of jury-tampering. It has
spared more than 14,000 jurors and their families needless
inconvenience, broadened the pool of jurors available to serve, and
significantly reduced the impetus for juries to rush their
decisions by sundown to avoid being kept overnight.
</P>
<P>
   With the temporary law due to expire on June 30, state court
officials are urging the Legislature to enact a permanent change
that would give trial judges discretion to forgo sequestration of
juries in all criminal trials, except in death-penalty cases. The
state's chief administrative judge, Jonathan Lippman, estimates
this overdue change would affect about 1,000 cases each year and
save $2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The court officers' union, not surprisingly, cherishes the
overtime the current rules compel. But at a time when other parts
of the justice system are starving for resources, the Legislature
should not waste money just to please a special interest.

INVESTIGATORS SAY EMBRYOLOGIST KNEW HE ERRED IN EGG MIX-UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the case of mixed-up embryos that caused a white
Staten Island woman who underwent in vitro fertilization to give
birth to two sons of different races, a state inquiry has concluded
that the embryologist knew another couple's embryos had been
implanted but failed to tell anyone at the time or to act to
correct his error.
</P>
<P>
   The embryologist, Michael Obasaju, could have told Dr. Lillian
D. Nash, the physician, to stop the procedure immediately. Instead,
investigators say, he prepared a second batch with the correct
embryos and handed them to Nash for implantation. He said he
remained quiet about his original error because the wrongly
implanted embryos were ``lower grade in quality'' and he did not
believe they would grow. But when the Staten Island woman became
pregnant a month later, Obasaju confessed the error to Nash, who
immediately informed the two couples involved, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Donna Fasano, who is white, gave birth to the
two boys, one white and one black. Since becoming public last
month, the case has reverberated through the field of assisted
reproductive technology, raising a host of ethical questions and
serving as a vivid reminder that mistakes, though rare, do happen.
</P>
<P>
   While state officials said Friday that ``the real error here''
was made by the embryologist, the report also found that numerous
procedural violations had taken place at the Manhattan clinic where
the mistake occurred, and it cited Nash for failing to properly
oversee Obasaju. The possibility of any punitive measures against
the clinic, IVF New York, or against Obasaju or Nash is uncertain;
the clinic remains open and must provide a written report to the
State Health Department by May 14, explaining what corrective
measures have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Mathis, a Health Department spokeswoman, said that
punitive action against Obasaju was unlikely because the state does
not license or certify embryologists. ``They are able to work as
embryologists based on their education, training and experience,''
Ms. Mathis said. She added, ``Our oversight was limited to the
facility where the error took place and the director of that
facility.'' Officials at IVF New York have told state investigators
that Obasaju will no longer be allowed to work there.
</P>
<P>
   The state report, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act,
is the latest development in a case that became public last month
after the black couple involved, Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert
Rogers,, filed a lawsuit seeking custody of the black child. The
Rogerses have said that the embryos wrongly implanted in Mrs.
Fasano belong to them. The suit also accused Nash, Obasaju, the
clinic, and another physician, Dr. Dov B. Goldstein, of
malpractice, negligence and breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, lawyers for the Fasanos announced that the couple
would raise their biological child and allow the Rogerses to raise
theirs if DNA tests proved they were his biological parents. David
Cohen, a lawyer representing the Fasanos, said Friday that the DNA
tests of the Rogerses were complete, but he would not release the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Silas, the Rogerses' lawyer, was not in his office
Friday afternoon and did not return telephone calls. But Cohen said
that lawyers for both couples were negotiating a visitation
arrangement so the boys would grow up knowing each other.
</P>
<P>
   Nash did not return a telephone message left with her office
answering service and another left on her home answering machine.
Obasaju could not be located last night for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The state report traces the beginning of the case to April 21,
1998, when Nash retrieved ova, or eggs, from both Mrs. Fasano and
Mrs. Perry-Rogers at IVF New York, also known as Central Park
Medical Services. Nash told investigators that the scheduling of
two patients on the same day was ``unusual'' but ``coincidental.''
She retrieved seven eggs from Mrs. Fasano and 25 from Mrs.
Perry-Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Obasaju, who like most embryologists has a doctorate but not a
medical degree, told investigators that he placed the eggs from the
two women in separate dishes. Each woman's eggs were inseminated
with sperm from her husband. Each woman's dish was labeled with her
name, and the dishes were placed in an incubator for three days.
The report said that Obasaju removed both dishes from the incubator
on April 24 and placed them on ``a hot plate'' so he could
determine which of the embryos had the best chance of successful
development.
</P>
<P>
   He then placed four of Mrs. Fasano's embryos into a different
culture dish. But the report said he divided Mrs. Perry-Rogers'
embryos into three dishes. Of the 25 eggs that had been taken from
her, 20 were fertilized: he placed six embryos for use later in the
day in one dish; he put 10 embryos to be frozen into a second dish,
and he placed four ``lower graded embryos'' into a third dish to be
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   He then placed all four dishes back on the hot plate. When Mrs.
Fasano arrived for her procedure, Obasaju told investigators, he
place the four lower-grade Rogers embryos ``by accident'' into the
catheter used by Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mathis said that if Obasaju had announced his mistake
immediately, ``there is some kind of procedure'' that might have
been used to wash out the embryos.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, after Nash learned that Mrs. Fasano was pregnant,
Obasaju admitted his error to her. Mrs. Perry-Rogers had undergone
the procedure with her own embryos, but she had not become
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   State officials noted that Obasaju is not the clinic's regular
embryologist; he works only with Nash. The report said that the
clinic did have written operating procedures, but that Obasaju did
not follow them. The report also cited officials of IVF New York
and Nash for failing to insure that the procedures were followed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mathis noted that Goldstein was ``not implicated in the
actual error.'' Goldstein, who operates a different clinic, had
agreed to store the Rogerses' additional embryos. His lawyer, Luke
Pittoni, said that he would file a motion next week to have his
client removed as a defendant in the Rogerses' lawsuit and as a
defendant in a lawsuit that has since been filed by the Fasanos.

   COMBAT
</P>
<P>
   -- With the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in its fourth
week, the alliance claimed one of its most successful nights of
bombing, destroying tanks and artillery sites in Kosovo and hitting
key sites around Belgrade. NATO also struck military targets in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   -- Albanian rebels in Kosovo captured a Yugoslav army officer
and turned him over to Albania, which then turned him over to U.S.
military officials in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO again acknowledged accidentally hitting a civilian
vehicle in Kosovo on Wednesday, but said it could not account for
the apparent bombing deaths of other civilians in the same area.
Serb officials said at least 75 people died in another NATO strike
on a refugee convoy the same day.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   -- A new stream of Kosovo refugees poured into Macedonia, and
foreign observers said they seemed to be the victims of another
mass expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   -- The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees accused Yugoslavia of
trying to expel the entire Albanian population from Kosovo. The
agency now estimates the total number of Kosovo Albanian refugees
who have been forced from the province since March 1998 at 671,700.
This compares with a pre-conflict Kosovo Albanian population of 1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER DEVELOPMENTS
</P>
<P>
   -- Russia's opposition-dominated lower house of Parliament
approved a resolution to allow Yugoslavia to join the loose

COLUMBUS GAME HOLDS MUCH IMPORT FOR GALDERISI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Revolution have only once defeated the Columbus
Crew in regulation time in a meaningful MLS game. In the 30th game
of the 1997 season, Alberto Naveda converted the game-winner on a
move set up by Giuseppe Galderisi and Alexi Lalas as the Revolution
qualified for their only MLS playoff appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Only Galderisi remains with the Revolution, but in an unofficial
role as assistant to player-coach Walter Zenga. Clearly, Galderisi
wants to stay with the team, and several key players have offered
support both with public statements and through in-person appeals
to general manager Brian O'Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   But no decision will be made until after Saturday's game against
Columbus, the second in which Galderisi will coach from the bench
without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, I am happy and proud to be with this
team,'' Galderisi said Friday. ``It's just so great to be able to
work with young players who want to improve and learn. Players like
Joe-Max Moore, who hasn't won anything in this league, still has
the ambition to win. With attitudes like his, this team can go very
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the older players to the youngest, they have the same
hunger to win and to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Galderisi appears to be an excellent foil for Zenga, whose
coaching experience only began last August. They communicate well,
and Galderisi is among the few coaches who both has inside
knowledge of the league and commands Zenga's respect. In fact,
Galderisi actually won more Serie A championships in Italy than
Zenga as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same mentality,'' Galderisi said of Zenga. ``We
work in the same way. We realized it in Massa Carrara last month,
the players and the coaches, we committed to working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Galderisi and O'Donovan began negotiating last month while the
team was training in Italy. This week, Galderisi has been in the
middle of Revolution preparations, and Zenga seems to be under less
pressure after delegating much authority to Galderisi.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Zenga is sticking to his policy of not informing the team
of the starting lineup until 90 minutes before kickoff. His choices
have been simplified because of injuries, but there seems little
future in playing Brian Dunseth out of position at right back and
Mike Burns in midfield. Dunseth, a central defender, has struggled
in the role, and Burns is better suited for the right back
position. But the Revolution have experienced some success in the
last two matches, so Zenga might not make major changes.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gorter, slated to be the team's midfield leader since
being recruited from Holland last year by former coach Thomas
Rongen, has not filled the role on a consistent basis. But Gorter's
presence late in last week's game against D.C. United, which the
Revolution lost in the shootout after tying, 2-2, in regulation
time, was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The primary objective will be to defend against the Stern
John-Brian McBride striking combination. Zenga tried to acquire
McBride in the offseason, and said McBride ``is the best striker in
the league.'' But John has been the best scorer, with 28 goals in
27 MLS appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep those two to zero or one goal to have a chance
to win,'' defender Dan Calichman said. ``We can't give them any
room. McBride will win 99.9 percent of any balls in the air and
Stern John can turn on you at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus had a 3-0 record and an 11-2 goal advantage over the
Revolution in the first three games last year, before the

ANALYSIS: A BIG STEP FROM DIALLO POSTERS TO POLICE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To underscore the message of their march, 10
politicians and community leaders led thousands of people across
the Brooklyn Bridge on Thursday with special signs slung around
their necks, each highlighting a specific point in their proposal
for police reform.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was, from even a few yards away, the placards
were impossible to read.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that poster board lends itself better to sharp slogans
than substantive suggestions is an apt symbol of the challenge
confronting the Rev. Al Sharpton and his partners in protest: how
to transform the passion that marked weeks of demonstrations since
the police shooting of Amadou Diallo into policies that will
actually have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They achieved a goal of focusing in on their issues in a
manner that is acceptable to most New Yorkers,'' said Norman Adler,
a political consultant. ``Now the question is, where do they go
from here? If I were they, I would be spending my time figuring out
how to go to step two, and that is how to create an organization
committed to the 10-point goals, an organization with a staff, and
a board, and with a budget, and with some strategies for achieving
your goals.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three weeks since black and Hispanic political
leaders met with the heads of the city's major labor unions and
civil liberties groups to draft the 10-point plan, which they hoped
would turn the outrage over an individual incident into a movement
for systemic change. But neither Mayor Rudolph Giuliani nor Police
Commissioner Howard Safir has publicly addressed any of the
proposals _ indeed, a top Police Department spokesman said Friday
afternoon that the commissioner had probably not even seen them _
and even keen observers of city politics are hard-pressed to cite
half the list.
</P>
<P>
   During his radio show Friday, Giuliani concentrated not on the
substance of the placards carried by the 10 march leaders, but on
the slogans touted by many at the back of the pack. Citing a poster
that showed a swastika across the insignia of the New York Police
Department and others that compared the mayor to Hitler and the
department to the Ku Klux Klan, Giuliani invoked David Duke to
denounce, again, the tone of the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just consider for one moment if David Duke came to New York
City, assembled 4,000, 5,000 or 10,000 people, whatever the number
you want to say the march was, and in that march there were 10
people that had signs with hateful, racist and anti-Semitic
language attached to it,'' the mayor said. ``And suppose a group of
politicians participated in that march, spoke to a group that had
signs like that. I think this morning a lot of tough questions
would be asked of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton and former Mayor David Dinkins, who wore point No. 1
around his neck at Thursday's march, expressed outrage at the
comparison to Duke, the former Klan leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's objecting to is what he's doing,'' Sharpton said.
``While he's being critical of signs that are excessive, he's being
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor exulted in the lower-than-expected turnout at the
march on Thursday _ organizers had predicted 25,000, and estimates
ranged from the official police tally of 4,500 to about 12,000 _
Sharpton and his colleagues celebrated what they said was the
largest-ever demonstration against police brutality and plotted
their next steps.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk about putting a referendum on the city ballot in
the fall to implement the police-reform plan, though probably only
one of the proposals, to reconstitute and fully fund the Civilian
Complaint Review Board, could be addressed through that process.
Plans are also afoot for a new umbrella civil rights organization
that would meet every other month and, among other things, draft
10-point plans for other city departments.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is headed to Riverside, Calif., on Saturday night to
protest a police shooting there, and he is organizing a national
tour for Diallo's mother, Katiadou, when she returns from Africa in
May. Separately, leaders of civil rights organizations across the
country plan to meet about police brutality in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned as an organizer, we got the debate
waving in this city,'' said Bill Lynch, who was deputy mayor under
Dinkins and helped organize Thursday's rally. ``It took nine years
from the time that Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus
before an accommodations law was passed. With technology, we don't
have to be that patient, but this is a long fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But where Lynch and others see momentum, some analysts say the
nascent movement could be in danger of stalling, with no logical
place to go next.
</P>
<P>
   It will most likely be many months before the four officers who
were indicted in the Diallo case return to court. Many in the City
Council and the state Assembly are supportive of the coalition's
cause, but with Giuliani running City Hall and his fellow
Republicans controlling the statehouse and the state Senate, at
least 2 of the 10 points _ proposals for a city residency
requirement for police officers and a special prosecutor for police
brutality and corruption _ seem unlikely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 10 proposals, such as an affirmative action policy,
sensitivity training and an end to the use of hollow-point bullets,
are in the hands of Safir and Giuliani, who show no signs of acting
on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes after the clarity of the initial moment, then things
do get a little more confused,'' said Lee Miringoff, a pollster who
has surveyed people's reactions about the Diallo killing. ``As this
works its way through the courts, it loses some of its initial
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that Giuliani himself will become the focal point,
as demonstrations give way to a get-out-the-vote campaign to block
his likely bid for a United States Senate seat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these people want more than anything else is to defeat
Rudy Giuliani in 2000 and thereby end his political career,'' said
Phil Friedman, a consultant who works for both Democrats and
Republicans. ``However much of a tragedy this is in human terms,
politically speaking it is in some part a game, where opportunity
has afforded itself to turn an unknown person into a martyr, to
turn a martyr into a movement, and to turn a movement into turnout
on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Thursday's crowd was reminiscent of the coalition
that elected Dinkins in 1989 _ and failed to re-elect him in 1993.
But the group is hardly ready to coalesce behind a candidate for
mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, a likely mayoral
candidate, wore point No. 7 _ raise police officers' salaries _
around his neck Thursday. Sharpton, who wore No. 8 _ end the
48-hour delay before department officials can question New York
officers involved in a shooting _ has not ruled out another run.
</P>
<P>
   And Public Advocate Mark Green, who has all but announced his
candidacy, did not get one of the 10 signs but was, nonetheless, in
the crowd, marching.

CRACKDOWN ON SCHIZOPHRENICS IS URGED AFTER UTAH SHOOTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia)   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ For the second time in three months, this
conservative city grappled Friday with news that a schizophrenic
resident who refused to take medication had walked up to strangers
and shot them dead.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesmen and advocates for the mentally ill called for
barring gun sales to people with histories of severe mental illness
and for laws mandating that schizophrenics take their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, Sergei Babarin, 70, killed two people and wounded
five others at a genealogical library before dying in a gun battle
with the police on Thursday, the authorities said. His widow and
son said Friday that he had refused to take his medication for
schizophrenia since December.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months ago, on Jan. 13, De-Kieu Duy, a woman who also
had a history of schizophrenia, entered an office complex three
blocks away from Thursday's killings at Temple Square, the heart of
the Mormon Church, and shot to death an AT&AMP;T employee, the police
say.
</P>
<P>
   The killings are only the latest involving schizophrenics who
refuse to take their medicine. These cases, the police say, include
a man who pushed a young woman in front of a subway train in New
York in January, a man who stabbed to death his pregnant fiancee
last June at their home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and a Montana
man who killed two police officers at the U. S. Capitol last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Treatment Advocacy Center, which seeks mandatory medication
laws, says Americans with untreated severe mental illnesses commit
nearly 1,000 homicides a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are having severe mental illness problems should be
prevented from buying a weapon,'' Lt. Phil Kirk, a police spokesman
here, said, noting that Barbarin and Ms. Duy previously had been
arrested for misdemeanor offenses involving weapons. Referring to a
federal law requiring background checks for felonies before guns
may be sold, he said, ``The Brady bill should be extended to
misdemeanors involving weapons offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Babarin was arrested here after he punched a
73-year-old man in a department store restroom, then tried to bite
him on the face, the police said. At the time, he was carrying a
loaded .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. He pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon, and the police
carried out a court order to destroy his gun. Today, Lieutenant
Kirk said the police were trying to learn how Barbarin got a new
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   With surveys indicating that two-thirds of Utah adults own
firearms, mental health advocates say more money should be spent on
insuring that schizophrenics take their medicine, prescription
drugs that often allow them to lead normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I am hearing today is how we need to keep guns away from
the mentally ill,'' said Vickie Cottrell, executive director of the
Utah chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a
nonprofit advocacy group. ``Well, how about getting the medication
to the mentally ill?''
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, medication is only mandatory if mentally ill people
pose an immediate danger to themselves or to others. Mrs. Cottrell,
whose daughter has brought her schizophrenia under control with
medication, said: ``I know of too many families who have tried to
get their loved one in a hospital. Too many times, terrible things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, the Utah Legislature rejected pleas by mental
health advocates to finance a system that would provide medical
monitoring of severely mentally ill people who are released from
hospitals and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Barbarin's son, Alex, said he had asked doctors for help with
his father, but was told that state laws limited involuntary
commitment to people who posed an imminent danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unreasonable liberty with people who need help,'' he
told The Deseret News here. ``You must be more preventive, because
one mentally ill person can damage so many lives _ not because he
intends to, but because he can't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Babarin, a toolmaker who emigrated from Leningrad,
Russia, to New York in 1981, had displayed odd behavior after
moving here a decade ago, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zelig of the Salt Lake Police said Babarin had thought his
son was a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency and last year
attacked a bicyclist by sticking an umbrella in his wheel spokes.
Barbarin was not charged in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say `Heil Hitler and I hate America,' '' a neighbor
said on Thursday at the the apartment complex for the elderly where
he lived. ``He could've been helped mentally, but somebody
failed.''

BASEBALL WANTS STRAWBERRY TO TAKE DRUG TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In the aftermath of Darryl Strawberry's arrest
Wednesday night on charges of cocaine possession and solicitation
of prostitution, Major League Baseball has sought to administer a
drug test to the New York Yankees outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has been subject to regular testing by the league
since the mid-1990s _ he underwent drug treatment while with the
Dodgers in 1994 and was suspended by baseball while with the Giants
in 1995 _ and he provided the league with a urine sample the day
before his arrest. What was unclear Friday was whether the latest
test sought by baseball had been previously scheduled or was in
response to the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the testing program, all samples are divided in half, and
if a test comes back positive, then the other half is tested to
confirm the results of the first batch. It is unclear whether
Strawberry _ who is in Florida, according to two baseball officials
_ was actually tested in the last two days, but a refusal to
provide a sample would violate the terms of baseball's after-care
program and place Strawberry at risk of immediate suspension.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who may
ultimately determine whether Strawberry will be given another
chance to play in the major leagues, maintained his public silence
on the matter Friday for the second consecutive day. He did not
return a phone message, and the Yankees offered no statement on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, 37, was arrested in Tampa, Fla., on charges of
possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and the solicitation of an
undercover police officer who was posing as a prostitute. He awaits
arraignment, which is likely to occur in the next two weeks, and
even if his drug test does not reveal the presence of cocaine,
Strawberry is now in a web of law and baseball rules that clearly
endangers his baseball career. Among the many complications he
faces:
</P>
<P>
   _ Possession of cocaine carries a maximum sentence of five
years, and solicitation of prostitution could lead to a 60-day
sentence. Strawberry has maintained his innocence on both charges,
indicating to the police that the drug, wrapped inside a $20 bill,
might have belonged to his wife's uncle _ an assertion denied by
the uncle, according to the police report filed in Strawberry's
case.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry's lawyers attempt to arrange a guilty plea on the
possession charge in return for a reduced sentence, the plea would
be viewed by Major League Baseball as a violation of his after-care
program; Strawberry would be subject to immediate suspension,
according to a baseball lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Because the Yankees wanted to avoid paying a luxury tax for
Strawberry's contract, they gave him a $2.5 million minor league
deal that contained a morals clause; according to the terms of that
agreement, Strawberry had to meet specific standards of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Strawberry has been advised by the Players Association that
this clause is unenforceable in relation to drug issues, according
to a baseball lawyer, because the Yankees' contract is superseded
by the terms of his after-care program with Major League Baseball.
But if Strawberry tests positive, pleads guilty or is convicted of
possession, then he is subject to suspension _ and given that he
was suspended for 60 days in 1995, and that penalties for repeat
offenders have escalated in the past, it stands to reason he would
be suspended for at least half the season. Officials for Major
League Baseball were researching applicable precedents Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Strawberry beats the cocaine-possession charge, or if the
charge is dropped, his career could still be at risk because of the
solicitation charge. Strawberry has a minor league contract with a
provision that the club can terminate the contract if the player
shall ``fail, refuse or neglect to conform players' personal
conduct to high standards of good citizenship and good
sportsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this instance, the conduct clause in Strawberry's
contract would not be superseded by the terms of the drug
after-care program.
</P>
<P>
   After his last suspension, Strawberry was considered untouchable
by clubs other than the Yankees. If he is suspended for half a
season, he will have almost no chance to play the rest of this
year, even if Steinbrenner brought him back, because he would have
to work his way back into shape. If he does not return in 1999, he
will be 38 years old next year, recovering from colon cancer,
moving on a bad knee and coming off a season in which he had a
total of 26 spring training at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, said Friday that
Strawberry's status is on his mind. ``It's in all our thoughts,''
said Zimmer, before adding, ``Life's got to go on.''
</P>

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The confusion about whether NATO
accidentally bombed civilian refugees in Kosovo reflects both the
novelty of the first real air war the alliance has ever fought and
the determination of its American military commander to control
everything NATO says about airstrikes even while he runs the war.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the truth is obscured in the fog between the
security-obsessed NATO military command center in Mons and the
civilian diplomats and bureaucrats of NATO's endless corridors here
in Brussels, an hour away. Brussels and Mons, it turns out, do not
always speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   The military commanders generally believe that the less the
civilian world knows about the tactics, intended targets and
weapons of allied planes, the less able their Serb adversaries will
be to shoot them down. So they want to disclose as little as
possible about those things in the daily briefings at NATO
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomats have to ensure political support for the war
on the home front, which means they need public confidence that
NATO is being forthright about its war aims and honest about how
well allied forces are carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental goal of NATO's bombing campaign is
protecting the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo from murder,
rape, and expulsion by the Serb authorities who rule the province,
so the charge that allied bombs actually killed Albanian refugees
cuts to the very heart of the rationale for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance's inability to answer the charge Friday led to
some sharp exchanges Friday afternoon between reporters demanding
more information from the military and the civilian spokesmen for
NATO, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani of Italy and Jamie P. Shea of
Britain, who devoted a far greater part of their briefing time to
parrying questions than to answering them.
</P>
<P>
   According to NATO officials, Gen. Wesley K. Clark has made
himself the only authoritative military source of information on
the bombing, in part because he has apparently barred subordinate
officers who plan and run the operation in Germany and Italy from
giving press interviews
</P>
<P>
   Stung by earlier criticism about the paucity of military
information on matters such as the number of strikes flown by
allied planes, Clark on Tuesday gave the most extensive public
briefing since the bombing began, the third one he has done
personally.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he briefed NATO ambassadors in private on an air
attack that, in NATO's version, destroyed a civilian tractor
traveling with two other vehicles on a road north of the town of
Djakovica at about 3 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But there was confusion, both in public and in private, about
two other air attacks on the road between Djakovica and Prizren, in
southwestern Kosovo, that Serbian state television said had killed
scores of civilians the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other incidents, they believe all they hit was military
targets,'' a NATO diplomat said. ``They are investigating, but the
normal debriefing process can take 24 hours, and these guys are
trying to take advantage of good weather and bomb military targets,
not spend all their time explaining the one attack that went
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What actually happened on the road between Djakovica and Prizren
is important because Clark and his commanders have been saying
since the bombing started on March 24 that they were doing
everything humanly possible to avoid civilian target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that over time, we will be able to establish the
truth on this. But it may take time,'' Shea said Friday. ``We are
not going to be blown off course by side issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, amid extensive accounts from reporters who were taken to
sites where civilians were killed, purportedly by NATO bombs, and
from refugees who have since crossed into Albania, the alliance has
acknowledged only that a civilian vehicle was struck north of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Even earlier NATO statements about the bombing are now
apparently inoperative. For example, a confirmation by the military
command in Mons Wednesday night that NATO warplanes had made
attacks south of Djakovica has been withdrawn. Shea and Marani
refused to say Friday that there had been any NATO attacks on the
Prizren-Djakovica road Wednesday. ``I do not accept any blame for
any other incident except the one north of Djakovica on which we
briefed you yesterday,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Marani said: ``What we know about our air attacks, we told you
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the civilian and military spokesmen often brief together,
they tend to speak with separate voices.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, who works for NATO's civilian secretary-general, Javier
Solana, has often found himself without much to say about the
bombing, which is left to Clark's own spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The military, for its part, has been loath to give detailed
accounts of its bombing, especially since the Balkans have been
shrouded by clouds for much of the past four weeks, limiting the
effectiveness of the attacks on Serb ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps half the Serb air defenses have been destroyed, one
allied ambassador said this week, but the command has claimed only
about a dozen tanks so far.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Shea and his military colleagues do not even seem to
be reading from the same script. Shea, for instance, started off
Thursday's briefing with bad news first, saying, ``NATO deeply
regrets the loss of life to civilians from the attack yesterday on
a convoy traveling between Prizren and Djakovica.''
</P>
<P>
   He then turned to Marani, who proceeded to give an extensive
explanation of an attack in a different place, one on three
vehicles north of Djakovica. That, he said, was the only one NATO
knew of in which civilians might have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The confusing NATO performance baffled the Pentagon's spokesman,
Kenneth Bacon, as much as it puzzled reporters here. ``I cannot
explain the NATO rendition,'' Bacon said late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clark's spokesman said the allies were preparing to
blast Serb television to stop it from broadcasting propaganda, but
Shea said no they were not, unless television towers were connected
to the military communications network.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication that the alliance realizes that it may need
professional public relations help, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair's office said Friday that his spokesman, Alastair Campbell,
had been asked by Shea and Solana to spend a day looking at their
media operation here.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things they discussed, an announcement from 10
Downing Street said, was ``how to counter the obvious disadvantage
of waging a conflict of this kind when the enemy has total control
of his own media.''

SPORTS COLUMN: UNDER ALL THAT HAIR IS GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, La., Pa., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Experts are calling Saturday's National Football League draft
revolutionary, largely because the sport's most exalted position _
quarterback _ appears to be undergoing a fundamental change.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely for the first time in 28 years, three quarterbacks
will be taken with the first three picks. More than that, for the
first time in NFL history three African-American quarterbacks _
Daunte Culpepper, Donovan McNabb and Akili Smith _ are expected to
be drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't revolution, but evolution. The need for better
players at all positions has overtaken the need to preserve the
myth of white dominance and heroism embodied by the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary aspect of the NFL's 64th draft involves an
emerging culture and a new generation of young players: They are
more independent, more unpredictable, more artistic and less
grateful than previous generations. The revolution is embodied by
Ricky Williams, the running back from the University of Texas. Some
say Williams is the best player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be the first pick. Not because he's a running back, but
largely because he is different.
</P>
<P>
   In the staid, conservative world of professional football
decision makers, where military order and ritual reign, Williams
potentially represents a challenge far more reaching than black
quarterbacks. Williams won the 1998 Heisman Trophy. He is the most
productive running back in Division I history, a runner with
bruising size and speed. He also has the longest braids in Division
I, is one of the few players to have his tongue pierced and is one
of many who are covered with tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Last January Williams fired Woolf &AMP; Associates, which had
represented him, and in February he signed with No Limit Sports
Management. No Limit was formed in 1997 by Master P, who turned a
rap career into a $200 million empire that features a record
company, No Limit. He founded No Limit Sports in 1997 and vowed to
challenge giants in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians and athletes historically have shared the same
creative spaces; now that is being manifested in a business
affiliation. Williams reacted to meeting Master P like fans react
to meeting Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks into my room, and my jaw just drops,'' Williams said.
``I was like, `Oh, my God.' I couldn't even talk. He's going
places. He's come from nowhere to get to the top, and I really
respect that. That's one of the reasons I want to be part of this
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams received warnings from various elements of the sports
establishment that he had better drop No Limit or the NFL power
structure would exclude him from the club. One writer, on national
television, warned Williams that his stock was dropping because he
supposedly showed up at a workout with a posse. In fact, he showed
up with his lawyer; his agent, Leland Hardy, and an accountant.
Williams had gained weight, the effect of his post-Heisman
celebrity. ``I told him to enjoy himself,'' Hardy said. ``You only
experience that once in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy designed a six-city, three-day tour, visiting teams that
held five of the first six picks. Williams met with owners and
general managers. They sat down and talked, broke bread. The
Saints' owner flew in from the owners' meetings to have dinner with
Williams and Hardy. Beneath the hair and tattoos they found an
engaging 21-year-old with insights. With a love of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams burned off the extra pounds, and in workouts he showed
that under the hair and the tattoos is an extraordinary runner. ``I
think he's a special player who comes out once in a while,'' Saints
Coach Mike Ditka said. ``Like Earl Campbell, Walter Payton. Like
Tony Dorsett. Those are special players. That's exactly what I see.
I think he's the big difference-maker right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Williams is not like Earl Campbell, who preceded him
at Texas. Campbell, in the typical, conservative
don't-rock-the-boat mode of old, warned Williams to get rid of the
accessories and cut his hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be being foolish,'' Williams said last week, ``but it
seems like because I'm the way I am and I do things the way I want
to do them and I'm not really a conformist, that people don't want
to see me succeed sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, 37, who was a heavyweight boxer, completed his MBA at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business and earned
a master's degree in international relations. He maintains an
office in Harlem. He speaks four languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to challenge,'' Hardy said, referring to taking on
the giant sports agents. ``They have inertia, they have a lot of
clients. But they also see the writing on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a mild revolution going on around the NFL. Black
quarterbacks are a small part of it, but Ricky Williams is the real
harbinger of change: change of perception, challenging executives
and coaches to look beneath the surface, beneath the skin. In this
case, beneath the braids.

VALHOL CAMP DENIES JOCKEY USED SHOCK DEVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valhol, the 30-1 shot who won the Arkansas Derby and touched off
an investigation, galloped over the Churchill Downs track in
Louisville, Ky., for the first time Friday morning in preparation
for the Kentucky Derby while his owner and trainer issued strong
denials of any wrongdoing by their jockey.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was requested by the operators of the Oaklawn Park,
where Valhol won last Saturday in a stunning upset for his first
victory in only the third race of his career. They reported that a
race track employee had found an electrical device on the track
after the race, and asked the Arkansas State Racing Commission to
investigate whether the jockey Billy Patin had used it to shock
Valhol into running faster.
</P>
<P>
   The commission in turn ordered the track to suspend distribution
of the $500,000 purse for the race _ $300,000 would go to Valhol _
and Oaklawn's evidence was turned over to the Thoroughbred Racing
Protective Bureau, the investigative branch of the thoroughbred
racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't feel there was evidence, we wouldn't be having
this meeting,'' said commission chairman Cecil Alexander at the
meeting called to announce the action. ``We certainly hope to have
this resolved before the Kentucky Derby because it is so important
for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby will be run at Churchill Downs two weeks from
today. If more than 20 horses are entered, which seems likely, the
field will be reduced to the top 20 earners in graded stakes races.
If Valhol does not have his $300,000 in prize money from the
Arkansas Derby, he will be left with just $38,400 in stakes
earnings and would be hard-pressed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol finished second in his debut in February and fourth in
the Louisiana Derby in March before winning the Arkansas Derby.
</P>
<P>
   His rider, Patin, an obscure jockey on the Louisiana Circuit,
had won 9 of 120 races this year. He traveled to Churchill Downs
with the horse and the horse's trainer but made no comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy told me he didn't do it, no way, no how,'' said the
trainer, Dallas Keen. ``And I believe him. It's like a bad
nightmare, but it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   James Jackson, the Texas breeder who owns Valhol, said from
Dallas, ``I think it's a witch hunt.'' He added: ``There is no
wrongdoing at all. It's just professional jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would take legal action if his horse was
disqualified from the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The use of batteries to enhance a horse's performance is nothing
new to racing, but has never been detected in a major race. &QL;

FIGURE IN 20-YEAR SCHOOL FUNDING SCHEME JUSTIFIES IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rabbi at the center of a scheme that funneled
millions of public school dollars from a Brooklyn district to a
Jewish girls' school said Friday that he knew dozens of Hasidic
housewives were collecting paychecks and insurance benefits for
no-show jobs, but that he justified the arrangement in his own mind
because he believed it benefited the children who attended his
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right to say, `The end justifies the means,''' the
rabbi, Hertz Frankel, said Friday, in his first interview since
pleading guilty April 9 to one count of conspiracy in the 20-year
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's comments came as investigators, and the rabbi
himself, shed new light on how a criminal operation of such
magnitude had gone undetected for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that the arrangement had flourished with
no interference, in part because the officials of Community School
District 14 who engineered and maintained the scheme were able to
exploit the school system's decentralized bureaucracy with little
fear of getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   The central Board of Education's bookkeeping was so lax, the
investigators said, that there was little chance that a central
administrator would notice if the Williamsburg district used city
and state tax money to assign 30 extra security guards to the
district office who never showed up for work _ one of the main
ruses that the conspirators employed to divert paychecks to the
Beth Rachel School for Girls in Williamsburg, where the rabbi was a
principal.
</P>
<P>
   Though perhaps one-third of the $6 million siphoned to the
Jewish school was from the federal Title 1 program, which pays the
salaries of remedial teachers in public and private schools, the
investigators said that it would have been difficult for auditors
to uncover the misuse of that money. That is because the girls'
school, given its poor population, was entitled to much of it.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using the federal money to pay its remedial
teachers, investigators said, the school often gathered the
paychecks in one pool for any number of uses, including the
purchase of equipment and books, and the hiring of secretaries. The
teachers entitled to the money, investigators said, were often
given only a fraction of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Though investigators have been unable to account for a large
portion of the money, in part because the checks were often cashed
at street-front check-cashing services, they have uncovered no
evidence that Frankel, 68, derived any personal benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real crime here,'' said one official familiar with the
scheme, which lasted from 1973 until 1994, ``is that every year the
district siphoned off all this money, before they decided whether
they were going to be able to rehire all their teachers or buy new
books. They said, `This is for Frankel.'''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a statement issued on his behalf on Thursday, the day
the scheme was first revealed by the special commissioner of
investigation for the city schools, Frankel said Friday that he had
been led to believe that the scheme was legitimate by two men who
are no longer in a position to argue with him. They are the
district's longtime superintendent, William Rogers, and his
successor, Mario DeStefano; they died in 1993 and 1996,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel said that Rogers had conceived the scheme because he
believed that Hasidic children should be entitled to public money
even if they attended parochial schools. ``It was easy on my
conscience,'' said the rabbi, 68, ``that the man in charge of this
program said, `Don't worry, Hertz' _ and he used to call me by my
first name _ `I am responsible. I direct you. I want to help these
children. I want them to get as much as they possibly can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was unclear what benefit Rogers received in return for
his largess, he was re-elected superintendent over an exceptionally
long period _ 20 years _ with the support of a critical, Hasidic
bloc on the community school board. Though Frankel denied holding
any sway over the members of the board, he acknowledged that he
played an important political role in the Satmar community. It was
he, for example, who arranged visits for the grand rabbi with
everyone from presidents to governors to mayors. And it was he who
did the translating.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could justify that dozens of women _ some of them
with 10 children each _ were able to enjoy health insurance
benefits for jobs they did not do, the rabbi said it was easy.
Though those women kept their benefits, they gave up their
paychecks to teachers at the school who had no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it balanced,'' he said.

PATAKIS RELEASE TAX RETURNS, REPORTING INCOME OF $246,417  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki and his wife, Libby, reported
income of $246,417 last year, a sharp drop from the previous year,
but the tax returns they released Friday also showed that Mrs.
Pataki has begun a new job in which she is paid to give speeches on
behalf of a medical products company, with a salary of $90,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman announced that she and her
husband, John, earned $1.4 million in federally taxable income last
year. As they have in the past, they filed for a four-month
extension to complete their tax forms, saying that they would make
a full disclosure in August.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has suggested in the past that his family has difficulty
living on only his state salary, which in January rose to $179,000
from $130,000, and as a result, he gives speeches for fees of at
least $15,000 each. Last year, he earned $50,000 for three speeches
and $24,000 more for his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   While the speeches have drawn criticism, Mrs. Pataki's
employment has also attracted scrutiny, and now, she, too, will be
paid to deliver speeches. In her new job as a consultant with an
Oregon-based company, Premier Heart, she will speak to groups about
being vigilant against heart disease, while promoting the company's
new testing device.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Mrs. Pataki's first foray into health education.
Since the governor took office, she has often talked publicly about
fighting breast cancer. Those speeches were not for fees.
</P>
<P>
   The work for Premier Heart is Mrs. Pataki's second consulting
job. In Pataki's first term, Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir and
benefactor to conservative causes, hired her to advise him on
expanding his television broadcasting business in the Middle East.
The governor's aides have said Mrs. Pataki has experience in
international business and family ties in Morocco. Lauder paid her
$80,000 last year, according to the returns.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pataki's hiring by Premier Heart was arranged by a college
friend of the governor, Richard Hayden, who is a principal in
Premier Heart. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Patakis, said
Mrs. Pataki did not have experience in the medical field but was
hired for her marketing expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is going to be helping to market whatever product it is
that they produce,'' McKeon said, adding that Mrs. Pataki would
have no contact with state government in her work.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said in a telephone interview that he helped found
Premier Heart last year to market a diagnostic device called the
Cardiotron, which is similar to a sophisticated electrocardiogram.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to figure out how to promote the product,''
Hayden said. ``Libby had done a lot of speaking on breast cancer,
quite effectively I thought, and we said wouldn't it be great to be
able to promote the fight against heart disease.

COUCH TO BROWNS IS LIKELY, BUT THE REST OF THE NFL DRAFT IS UP IN
THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When quarterback Tim Couch worked out with the Cleveland Browns
for a second time last week, his passes had more zip and his step
had an extra bounce. The Browns' management saw enough to feel
comfortable with the fact that Couch could lead their team for the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But while it seems 90 percent certain that the Browns will take
Couch with the first pick in Saturday's NFL draft, all kinds of
machinations could affect their choice, including their contract
negotiations with Couch's agent, Tom Condon. If there are no snags,
Couch will most likely be a Brown.
</P>
<P>
   After that, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   Which players will go where depends on whom you talk to and
when. Last month, the draft order looked like this: Couch as the
No. 1 pick, then running back Ricky Williams to Philadelphia,
quarterback Akili Smith to Cincinnati, linebacker Chris Claiborne
to Indianapolis and cornerback Champ Bailey to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, that completely changed, with the Browns talking
about Smith and Williams as candidates for the top spot. And
Friday, one top league executive had the first five picks as Couch,
quarterback Daunte Culpepper, Smith, Williams and Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, put on your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Expect a number of trades throughout the two days of the draft,
including several high-profile ones in the first round. While it is
hard this time of year to figure out what teams are really trying
to do _ they tell each other all kinds of lies _ several themes
were still developing late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints continued to try to move from the 12th
spot overall into the top four to get Williams. The Saints are
offering all of their picks from this year's draft, plus several
next year and players off their roster. So far, they have not had
any takers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys might lose Leon Lett, their star defensive
lineman, to a drug suspension, so they are almost certain to take a
defensive lineman with their pick, the 22nd. They want North
Carolina's Ebenezer Ekuban, a 6-foot-3-inch, 281-pound player who
is probably the most athletic defensive lineman in the draft. The
Cowboys are so enamored with Ekuban that they have had a
representative at his house recently, trying to negotiate a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay Packers, as they did last year, are trying to move
up from the 25th spot and have been talking with Seattle, which
picks 17th. Ron Wolf, the Packers' general manager, is one of the
best personnel men in the league and likes adventures on draft day.
If he does trade with Seattle, Wolf wants either a cornerback like
Antwan Edwards of Clemson or a defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Culpepper's stock has increased dramatically in the last
48 hours. Baltimore, picking 10th, likes him. Also, the Raiders
want Culpepper but do not think he will be around at No. 18 when
they select. If he is not, they are comfortable with UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   And the most sure pick in the draft? Bailey, from Georgia, who
is considered one of the most versatile players in college football
history. He can play wide receiver, return kicks or fly the space
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Teams believe Bailey is the one player in the draft who is a
lock to succeed. ``Our scouts tell us the safest player on our
board is Champ Bailey,'' said Carmen Policy, president of the
Browns. ``They say he's an impact player who is going to contribute
right from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we were going to go the absolute safest route,'' Policy
added, ``that's the player to take.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers' draft is being run by Bill Walsh, who
wants a quarterback in the first round. Yet he seems to be ignoring
the fact that the 49ers desperately need defensive players. They
may address that need in rounds three through five.
</P>
<P>
   The draft remains strong in terms of offensive linemen, with one
general manager saying a team can get a solid one through the third
round. The executive also said that talented defensive linemen go
only about five deep, that the linebackers over all have excellent
speed, and there is not a lot of depth at cornerback but there is
at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the draft is interesting, because there are always a
number of surprises. This draft will have likely have its share _
and then some. &QL;

 &HT;    Promotor Harmon retiring from racing

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Harmon, one of stock-car racing's most flamboyant
_ and successful _ promoters is retiring after Saturday's races at
Nashville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Since he started in the mid-1950s, Harmon has promoted races at
more than 50 tracks, including Macon Raceway, Senoia Raceway,
Lanier National Speedway and Peach State Speedway in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   His latest effort, at Nashville Speedway USA, saw him take an
operation that was nearly broke and transform it into the top short
track in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But at 66, he says he's ready to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my day in the sun, and I've enjoyed it tremendously,
but I just don't have the energy I used to,'' Harmon said.

 &HT;    McReynolds bids to buy Rudd team
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Larry McReynolds, crew chief for driver Mike
Skinner, submitted a bid to buy the Winston Cup team of veteran
Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, a 25-year veteran and one of only four drivers on the Cup
circuit who owns his own team, is looking to make changes to the
struggling Tide-sponsored No. 10 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Various media outlets reported that CART owner Chip Ganassi is
interested in buying the team, but Rudd denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, 42, says he might not sell the team altogether. In fact,
he says he may add a partner, which would allow him to add a second
car and become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could take in the right partner to make the team
stronger and better, and help me with the business side to expand,
that would be great,'' he said. ``We definitely need to be looking
at going with a multi-car team, whether it's now or next year. But
it's gonna take more than me handling that because it's become big
business.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds, who plans on leaving Richard Childress Racing after
this season to form his own team, says his offer to Rudd may not be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd is 35th in points going into Sunday's Goody's Body Pain
500. He entered this year with at least one victory in each of the
last 16 seasons. Around the track
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip qualified on speed for the third race in a row,
posting the 25th-best average speed at 94.153 mph. ... James Ince
resigned as crew chief for the No. 16 Ford team, citing
``philosophical differences'' with Roush Racing management and
driver Kevin Lepage. Ince was replace by Tommy Morgan, crew chief
for Jeff Burton's Busch team.

 &HT;    Rookie Stewart first in fast field
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Rookie Tony Stewart raised quite a stir in
the first seven races of the Winston Cup season. He started on the
front row of his first Daytona 500 in February, and then posted
consecutive sixth-place finishes at Darlington and Texas last
month.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Stewart captured his first pole by breaking the track
record in first-round qualifying for Sunday's Goody's Body Pain 500
at Martinsville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, whose No. 20 Pontiac was the 45th of 46 cars to run,
covered the .526-mile oval in 19.875 seconds, an average speed of
95.275 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 27, was one of 24 drivers who broke Martinsville's
qualifying record of 94.129 mph, set by Ted Musgrave in September
1994. Stewart's speed also dismantled an all-Roush Racing front row
of Mark Martin and Jeff Burton, who will start second and third,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a former champion in midgets and sprint cars from
Columbus, Ind., says he was even surprised by his fifth top-10
qualifying effort of the season. Less than two weeks ago, he
struggled in testing at Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up (Friday) morning and really didn't want to get out
of bed,'' he said. ``On the other hand, I thought this was going to
be a true test of how my season is going to be. This is the first
place where I've really, really struggled in testing. I was really
dejected when I left. ... I thought for sure we'd be a second-round
qualifier and have to fight to get in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stewart will be trying for his first Winston Cup
victory. There have been only two Winston Cup rookies to win races
at Martinsville _ Earl Rossin 1974 and Morgan Sheppard in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who earned his third top-5 start of the season, says he
won't be shocked if Stewart becomes the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running against him in the Busch series, I was
really impressed by his ability,'' Burton said. ``Tony's going to
be a guy that we're going to have to race for a long time....
They're just doing a great job. They're a rookie team and they've
taken advantage of the tests that they've gotten. They deserve
every bit of credit that they get.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart is getting plenty of notice, including comparisons
to NASCAR's last phenomenal rookie, two-time defending Winston Cup
champion Jeff Gordon, who broke into the circuit full-time in 1993.
Gordon's average finish in his first seven races was 17th;
Stewart's was 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has obviously benefited from driving for
established owner Joe Gibbs, as well as the steadying influence of
teammate Bobby Labonte, says he isn't ready to get ahead of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two goals we set at the beginning of the season are the
same ones we're going to carry all the way through the end of the
year,'' Stewart said. ``That's just to qualify in the first round
and get in the top 25 each week, and then try to finish as many
laps as we can on race day. Anything more than that was going to be
a bonus.

 &HT;    Cather demoted to AAA
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Braves optioned reliever Mike Cather to Class AAA
Richmond to make room for John Hudek on the 25-man roster and to
give Cather some time to work on his control.
</P>
<P>
   Cather, who is coming back from rib extraction surgery, has
struggled with the location of his pitches, causing him to be used
sparingly this season. In four appearances, he has given up three
runs in 2.2 innings. Monday in Philadelphia he gave up a pair of
solo home runs _ to Alex Arias and Scott Rolen _ in one inning. He
managed to win the game but it was clear he was not pitching
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' Cather said. ``You always see yourself
as a big-league pitcher, going back to the minor leagues isn't fun
for anybody. I'm hoping to capitalize on it.... It could be a
blessing. I know I'm going to get some innings. I've got to take
advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year in a row Cather has started the season
on the Atlanta roster, only to be sent down. But this time he's not
letting it get to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take it personally anymore,'' Cather said. ``I know
it's for the good of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cather said his arm feels fine, and his pitches are as live as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just been inconsistent,'' Cather said. ``I've been
inconsistent with my breaking ball and the location of my
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Cather's opportunities to pitch in Atlanta were shrinking, so
he'll welcome the Richmond assignment in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can throw in bullpens until your eyes cross,'' Cather
said. ``Throwing in game situations is where you get your stuff
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Atlanta manager Bobby Cox: ``It may have been smart letting
him spend the first two weeks in Richmond. Maybe it's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves placed reliever Kerry Ligtenberg on the 60-day
disabled list to create a spot for Hudek on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez could have played Friday, saying he was completely
recovered from the twinge he felt in his lower back on Wednesday
night. ... Ryan Klesko is still plagued by a hamstring pull and is
not expected to return in this series.

 &HT;    Two picks for Reeves on first day
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The start of today's NFL draft will look boring to
Falcons fans. Atlanta doesn't pick until 30th, some four or five
hours into in the first round. The Falcons will have just two picks
today, the next coming third-from-last in the third round _ about
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No one is speculating that the Falcons will trade for a better
pick. When a team has traded away its second-round pick, gone last
year for wide receiver Tony Martin, and when its third-round pick
is so late, it doesn't have much to barter with _ unless it wants
to send a veteran packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at the level we're at,'' coach Dan Reeves said,
``nobody wants to help you out.'' So don't be shocked if Atlanta
trades back to pick up later picks, especially if the Falcons can't
land a quality defensive end in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of 22 starters return from last year's team, and the
three other spots are all but spoken for, by newly acquired strong
safety Marty Carter and wide receiver Chris Calloway and by last
year's No. 1 draft choice, linebacker Keith Brooking.
</P>
<P>
   But 14 projected starters have contracts scheduled to expire
after next season. Ten are to become unrestricted free agents, and
three will become restricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is defensive end, the one position that
could force the Falcons to try to trade for a better choice. Only
starters Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau have played in an NFL
game, and both have contracts that expire after next season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta likes defensive ends Jevon Kearse of Florida, Virginia's
Patrick Kerney, Saginaw Valley State's Lamar King, and perhaps
Florida State's Tony Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we've got a defensive end we like, and there are three
teams we think are going to take a defensive end,'' Reeves said,
``we might get on the phone and try to trade picks with a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four teams immediately in front of the Falcons _
No. 26 Jacksonville, No. 27 San Francisco, and No. 29 Minnesota _
seem to be interested in defensive ends.
</P>
<P>
   Another NFC team might be reluctant to trade with the defending
conference champions. That would leave Buffalo at No. 23. The Bills
are interested in a cornerback, and there could be at least two
first-round caliber corners available at No. 30.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta stands pat, and those ends and defensive tackles
Anthony McFarland of LSU and Reggie McGrew of Florida all are gone,
the Falcons probably would select the best player available from
among cornerbacks Antoine Winfield, Fernando Bryant and Fred
Vinson, wide receivers Kevin Johnson, Troy Edwards and Peerless
Price and Georgia tackle Matt Stinchcomb. Syracuse fullback Rob
Konrad is a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also have labeled 10-15 players as ``can't miss,''
and team officials expect them to go quickly. But if one of them
slips to No. 30, Reeves said Atlanta would choose him regardless of
position.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Atlanta would trade back into the
second round.

 &HT;    Browns trying to sign Couch for right price
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The process that should culminate with the Cleveland
Browns taking Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch with the first choice
in today's draft began in earnest Friday afternoon. After days of
talking by telephone, agent Tom Condon and Cleveland salary-cap
expert Lal Heneghan initiated face-to-face negotiations aimed at
reaching a deal before the start of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, this shouldn't be that hard,'' Condon said.
``But, hey, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a negotiation rife with intrigue. Condon negotiated
a landmark contract last year for Peyton Manning and has hinted he
wants a deal that is about 8 percent more _ the increase of the
rookie pool over 1998 _ than the six-year, $38 million Manning got.
The Browns want to hold the line on the contract, and their
posturing the past few days indicates they will try to squeeze
Condon a bit.
</P>
<P>
   There also is talk that agent Leigh Steinberg, who represents
Oregon quarterback Akili Smith, is willing to undercut Condon's
figures in an attempt to persuade the Browns that his client should
be the first choice. Steinberg said Friday evening that there had
been no negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the matter of Condon and Carmen Policy, the
Browns' team president. Condon works for Cleveland-based IMG, the
sports and entertainment giant that Policy thinks was heavy-handed
in its failed attempts to land the franchise's marketing deals.
Some club officials feel IMG was the source of a misinformation
campaign aimed at discrediting Smith's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Falling star
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is prohibited from publicly discussing players under
scrutiny, but officials did privately confirm they are reviewing
the results of a positive drug test by Dallas defensive tackle Leon
Lett. Friday morning, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones informed his
coaching staff that Lett's availability for 1999 is uncertain. That
could dramatically alter the team's strategy in the first round.
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey had hoped Louisiana Tech wide receiver
Troy Edwards might fall to him at the 22nd spot. If Lett is
sanctioned, however, Dallas might be forced to look to a player
like Florida defensive tackle Reggie McGrew. The club is attempting
to trade up for a shot at LSU defensive tackle Anthony McFarland.
Lett has been suspended twice for violating the NFL's drug-abuse
policy. He could be suspended for a year if the recent test is
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Maneuvering
</P>
<P>
   New England offered wide receiver Terry Glenn as part of a
package to St. Louis, hoping to get into position to select Miami
tailback Edgerrin James. ... Bengals coach Bruce Coslet would
prefer to trade out of the third spot, fall back and select UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown. But owner Mike Brown wants to stay put and
take Akili Smith. ... Detroit coach Bobby Ross is trying to
persuade Lions management to sign defensive end Marco Coleman,
which could affect the club's draft plans. ... The Saints made an
offer to Philadelphia that had Eagles officials thinking about
trading down from the No. 2 spot. It's believed the Saints included
defensive end Joe Johnson in the package. ... Rams officials still
aren't settled on whether they'll take North Carolina State wideout
Torry Holt or Arizona corner Chris McAlister with the sixth pick.
... Miami coach Jimmy Johnson was trying hard to move into the top
six picks. If he can't move up, Johnson wants to trade out of the
first round and draft McNeese State tailback Cecil Collins in the
second. ... Don't be surprised if the Falcons select Notre Dame
offensive lineman Mike Rosenthal in the third round. ... St. Louis
hopes to trade quarterback Tony Banks today to Dallas, Washington
or Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Super sleepers
</P>
<P>
   Some players that fans don't know, but who could be off the
board by the end of today's action: DE/LB Joey Porter (Colorado
State), CB Anthony Parker (Weber State), DE Chike Okeafor (Purdue),
DT Cletidus Hunt (Kentucky State), OG Tony Coats (Washington), RB
Joe Montgomery (Ohio State), OG Randy Thomas (Mississippi State),
DE Roderick Coleman (East Carolina), WR Darnell McDonald (Kansas
State).
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith on the workout the Browns had with Couch on Sunday,
a session in which the Kentucky star impressed Cleveland coach
Chris Palmer enough to secure the No. 1 spot: ``It was like they
said, `OK, we're going to give you a second chance at this.' Hey,
if they'd given me the chance to throw for Carmen Policy and
(owner) Al Lerner, I would have put on a show they'd never forget.

 &HT;    Get an eraser: Draft scenarios change rapidly
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call Leland Hardy, the agent for Heisman Trophy
tailback Ricky Williams, and his answering machine greets you in
three languages.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty about today's NFL draft, such an eclectic
approach probably is appropriate. The final draft of the '90s is
shaping up as one in which pre-draft impressions probably won't be
lasting ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do all the planning and be as diligent as possible
and, in a draft like this one, it might not matter,'' Tampa Bay
coach Tony Dungy said. ``There are going to be a lot of trades
evolving, and you're going to have to react and be able to think on
your feet. What seems to be happening one minute could be the
opposite a minute later. You'll just have to trust your judgment
and instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half-dozen selections appear set: For the first time
since 1971, the first three choices will be quarterbacks. But
little is settled after that.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that a few teams hope to maneuver up
toward the top, more wish to move down, and, typically, Miami coach
Jimmy Johnson is prepared to do both. By the time the first round
ends tonight, the NFL will have worn down plenty of erasers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Johnson, some general managers, such as Ron
Wolf of Green Bay, placed more emphasis this spring on assigning
very specific values on prospects. Those teams know in what round,
and what portion of that round, they want to get a player. Because
this year's draft is viewed as average in most areas, teams want to
avoid reaching for a player and taking him at a spot higher than
his rating on their draft board.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever, you pay for your mistakes,'' Cincinnati owner
Mike Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the quarterbacks will grab the spotlight
today. Only four times since 1970 have more than two quarterbacks
gone in the first round. Five likely will go today, the most since
the six of the celebrated Class of '83.
</P>
<P>
   Just as notable is that three of the quarterbacks are black,
equaling the highest number of African-American quarterbacks in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   However, the offensive linemen are the ones lending depth to
this draft. Nine blockers are included in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's top 50 players, and 10 to 12 linemen could
be selected in the first two rounds.

 &HT;    Army `black helicopter' training goes boom in the night
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The black helicopters, and the specially-trained
U.S. Army troops they dropped across South Texas for 10 days in
February, are gone now.
</P>
<P>
   In their wake, they left a trail of tales that will be told,
retold, and embellished for years _ the soldiers rappelling into
cities, the explosions, the accidental fire, the satchel full of
cash to pay for damages. And they ignited a new round of buzz among
those who consider the helicopters symbols of government oppression
or a coming one-world order.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Special Operations Command's training exercises _
dubbed Operation Last Dance _ were the latest in a 10-year effort
to give the United States' elite troops real-world experience in
different urban environments. And in town after town, local leaders
remain divided over whether they would invite the soldiers back for
an encore.
</P>
<P>
   In Alice, Police Chief Jack Compton said he would be honored to
see the units return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a damn well-run operation,'' Compton said of
the Feb. 12 exercise at a former poultry plant. ``For some of the
folks living in the area it was a big event. They sat on their
porches (to watch) and had a grand old time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kingsville, Tomas Sanchez, head of Kleburg County's emergency
management office, said he and other county officials weren't
notified of the Feb. 8 operation _ city officials were _ and that
he would try to stop any future exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see a bunch of helicopters coming and a bunch of men
rappelling with no markings on their uniforms, and bang-bang,
boom-boom, you get a little concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as a year before, Army representatives had quietly
approached officials in a number of Texas cities, seeking
permission to stage training missions in abandoned buildings. There
would be helicopters and explosions and small-arms fire, they said,
but the grenades would be weaker versions of the real thing, the
bullets would be plastic, and buildings would be prepared
beforehand to protect people and property.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Bragg, N.C., home of the Special Operations Command, the
exercises are an essential part of training the Army's elite
forces, which number 27,000 active and reserve members, said
spokesman Walter Sokalski. Since the late 1980s, Sokalski said,
they have used populated areas to stage missions that serve as a
final exam for the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The initial homework takes place at bases around the country,
where soldiers practice in buildings erected to simulate an urban
environment, Sokalski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we move to a real-world environment where you have things
like telephone lines and different lighting, to see if they've
learned the skills they need to learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas exercises involved 65 soldiers and support personnel,
said Maj. Jeff Fanto, spokesman for the U.S. Special Operations
Command at Fort MacDill, Fla., headquarters for the nation's elite
military units. He said he knows of no civilian injuries or deaths
during an urban special operations exercise. Jamming 911 lines
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 8 in Kingsville, a city of 27,000 near Corpus Christi,
eight helicopters hovered over several downtown buildings in the
evening as local police cordoned off a three-block area. Dark-clad
soldiers with night-vision goggles slid down ropes, then muffled
booms and shots erupted inside the old Exxon building and the
former police headquarters. The blasts blew out windows at the
Exxon building, despite the plywood tacked up to contain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor recessed a city meeting so local officials could
watch. But it looked all too real to those nearby residents who
hadn't been notified of the exercise _ including many who lived in
the Casa Ricardo retirement home across the street. Callers lit up
the 911 lines.
</P>
<P>
   Then a mishap. According to Kingsville Fire Marshal Lupe Garcia,
soldiers cutting through a door in the old jail with a blowtorch
started a fire that spread beyond their control. ``It gutted the
room pretty well,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire department, which according to fire chief Coronado
Garza had less than two hours' notice before the exercise, put out
the blaze in less than 20 minutes. Sanchez, the county emergency
management chief, said Kingsville police weren't alerted soon
enough to notify all of the surrounding businesses and residents.
And although city leaders approved of the exercise, he said county
officials were kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caused a little bit of bitterness and friction,'' he said.
``It's not what they did, it's how they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army wasn't asked to pay for the damage to the old police
building because it was going to be torn down anyway, said Police
Chief Felipe Garza. But he and other officials said the Army
promptly paid the police and fire departments for their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid cash money,'' said Garcia, the fire marshal. ``They
had a satchel ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanto, the U.S. Special Operations Command spokesman, said he
isn't sure whether the Army reimburses local officials for police
and fire services. ``I really don't know anything about that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said more than 50 citizens called 911, most of them
``inquiring just what the hell the noise was.'' In the following
days, Garza said he got more calls, this time from talk-radio shows
around the country wanting him to go on the air live to talk about
the operation. Internet sites sizzled with stories of U.S. soldiers
invading a small Texas town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I've been on more radio talk shows,'' Garza said. He said
he tried to knock down the conspiracy talk, but he's not sure it
did any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alarmists will continue to sound the alarm, the Chicken
Littles will still see the sky fall, and the anti-military and
anti-government types will still be against the government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed welcome
</P>
<P>
   From Kingsville, the soldiersmoved on to the Corpus Christi
area, where they staged several days' worth of exercises, and to
Alice and finally San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Blackhawk helicopters dart over a former water
treatment plant, a refinery area, and Harbor Island, across the
water from his city, Corpus Christi Mayor Loyd Neal said he was
proud that the area could help soldiers hone their skills for
dangerous missions.
</P>
<P>
   Some citizens expressed concern about the maneuvers, but Neal
said the Army sent the commanding officer and an Army operations
specialist to speak at a city council meeting after the operation
began to give residents more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad that Corpus Christi, with its rich military
tradition, was selected for one of these sites,'' said Neal, a
retired Army colonel. ``As I told them, we'd be glad to have them
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Aransas Mayor Glenn Martin was less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was somewhat disturbing, since we didn't know they were
coming,'' Martin said of the Army's maneuvers on nearby Harbor
Island. ``But we had no problems, no damage. In this area, we're
used to military exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alice, a city of 20,000, an exercise in an abandoned poultry
processing plant at the edge of town generated only three phone
calls, said Compton, the police chief. But when the helicopters
reached San Antonio Feb. 18, an old controversy was waiting for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Army finished its operation at Fort Sam Houston, a military
base just northeast of downtown. Mayor Howard Peak said the Army
chose the base because he and the police chief had rebuffed an
earlier request to stage maneuvers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Peak said, Army officials approached him about
training in San Antonio, but he refused to give his consent because
the Army would not divulge the details of the operation. At that
point, he said, ``they tried to go around us and offer money to
people for their support, which was very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Peak said Army officials offered to make donations to a City
Council member's favorite charity in order to win his support. The
council member, Mario Salas, told San Antonio reporters he rejected
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Fanto said there was no such offer. ``We do not do business by
bribery or those types of things,'' Fanto said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Peak said, the operation at Fort Sam Houston went
smoothly. San Antonio has a strong relationship with the military,
he said, but he will never consent to operations within the city.
</P>
<P>
   And what about Austin? City Manager Jesus Garza said he has
never heard of a request from the Army to conduct such drills here.
He said such a decision would be made by the City Council, with
input from the city's police and fire chiefs and emergency
management office.

 &HT;    Ted Turner and the West `as it was meant to be'
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner has dreamed of bigger game ever since he
kept salamanders in a jar as a 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Young Ted lay in bed some nights picturing 1,000 bison crossing
a grassy plain that stretched to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five years later, Turner has 17,000 bison roaming on nine
ranches in the American West. The massive, shaggy-headed beasts
represent more than the fulfillment of a childhood dream.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of an ambitious and controversial effort to
restore a trampled and overgrazed American West to the glory it
knew in the days when the Sioux dominated the Great Plains. And,
ever the wily businessman who turned an outdoor advertising
business into a multibillion-dollar media company, Turner wants the
effort to pay for itself, if not turn a small profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Teddy Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller, who at the
turn of the century bought millions of acres of wild land, has
anyone tried to save so much of the country's natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody doing land conservation on that scale that
Turner is,'' says John Sawhill, president and chief executive of
the Nature Conservancy. ``He's really leaving a legacy. His efforts
will make a difference in the landscape for future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's ranches are about something deeply personal,
representing a lifelong pattern of searching for things that are
fun, challenging and part of a larger crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bringing back the old West, saving key pieces of the world
from development,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing it because I enjoy it. It's that simple. At some
point I'm going to retire, and I'm a very active person. These
ranches will give me something pleasurable to do,'' says Turner,
vice chairman of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' Turner adds with his trademark wink, ``I've always
been a collector and the buffalo nickel was the favorite in my coin
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner has rarely discussed his plan with anyone outside a close
circle of friends and family. But, as his operations have grown, he
feels the need to explain his goals out West. That's why an Atlanta
Journal-Constitution photographer and reporter spent several days
at one of his ranches _ the Vermejo Park Ranch in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While Turner has his supporters, many Westerners are suspicious.
They see him as some ``Hollywood'' outsider who doesn't understand
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Most ranchers would shoot the coyotes Turner keeps on his land.
And they resent his removing the fencing that long divided the West
into individual cattle pens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of skepticism by other ranchers,'' says
David Vacker, general manager of Vermejo Park Ranch, Turner's
largest single property. ``But a lot of them are coming by at least
to take a look at what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   What visiting ranchers see are tens of thousands of acres burned
black to clear the way for the restoration of native trees and
grass. If they're lucky, visitors might also see the wolves,
black-footed ferrets, bison and other endangered native Western
animals Turner is trying to reintroduce on his land.
</P>
<P>
   A family affair
</P>
<P>
   Turner is no stranger to controversy. It has dogged him since he
helped launch the cable TV industry in the early 1970s. But unlike
that effort, which made him a multibillionaire, his ranches and
environmental effort are a family affair. Two of his sons, Teddy
Jr. and Beau, are heavily involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is the right thing to do with our ranches,
the right thing for the family and the right thing for the
future,'' says R.E. ``Teddy'' Turner Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy Jr. and Beau, Turner's second- and fourth-born children,
serve as their father's right and left hands in running his
ranches. They are as different as a sports jacket is from a fishing
vest.
</P>
<P>
   Beau, 31, is the fishing vest. A towering, lean figure and an
expert hunter and fly fisherman, Beau is partial to worn pants and
hiking boots. He's a naturalist by training, and preservation ideas
burble from him like a stream flowing in mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But Beau is no backwoods recluse. It's his job to oversee all
his father's land and scout out new purchases. He takes his job
very seriously, spending most of his time traveling among his
father's ranches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stewardship is everything,'' says Beau. ``Heck, bison could
ruin the land just as much as cattle if not handled right.'' He
wants his family's land to set an example.
</P>
<P>
   At the ranches, Beau works to keep everyone from the kitchen
help to managers enthusiastic and on task. His chief tools are
traits he inherited from Dad. He's got Turner's gruff laugh,
flashing smile and winning enthusiasm. And, like Dad, he's got a
hearty slap on the back for anyone within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Beau works his father as deftly as he does the ranch hands. He
wants him to keep buying land, saving it from the rapid
urbanization engulfing large parts of the West. And to save the
bison, Beau needs ever more land to support expanding herds.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental preservation interests aren't limited to the
West. He has recently considered land for his father to buy in
Alaska and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Too much?
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, 35-year-old Teddy considers land purchases as part
of a bigger business calculation and worries his father is buying
too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Beau sees Dad's legacy as protecting the land,'' Teddy
says. ``But I worry that we'll get in over our head. We can't sell
all the bison meat we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Teddy's business sense is hard won, sharpened after years of
working for his father at Turner Broadcasting Corp. He left the
company after Time Warner bought it three years ago and is trying
to make it as an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy likes to joke that he's the only Turner who carries a
Republican Party membership card in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Turner asked his son to rejoin him in business
but this time outside the company. He wanted Teddy to handle the
sales and marketing of his bison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Teddy runs U.S. Bison Co., the marketing arm of his
father's bison effort, from Jacksonville. There, Teddy is one step
removed from a strong-willed father and minutes from the ocean and
sailing. An expert sailor like his father, Teddy draws his
inspiration from the sea _ not land.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences in opinion and style, Teddy and Beau
are close and speak fondly of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing when you think about it,'' says Beau. ``My
family's one big circus, but we all find a way to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   One way they get along is by turning to Dad to settle
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is concerned about both issues raised by his sons, money
and business.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest worry is time, or the lack of it, to oversee his
ranching operations. The ranches already employ 200 people, a
number that swells with temporary workers during the peak warm
weather hunting and fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As for buying more properties, Turner quips, ``At some point
we'll either run out of suitable land to buy or money.'' But that
time apparently hasn't arrived. ``If ranches are for sale that make
sense for bison, we will consider them,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Vermejo Park
</P>
<P>
   There's no better place to grasp the scope of Turner's effort
than at his largest ranch, Vermejo Park in northeastern New Mexico.
Shaped roughly like Italy, Vermejo's 588,000 acres sprawl from the
top of snowcapped mountains to rolling grassland. That's an area
equal to three-quarters the size of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Beau first heard about Vermejo, which once was owned by the
Pennzoil Co. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He wasted no time in flying out to see the ranch. Even he, used
to spectacular wilderness vistas, was stunned by the breadth of
Vermejo's beauty. ``I told Dad he just had to buy it,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Turner took his son's advice, buying the property for $80
million nearly three years ago. He bought it without seeing it
himself _ a testimony to both his harried schedule and the trust he
places in his son.
</P>
<P>
   When Turner showed up to inspect Vermejo, Beau wasn't there. ``I
was scared of what Dad would think when he saw it for the first
time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. Turner grasped Vermejo's potential
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   From the footsteps of the main house on the ranch, he could see
elk grazing in a nearby meadow.
</P>
<P>
   Rising above the elk were dark-green foothills stretching out as
far as the eye can see. And above them towered the snowy jagged
peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains 30 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   All that Turner saw belonged to him as part of the Vermejo
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Given its diversity in terrain and wildlife, Vermejo was a great
testing ground for ideas about conservation. If restoration worked
here, it might work on other Turner properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vermejo's diversity encompasses the best and the worst of the
modern West. The best was the wide variety of wildlife and
vegetation represented at Vermejo.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch has an estimated 10,000 elk, 183 different kinds of
birds and 10,000 prairie dogs. There also are coyote, bear and
herds of fleet-footed antelope that flash like white and brown
minnows across the ranch's grassy plains.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife at Vermejo is surprisingly accessible. A herd of
elk graze within eyesight of Turner's main residence, a mansion
called Casa Grande that's made from the land's native yellow
sandstone. Mule deer nibble grass at Casa Grande's footsteps. They
are not pets.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the house, prairie dogs bark in an adjacent meadow.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the bison. About 2,500 roam 65,000
acres, an area roughly eight miles by 15 miles, in the grassy boot
of Vermejo. It's a 35-mile drive from Casa Grande to the bison.
</P>
<P>
   Vermejo ranch manager Vacker is a scholar cowboy who has learned
to read the landscape like an archaeologist deciphering
hieroglyphics. Wearing a worn cowboy hat stained white from salty
sweat, he studies the softly rolling foothills of the ranch. Every
hill has a story to tell, and at Vermejo not every story is a
pretty one.
</P>
<P>
   Vacker points to some rotting stumps of yellow-belly pine that
litter the hills.
</P>
<P>
   At one time these trees, which can reach heights of 80 feet,
dominated the ranch. Then the pines were logged by the tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In the rotting wake of the yellow-belly pines rose up smaller
blackjack pines, which now darken the hills like thick weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Next Vacker points to one of the gullied riverbanks that
crisscross the landscape like weathered crow's-feet in an aging
cowboy's face. The gullies tell how grazing cattle denuded the land
of the natural grasses that held back the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned from people more how not to do things than how to
do them right,'' says Vacker.
</P>
<P>
   Land restoration
</P>
<P>
   Vacker's mandate from the Turners is simple, if daunting. He
must wipe the landscape clean of man's influence. ``It's becoming
rarer and rarer to find areas absent of evidence of man,'' says
Vacker.
</P>
<P>
   This is a job that requires Vacker to be both politician and
forest ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, for example, Vacker has burned 35,000 acres at
Vermejo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to clean out weedlike trees and grasses, making
space for the native species to again take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, are animals Vacker considers unnatural and
destructive, including 7,000 head of cattle that grazed Vermejo
before Turner bought the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that, without the insatiable cattle, denuded
riverbanks will again reseed with natural grasses.
</P>
<P>
   When Vacker sent the cattle packing he began dismantling the
ranch's 500 miles of barbed wire fencing. He's taken down 200 miles
of it so far, giving Vermejo a more open feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put in a resilient ecosystem that can support
itself,'' he says. Wildlife restoration
</P>
<P>
   Plant life is only half the environmental equation for the
Turners. They also want to reintroduce endangered animal species
that once thrived in the West. Again, Vermejo and its bison are a
case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Turner isn't breeding bison like cattle, fencing them in and
herding them from grass lot to grass lot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he lets his bison roam free. There are few fences
blocking their grassy range.
</P>
<P>
   The bison are just the start of wildlife restoration at Vermejo.
</P>
<P>
   In a project funded by Turner's Wildlife Foundation, Vermejo is
trying to breed endangered black-footed ferrets. They live in what
looks like a low-ceiling circus tent of black netting within the
bison's grassy home. If breeding succeeds, the ferrets will be
released onto the ranch for help in reining in the prairie dog
population.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the most controversial move, Turner would like to
reintroduce wolves to Vermejo. To do so, Turner needs state
permission and it won't be easy to get. ``Wolves remain an
emotional issue here,'' says Vacker. ``They still represent
something dark and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   To win local acceptance of wolves, the Turners will have to
manage the people living around Vermejo as much as the land _ and
they know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't own this much land and not effect the people living
around you,'' says Beau. ``We want to be good neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   At Beau's direction, the Turner family's various philanthropic
foundations have given money to some nearby towns. For example,
Raton, a town abutting the eastern corner of the ranch, received
$100,000 for youth activities.
</P>
<P>
   Vacker has also ringed the bison's domain with electric fencing.
``Bison are thought by many to be mangy marauders who will break
out of the range,'' explains Vacker. ``Not a single bison has
escaped but the fencing makes my neighbors happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning a profit
</P>
<P>
   Turner is not relying alone on bison to support his land. He's
also counting on big-game hunting, fly-fishing and something called
ecotourism. In layman's terms, ecotourism is observing wildlife,
not shooting it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the big moneymaker at Vermejo is game hunting.
Visitors, largely wealthy executives and celebrities, pay $10,000
to hunt on Vermejo. Guests have included Atlanta Braves player Ryan
Klesko and ABC anchor Sam Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, Turner would like bison and ecotourism to become the
financial base of his land. Neither is close to meeting that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 50 years away from making ecotourism pay,'' says Vacker.
By then, Vacker figures, so much natural habitat will be gone that
people will pay a lot to see one of the few remaining vestiges of
the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   Turner agrees. ``We're not going to turn my land into another
Disneyland or Animal Kingdom,'' he says. ``But it will be a place
that people can come and see the West as it really was, as it was
meant to be.''

ZAMBRANO NOT POPULAR IN CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago is not Los Angeles Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano's
favorite town. Nor is it his favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano has been harshly criticized since he mocked the Fire's
unattractive approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, of course, got the last laugh by sweeping the Galaxy
in the Western Conference finals, then winning the MLS championship
on Los Angeles' home field at the Rose Bowl with a stunning defeat
of two-time MLS champion D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Zambrano sends his troops to Soldier Field. The Galaxy
(2-2, two points) meets Chicago (3-1, six points) for the first
time this season at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano has since called Chicago the class of the Western
Conference. But it doesn't matter much because the Fire's fans will
never let him forget the words that became Chicago's motivation a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a problem in this league, but when I said
Chicago was a team that only defended, I got an incredible amount
of bad print from the Chicago press for it,'' Zambrano said. ``It
seemed like I was saying something sacrilegious.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano hasn't changed his opinion of the style of play Chicago
used last season, but wishes he hadn't voiced it -- not because he
doesn't believe it, but because he thinks it may have been unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have said, for example, that someone should never
pay to see this team play,'' Zambrano said. ``That's not fair
because what we perceive as beauty in this game is different.
Whether I like or dislike that type of soccer, it shouldn't matter.
I should have kept it to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Zambrano would be hard-pressed to accuse Chicago of
defending this season, especially since the Fire has a
league-leading 10 goals.

RAP SINGER PUFFY ARRESTED ON ASSAULT CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean Combs, a 29-year-old rap performer and producer,
was arrested Friday and charged with taking part in battering an
executive at Universal Records with a Champagne bottle, a chair and
a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Puffy, Combs surrendered to police at noon and was
charged with second-degree assault and criminal mischief. Two
others are still being sought in the attack. The assault charge can
carry a sentence of up to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they could not confirm the motive
for the attack, although it apparently involved a dispute over a
music video that Combs did not like.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Combs was one of three men who entered the Manhattan
office of Steven Stoute, 28, a rap producer, at 1755 Broadway
around 4:30 p.m. Thursday, beat him with several objects from his
office and damaged the room. The attack was recorded by security
video cameras in the office, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoute may have suffered a broken left arm in the attack, and
had extensive cuts, bruises and swelling on his head, arms, legs
and back, said Barbara Thompson, spokeswoman for the Manhattan
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Combs did not enter a plea in an appearance before Judge Troy
Webber of Manhattan Criminal Court. The judge set bail at $15,000,
which Combs paid immediately. He left the courtroom without
commenting to reporters, and his lawyer, Nicholas Kaizer, did not
return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson said Combs had a criminal record, having been found
guilty in 1996 of criminal mischief after threatening someone with
a gun. He paid a $1,000 fine for that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stoute nor Juanita Stephens, spokeswoman for Combs and
the vice president for publicity at Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs'
record company, would comment yesterday on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rap business has a reputation for bloody attacks by
performers feuding with others in the industry. An editor at Blaze
magazine, which focuses on rap, was beaten by four men in his
Manhattan office in November in a dispute over a photograph
published by the magazine.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ In a state Capitol reception room ornamented
with marble fireplaces and crystal chandeliers, Gov. Jesse Ventura,
wearing blue jeans and white socks and looking like someone who
could use a shave, was talking _ roaring, actually _ about running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could win,'' Ventura said, rattling off poll numbers as he
jutted his broad chin, ``if I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first three months of office, Ventura, the former
professional wrestler known for fighting in a pink boa, has managed
to offend, annoy and outrage plenty of Minnesotans _ but win the
cheers of most.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as much feathers as I've ruffled in being politically
incorrect,'' he said in an interview, ``I get 10-to-1 letters from
people saying that's why they like me.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent public opinion survey showed Ventura with a 57 percent
approval among voters, a high rating, if down from the lofty 72
percent he received just after his stunning triumph last November.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that prides itself on having a painfully earnest
style of trying to say and do the right thing, Ventura has jumped
at every chance to be incendiary _ and then to pour on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In the 27 appointments he has made as governor, he has not named
a single black man or black woman. He joked on national television
_ and later offered a tepid apology _ that St. Paul's confusing
street plan had been designed by ``drunken Irishmen.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that college athletes should not be required to
attend classes. He called, without success, for a salary for his
wife as first lady, and for bodyguards at his suburban horse farm.
And he has crossed swords with Garrison Keillor, the Minnesota
folklorist who is host of ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' the
National Public Radio program.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is loud, profane and often seems ready to explode,
thrusting a forefinger menacingly in the direction of anyone who
poses an unpleasant question.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his bluster, the governor has shown little
inclination to push for big policy changes. Borrowing from
approaches from both the Democratic and Republican Party, he has
been described as ``a centrist with an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Carlson, a radio talk-show host and former Minneapolis
mayoral candidate, has had Ventura on her program, where time after
time she has corrected what she called his ``atrocious grammar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we are the envy of the nation or the laughingstock,''
said Mrs. Carlson, the former wife of former Gov. Arne Carlson. ``I
haven't decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Minnesotans, Ventura's antics continue to amuse.
But it is uncertain whether voters will ultimately want more in a
governor than an often delightfully outrageous showman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I like Jesse?'' said Gary Fursetzer, a 45-year-old
Minneapolis limousine driver. ``Sure I like him. Do I think he'll
be a good governor? Well, that's another question.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention and, often, affection he has received, the
mountainous hulk of a governor has yet to show much political
muscle. Steve Schier, a political science professor at Carleton
College, said Ventura, as a third-party candidate, had no real base
of power in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can huff and he can puff, but he can't blow their house
down,'' Schier said. ``Jesse is a man without a political base.
This guy has no votes in the state Senate or House that will,
forgive the pun, go to the mat for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has not pressed hard for any agenda. Indeed, some
politicians have scoffed that Ventura, a boat owner, has made
regulations on watercraft one of his chief concerns. Moreover, some
legislators have complained that Ventura does not always make
himself accessible or engage in the nitty-gritty of government.
</P>
<P>
   The departing Democratic Party chairman, Dick Senese, predicted
that Ventura's outrageous style ``will wear thin,'' especially if
the state's robust economy falters. Senese said the governor's
perceived contempt for negotiation and compromise would ultimately
hinder his ability to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fond of saying he's not going to play the games
politicians' play,'' Senese said. ``But it's not only the game of
politics, it's the game of life. You and your friends can't decide
what restaurant to go to without discussion and compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Schier, ``His style is fire-engine red, but his
policies are beige.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That moderation, Schier said, makes the governor appealing to
many Minnesotans who are weary of the very liberal character of the
state's Democratic Farmer Labor Party and the sharply conservative
bearings of its Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   On the biggest issue, how to handle the state's budget surplus,
Ventura favors a rebate to taxpayers. But he would cap the rebate
at $5,000 per household. Ventura has also proposed big increases in
spending for education and public housing. And he favors the
creation of a light rail transit system between Minneapolis and the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Those positions have won the support of Mayor Sharon Sayles
Belton of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a shared agenda,'' she said of Ventura. Ms. Sayles
Belton, who is black and considered a political liberal,
acknowledged that she had winced when the governor's appointments
did not include any blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the lack of diversity in his Cabinet bring a
glower to the governor's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in quotas,'' he said with an angry growl. ``I
pick the most qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura noted that some of his top advisers have included
blacks. And he said he had received few applications from blacks
for Cabinet positions. Minnesota is more than 90 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also created a stir by requesting, and obtaining, a
permit to carry a pistol. But he said he does not carry a pistol
while making his rounds at the Capitol, as some leaders had feared
he would do.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after an apparent cheating scandal was exposed among
University of Minnesota basketball players, Ventura raised eyebrows
by suggesting on a television show that athletes should not be
bothered by schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is, to eliminate this cheating, or the possibility of
it, why not let kids go to college and just be athletes while
they're there?'' he said. ``No classes. Let them simply play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when they're done, if they don't make it in the NFL, if
they don't make it in the NBA, if they don't make it in pro
baseball, whatever it might be, then give them their scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   He also offended some Minnesotans with his answer to a young
single mother who had described her plight to the governor at a
forum. In essence, the governor told her, she had gotten herself
into trouble and should not expect the government to solve all her
problems.
</P>
<P>
   While some people were outraged by his seeming lack of empathy,
many others cheered the governor for being straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks from the heart like an average, ordinary
Minnesotan,'' said Emmett Carson, the president of the Minneapolis
Foundation, a private group that supports charities. ``That is what
is so refreshing, and sometimes so scary, about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who rarely misses a chance to promote his upcoming
book, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' (Villard), has gotten into a
war of words with a much more understated Minnesota figure,
Keillor. Keillor's book, ``Me, by Jimmy `Big Boy' Valente as Told
to Garrison Keillor,'' a stinging satire of a professional wrestler
with an unmistakable resemblance to the governor, enraged Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has criticized Keillor as ``a highbrow,'' described his
radio show as ``boring'' and said, ``I never watched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he much preferred the brand of humor found in the
movie ``Fargo,'' which lampooned Minnesota stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graphic violence and things you can laugh at,'' he said,
referring to the movie. ``That's much better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for president, Ventura said some polling organizations had
found that nationally, he had the support of 23 to 32 percent of
those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House, he would tell the truth, Ventura said, as he
sprinkled his speech with barnyard epithets and roared in delight.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not planning a presidential bid just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never say never,'' he said, folding his powerfully
muscled arms across his chest. ``Ten years ago, if somebody would
have said I'd be governor, I would have laughed.''

   NATO Strikes In the last weeks, Serb military and police, under
direct orders from Slobodan Milosevic, emptied the villages and
cities of Kosovo-Metohija, and burned or bulldozed thousands of
homes. Heads of families have been pulled from the arms of their
wives and children and shot. Thousands of innocent and unarmed
people are feared dead. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are
fleeing Milosevic's pogrom. Do not allow misguided patriotism to
bind you to his atrocities. NATO will intensify its strikes until
the repression of civilians in Kosovo-Metohija are withdrawn, the
refugees are allowed safe return and your leaders resume meaningful
negotiation. NATO remains resolved to defend the defenseless in
Kosovo-Metohija.

SUIT SAYS IMMIGRATION SERVICE REJECTS WAIVERS FOR DISABLED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service
was accused in a lawsuit Friday of arbitrarily rejecting the
applications of disabled immigrants who seek exemptions from the
English language and civics parts of the citizenship exam.
</P>
<P>
   The class action suit asked the U.S. District Court in Manhattan
to require the agency to follow its own published guidelines for
evaluating disability waivers and to reconsider all the
applications it rejected over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials, the lawsuit added, are ignoring the
guidelines and second-guessing the immigrants' own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1994 law, immigration officers are required to
accommodate legal immigrants who are disabled and whose doctors
attest that their disabilities prevent them from demonstrating an
understanding of English and civics.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants have complained for years about the way
the immigration service handles medical waivers. A similar class
action lawsuit accusing the agency of arbitrarily rejecting waiver
requests was filed last year in Florida against the agency's Miami
district.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in New York City have reported cases in which
immigration officers had scolded disabled applicants for asking for
waivers, rejected applications without seeming to read them and
misleading immigrants on how to apply for waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington recently acknowledged that
they have had difficulty administering the waivers and have
repeatedly revised policy guidelines for field workers who handle
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The latest INS guidelines for its field workers require them to
contact an immigrant's doctor if they have questions about the
application. The guidelines also caution them against
second-guessing the doctor and oblige them to give a reason in
writing for denying an application.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to follow their regulations,'' said Constance
Carden, a lawyer for the New York Legal Assistance Group in
Manhattan, which filed the lawsuit with the Hudson Valley Poverty
Law Center in White Plains, N.Y. ``If they would follow their own
policies, we'd find our clients are being fairly treated.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cited the cases of two people. One is a Ukrainian
woman, Musya Krukier, 73, who became paralyzed after a stroke. She
submitted medical records and statements by several of her doctors
that she cannot learn and retain information. Her applications were
repeatedly denied. The lawsuit maintained the rejections were made
by officers who made medical conclusions they were unqualified to
make.
</P>
<P>
   The second case involves Teresa Riascos, 69, from Ecuador, who
lives in Ossining, N.Y. The lawsuit says that her waiver request
was not accepted, but that she was never given an explanation.

MAJOLI DRAWS RUBIN FOR FIRST MATCH IN FED CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iva Majoli of Croatia decided she liked the luck of the Fed Cup
draw Friday in Raleigh, N.C. In the first of five matches Croatia
is playing against the United States this weekend, Majoli, the
32nd-ranked player, is scheduled to face No. 23 Chanda Rubin, the
last-minute replacement for the injured Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   In the second singles match, third-ranked Monica Seles, who has
an 8-0 Fed Cup record, will meet 70th-ranked Silvja Talaja.
</P>
<P>
   A French Open champion in 1997 but struggling since then, Majoli
pronounced herself eager to test herself and her 2-2 record against
Rubin, a fellow baseline grinder whom she has not faced in more
than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost forget how she plays,'' said Majoli, who has a 14-6
Fed Cup singles record. ``It's a really big thing for Croatia to be
in the first division, and we're going to fight as hard as we can.
I think in the Fed Cup everyone can beat everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While praising the city and its Raleigh Racquet Club, Majoli
expressed regret that Zagreb, Croatia, the original host city, had
been ruled out because of the conflict in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was very excited to have American players in our
country, and we wanted to really welcome them, but circumstances
didn't allow us to,'' Majoli said. ``I'm feeling really sad for the
people, because I think they're all suffering because of the one
leader, Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King, captain of the U.S. team, said she did not
expect the injury to the second-ranked Davenport, who has a
sprained tendon in her left wrist and cannot hit a two-handed
backhand without pain, to compromise the new home team's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chanda is playing the best tennis of her life,'' King
said. Rubin has made a snail-like recovery from 1996 wrist surgery
but has already won a title, and defeated No. 1 Martina Hingis this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The singles pairings are reversed Sunday, followed by a doubles
match. Although Davenport has volunteered to play the doubles match
if the series is tied at 2-2, for now King has designated Seles and
Lisa Raymond to take on Majoli and Talaja.

   DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS RISE TO FIFTH CONSECUTIVE HIGH
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose to a fifth consecutive
record as Eastman Kodak soared on unexpectedly strong earnings. But
computer stocks extended their weeklong slide, leaving major
indexes mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow gained 31.17 points, to 10,493.89. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index slipped 3.86 points, to 1,319, and the Nasdaq
composite index slumped 37.73 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,484.04.
</P>
<P>
   PICTURE PERFECT RESULTS FOR KODAK
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter profits at Eastman Kodak, excluding one-time
charges, rose 9.3 percent, to $259 million, or 80 cents a diluted
share. Sales rose 6.5 percent, to $3.1 billion. The news sent
shares of Kodak soaring $6.4375, or 9.67 percent, to $73.
</P>
<P>
   OUTPUT INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN MARCH
</P>
<P>
   Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose
one-tenth of 1 percent in March despite a decline in production at
automobile plants. In a separate report, the Commerce Department
said housing construction fell 1.3 percent in March, dropping to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.77 million units.
</P>
<P>
   IRS DISMISSAL HALTED BY SENATOR
</P>
<P>
   As millions of Americans were filing their income tax returns
Thursday, the Houston office of the IRS was taking steps to dismiss
an agent who blew the whistle about IRS abuses. The action was
halted when the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee protested
to the tax commissioner, Charles Rossotti.
</P>
<P>
   CATERPILLAR NET SURPASSES REVISIONS
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, which had sounded an earnings warning last month,
posted a decline in quarterly profit that was smaller than
analysts' latest forecasts. Earnings fell 52 percent, to $205
million, or 57 cents a share. The per-share figure was higher than
the 42 cents that analysts had been expecting since Caterpillar had
warned on March 12 that earnings in the quarter would fall as much
as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEANS RULE OUT BANANA APPEAL
</P>
<P>
   The European Union does not plan to appeal a World Trade
Organization ruling that its banana imports policy illegally hurts
United States-based growers, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's
trade commissioner, said. He added that there was not enough time
to prevent Washington from seeking authority to impose retaliatory
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ESTIMATED LOSS AT NISSAN GROWS
</P>
<P>
   Yoshikazu Hanawa, the president of Nissan Motor, reported a
revised estimate of fiscal year losses at the automaker that were
more than three times as bad as the company had anticipated. Nissan
also eliminated the shareholder dividend for the first time since
it became a publicly traded company a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   EX-FORD CHIEF EARNED $73 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   Alex Trotman, the former chairman and chief executive of Ford
Motor, received more than $73 million in his last year at the
automaker, an SEC filing disclosed.

ANGELS TRY TO MAKE EDISON FIELD DUGOUTS SAFER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They're back.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels returned home from their first road trip to
find padded railings in front of both dugouts at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   In the team's season opener, first baseman Mo Vaughn sprained
his left ankle when he fell into the visitor's dugout chasing a
foul ball, mostly because he didn't have a feel for how close the
steps were. Vaughn hasn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Terry Collins said Vaughn's mishap was not the
reason for the return of the railings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo had nothing to do with it, Collins said. ``Line drives into
our dugouts had everything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   After Anaheim Stadium was renovated back to a baseball-only
facility for the beginning of last season, the railings were in
place early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   But complaints from the dugout about not being able to see the
field action along with an inability to effectively relay signs
from the bench to base coaches were cited as the reasons why they
were removed.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said during this season's first homestand, pitcher Omar
Olivares was hit by a line drive in the dugout and that there had
been several other close calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are too valuable to get hurt, Collins said. ``We've
decided the safety of the players is what we have to concern
ourselves with.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said even if the railings had been in place last week,
it likely wouldn't have mattered in Vaughn's situation since they
don't extend completely to each end of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look to where it ends, Collins said of the railings,
``there wouldn't have been anything there anyway.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) With questions still lingering about when Jim Edmonds
might return, the team's fourth outfielder, Orlando Palmeiro,
certainly has done all he can to keep production at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro hit .333 on the recent seven-game road trip, including
four RBIs and his first major league home run after 415 at-bate.
Palmeiro had three hits in Thursday's game at Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good a fourth outfielder as any team needs, Collins
said. ``He's done a great job.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Palmeiro would have been in the lineup even more,
but that he wanted to get backups Jeff Huson and Tim Unroe some
much-needed at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Because the team is missing three regular starters,
Collins said he was pleased with the 5-5 record heading into
Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   On the road trip, the Angels batted .342 with 23 doubles --
including 10 in one game against Texas -- seven home runs and 47
RBIs, averaging 7.6 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff also was sharp during the trip, especially
the bullpen, which did not allow an earned run in 20 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played three good teams so far, Collins said of the
Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers and Oakland A's. ``A lot of our
guys have played really well, so I'm happy.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) The double-A Little League Field at Orchard Dale School in
Whittier will be rededicated as Darrin Erstad Field in a ceremony
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad donated $50,000 for renovations for two baseball fields
and Angels Care contributed another $30,000 for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters included the East Whittier City School District
and the Whittier Boys and Girls Club.
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) Pitching matchups for the remainder of the series: Tonight
-- Ken Hill (0-1, 7.56 ERA) vs. Freddy Garcia (2-0, 3.65 ERA);
Sunday -- Steve Sparks (0-2, 7.20 ERA) vs. Brett Hinchcliffe (0-0,
5.68 ERA).

you out of the sky and of surviving 30 or so hours in a space the
size of a Honda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But life at the controls of the world's most expensive aircraft
is an almost antiseptic experience, a test of skills far removed
from the death and destruction on the ground below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those surreal events,'' in the words of one pilot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the United States joined NATO in Operation Allied Force,
the B-2 stealth bomber was a bit of a hangar queen _ an enormously
sophisticated $2 billion airplane that the Air Force brass had been
unwilling to risk near live fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that changed last month when a pair of B-2s became the first
Allied jets to head into the hostile skies over Yugoslavia and dump
loads of ``smart bombs'' on the most heavily guarded targets in
Serb territory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since then, said Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge of the 509th Bomb
Wing, B-2s have headed into combat overseas ``most nights...and
performed beyond our expectations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for the first time since the bombing campaign began,
two stealth bomber pilots from Whiteman Air Force Base talked about
flying the bat-winged behemoth in combat and waging war across the
ocean without setting foot on foreign soil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they said, the trips to Eastern Europe resembled
scores of training missions they'd flown before. Planning sessions
were followed by equipment checks followed by in-air refuelings
before dropping bombs and repeating the equipment checks and
refueling on the way home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it /{was/} different. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see missiles in the air,'' said a major, ``you know
it's combat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They can see, as well, the fiery damage below of war, and they
can hear the excited conversations of their comrades in other
airplanes dodging their way through combat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear the chatter,'' said a captain, ``and the octaves
change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The two pilots spoke only on the condition that they not be
named. When pilots of other aircraft spoke on television shortly
after the war began, their families were flooded by hate mail over
the Internet from around the world. And after an F-117 stealth
fighter was shot down over Serbia, the longstanding tradition of
having pilots' names written on the sides of their aircraft came to
an end.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flying the B-2 is like piloting no other aircraft in the world.
It was built for secrecy, not for speed. So it has none of the
yank-and-bank qualities that test the pilots of fighter jets or
even B-1 bombers. Trainers tell new B-2 pilots that rarely will
they have a handful of plane, but they will often have a brainful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a systems manager,'' the captain said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And an enormous system it is. Parked on a football field, it
would stretch from sideline to sideline. It is packed with the
latest in computer-designed technology designed to befuddle enemy
radar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has the ability to take two persons and 16 bombs anywhere
around the globe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of their flights, a computer does the steering and a
system of computers linked by satellites guides the bombs to their
targets. Only during landings, takeoffs and the four in-air
refuelings on the Yugoslavia trips do pilots grab the controls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else is programmed ahead of time,'' the captain
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For these Yugoslavia combat flights, pilots have been told of
their missions about a week in advance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like us,'' said the major, ``we train our whole careers
to do this. They can't help but be excited.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The days leading up to the long-distance war pass however the
pilots want. They can study the flight plan, practice guiding a B-2
in a simulator and change their sleep schedules to adjust for the
marathon trip. The major ran errands _ picking up a child from
school, heading to football practice _ the day before his first
combat. The captain hit the links. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Research performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Texas
for long-range bombing missions has given pilots clues about how
best to get ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem the pilots have is fatigue,'' said Bill
Storm, one of the researchers who has designed methods for dealing
with the long flights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force times different tasks on a mission _ topping the
plane's fuel tank, or dumping its payload _ with considerations of
when pilots become most groggy. They also have detailed advice
about what to eat and when. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B-2 pilots take turns sleeping on the mission, snoozing in the
cramped space between the two seats and the plane's small toilet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each pilot packs his own meals. The slim major said he drinks
water by the gallon and charges himself with a cup of coffee 15
minutes before refueling. The equally trim captain _ the two have
not flown together _ chows with more abandon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a junk food junkie,'' he said. He's fought this war while
guzzling liters of Mountain Dew and Coke, wolfing down tortilla
chips and shoveling in Hot Tamales candy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I work up a good sugar high and keep it going until I crash
for a while and then get up and do it again,'' the captain said.
The result? The captain slept seven hours on his mission, and the
major less than three hours on his. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the scenery, ``you'd figure during a war they'd have the
lights off,'' the captain said. ``But (Serbia) was lit up as big as
Dallas.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each plane carries 16 satellite-guided, 2,000-pound bombs, which
are released in quick clusters _ an open bomb bay can show up on
enemy radar below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, pumped with adrenalin, they head for Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel good when you get out of there safe,'' the major
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' wives get telephone calls from Whiteman officials
once their husbands have cleared enemy air space and wait another
half day or more to see them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was scared,'' the major said. ``She told me that
after she got the call she slept well.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Research shows pilots get drowsiest on the drive home. Some pass
the time reading magazines. Others try to nap. Often they chat
about high school days, about their plans for the next day, about
sports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about anything you would talk about sitting down with
a guy at a bar,'' the captain said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the wheels of their jets finally touched down on same
runway they lifted off from about 30 hours earlier, the pilots
headed for a few hours of briefing and then to their own beds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his mission, the captain slept 21/2 hours before spending
an evening at home with his wife and child. The major slept five
hours, had dinner delivered from Pizza Hut, helped his kids with
their homework and played a few hands of Uno. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His next orders? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife told me I had to mow the lawn.'' &QL;

ONCE AGAIN, DRIVE TURNS DOWNTOWN KC INTO COWTOWN KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Radio personality Mike Murphy majestically raised his arm
Friday, signaling the start of his fourth annual cattle drive
through downtown Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Head 'em up, move 'em out. Let's go!'' Murphy yelled at
precisely 12:20 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the cattle apparently didn't know that _ at least for today
_ this was a cow town again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the chill in the air. Or maybe the animals were
spooked by the crowd in the River Market area. Or it could have
been a case of cattle contrariness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for several minutes the livestock sort of mingled among
themselves, lacking any drive whatsoever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the crowd yelled: ``Isn't that cute. They won't
budge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then one animal became amorous, much to the amusement of some in
the crowd and the horror of others. Finally, one cow decided it was
show time and took off. About 50 others ambled behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Claire McCaskill tried to keep up on horseback. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said McCaskill, one of the ``cowpokes''
participating in the urban cattle drive. ``It (horseback) beats the
back of a car any time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the cattle paraded through downtown, roughly 1,000 people
paused to stare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Faulkner, the operator of Benjamin Ranch, said cool weather
actually makes the cattle lively. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone in the crowd asked Faulkner whether it was OK to run in
front of the animals, as participants do during the running of the
bulls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advise it,'' Faulkner said. ``This ain't Spain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the cattle rounded a grassy median at Ninth and Main streets,
several stopped to smell the roses _ and eat them. But a cowboy
with a lasso coaxed them back on the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jan McCain watched the spectacle from a window inside Commerce
Bank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is amazing,'' McCain said. ``This is the first
time I've seen cows in a city. They don't do this in Memphis, where
I'm from.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Goodwin of London, who was in Kansas City visiting a
friend, took time to cheer on the cattle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen lots of things,'' Goodwin said. ``But I've never
seen anything like this before in my life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the drive, the cattle were herded into a pen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former restaurateur Carl DiCapo said the cattle drive had a few
critics four years ago when it started. But now, DiCapo said, the
idea is spreading to other cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City's a leader,'' DiCapo said. ``You just see. One of
these days, this will be compared to the American Royal Parade.'' &QL;

IN PARTISAN BUDGET BICKERING, LITTLE THINGS COUNT BIG 
GAY RIGHTS BILL ADVANCES 
STATEN ISLAND SECESSION DRIVE WANES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ First it was a luge run. Then the Harlem Boys
Choir. What next?
</P>
<P>
   In this year's state budget stalemate, the Capitol's hoary
tradition of holding up the opposition's pet projects has descended
to new levels of minutiae. Such skirmishes have little to do with
the budget, but they neatly illuminate the animosity between Gov.
George Pataki, a Republican, and the assembly speaker, Sheldon
Silver, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Another late budget means a series of emergency appropriations
bills to keep the state running, and Pataki likes to slip unrelated
items into them, a back-door way to get what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it works. Two years ago, he won changes in a
vehicle-emissions law by attaching the amendments to an emergency
spending bill. But this year, nothing so substantive is at stake,
and Democrats say the governor is using the insertions to embarrass
them.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the governor's first two-week emergency bill was $10
million for a luge run and two ski lifts to be used during next
year's Goodwill Games at Lake Placid. He proposed taking the money
from an environmental fund, which he knew the Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Silver declared that this year, no emergency spending bill would
pass with any extraneous elements. Pataki accused the speaker of
putting the games at risk. Democrats said the governor could
readily find the money elsewhere (which he did this week). For a
few days, there was the threat of a government shutdown, if the
Assembly refused to pass an emergency appropriation because the
bill included money for the luge run .
</P>
<P>
   Then the governor blinked, removing the luge and lifts from the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pataki's own pet projects could not crack the speaker's
hard line, what about an item dear to Democrats? This week, in a
new emergency bill, the governor included $60,000 for a trip to
Israel by the Harlem Boys Choir.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the governor of trying to divide black
legislators from white ones. ``To make the Boys Choir of Harlem
political pawns in this game is awful, and he should be spanked,''
Assemblyman Keith Wright, a Harlem Democrat and chairman of the
Black and Hispanic Caucus said of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki professed surprise at the reaction. ``If it's a problem,
I'll take it out,'' he said, and he did.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, throughout this byplay, no progress toward a budget
was made.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Rights Bill Advances
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's annual passage of a gay rights bill can seem like
an exercise in futility, but this year there are signs that the
sands beneath the issue are shifting after a long stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's lower house recently voted 105 to 43 for the
measure, compared with last year's 87-53 vote. Seven Republicans
switched their positions. In particular, Republicans from Nassau
County voted unanimously against the bill last year, but voted 5 to
2 for it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a sense that this was the right thing to do,''
said Assemblyman Thomas Alfano of Franklin Square, one of those who
switched.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the bill _ which would ban discrimination in
employment, housing and other fields _ has languished in the
Republican-controlled Senate. Last year, for the first time,
supporters were confident it could pass, but Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno would not allow a vote. No one has been so bold as to predict
that Bruno will relent this year, but the bill's supporters took
heart from recent events.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans have a long tradition of tolerant social
views, in keeping with a state where a fiercer brand of
conservatism does not play well. Pataki, who says he would sign the
gay rights measure, is from that mold.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans also keep a wary eye on New York's Conservative
Party, which opposes abortion, gambling and gay rights. Republicans
in suburban swing districts often move to the right on social
issues to avoid a Conservative challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Republican legislators say the Conservative Party applied no
pressure on the gay rights vote, nor did Nassau County's powerful
Republican chairman, Joseph Mondello. Gay rights advocates say that
bodes well for winning more votes in the Senate, adding to the
pressure on Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island Secession Drive Wanes
</P>
<P>
   The fires of Staten Island secession have been banked, thanks to
years of attention and pork from a governor and a mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, who owed their elections in part to ``the forgotten
borough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cityhood for Staten Island is the longest of long shots, opposed
by Silver, Giuliani and New York City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone. Recent polls have shown that a majority of Staten
Islanders no longer support secession, a sharp turnabout from a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But state legislators from the borough refuse to give up on the
idea _ in fact, they dare not. ``At any time, something could
happen to get people worked up about it again,'' said an aide to
one of those lawmakers. ``You don't want to be the guy who let it
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Robert Straniere, a Republican, reintroduced a
secession bill this year, though it has no chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   And the island's legislators appear to have saved the most
visible expression of the secessionist movement, the Staten Island
Charter Commission.

AIR AND LIGHT: HELPING A CITY KEEP ITS SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Kent walked toward Seventh Avenue along West
43rd Street, pausing in midstride to enjoy _ nothing. He beheld the
intersection's southwest corner, where a building had been razed
months earlier to create _ for now _ an open space. Kent could see
the tip of the Empire State Building looming elegantly beyond.
Standing on 43rd Street, he could actually get an unusual panoramic
view of the buildings and billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, he could feel the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes everything, doesn't it?'' he said. ``It doesn't get
any better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Right on both counts. The space on the corner is as temporary as
it is serendipitous. Bulldozers and dump trucks are already
rumbling into it, as the foundation is laid for a new office
building for Reuters. The tower will join another building across
the street for Conde Nast magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This will attract thousands of office workers to the area, who
will have to cram themselves into the throngs of tourists who have
descended upon the sanitized Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The construction and crowds bode well for the economy, but those
developments worry Kent. He is the president of the Project for
Public Spaces, a New York group that designs urban oases in parks,
waterfronts and squares.
</P>
<P>
   Often, creating people-friendly areas means making them
pedestrian-friendly. He thinks that notion has been lost in the
remade Times Square. As a result, even the unexpected open space on
43nd Street seems out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing this is like, God, we need light and air,'' he said.
``We have it here, but we don't even plan to use it. Everything is
so damn crowded, you feed suddenly awkward, and you can't enjoy the
openness you feel when a building is taken out. If the street is
not changed to compensate for the excessive density, it's going to
lose its allure. The street has been transformed, but it has not
changed to handle all the pedestrians.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking his cue from planners in Zurich and Copenhagen, Kent
suggested reducing the traffic flowing through Times Square. Right
now, cars are almost always stacked up at a choke point near 46th
Street, as the eight lanes of Broadway and Seventh Avenue feed into
five lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic usually eases after the cars pass through the choke
point. Kent suggested moving the point further north, which he said
would open up more space around the pedestrian islands that include
the always packed TKTS booth.
</P>
<P>
   Choke point is a fitting term for the crushing experience that
would make any sane person want to strangle the urban designers who
dreamed up the current layout.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his fellow New Yorkers intent on dodging the
tourists, watch sellers and turbaned preachers on the sidewalk,
Kent walked in the street, close to the gutter. On one pedestrian
island, several dozen teen-agers posed for a class picture. He
walked past them, cutting diagonally across the street, where he
caught the attention of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let him go that way,'' one officer yelled to his partner
as he tried to wave Kent back to the crosswalk. ``The sidewalk's
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in some parallel universe. The one Kent tried to walk on
was filled with teeny-boppers shouting up to their idols in the MTV
studios. Not an inch was open. The street, in contrast, had few
cars and lots of open space.
</P>
<P>
   There is just too much excess capacity in the roadway here,''
Kent said. ``If we moved up the choke point, we could double the
size of the islands and widen the sidewalk. It doesn't take a
genius. If you look at this now, you know there's something wrong
with this picture. Traffic engineers don't think about it. They
think about moving cars through a given space. But is the role of
the city to absorb more automobiles, or to create wonderful public
spaces?''
</P>
<P>
   Weed out the traffic, widen the walkways and the square will be
there. He is trying just that in Astor Place, where he has been
enlisted by administrators at Cooper Union to revamp the public
spaces around the college. Some streets may be closed, others might
be redrawn to accommodate shoppers, markets and restaurants. He is
even talking about expanding the small park just south of the
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a park in a square, that's exciting,'' Kent said.
``You have quiet open space and active green space.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a space has a special place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to here,'' Kent said, pointing to his heart. ``You're
talking about soul. Does a place have a soul?''

DEAF MAN, DENIED INTERPRETER AT LAMAZE CLASS ,  EXPERIENCED BIAS AT
HOSPITAL, JUDGE RULES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mount Sinai Medical Center illegally discriminated
against the deaf husband of a pregnant woman by refusing to provide
a sign language interpreter while the couple were attending Lamaze
classes, a federal judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the hospital's refusal, Jeffrey Bravin, a teacher
at the Lexington School for the Deaf in Manhattan, was unable to
learn the Lamaze method of assisting a woman giving birth, Judge
Robert Sweet of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said in his
opinion Wednesday. Bravin's wife, Naomi, needed a birthing partner
to take part in the classes and to learn the techniques being
taught, the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital did not provide interpreters during the birth or
the week after, when the Bravins' newborn son, Ethan Raymond, was
being treated for low blood sugar in Mount Sinai's neonatal
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of Lamaze is team effort,'' said Alan Rich, the
lawyer for the Bravins, who now live in South Hempstead, N.Y., but
were living in New York City in 1997, when Mrs. Bravin was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The birth, Rich said, was like a ``Marx Brothers movie,'' with
Mrs. Bravin ``trying to interpret between contractions,'' to
explain what Bravin was supposed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1997, when the Bravins first requested an interpreter
for the Lamaze classes, the hospital turned them down, according to
court papers. Bravin obtained a letter from the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services stating that the Bravins had a legal
right to an interpreter, but the hospital disagreed, saying that
Mrs. Bravin, who can hear, was the patient, not her husband, court
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Alfredo, one of Mount Sinai's lawyers, said she had not
yet seen the decision and would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that the hospital violated state and federal laws
requiring accommodations for the disabled, but rejected the
class-action claim of the Bravins and the Civic Association of the
Deaf of New York City, a watchdog group on the legal rights of the
deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Though the lawsuit focuses on the Lamaze classes, the Bravins
were more upset when the hospital refused to provide an interpreter
during the birth and the week that their baby was in the neo-natal
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is hearing, but she has been so upset at what has been
happening to our baby that she can not interpret,'' Bravin wrote in
an affidavit on Sept. 19, attempting to obtain a court order to
force the hospital to provide an interpreter. ``She has been
crying. I want to speak directly with those in charge of my baby's
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, naturally, like any other parent, concerned about the
well being of my baby, but especially here, my baby is in an
intensive care unit,'' Bravin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, after ruling in favor of the Bravins, scheduled the
decision on the amount of damages for May.

ON DRAFT DAY, PARCELLS' JETS WILL SIT AND WAIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ark., Colo., Calif., Tenn.)   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under the dominating influence of Bill Parcells, who had to
reshape the team in his image, the New York Jets drafted 23 players
over the first two years of his regime. Only the Miami Dolphins,
led by the equally exigent Jimmy Johnson, drafted more.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets appear to be closer to the team Parcells wants. So
they go into the weekend's draft not having generated the wholesale
deals and moves that led to all those previous draft choices. The
Jets have only eight draft picks, none in the first round, and no
more than one choice from the second through fifth rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets could fail to come out of this draft with a starter,
but they may find one if a quality guard _ a position at which they
have virtually no starting experience _ is there for the taking at
No. 57.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with the self-described pro-active Parcells at the helm (he
made a half-dozen moves in his first two Jets' drafts), draft
analysts believe the Jets will try to move up, even though they do
not appear to have much to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells insists that linebacker James Farrior, his
disappointing first pick of 1997, is not on the trading block. The
coach did say, however, that he will listen to reasonable offers
for the running back/kick returner Leon Johnson, an impact
performer in 1997 who was injured and less effective last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much ammunition to move up,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets recently cut Todd Burger, the starting left guard.
Right guard Matt O'Dwyer is still trying to land a job as a free
agent. The Jets need two guards if they do not re-sign O'Dwyer, or
if he goes elsewhere. O'Dwyer's agent, Tom Condon, did not return
phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The draft is deep in offensive linemen. Doug Brzezinski of
Boston College, an acclaimed guard, is unlikely to be around when
the Jets go shopping so far down in the second round. But according
to Russell S. Lande, the former scouting administrator for the Rams
and editor of the draft-rating publication GM jr: ``There are
guards who could be there when the Jets pick. One guy I like is
Craig Heimburger of Missouri. He's the kind of player Parcells goes
for. He attacks every play. Some teams may pass him over because of
size. I also think Brandon Burlsworth of Arkansas and Anthony
Cesario of Colorado State are viable picks.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be sometime after 5 p.m. Saturday, more than five hours
after the draft begins, when the Jets will have their chance.
Perhaps by then Parcells may even have a cornerback he covets. He
also wants a wide receiver out of this draft, and will consider a
quarterback. The agent whose career has been built on quarterbacks,
Leigh Steinberg, describes this draft as the ``best for
quarterbacks since 1983 _ Jim Kelly, John Elway, Dan Marino and
others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be a good quarterback at 57, when the Jets
draft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets seem almost certain to take a quarterback this weekend.
Vinny Testaverde, 35, is one of the club's strongest players and a
workout workhorse. He also is younger and healthier than Marino and
Elway. But the Jets have to think of a quarterback for the future,
and their experiment with Ray Lucas has been inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will also be taking a cornerback. Ray Mickens, their
No. 3 corner, recently signed a one-year deal. He is unhappy that
he is not more highly regarded, and his future as a Jet remains
problematic. Cornerbacks who could be available in later rounds
include Daylon McCutcheon of Southern California and Fred Vinson of
Vanderbilt. Vinson is recovering from a foot injury and has not
been seen at the scouting workouts.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the third year, the Jets will be host to a free draft-day
party at the Official All Star Cafe in Times Square. More than
3,000 fans attended last year's party. Today's guests will include
two of the newest Jets, safety Steve Atwater and linebacker Roman
Phifer, as well as the former Jets Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and
Bruce Harper.

LAWYERS GROUP MAKES TV ADS TO TOUT PRO BONO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Did you hear the one about the group that bought
$25,000 in television advertising to convince the public that
honorable, saintly lawyers walk among us?
</P>
<P>
   It's no joke.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Monday and running through mid-May, a 30-second spot
that promotes free legal work done by members of the King County
Bar Association will appear. The advertisement will run 300 times,
mostly on cable TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the county bar group has tried this
approach, said Linda Strout, association president. And it may be
the first time that any bar group has taken to the airways to
polish the profession's image, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bar group hopes the ads will spur more lawyers to take on
pro bono work. The lawyers' code of professional responsibility
urges them to offer free advice and work to the poor. About 1,200
of the bar association's 5,200 members did that last year,
providing $2 million in free services. That represents a small
percentage of the total billings lawyers had in King County last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the group also wants to begin to change the public's
attitude about lawyers, Strout said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has come away with an image of lawyers as being
very sleazy, self-aggrandizing and interested only in money,''
Strout said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who hasn't heard a lawyer joke? (Why didn't the shark
eat the lawyer who fell in the ocean? Professional courtesy.)
</P>
<P>
   Television programs and movies portray lawyers as rapacious,
sex-crazed or addle-brained. One recent film even featured Satan
himself as a member of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to us that more and more lawyers are portrayed in
negative ways,'' Strout said. ``And we know that isn't really true
and that lawyers are really good people. That side of the story
isn't told.''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on pro bono legal work was easy. Such volunteer
programs are ``the heart and soul of the King County Bar
Association,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a social club. We have been doing pro bono work for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 people received pro bono work from bar association
members last year. The clients have to have incomes that are no
more than 125 percent of federal poverty levels. The free work is
for civil legal problems. Poor people who face criminal charges get
lawyers provided at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   The ad is very different from the lawyer come-ons television
viewers are used to. There's no promise to exact revenge on the
driver who gave you whiplash or the boss who sent you up that
wobbly stepladder.
</P>
<P>
   This one uses the words of Seattle-area lawyers Rick Spoonemore
and Lisa Schuchman as ``voices of justice'' who talk about their
pro bono work. It was filmed in a courtroom in King County Superior
Court with a real judge portraying himself and Strout acting the
part of an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Strout said she doesn't expect the ad will change people's
attitudes over night. ``We hope they might say, `The King County
Bar Association's pro bono program _ what's that all about?'''

 &HT;    48 homes fell to blazes
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane,Brian D. Crecente and Jenny Staletovich/Palm
Beach Post Staff Writers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Nobody wanted to look when the sun came
up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A night of wildfires had visited their neighborhood and marched,
in no particular order, across seven square miles, wiped out 48
homes and damaged another dozen. Returning home was like rolling
dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a bad dream and I haven't woke up yet,'' Juan
Echazabal, 43, said as he shoveled through ash that used to be his
house.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the winding streets of this community, neighbors
returned to find a checkerboard of destruction in the worst fires
to burn St. Lucie County in memory. About 300 became homeless
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses stood intact. Some had lawns burned to within inches
of the front door. Yet others were simply flattened. A swingset in
one yard was untouched; the house was gone. In another lot, only
concrete lawn furniture, a hot-water heater and the charred frames
of metal kitchen appliances remained.
</P>
<P>
   Once woody lots, thick with pine and Brazilian pepper, became a
winter landscape, blackened like a film negative. Instead of snow,
ash blanketed the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you grab when your whole life is in that house?'' Don
Kranker asked. Weeping, he hugged his neighbor and explained that
when firefighters ordered him to leave, he stayed behind armed with
a garden hose to save his house. It survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no defense. I just didn't think I was going to make
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pete Bordon, the county's radio coordinator, after a tour
of the worst-hit streets: ``I see burned homes, burned property,
peoples' lives devastated by fire. People's memories, their days
here totally destroyed. It's unbelievable what I see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers, forest rangers and homeowners began the
monumental task of cleaning up and starting over as Gov. Jeb Bush
toured the area Friday evening. Bush said he will meet with
forestry officials today to determine how much money to request
from President Clinton. Property appraisers and Federal Emergency
Management Agency officials also began tallying the loss, but
probably won't have a total for several days, said County
Administrator Doug Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the fires remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign came about 3 p.m. Thursday when smoke was
reported near Gatlin Boulevard. Another fire burned the day before
off Gatlin Boulevard, prompting speculation that it was never
entirely extinguished and reignited. But Ron Parrish, spokesman for
the St. Lucie County Fire District, said Thursday's fire occurred
at least a half mile away, too far to be the same blaze. The
district, along with an arson strike force recently created by the
state, will investigate what they suspect was not caused by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have lightning here, so we have to look into the
many ways man can cause fire,'' said Division of Forestry spokesman
Gene Madden. ``Fire is one of the most difficult things to go to a
spot and say, `Ah-hah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how it started, fire officials know what kept it
going. And keeping up was like racing the wind.
</P>
<P>
   With gusts of 30 mph, no amount of equipment, either tractors
plowing fire lines or helicopters raining water, could control the
fire, said Senior Forester Dale Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine the equipment you'd need to knock that
out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who watched raging fires ignite parts of Volusia and
Flagler counties in the worst conflagration of last year's wildfire
season, Thursday's were eerily familiar. Eventually, 500,000 acres
burned last year and 370 structures were damaged or destroyed. Fire
officials had hoped the fires would provide a lesson, and help
fatten their budgets. But so far, that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   No fire hydrants
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture asked Bush for a $125.2 million
budget hike, but the governor slashed its request to $223.4
million. The legislature is considering a bill that would provide
$13.2 million for helicopters, pilots, strike teams and other
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we need to put more in there, we'll do that,'' said Rep.
Ken Pruitt (R-Port St. Lucie), a House budget chairman whose family
was evacuated Thursday. Pruitt, and U.S. Rep. Mark Foley (R-West
Palm Beach) traveled with Bush on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so much concerned about the direct amount as getting
the resources there now,'' Pruitt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats spotted some irony, especially after Republican
leaders approved a whopping $1 billion tax break Thursday, the
biggest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are providing millions of dollars in big breaks to big
business while our citizens watch their homes burns,'' said Rep.
Les Miller (D-Tampa), whose side of the state ignited in March when
thousands of acres near Naples burned.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the state continued to dump manpower and
equipment onto the Port St. Lucie fire. To help out the more than
60 county firefighters working the fire _ altogether 150 from the
county were on duty overnight _ the state sent five brigades with
15 fire trucks to the area. A National Guard Blackhawk helicopter,
carrying a ``Bambi bucket'' holding 750 gallons of water, continued
to patrol Friday morning. Two P-3 Orions airplanes from Brooksville
and Tallahassee were also on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In retracing their steps and trying to explain what happened,
county and fire officials said several elements factored into the
equation, the same elements that create every significant fire:
drought, wind and thick vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Only one third of the 80-square-mile city is developed, meaning
many lots remain empty, but heavily wooded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to take care of all these lots, would be impossible,''
said Mayor Jim Fielding. ``If it was reversed, if 70 percent were
built out and 30 percent empty, we might have a better shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that an absence of water and sewer lines that could
provide hydrants. The city had planned to install the lines, but
was delayed two years by lawsuits, Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope those people who stood up several years ago and fought
the city tooth and nail _ we don't need water, we don't need sewer
_ are reading the newspapers now,'' said Deputy City Manager Victor
Granello.
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner John Bruhn, chairman of the county fire
district, who raised the issue several weeks ago, has asked the
county attorney to draft an ordinance requiring hydrants in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they built a whole neighborhood without fire
hydrants,'' said Glen Abraham, who fought back flames with a garden
hose. ``It was very frustrating. The entire neighborhood was on
fire and we never saw any firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ill wind blew no good
</P>
<P>
   That's because every firefighter was fighting a fire that blazed
across 2,400 acres, Parrish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very stretched as far as apparatus goes. I was getting
calls at the dispatch center from people standing in front of their
homes, watching them burn. It was very difficult. I was sitting in
the communications center and I kept thinking, `This is not us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the lack of hydrants may have angered owners of
burning houses, Parrish said water really wasn't the issue. Wind
was.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, county officials declared a state of
emergency as drought conditions worsened. About two hours before
the fire, state officials warned them to be on alert. Anderson
said. Almost immediately after arriving at Thursday's fire,
firefighters called for help from Martin and Indian River counties.
Palm Beach and Broward counties soon joined. When foresters _
already on edge by weeks of fierce fire conditions _ arrived, they
called in air support, diverting helicopters working other fires in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past month, we've had several large fires around the
state. Some, as large as 10,000 acres. But they were in remote
areas,'' Madden said. ``This is the most significant in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   With wind gusts from the south and southwest spreading fires
rapidly, workers dug in. Communications quickly became a problem
because each agency involved _ county firefighters, foresters,
deputies, city police and Florida Highway Patrol troopers _ worked
off a different radio frequency. Still, even if everything had gone
as planned, controlling the blaze would have been futile, Madden
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fire department, no fire personnel, is going to be able to
get in front of (a wind-driven fire) and stop it. Mother Nature
started that and Mother Nature stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires weren't fully controlled until early Friday, said
Forestry Division ranger Craig Iversen. Only one small fire in the
area flared Friday. Several other smaller brush fires in the county
also ignited.
</P>
<P>
   That was no comfort to homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just finished building the house ourselves,'' Polly Trimble
said as she stood outside a Kmart she visited Friday morning to buy
new clothes and other items her family lost when fire razed her
house on Gabor Court. ``My husband slaved over it for a year and I
did the tile work. Now it's all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, people struggled to comprehend the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Mount Saint Helens went through here,'' said
Chrystal Perkins as she drove down one particularly bad street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually my anniversary and it will be six years because
we moved here when we got married,'' said Kathy Federico, whose
house was destroyed. ``We slept on the floor. We had nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon Friday, 42 families had applied for disaster aid at
the Red Cross shelter in the city's community center. Businesses
and residents from four counties dropped off boxes of diapers,
toothbrushes and blankets. Others left money. So much food was
available that many carried cartons of bread, fruit and bottled
drinks home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a stack of checks and cash _ enough that it makes me
uneasy,'' said the Red Cross' Hillery Brown. ``The community
outpouring has been overwhelming.''

GIGANTE'S LAWYERS SAY JURORS IMPROPERLY DISCUSSED HIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for imprisoned Mafia boss Vincent Gigante say
they will seek to overturn his conspiracy-to-murder and
racketeering convictions because they have evidence that the jurors
at his 1997 trial improperly discussed the case among themselves
throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had instructed the jurors, who heard the case in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, not to discuss the testimony and
arguments until deliberations had begun, a standard instruction
that is intended to keep jurors from forming and exchanging
conclusions before all the evidence is in.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Gigante said that to gather the evidence of juror
misconduct, his client's relatives hired a private investigator
who, several months after the trial had ended, secretly recorded
conversations with a private security guard who had been hired by
the government to drive jurors between their homes and the
courthouse. The lawyers said the driver, Alfred Santoro, was
recorded on tape saying that the jurors discussed details of the
case long before deliberations began.
</P>
<P>
   Gigante's relatives hired the investigator, Raymond Glynn, after
the lawyers learned that Santoro had described the jurors'
discussions to other people, one of the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Glynn made available Friday what he said were
transcripts of some of the recorded conversations, in which Santoro
spoke with Glynn or with an associate of his.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the conversations, said to have taken place two and a
half months after Gigante was convicted in July 1997, Santoro says
the four jurors he had been driving each day told him that all 12
jurors, as well as the six alternate jurors, had discussed the
evidence during recesses throughout the trial, according to the
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what they were telling me afterwards,'' Santoro says,
according to the transcript. ``Most of the 18 jurors were listening
to one of the alternates.''
</P>
<P>
   That alternate, Santoro says, ``was the one that spoke up and
spoke to the other 17 jurors, and everybody was agreeing with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript, Santoro says he was told that this alternate
juror believed that the evidence was not sufficient to convict
Gigante, and that the other jurors and alternates were going along
with him. ``They were saying: `Yeah, you're right, John, you're
right. I agree with you on that, I agree with you on that point,''
Santoro says.
</P>
<P>
   Santoro says that when the alternates were dismissed just before
deliberations began, the alternate juror known as John was no
longer there to exercise his influence, according to the
transcripts, and Gigante was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   And in what was said to be a transcript of another conversation
_ on Oct. 23, 1997, three months after the conviction _ Santoro is
quoted as describing a conversation among the four jurors during
the third or fourth week of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said the conversation touched on a central question of the
trial: Had Gigante been mentally ill for a long time and incapable
of having been the boss of the powerful Genovese crime family, as
his defense maintained, or had he long been faking insanity,
employing a zombielike act during the trial, as the prosecution
contended?
</P>
<P>
   In the transcript of the recorded conversation, Santoro says:
``They looked at his face, the jurors in my car. One woman said,
`Jesus, his face, his expression, no expression.'''
</P>
<P>
   Santoro then describes the response of a male juror in the car,
quoting him as saying, `` `Sometimes I saw him and his eyes looked
like they, they were alert.''' He said the juror added, `` `He
looked like he was aware of what was going around him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kartagener, a lawyer for Gigante, who is 70 and is
serving a 12-year sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota, said
he would argue at a hearing on Thursday that Judge Jack Weinstein
should question all the jurors about what Santoro says was their
improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Dorsky, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined
to comment, and Santoro could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kuby, the lawyer for Glynn, the private investigator,
expressed concern that prosecutors would accuse his client of
wrongdoing as they try to ``defend Gigante's conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein could order a new trial, could decide that Santoro or
the taped conversations are not credible, or could decide that even
if the jurors discussed the case as Santoro says, that did not
taint their verdict.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombing of Serbia has spread a deep _ and perhaps
long-lasting _ chill over NATO's relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The West's hoped-for, bear-hugging strategic partnership with a
newly democratic Russia gave way pretty quickly to one of a
pricklier sort: a readiness to agree where they could, but to
disagree openly and at times bad-temperedly where they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   By now that air of intermittent iciness seems to have turned
into a veritable blizzard of dispute: from the war in Bosnia to the
handling of Iraq, from NATO's inclusion of Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary as new members, to be sealed ceremonially at
the alliance's summit in Washington on April 23, to the conflict
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This time the chill seems both deeper and more dangerous.
President Yeltsin has not only barked his hostility to NATO's air
and missile strikes, he is sending Russian intelligence-gathering
ships to the Adriatic, he may have hinted that his nuclear missiles
could be retargeted at NATO cities.
</P>
<P>
   He has also said that the use of NATO troops in Kosovo to end
Serb attacks on the mostly Muslim population could even turn a
potential cold war hot by drawing Russia into the fighting on
Serbia's side, possibly provoking a wider conflict in Europe or
even a ``third world war.''
</P>
<P>
   An alarming prospect. But, barring great stupidity on both
sides, not a likely one.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians are deeply unhappy at seeing fellow Slavs
being bombed by a military alliance that within shortish memory was
the old Soviet Union's implacable foe.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders, already scrapping amongst themselves even
before Kosovo about how deliberately anti-western Russia's foreign
policy should be, felt slighted by NATO's decision to use force
over their firm objection.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing NATO soldiers on the ground in Kosovo _ a province of
Serbia _ would be an even greater affront to Russian dignity.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason, though not the only one, why NATO is hoping,
perhaps vainly, that air power alone can persuade Serbia's Slobodan
Milosevic to end his reign of terror in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rhetoric, so far Russia has said it will not
intervene, or supply weapons to the Serbs. Yet this is the most
destructive row between Russia and the West since Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   It also coincides with two other events that in Russian eyes
only underline how this former superpower has fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   One is next week's NATO summit, which might have effected a bit
of a public reconciliation with Russia, but which is now being
taken in Moscow as salt to new diplomatic wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a deal-in-the-making on new IMF loans for Russia:
as much as they need the cash, many Russians hate to be seen going
cap in hand to foreigners again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed those foreigners should be cautious over any new loans
until Russia has carried out reforms that would make the money work
better for recovery _ a point that it is to be hoped will not be
overlooked in the face of more Russian bad temper at this delicate
moment.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that by the time peace in some form returns to
Kosovo, Russia will have managed to profit from the crisis in more
ways than economic.
</P>
<P>
   Seen cynically, Russia's snarls of hostility over Kosovo are in
part prompted, not so much by concern for their Serb cousins
(Russia has said not a word about the plight of the hapless
Kosovars), but by a desperate need in these second-class-power days
to hog the diplomatic spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by playing its hand in a more principled fashion, Russia's
diplomacy could do a lot more: including wiping away the image of
Russia now forming in the West _ that of a country that
increasingly finds its friends among the world's despots (Milosevic
and Iraq's Saddam Hussein being two of them) not its democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's diplomatic leverage has been increased by the fact that
NATO's leaders have underestimated Milosevic's determination to
keep Kosovo in his grip and thus overestimated their ability to
herd him into a peace deal with threats alone: the air strikes may
have to go on for painfully long yet.
</P>
<P>
   They also overlooked the Milosevic capacity for serial barbarity
_ though why, after the horrors of Bosnia, is unclear. He has
driven hundreds of thousands of civilians from their homes,
executed large numbers of Kosovo's menfolk and used the plight of
the refugee flood he has created as a weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point a peace deal will have to be crafted with
Serbia, perhaps even with Milosevic in power.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could play a big part, offering Milosevic face-saving
ways _ for example, a largish contingent of Russian troops in a
future peacekeeping force _ of claiming that it was Russia's
backing, not NATO's bombing, that had brought about peace (though
without the air strikes he would have ``cleansed'' Kosovo and hoped
to get away with it).
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's credibility would also be on the line. Although it
has parted company bitterly with the West over air strikes, Russia
had fully supported the peace deal that Milosevic tore up last
month.
</P>
<P>
   That included a far-reaching degree of autonomy for the Kosovars
and an international peacekeeping force to ensure Milosevic kept
his word.
</P>
<P>
   Those same principles have been supported by the U.N.
secretary-general. Russia should in no way try to help Milosevic
off these hooks now.
</P>
<P>
   Step back from the frostiness of recent weeks and the divide
over Kosovo looks different. Ranged against Milosevic for his
yearlong brutalities are not only all of the West's strongest
democracies (including France, long a friend of Serbia), but also
much of world public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   By now Russia, North Korea and China are about the only
self-confessed friends Milosevic has.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Russia has wanted to be counted among the democracies,
with all the trappings of membership in the premier western clubs.
Is it really in Russia's interests to gamble away its standing in
the democratic world in support of a regime that has committed the
most heinous human-rights abuses in modern Europe?
</P>
<P>
   But if that is to be the dividing line of a new cold war, so be
it. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Orlando Hernandez came to this country 13 months ago,
knowing little English beyond the names of baseball teams. He
conducted his first full postgame interview in his second language
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No control fastball,'' Hernandez said, shrugging his
shoulders. ``No control. Next time, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was far more remarkable and accurate with his
splintered sentences than he had been on the mound in the New York
Yankees' 8-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. It was the second
consecutive defeat for the Yankees, who once again performed
terribly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening was not a total loss: Hideki Irabu, aided by an
adjustment in the way he uses his back foot in his delivery, threw
three perfect innings, striking out four, and Derek Jeter slugged
his fourth home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took an early and prohibitive lead by taking
advantage of Hernandez's wildness. Last Sunday, the Yankee pitcher
threw a perfect game for six and one-third innings against Detroit,
blowing on his hands before each pitch in the 44-degree conditions
at Yankee Stadium. The temperature in Tiger Stadium this evening
again was 44 degrees, but it seemed much colder; rain had fallen
here most of the day, and wind whirled within the high walls of
this aging park.
</P>
<P>
   With his breath leaving his mouth in clouds, Hernandez blew on
his hands before and after each pitch, even as the catcher Joe
Girardi flipped the ball back to him. Hernandez, who was raised in
Cuba's tropical climate, prefers warmer weather, and there were
suggestions that Friday night the cold may have gotten to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it was no problem,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence to the contrary. Hernandez, who walked four
batters in his first two starts, walked two and hit another in the
first inning, giving up four runs, including an unearned run after
Jeter dropped a pop fly. Gregg Jefferies smashed a two-run homer in
the second, and in the fourth, Hernandez surrendered a triple, walk
and double, wrapped around a throwing error by Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, Girardi said, ``Never really looked comfortable, from
the start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first eight games, Yankee starters compiled a 1.51 earned
run average. But over the last two games, Roger Clemens and
Hernandez have been charged with 14 earned runs in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tigers running away after five innings, the Yankees'
interim manager Don Zimmer attempted to salvage some good from the
evening by inserting Irabu. The Yankees now are at least exploring
the idea of trading Irabu, and after he allowed five runs in
one-third of an inning against Baltimore on Wednesday, club
officials kept him in the major leagues, where he can re-establish
his value in relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu affected a minor change in his delivery in the last two
days: Rather than keep his back foot flat as he pushes off the
rubber, he perched high on the front part of his foot, as if he was
catapulting himself toward home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The game essentially was over by the time Irabu took the mound
in the sixth, and Irabu has always done well against the
free-swinging Tigers. Nonetheless, Irabu did throw the ball much
better, striking out Bobby Higginson and Damion Easley and two
others in his three innings. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The march of technology is a social as well as an economic
phenomenon. Some whole industries, such as personal computers, seem
to rely on the insatiable desire of people for the latest gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you really need it: just throw away your old
computer, television, hi-fi or whatever and buy a newer, better
(and often cheaper) one.
</P>
<P>
   An unwelcome side-effect is an instinctive tendency to disparage
older technologies in favor of newer ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ditching the old completely can often prove a mistake _
because technologies that are dismissed as yesterday's habits
sometimes turn out to be not such old hat after all. What was once
regarded as obsolete can, with a minor tweak or embellishment, be
revived as fast as any old fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest instance of an old technology to be rehabilitated in
just such a way is clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   Once a standard method of powering clocks, watches and
children's toys, it fell from grace with the rise of
battery-powered gadgets. Yet, as the power needed by modern
circuitry decreases, clockwork is becoming a feasible power source
once more.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-up radios and flashlights are on sale. The American
military is evaluating hand-cranked satellite-navigation devices
and landmine detectors that would save soldiers from having to lug
bulky battery packs around.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other mechanical devices have been revived too. A
hundred years ago, all calculators were mechanical, but they were
displaced by electronic ones containing valves, then transistors,
and finally microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Now microscopic mechanical components are staging a comeback at
the heart of a new class of silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Such microelectro-mechanical systems can sometimes do things
that electronics cannot: tiny silicon arms and levers can, for
example, act as compact filters, timekeepers, optical switches and
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Transport offers other examples. Filthy, soot-belching steam
locomotives were rejected in favor of diesel and electric ones
decades ago. Now new, modernized steam engines are sometimes more
efficient and more environmentally friendly than diesels.
</P>
<P>
   Airships and balloons are also poised to return to the
ascendant. New airships, built with space-age materials and filled
with inert helium rather than explosive hydrogen, are taking to the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have even been floated to use them as fixed communications
relay-stations over big cities. Researchers are looking into the
use of balloons to carry scientific instruments over the surface of
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the triumph of paper. The computer has entirely
failed to dethrone paper; instead, computers make it easier to
generate documents, and the introduction of the PC, far from
fostering the paperless office, has led to a huge increase in
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible to spot a similar pattern in wars: as events
in Kosovo are showing, even the stealthiest fighter/bomber cannot
substitute for the man on the ground with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of history is, in short, that even apparently
moribund technologies such as clockwork have a persistent habit of,
well, springing back to life.
</P>
<P>
   That is worth remembering next time you hear the death knell
being sounded for a supposedly outmoded way of doing things. Last
year's habit can often turn out to be next year's habit too. &QL;

<P>
   The march of technology is a social as well as an economic
phenomenon. Some whole industries, such as personal computers, seem
to rely on the insatiable desire of people for the latest gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you really need it: just throw away your old
computer, television, hi-fi or whatever and buy a newer, better
(and often cheaper) one.
</P>
<P>
   An unwelcome side-effect is an instinctive tendency to disparage
older technologies in favor of newer ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ditching the old completely can often prove a mistake _
because technologies that are dismissed as yesterday's habits
sometimes turn out to be not such old hat after all. What was once
regarded as obsolete can, with a minor tweak or embellishment, be
revived as fast as any old fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest instance of an old technology to be rehabilitated in
just such a way is clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   Once a standard method of powering clocks, watches and
children's toys, it fell from grace with the rise of
battery-powered gadgets. Yet, as the power needed by modern
circuitry decreases, clockwork is becoming a feasible power source
once more.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-up radios and flashlights are on sale. The American
military is evaluating hand-cranked satellite-navigation devices
and landmine detectors that would save soldiers from having to lug
bulky battery packs around.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other mechanical devices have been revived too. A
hundred years ago, all calculators were mechanical, but they were
displaced by electronic ones containing valves, then transistors,
and finally microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Now microscopic mechanical components are staging a comeback at
the heart of a new class of silicon chips.
</P>
<P>
   Such microelectro-mechanical systems can sometimes do things
that electronics cannot: tiny silicon arms and levers can, for
example, act as compact filters, timekeepers, optical switches and
sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Transport offers other examples. Filthy, soot-belching steam
locomotives were rejected in favor of diesel and electric ones
decades ago. Now new, modernized steam engines are sometimes more
efficient and more environmentally friendly than diesels.
</P>
<P>
   Airships and balloons are also poised to return to the
ascendant. New airships, built with space-age materials and filled
with inert helium rather than explosive hydrogen, are taking to the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have even been floated to use them as fixed communications
relay-stations over big cities. Researchers are looking into the
use of balloons to carry scientific instruments over the surface of
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the triumph of paper. The computer has entirely
failed to dethrone paper; instead, computers make it easier to
generate documents, and the introduction of the PC, far from
fostering the paperless office, has led to a huge increase in
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   It is even possible to spot a similar pattern in wars: as events
in Kosovo are showing, even the stealthiest fighter/bomber cannot
substitute for the man on the ground with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of history is, in short, that even apparently
moribund technologies such as clockwork have a persistent habit of,
well, springing back to life.
</P>
<P>
   That is worth remembering next time you hear the death knell
being sounded for a supposedly outmoded way of doing things. Last
year's habit can often turn out to be next year's habit too. &QL;

   SAN JOSE _ For some in Silicon Valley it is not enough to have
invented ``the new economy.'' They claim to have invented a new
society, too, one that has abolished class and race prejudice, and
judges people purely on the basis of merit.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly true for Asians. Almost a third of the
region's scientists and engineers are Asian-born.
</P>
<P>
   Indians and Chinese created 27 percent of the 4,000-plus
high-tech businesses founded in 1991-96. But, for the region's
fastest-growing ethnic group, the picture is very different.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos make up 23 percent of the region's population; but when
the San Francisco Chronicle investigated 33 high-tech firms last
year it found that only 7 percent of the work force were Latinos,
and hardly any of these held managerial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So what? The overworked cyber-elite desperately needs people to
tend its children and clean its houses. And a large number of the
Latinos are poorly educated immigrants. So long as the ladder of
opportunity stretches from Taco Bell to Intel, there should be no
need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the ladder is getting more rickety. Only 56
percent of Latino students graduate from high school, a smaller
proportion than a few years ago; only 19 percent complete the basic
courses you need to get into college; and only 11 percent are
enrolled in an advanced maths class.
</P>
<P>
   One Latina in eight has a baby before her 18th birthday. The
Latino barrios of East Palo Alto and East San Jose are as rough and
tough as the rest of the region is soft and cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   The poor are not only falling further behind the rich. They are
losing out in absolute terms as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991-97, households in the bottom 20 percent of the income
distribution saw their real income fall by 8 percent, according to
a local think-tank, Joint Venture Silicon Valley Network. During
the same period households in the top 20 percent saw their income
increase by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The canneries and defense companies that used to provide
immigrants with well-paid jobs have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech giants such as Hewlett-Packard once prided themselves
on their ability to promote talented shop-floor workers. Now they
have contracted out their manufacturing to specialists, many of
them abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the Valley is being set by smaller companies that
value speed and flexibility above all else: a marvelous development
for educated job-hoppers, but a dismal one for people who start at
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many Latinos made it into the middle class by dint
of buying houses and starting businesses rather than accumulating
education, a pattern that still prevails in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The father of Ruben Barrales, the president of Joint Venture,
immigrated from Mexico in the late 1950s, began work as a laborer,
but then started a roofing business and bought his own house, along
with several other bits of property.
</P>
<P>
   Such upward mobility is a lot harder now. A survey of the area's
fastest-growing companies found that 84 percent of their jobs
required education beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Most Latinos lack the capital they need to expand small
businesses. And now that the average house price is $500,000 even
the middle classes _ let alone the poor _ cannot easily get into
the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Pastor, an academic at the University of California,
Santa Cruz, points to two other things that limit social mobility.
One is that, in this highly fluid economy, it is now more natural
to draft in a friend from the other side of the world than to
wonder whether your gardener carries the high-tech equivalent of a
general's baton in his knapsack.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the fact that people who rely on public transport
find it all but impossible to turn up for the night-time and
weekend shifts that many high-tech manufacturers demand.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to close this growing digital divide? There are
lots of straws in the wind. Joint Venture is trying to bring the
Valley's social networks together so that the cyber-elite rub
shoulders with minorities.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Center for Employment Training has a good record in
placing minorities in high-tech firms. Some local firms such as
Intel and Cisco Systems are bringing both computers and computer
education to schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Wilcox High School, which is about 30 percent Latino,
students recycle old computers, revamping them with the latest
chips and then handing them down to local elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos in general are getting more computer-savvy: one recent
survey suggests that, in the country as a whole, the proportion of
Hispanic homes with computers doubled in 1994-98, from 14 percent
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be enough to prevent the new demographics from
colliding with the new economy remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are becoming a powerful political force in Silicon
Valley. Last November, San Jose became the first major Californian
city to elect a Latino mayor, Ron Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
   The trade unions are recruiting lots of Latinos, scoring big
hits with their ``justice for janitors'' and ``living wage''
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The cyber-elite may yet have cause to regret that they did not
take their talk of a color-blind meritocracy a little more
seriously. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As the big contenders for the White House start to
line up for next year's election, a herd of others are fighting for
their footnotes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, there is a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Palicki of Alabama, an Independent, is running his entire
campaign in cyberspace, and Joe Bellis of Kansas sports a website
only a bit less involved than the blueprints for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who complain that all politicians are the same have not
looked hard enough. David Wyatt, a bill-collector from Florida,
bases his platform on a classic Pink Floyd album, ``The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hines, a former U.S. Marine, is running from his West
Hollywood base as the first openly homosexual candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Hamm of Colorado, who won 70 votes in the 1996 New
Hampshire primary, is running again, undaunted, on the issue of
legalizing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot-access laws vary from state to state. Some states, such
as New York, present barriers that even Ross Perot found daunting;
others require no more than a small filing fee, leaving plenty of
room for the tongue-in-cheek candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Hirschon, a bartender in the District of Columbia, is
sponsoring a contest for a running mate. Contenders must submit a
photograph: Hirschon is looking for a human but is willing to make
an exception for a cute family pet.
</P>
<P>
   Two professional wrestlers, Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan, perhaps
out of jealousy of their former colleague, now Minnesota's Governor
Jesse Ventura, are gearing up their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, an ultra-right-wing black who ran in 1996, is a
possibility again in 2000, and may once more provide some comic
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Some parties have been around for so long that they are part of
the establishment, from the old warhorse Prohibition Party to the
right-wing U.S. Taxpayers and the far-left Socialist Workers. New
midgets, some of which exist chiefly in the minds of their
founders, put the old ones to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christians have formed the Puritan Party, which
proposes to turn the United States into a theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pansexual Peace Party advocates everything the Puritans
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Values Party was founded, according to Tom Wells of
Florida, at 2 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1994, when God spoke directly
to Wells and told him to run for Congress first and then for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most challenging of the dozen or so newcomers is the
National Equestrian Party, ``the party with horse sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the race for the Democratic and Republican nominations
will dominate the news, there are other vigorous contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party has a lively contest between a former
presidential candidate, Harry Browne, and another veteran, Jacob
``Bumper'' Hornberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is wide open; its 1996 candidate, Ralph Nader,
may face both a 1960s icon, Angela Davis, and Dr. Hunter ``Patch''
Adams, the subject of a current film starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans complain that the presidential campaign is too
long. But the realities of time and money require contenders to
start work early if they are to have any hope of making a mark in
the primaries of 2000; California, the nation's biggest prize, has
moved its primary forward from June to March.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit too soon to start the campaigns of 2020 or
2024. Yet that has not deterred a number of children who have
already declared their candidacies for the years in which they meet
the constitutional requirement to be 35 years old. &QL;

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ As the big contenders for the White House start to
line up for next year's election, a herd of others are fighting for
their footnotes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, there is a bumper crop.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Palicki of Alabama, an Independent, is running his entire
campaign in cyberspace, and Joe Bellis of Kansas sports a website
only a bit less involved than the blueprints for the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who complain that all politicians are the same have not
looked hard enough. David Wyatt, a bill-collector from Florida,
bases his platform on a classic Pink Floyd album, ``The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hines, a former U.S. Marine, is running from his West
Hollywood base as the first openly homosexual candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Hamm of Colorado, who won 70 votes in the 1996 New
Hampshire primary, is running again, undaunted, on the issue of
legalizing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot-access laws vary from state to state. Some states, such
as New York, present barriers that even Ross Perot found daunting;
others require no more than a small filing fee, leaving plenty of
room for the tongue-in-cheek candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Hirschon, a bartender in the District of Columbia, is
sponsoring a contest for a running mate. Contenders must submit a
photograph: Hirschon is looking for a human but is willing to make
an exception for a cute family pet.
</P>
<P>
   Two professional wrestlers, Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan, perhaps
out of jealousy of their former colleague, now Minnesota's Governor
Jesse Ventura, are gearing up their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, an ultra-right-wing black who ran in 1996, is a
possibility again in 2000, and may once more provide some comic
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Some parties have been around for so long that they are part of
the establishment, from the old warhorse Prohibition Party to the
right-wing U.S. Taxpayers and the far-left Socialist Workers. New
midgets, some of which exist chiefly in the minds of their
founders, put the old ones to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christians have formed the Puritan Party, which
proposes to turn the United States into a theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Pansexual Peace Party advocates everything the Puritans
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The Family Values Party was founded, according to Tom Wells of
Florida, at 2 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1994, when God spoke directly
to Wells and told him to run for Congress first and then for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most challenging of the dozen or so newcomers is the
National Equestrian Party, ``the party with horse sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the race for the Democratic and Republican nominations
will dominate the news, there are other vigorous contests.
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party has a lively contest between a former
presidential candidate, Harry Browne, and another veteran, Jacob
``Bumper'' Hornberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is wide open; its 1996 candidate, Ralph Nader,
may face both a 1960s icon, Angela Davis, and Dr. Hunter ``Patch''
Adams, the subject of a current film starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans complain that the presidential campaign is too
long. But the realities of time and money require contenders to
start work early if they are to have any hope of making a mark in
the primaries of 2000; California, the nation's biggest prize, has
moved its primary forward from June to March.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a bit too soon to start the campaigns of 2020 or
2024. Yet that has not deterred a number of children who have
already declared their candidacies for the years in which they meet
the constitutional requirement to be 35 years old. &QL;

DEVILS SHOOT DOWN FLYERS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils' regular season
finale Saturday night in Nashville will have double significance. A
victory would capture first place in the Eastern Conference and
break Montreal's record for road victories in a season.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario was set up after Friday night's 3-2 overtime
triumph over the Philadelphia Flyers at Continental Arena put the
Devils (46-24-11) one point over the Ottawa Senators (44-23-14),
the team that eliminated the Devils in the first round of last
year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Terreri proved again why he has dominated the Flyers like
no other Devils' goaltender. Even though he made his first start in
seven games, Terreri displayed glimpses of brilliance, turning
aside 27 shots, including two in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``T-bone played great,'' coach Robbie Ftorek said. ``He made
some big saves for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Terreri can be a pivotal man for the Devils in the playoffs. His
strength is coming off the bench after a long spell and still be
sharp. He played with inspiration Friday night and instilled
confidence in his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good out there,'' said Terreri, whose reord against the
Flyers as a member of the Devils is 18-5-2. ``I feel good playing
against them. this was an intense game from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Terreri's cannot be blamed for Philadelphia's goals. He was
screened by Ken Daneyko on the goal by Keith Jones with 2 minutes
37 seconds left in the second, and he was left at the mercy of
Mikael Renberg's goal 6:38 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rolston scored the first goal for the Devils and Bobby
Holik scored twe last two goals, including the winner with 1:33
left in the overtime, when he took a pass from randy McKay,
streaked down the right wing and beat John Vanbiesbrouck between
the 5-hole for his 26th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more chances than they did and it always feels good in
the overtime,'' Holik said. ``We believe we're at a level we can do
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Scott Stevens put in perspective the Devils' aspirations
of finishing first in the Eastern Conference and breaking
Montreal's record for most victories on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have control of our own destiny,'' Stevens said. ``It's in
our hands, and it is an opportunity for us to finish first in the
conference and also break the road record.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ottawa's 2-2 tie with the Rangers on Thursday night, the
Devils have an excellent chance of finishing first in the Eastern
Conference and gain the home advantage throughout the conference
playoffs with a victory at Nasville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not thinking in terms of winning the conference,''
Stevens said. ``All we've been thinking is try to finish as high as
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens appeared more concerned about breaking the record for
most victories on the road rather then finishing first in the
conference. The Devils finished first in the conference the last
two seasons, but they never came close to breaking the record for
most victories on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Montreal Canadiens set the record of 27
victories on the road in their dynasty years in the late 1970s has
been extra motivation for the Devils to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that we've tied them,'' Stevens said about the 27th
victory the Devils accomplished with the triumph in Buffalo two
nights ago. ``Now, we want to win it outright.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens echoed the sentiments of the rest of the Devils about
their desire to break Montreal's record that was set in 1976-77 and
repeated a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to get to this point again,'' Stevens said.
``That's why we want to do it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The governor of New Mexico looks normal. He sounds normal. But
he is definitely not normal.
</P>
<P>
   He likes hang-gliding, parachuting, 100-mile races. He runs,
bikes or swims for two hours each day _ and he begins this routine
at five every morning.
</P>
<P>
   He once shut himself inside a freezer, to prove he could
withstand the cold; he clamped an alligator clip on to his tongue,
to show he could withstand pain.
</P>
<P>
   Now he aims to prove that he can stand heat, too, better than
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   While other governors tiptoe around the issue of education
reform, fearing that they will be burned, Gary Johnson declares
that every pupil in New Mexico must have a school voucher.
</P>
<P>
   Take a breath, and savor the mad scale of this ambition.
Although Milton Friedman came up with the idea of school vouchers
nearly half a century ago, it has barely been put into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee led the way in 1990 with a voucher program that
covered 1,100 poor students; the scheme has been expanded since,
but still covers only 15,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland followed in 1995 with a program covering 2,000 pupils,
but the courts (pending an appeal) have found Cleveland's design to
be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in America is there a state-wide voucher scheme.
Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania and Arizona have recently debated the
idea; but all are plotting pilot projects, limited to the poorest
or academically weakest pupils.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Johnson is being far bolder. He wants to cover
100,000 children in the first year of his program, and all of them
soon after. And his style is as remarkable as his objective.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, pollsters have persuaded politicians not to
mention the ``V word'': voters seem to think that vouchers, which
give poor children the option to leave the public schools, will
drain the public system of resources. (In fact, so long as they are
properly designed, vouchers drain resources only as fast as they
drain resource-consuming pupils.)
</P>
<P>
   So Florida's vouchers are called ``opportunity scholarships,''
Pennsylvania has ``opportunity grants,'' and other states have
given up on vouchers in substance as well as language,
experimenting instead with various kinds of tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will have none of that. ``I was told not to use the V
word,'' he says of his campaign last year. ``I used it whenever
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that New Mexico lends itself easily to this kind of
radical idea. Its people adore big government, which is only
natural given that public spending accounts for half of New
Mexico's economy, compared with a third in the rest of America.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the pollsters said that Johnson _ a Republican, and a
stridently free-market one at that _ would have a hard time getting
elected to a second term: the Democrats had fielded a strong
Hispanic candidate, and Hispanics account for 40 percent of New
Mexico's people.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson defied the odds. He won, and comfortably; he is the
first governor of New Mexico ever to win two consecutive terms in
office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's record helps to explain his bravado on education.
If you remind him that voters have rejected pro-voucher referendums
in Oregon, California, Washington and Colorado, or if you dare
suggest that the polls augur poorly for his plan, the governor
responds with genial disregard: ``Damn the polls,'' he says, ``I
move them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of prisons, the governor recalls, polls said
three-quarters of New Mexicans opposed privatization four years
ago. But the governor privatized them anyway, and now most New
Mexicans applaud him.
</P>
<P>
   Just possibly, Johnson may already be shifting the climate of
opinion on education. Before he began to speak out in favor of
vouchers, fewer than half of New Mexico's parents supported the
idea; but a recent survey suggested that 58 percent have now come
around to it.
</P>
<P>
   And the more the governor talks, the more converts he is likely
to win. He argues vigorously that other education remedies have
failed: since taking office in 1995, Johnson has raised education
spending by nearly a third, but dropout rates and test scores have
showed barely any improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Since money has not solved the problem, the governor goes on, it
is time to shake the system up. By making children mobile, comes
the conclusion, vouchers will require schools to improve
themselves, or lose their pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's determination promises a fight worth watching.
The Democrats who run New Mexico's legislature have close ties to
the teachers' unions, and the unions hate vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   They have summoned their members to fight an anti-voucher
crusade, distributing the call through the state's network of
parent-teacher associations and through radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Democratic law makers have sent Johnson two
budgets, neither of which authorized vouchers. The governor vetoed
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he will carry on wielding his veto. If there is no
budget, so be it: the state government will shut down in July, and
remain shut until the Democrats see reason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a similar drama took place in Washington, three
years ago, it was the Republicans who were humbled in the end. But
Johnson reckons that was because Republicans occupied Congress
rather than the executive branch: New Mexico is different.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he may be willing to accept a voucher scheme
covering somewhat fewer than the 100,000 pupils he wants; but he is
not going to give up. He would rather sacrifice his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, he says, are ``a great issue to go down on.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can avoid going down, small New Mexico may suddenly have
big consequences. A Johnson victory would prove that school
vouchers can make good politics as well as good sense, and
encourage other Republicans to campaign on them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a quiet pro-voucher tide flows in America: though only
51 percent of respondents in last year's Gallup poll favored
vouchers, that is up from 43 percent two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide needs a bold surfer if it is to have policy
consequences. Gary Johnson, fitness fanatic that he is, seems the
ideal candidate. &QL;

crusade, distributing the call through the state's network of
parent-teacher associations and through radio advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Democratic law makers have sent Johnson two
budgets, neither of which authorized vouchers. The governor vetoed
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he will carry on wielding his veto. If there is no
budget, so be it: the state government will shut down in July, and
remain shut until the Democrats see reason.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a similar drama took place in Washington, three
years ago, it was the Republicans who were humbled in the end. But
Johnson reckons that was because Republicans occupied Congress
rather than the executive branch: New Mexico is different.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he may be willing to accept a voucher scheme
covering somewhat fewer than the 100,000 pupils he wants; but he is
not going to give up. He would rather sacrifice his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, he says, are ``a great issue to go down on.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can avoid going down, small New Mexico may suddenly have
big consequences. A Johnson victory would prove that school
vouchers can make good politics as well as good sense, and
encourage other Republicans to campaign on them.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a quiet pro-voucher tide flows in America: though only
51 percent of respondents in last year's Gallup poll favored
vouchers, that is up from 43 percent two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide needs a bold surfer if it is to have policy
consequences. Gary Johnson, fitness fanatic that he is, seems the
ideal candidate. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG _ America has Jeff Bezos; China has Jack
Ma Yun. Both are clever entrepreneurs who have grown rich by being
among the first to exploit the Internet's potential. But there the
similarities end.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, around the time Bezos was setting up Amazon.com, Ma was
sending his first e-mail message during a trip to America to
negotiate a deal for a provincial highway (of the asphalt variety).
</P>
<P>
   He got three responses and was so impressed that he bought a PC
with some winnings from Las Vegas, signed up with a web-hosting
service, and returned to China to found an Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   China would not get its first commercial Internet connection for
a few more months. When it did, and Ma logged into the Shanghai
service provider with a long-distance call from his native
Hangzhou, the first page of his site took three hours to load.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed made me lose face, but at least I proved that I
could really do it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ma's sites, ChinaPages and ChinaMarket, had their
first few thousand visitors, Bezos was well on his way to becoming
a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is not America, especially when it comes to e-commerce.
However, countries in the region are racing to wire themselves up,
with such projects as Singapore's ``wired island,'' Malaysia's
multimedia super corridor and Hong Kong's planned ``cyberport.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are only just getting to grips with their own
e-mail, government planners proclaim Asia's ambition to create a
networked society. In China, 1999 has been declared the ``year of
getting on the Internet'' and all ministries are creating websites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Asia's economic crisis, Internet and e-commerce growth
rates are among the highest in the world, and often twice as high
as that in America.
</P>
<P>
   Every consultancy has its own estimates of Asian e-commerce
revenues; all agree that they are small compared to America's _ but
whose aren't? A more reliable guide may be the number of secure web
servers in each country.
</P>
<P>
   Secure servers are used mainly for e-commerce, and they have
certificates giving the actual country of residence, as opposed to
address ``domains'' such as ``.uk'' or ``.fr'' which can often be
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Asia is not as far behind the West as is often
thought. Today it has nearly two-thirds as many e-commerce servers
as the EU and it is gaining ground, according to Netcraft, a
consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong are all above
the EU average of e-commerce servers per person. And China, which
two years ago had no such servers at all, is catching up at a
phenomenal pace, growing at an annual rate of more than 1,000
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Asian e-commerce is a breed apart. Although plenty of
Asian entrepreneurs dream of Amazon-like wealth, few have been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The ownership of PCs is rising, albeit from a low base. But at
least half those PCs are not connected to a network, having been
bought mostly to educate children.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of online users in Asia are in business, compared
with a third in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are other barriers to consumer e-commerce. Few Asians have
credit cards; they prefer face-to-face buying (mail-order has never
taken off, except in Australia and New Zealand); and most of the
region is plentifully served by corner shops.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian banks mistrust online transactions.
ActionAce.com, an online toy seller based in Hong Kong, has to
process its orders in America, because no local bank would serve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business e-commerce, or e-business, is a different
story. Even in the home of consumer sites such as ebay and eTrade,
which steal the headlines and achieve dizzying valuations,
e-business is the greater part of online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, e-business is even more preponderant than in America
and it is likely to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Although Asian consumers are ill-prepared for e-commerce, its
businesses stand to gain far more than their western counterparts.
The region is dominated by small and medium-sized firms, many of
them exporters in manufacturing industries. Most were too small to
jump on to previous IT bandwagons.
</P>
<P>
   When companies such as WalMart pushed electronic data
interchange (EDI) in the 1980s, small Asian producers were often
left out, because they could not afford the proprietary systems
that they needed to gain access to the network.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet, they can redress the balance. Few have
mainframes running business processes or databases keeping stock.
But they can do wonders for their efficiency by replacing women at
desks shuffling countless flimsy paper forms.
</P>
<P>
   Small Asian firms are notoriously bad at international
marketing, something a website makes simpler. E-mail is cheaper
than faxes and international telephone calls. Even the smallest
factory can afford a PC and a dial-up Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of Asian Sources. A few years ago, this firm
was chiefly a trade-paper publisher, sending hundreds of salesmen
to tiny factories in China, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia to sell
product-display advertising in glossy catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   Now Asian Sources is shifting to a website. The same salesmen
carry digital cameras and teach factory managers how to use e-mail,
even helping them set up their first PC.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 manufacturers, some of them tiny shops in remote
Chinese provinces, are now online.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas big Western firms have the clout to become e-business
hubs themselves, smaller Asian firms are turning to ``electronic
trade associations'' that are starting to create entire e-commerce
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a consultancy, counts more than 100 of these
third-party hubs in Asia, such as Advanced Manufacturing Online
(AMO) and Arena (formally Cargonet), a site that tracks shipments
and export logistics for dozens of firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, firms will compete ``supply-chain versus
supply-chain,'' says James Hatcher of AMO; the most wired firms
have the greatest chance of prevailing. It may not be as glamorous
as books and videos, but it fits better with Asia's strengths in
manufacturing and trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, the Internet is seen as a libertarian's
dream, releasing commerce and consumers from government
interference. There is no such fervor in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Without a Nasdaq on which to launch start-ups, and little
appetite among investors for firms, such as Amazon, that lose money
with every sale, Asian governments have been the main promoters of
Asian e-commerce _ and welcome ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   When China's trade ministry asked Ma to set up ChinaMarket,
4,500 companies joined before he ran a single advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be anything headline-grabbing about most
e-business _ an e-mail here, a website there _ but an e-commerce
revolution is nevertheless under way. &QL;

PATAKI CRITICIZES CLINTON ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, N.H. _ Testing a foreign-policy theme in his second
political trip to New Hampshire in less than a month, New York Gov.
George Pataki criticized President Clinton's policies on Kosovo,
saying they had ``raised the risk of trouble in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   In a warmly received speech at the Veterans of Foreign War Post
4368 here, Pataki said the president had failed to accomplish three
of his main goals in the region: protecting the people of Kosovo,
preventing the ``destabilization' of the Balkans and weakening
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have his policies done?'' Pataki asked a gathering of
about 75 people. `Instead of preserving the life and the shelter of
the Kosovars, we have seen hundreds of thousands forced out.
Instead of stabilizing the Balkans, his policies have created
instability in places like Macedonia, and raised the risk of
trouble in the Balkans. And instead of weakening Milosevic, he has
united the Serbian people around Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki added, ``I think it's tragic that we have not achieved
those goals, honorable as those goals were.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's appearance here Friday was part of a series of speeches
around the country in recent months intended to bolster his
national presence.
</P>
<P>
   As in his previous speeches, the governor, who has been
mentioned as a possible candidate for the Republicans' national
ticket next year, emphasized his credentials as an effective tax
cutter and crime fighter. But his comments tonight represented the
first time he has ventured into foreign policy on one of his
political trips.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's trip was his second to New Hampshire, the site of the
nation's first presidential primary. Pataki is among a growing list
of candidates who have traveled here to woo voters: this weekend
alone, two Republican presidential hopefuls _ former Vice President
Dan Quayle, and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio _ are swinging through the
state while Vice President Gore is scheduled to visit nearby Keene,
Salem, Bedford and Manchester.

   EAST JERUSALEM _ Even by his own globe-trotting standards,
Yasser Arafat has clocked up an enormous number of air miles.
Between late March and early April, the Palestinian leader visited
a dozen capitals in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this frenetic diplomacy was to ``consult'' friendly
governments about what he should do on May 4. This is the expiry
deadline for the Oslo agreement's five-year interim period, and the
date, according to the Oslo process, when Israel and the
Palestinians should have reached a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the date on which Arafat has been insisting for the
past 20 months that, should there be no agreement, it is the
Palestinians' right to declare a state unilaterally in the West
Bank and Gaza ``with Jerusalem as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinians are aware that their leader's diplomatic
offensive is an exercise in damage limitation. From Washington to
Moscow to Tokyo, Arafat has been told that he must postpone any
unilateral declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The world's caution is not about the Palestinians' right to
statehood, which is gaining general recognition. It is born of the
fear that a Palestinian UDI would allow Israel's prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, to tear up the Oslo agreement _ and milk for
all it is worth the issue of ``Palestinian terrorism'' less than
two weeks before Israel's crucial election on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's problem is how to climb down from the UDI tree without
losing face with his own people. It is proving to be a hazardous
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders have offered some ladders to help him. The Americans
have combined quiet promises of a more active role in the peace
process after Israel's election with denunciations of Israel's
continuing expansion of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has gone further. Its leaders, meeting in
Berlin last month, issued a statement reaffirming the Palestinians'
``unqualified'' right to self-determination, ``including the option
of a state.''
</P>
<P>
   While urging both sides to agree to an extension of the interim
period beyond May 4, the EU also said that Palestinian
self-determination is a right ``not subject to any veto'' and that
it believed that it should be possible ``to conclude the
negotiations [on a final agreement] within a target period of one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat called the declaration a historic endorsement of
Palestinian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, for his part, regretted ``that Europe, where a third
of the Jewish people perished, would see fit to impose a solution
that endangers the state of Israel and its interests.'' It was a
comment that made even some of his supporters wince.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said that the final decision on whether to declare a
state will be made by the Palestine Liberation OrganiZation's
125-member Central Committee in Gaza on April 27.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that the package of American promises
and European declarations will be enough to marshal a majority in
favor of postponement.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of Palestinians argue that promises and
declarations, when faced with an Israel that may after all continue
to be led by Netanyahu, are no longer enough.
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, a prominent member of Arafat's Fatah movement, Ahmed
Korei (Abu Ala), wrote a long article in two Palestinian newspapers
arguing that the Palestinians should declare a state on May 4 and
let the world be damned.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Palestinian architects of the Oslo agreement, Korei
is not known as a radical. But as speaker of the elected
Palestinian Legislative Council he has to listen to public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He makes the telling point that postponing statehood on May 4
would be no less beneficial to Netanyahu's electoral fortunes than
declaring it.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian retreat, he writes, would be used by the Likud
leader as proof that he has succeeded in ``lowering Palestinian
expectations'' on any permanent deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other Palestinian leaders agree that May 4 cannot come and go
like any other day. Azmi Shuiabi, a member of the PLO's Central
Committee, says that it would be ``foolish'' for the Palestinians
to pit themselves against the international consensus in favor of
postponing a declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   But he also says that the Palestinians should not extend Oslo's
interim period without ``guarantees'' from Israel, the United
States and the EU. Chief among these, says Shuiabi, should be an
``absolute freeze'' on all settlement construction. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   According to Israel's Peace Now movement, Netanyahu's government
has established 17 new ``hilltop'' settlements since the Wye
agreement was signed last October. This has swollen the West Bank's
settler population from its present 160,000 to a potential 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new settlements, Peace Now points out, are close to areas
from which Israel is supposed to withdraw under the terms of Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Should they be developed, a future Palestinian state would find
it difficult to expand much beyond the 29 percent of the West Bank
the Palestinian Authority (PA) currently (and partially) controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say that such construction runs counter to
understandings reached with Netanyahu at the time of the Wye
negotiations. Netanyahu responds that ``We (Israel and America)
have never had an agreement to limit activities in the
settlements.'' &QL;

   Three weeks before the ``sacred date'' of May 4, Arafat's
dilemma is acute.
</P>
<P>
   Should he declare a state, or suspend what many Palestinians see
as the constraining terms of the interim agreements (especially the
security cooperation between the PA, Israel and the CIA), he may
enhance Likud's chances and anger the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Should he do nothing, he will be exposed before his people as a
leader who is impotent in the face of an Israeli government that
not only declares its intention ``never'' to allow a Palestinian
state, but which every day builds facts to prevent one from
emerging. &QL;

   EAST JERUSALEM _ Even by his own globe-trotting standards,
Yasser Arafat has clocked up an enormous number of air miles.
Between late March and early April, the Palestinian leader visited
a dozen capitals in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this frenetic diplomacy was to ``consult'' friendly
governments about what he should do on May 4. This is the expiry
deadline for the Oslo agreement's five-year interim period, and the
date, according to the Oslo process, when Israel and the
Palestinians should have reached a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the date on which Arafat has been insisting for the
past 20 months that, should there be no agreement, it is the
Palestinians' right to declare a state unilaterally in the West
Bank and Gaza ``with Jerusalem as its capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Palestinians are aware that their leader's diplomatic
offensive is an exercise in damage limitation. From Washington to
Moscow to Tokyo, Arafat has been told that he must postpone any
unilateral declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The world's caution is not about the Palestinians' right to
statehood, which is gaining general recognition. It is born of the
fear that a Palestinian UDI would allow Israel's prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, to tear up the Oslo agreement _ and milk for

SOME LAKERS SEEM SKEPTICAL ABOUT DROPPING RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Adding Dennis Rodman was supposed to improve
the Los Angeles Lakers. Now management hopes removing him will
achieve the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   But many Lakers are skeptical that waiving the seven-time
rebounding champion will get them any closer to a championship.
</P>
<P>
   They hesitated to criticize the decision by coach Kurt Rambis,
but players didn't praise it either Friday, a day after the
franchise decided to cut the troublesome forward loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed,'' Kobe Bryant said, ``because
obviously I felt that he could have benefited the team, he could
have helped us down the road. But it's a decision I'm just gonna
have to stand by Kurt and stand by management and just move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Shaquille O'Neal specifically requested the
Lakers sign the rebounding ``thug,'' and was perhaps Rodman's
greatest advocate. But the usually talkative O'Neal refused to
speak with reporters Friday, apparently upset over the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Co-captain Derek Harper also declined comment, saying, ``I don't
have a reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many late arrivals, skipped practices and refusals to
re-enter games prompted Rodman's termination. The Lakers finally
drew the line when Rodman arrived late to Thursday's practice, sans
shoes and socks. But the decision reflected a cumulative effect of
51 days of unpredictable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a decision we had to make,'' general manager Mitch
Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was for Rambis' sanity and ability to lead as much
as anything. Rambis requested the Lakers at least suspend Rodman,
but preferred cutting him. Kupchak and executive vice president
Jerry West ``readily agreed,'' Kupchak said. And owner Jerry Buss,
a friend of Rodman's, did not stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   With just 10 games left in a tumultuous season, the Lakers could
have let a few more Rodman flare-ups sail by, hope for the best and
figure he could be counted on in the playoffs. But in Rambis' view,
the team could no longer endure the distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time we need the ultimate focus and
concentration,'' he said. ``I didn't let (Rodman's actions) bother
me, I didn't let that bother the team, but it would be silly to say
it didn't affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his antics could have cost the Lakers a win. His
failure to attend practices disturbed their rhythm, Bryant
admitted, and on four occasions Rodman refused to re-enter games _
two of them losses _ citing elbow soreness or muscle tightness. In
another loss, Rodman was ejected late in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that he could have gone to war with us a little bit
more... but those are just minor things that you can overlook with
a victory,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many losses, however, magnified the disturbances and
failures to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things that happened, and there were many, there
are certain ones that gravitate more toward the top of the list,''
Kupchak said, ``....and certainly refusing to enter a game falls
toward the top of the list of actions that are not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Any negative actions, however, could be wiped out quickly by a
dominating performance from the talented defender and rebounder,
and Bryant reflected many players' outlook: that it was worth the
hassle, so long as the Lakers were winning.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, they did. The Lakers won the first nine games
Rodman played, before his four-day detour to Las Vegas. When he
returned, the magic was gone and the schedule tougher, and the
Lakers have gone 8-6 since then.
</P>
<P>
   So now Rodman's an ex-Laker, but is the team any better off?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not have made this move had we not thought our
performance would improve,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Derek Fisher said. ``We'll see. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lot of obstacles, and this is another one. And
we have to figure out a way to put it behind us and move on.''
