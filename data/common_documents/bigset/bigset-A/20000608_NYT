FOR HOMESCHOOLERS, OPPORTUNITIES REACH FAR BEYOND FAMILY WALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 13, Michael Brown pulled apart 60
computers that had been left for trash. As part of his
home-schooling, he turned them into 35 working machines.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, those computers are being used by his four
brothers, a sister and home-schoolers in their Blue Springs, Mo.,
community.
</P>
<P>
   There is sweet symmetry to this: The proliferation of computers
is partly responsible for a boom in home schooling, a movement
that's attracting more gifted children.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the Internet has made home curriculums richer than
ever before. And they've also provided the parent/teachers the
information they need to enter their students in local, state and
national competitions.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/And those students are winning.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, homeschooler George A. Thampy of Missouri placed
first at the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Washington.
Two other home-schooled students placed second and third.
</P>
<P>
   The previous week, George placed second in the National
Geography Bee.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old from suburban St. Louis was the second
homeschooler to win the spelling bee. In 1997 Rebecca Sealfon of
Brooklyn, N.Y., won.
</P>
<P>
   ``As homeschoolers learn they are eligible to compete in these
competitions, they begin joining in droves,'' said Michael Farris,
executive director of the Center for Home School Education Legal
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started a national homeschoolers' debate program four years
ago with about 150 kids. Now there are 1,200 members.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven of the 248 national spelling bee contestants this
year were schooled at home.
</P>
<P>
   But computers alone don't explain why more home-schooled
children are appearing in major academic competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last five years, some educators say, major
corporations that sponsor these contests have begun to accept home
schooling as a legitimate, alternative form of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago when we applied to get into district contests, we
were turned away,'' said Barbie Lay, president of Johnson County
(Kan.) Parent Educators, which has more than 900 families as
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doors continued to open as more numbers of us started
knocking on them saying, `Can we get our children involved?' ''
</P>
<P>
   No firm statistics exist on the prevalence of home education,
but experts say it's becoming more popular. According to the Center
for Home School Education in Virginia, as many as 1.7 million
children in the United States are taught at home. About 30,000 to
35,000 live in Missouri, and 15,000 to 17,500 in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the movement, most parents home schooled
for religious reasons, and not all of the students did so well,
said Peter Rosenstein, executive director of the National
Association for Gifted Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now a lot of gifted kids become home schooled because
their school can't meet their needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a stellar example. When he was 11 and ready for sixth
grade, his mother said, she wanted him in the Blue Springs School
District's gifted program. She says she was told that he hadn't
lived in the district long enough to be properly tested and
therefore wasn't yet eligible. The Browns had moved from California
two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided his needs were not being met and he would be
educated at home,'' said Brown's mother, Robin Brown. ``He was our
experimental child.''
</P>
<P>
   By 16, Brown was enrolled at Longview Community College. While
his peers in the class of 2000 were collecting high school
diplomas, he was getting his associate's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Brown starts a pre-med program at the University of
Missouri-Columbia in the fall. He wants to be a doctor or medical
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being home schooled made the difference,'' said Brown,
who is 18. ``If I had stayed in public school I wouldn't be where I
am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was not a contest joiner, but his 13-year-old brother,
Grant, wants to be. He's constructing a Web page he will enter in a
local technology competition this summer. He learned about the
contest from other homeschoolers he chats with via computer.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools still have the advantage in areas like science
and sports. But as even more resources become available, advocates
of the movement predict that homeschoolers will be more competitive
in those arenas, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home-schooled children are just like public school children _
they are all different and they learn differently,'' said Robin
Brown, who is teaching Grant and his sister Nicole, 11, at home,
while their brothers, Nathan, 10, Ephraim, 7, and Caleb, 6, attend
Young Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Robin and her husband, David Brown, dispute those who say only
the gifted home schoolers are successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Zeysing, owner of Cathy's Creative Dance School in
Independence, has noticed that the homeschoolers in her studio who
excel are also otherwise exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Zeysing is a parent, and she teaches remedial reading in Blue
Springs schools. Like others involved in mainstream education, she
wonders whether the home schooler can be well-rounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a teacher and I don't think I have all the skills to
teach my child everything my child would need to be successful in
life,'' Zeysing said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hats go off to parents who do this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns say it's not easy, but the key is remembering this:
``Gifted is a relative term.''
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter Nicole doesn't like to read. She prefers crafts
and animals but has read many of the same books Grant has read.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is also pretty good at the hula,'' her dad said.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Grant, their mother said, Nicole probably will not go
to college. She wants to go to cosmetology school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her fine, just do your best. Nicole will probably be a
gifted hairdresser.''

DOCTORS, EX-HOSPITAL EXEC TELL APPEALS COURT THAT TRIAL JUDGE
ERRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES and ROBERT BOCZKIEWICZ  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Two Johnson County physicians and a former Kansas City
hospital executive say they were wrongfully convicted in a kickback
scheme because the judge committed serious errors at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians, brothers Robert and Ronald LaHue, and the former
chief executive officer of Baptist Medical Center, Dan Anderson,
made the claims in separate written arguments filed recently with
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are due to respond to the defendants' filings in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants want the appeals court to overturn their Medicare
fraud convictions. In April 1999, a federal jury in Kansas City,
Kan., found the LaHues and Anderson guilty of conspiracy to defraud
the federal government and of paying and receiving payments in
return for the referral of nursing home patients to Baptist and
other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants say that the payments were for legitimate medical
services and that the business relationships between the doctors
and the hospitals benefited the patients and Medicare alike.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the defendants single out as an error an
instruction given by U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum to the
jury. Lungstrum told jurors that to return a guilty verdict, they
had to find that the payments were made with the intent, ``at least
in part,'' to induce the doctors to refer patients to the
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The jury instruction ``effectively criminalized innocent
conduct,'' Anderson contends. Anderson says the jurors should have
been instructed that he could not be convicted unless ``the primary
purpose'' of the payments was to induce referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under (Lungstrum's) interpretation, every hospital would
violate the statute on a daily basis through normal business
activities,'' Anderson says.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, Ronald LaHue says federal prosecutors in effect
gagged potential defense witnesses, including hospital personnel
and the lawyers who drafted the contracts between the LaHues and
Baptist, by naming them as unindicted co-conspirators. That
prompted the witnesses to invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Naming them as co-conspirators amounted to manipulation and
coercion by the prosecutors because, LaHue says, no criminal
charges were ever brought against them. LaHue says Lungstrum should
have granted his request to grant the alleged co-conspirators
immunity from prosecution so they could testify.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also contend that Lungstrum erred by admitting as
evidence the handwritten notes of the lawyers involved in setting
up the business arrangements between the LaHues and Baptist. The
lawyers were indicted but later acquitted by Lungstrum, who found
the evidence against them insufficient. The lawyers' notes were
highly prejudicial and should have been excluded, the defendants
say.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Anderson says he should have been treated no
differently than Dennis McClatchey, another Baptist executive, whom
Lungstrum acquitted after the jury convicted him. Lungstrum
concluded the evidence for conviction was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also point out that Lungstrum denied them an
acquittal or new trial despite his finding that there was no
evidence that patients referred by the LaHues received substandard
care or were denied their choice of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Congress intended to criminalize those practices _ not the
practices of which the defendants were convicted, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and the LaHues were sentenced to prison but remain free
pending their appeal.

FDA ADDS HURDLES IN APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf to add information about Population Council; subs
11th graf for clarification)  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-running effort to bring the French
abortion pill to women in this country has encountered yet another
obstacle: a suggestion by the Food and Drug Administration that it
may place tight restrictions on how the drug, RU-486, is
distributed and who can prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, once a drug is approved, any doctor can prescribe it
for any purpose. But people familiar with negotiations between the
FDA and the sponsor of RU-486, which is also known as mifepristone,
say the agency is considering taking several unusual steps,
including restricting prescribing privileges to doctors who perform
surgical abortions.
</P>
<P>
   That would effectively eliminate what advocates of abortion
rights see as mifepristone's main advantage, moving the procedure
out of potentially high-profile clinics and into the private
offices of gynecologists, family practitioners and other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kills the drug if it can't be used by primary care
providers,'' said Dr. Eric Schaff, a professor of family medicine
at the University of Rochester who has run clinical trials of
RU-486 in the United States. ``The whole idea of mifepristone was
to increase access.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is mifepristone's potential. A study released
Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in three
gynecologists who do not perform abortions would prescribe
mifepristone if it were approved by the FDA. But the study also
found that doctors would have second thoughts if they were required
to undergo training to use the drug, another condition the FDA is
considering imposing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the food and drug agency refused to comment on the
negotiations, as did the Population Council, a nonprofit research
group that holds the rights to market mifepristone in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Heather O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the Danco Group, the
investors who have licensed those rights and are arranging for the
drug to be manufactured and distributed in this country, said ``The
agency's initial approach is more restrictive than we had
envisioned for a drug that has been used safely by so many women.''
</P>
<P>
   But she would not elaborate, beyond saying, ``We are in the very
early stages of a delicate negotiation process with the FDA.'' FDA
Studies show that when taken in combination with misoprostol, an
already approved medication, mifepristone causes abortion, in
essence, a miscarriage, in more than 95 percent of women who are no
more than 49 days pregnant. After years of controversy, the FDA
announced in 1996 that the drug was safe and effective for use in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   But the final approval process has been fraught with
complications, in part because the drug's sponsors had trouble
finding a manufacturer. That issue has been settled (the
manufacturer's identity remains undisclosed), and in February, the
FDA notified the Danco Group it would give final approval to RU-486
if certain labeling and manufacturing issues could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has until Sept. 30 to either approve the drug, reject
it or call for a further delay. Negotiations were proceeding apace
when, at a Population Council meeting last Friday, officials from
the Danco Group announced that they had just received a new set of
requirements from the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Burnhill, medical affairs vice president for Planned
Parenthood of America who was present at the meeting, said the list
caught Danco officials by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought all the FDA requirements had been dropped on the
table in February,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring that only abortion practitioners
prescribe mifepristone, Burnhill said, the FDA is demanding that
prescribing doctors be trained in mifepristone's use; be trained in
reading ltrasound scans; and maintain admitting privileges at
hospitals with emergency facilities no more than an hour from their
offices, in case women experience complications.
</P>
<P>
   Burnhill said doctors would have to register with the drug's
distributor, ``so that the distributor would not be supplying the
product to every Tom, Dick and Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal contained a subtle, but important,
wording change: because the word ``physician'' and not ``provider''
was used, nurse-practitioners would be unable to prescribe
mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Though rare, similar requirements have been imposed on drugs
including thalidomide and certain narcotics used to relieve pain in
cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some abortion rights advocates and others who favor approval of
Ru-486 fear that the requirements mean a national list of
mifepristone providers would be created, giving abortion opponents
an opportunity to single out those doctors. Others say the FDA is
succumbing to political pressure and treating women unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To encumber a drug like this is extremely unusual for the
FDA,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin, a professor of public health at
Columbia University. ``We have Viagra that went out in widespread
fashion even though there was some suggestion that it might cause
serious cardiovascular events. In contrast, this is a highly
studied drug where the safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.
That indicates how the political climate is really interfering in
the science.''

DIFFERENT HORIZONS, SAME VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nine weeks, Tony Amend and Brad Rincker had time to think
about what their jobs meant to them. Both Teamsters were locked out
of their warehouse jobs at Associated Wholesale Grocers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what both decided: Their jobs were hard, physical labor _
the kind that most people simply wouldn't care to do or wouldn't
last in for the decade-plus they each had under their belts.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed that before the lockout and for months on end, they
had made many personal and family sacrifices to work mandatory
overtime, often putting in up to 14 hours a day, 70 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   And both were shocked at the lockout, not quite able to believe
that after years of work, they were drawing state unemployment
money.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after AWG and the union settled their dispute before
the National Labor Relations Board, and the union signed a contract
with an AWG subcontractor to operate the warehouse, both men
reported back to work.
</P>
<P>
   On Amend's first day back, he put in 14 hours. He said his
supervisors were happy to see him and he was happy to be there,
despite some hassles with equipment that had been damaged during
the Teamsters' absence.
</P>
<P>
   As the sole support of his family, Amend was delighted to be
done with mowing lawns, painting houses, doing landscaping _ any
odd job he could find to supplement his $306-a-week unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   On Rincker's first day back, he decided to turn in his
resignation. Faced with immediate 12-hour workdays, he realized his
life's priorities had changed during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Rincker, who didn't have the same family financial obligations
as Amend, had used the lockout time to jump into a 30-week
Microsoft certified software engineer training program. He'd
already returned to Penn Valley Community College and, after three
semesters of night school, had a 4.0 grade point average in
computer network administration classes.
</P>
<P>
   So one man is back in the saddle, and the other chose to ride a
different horse. But both carry similar impressions from their time
in the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Principal among them is good will toward the supervisors who
acknowledged them as thinking, well-intentioned workers who had
goals, personal needs and strong work ethics. They appreciate those
supervisors who worked with them to adjust work hours to
accommodate personal needs or took care to explain company
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also exude optimism about the ability of the Teamsters,
the warehouse operator, Elite Logistics and AWG to make a go of it
together. It won't be easy; the lockout and months leading up to it
exacerbated a nasty atmosphere of us vs. them, labor vs.
management.
</P>
<P>
   Both hope that Elite will hire enough people to do the jobs and
that the excessive overtime will end, making life easier for all
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Both think there's a chance now to improve work conditions and
work relationships. Amend expects to do his part on the job.
Rincker will cheer from afar.
</P>
<P>
   Both urge the public to pay attention. There's a ripple effect
throughout the economy when work stoppages occur for any reason.

2 CHARGED IN $1.5 MILLION MAIL THEFT SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Pa., N.J.)   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young couple used mail pilfered from thousands of
homes in Queens and Long Island neighborhoods to steal more than
$1.5 million from banks and credit card companies, prosecutors said
Wednesday. They called the crime one of the most brazen and
methodical cases of identity theft they had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said the couple, Ismael
Irizarry, 28, and Luisa Irizarry, 27, hired 16 people to plunder
mailboxes in affluent and middle-class neighborhoods like Forest
Hills and Bayside in Queens, as well as communities in both Nassau
and Suffolk counties.
</P>
<P>
   Their victims included ``many prominent names in the New York
metropolitan area,'' including political and civic leaders, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Irizarrys moved to Pembroke Pines, Fla. Mr.
Irizarry, who was indicted in November, was arrested in January on
a visit to New York. He is being held without bail.
</P>
<P>
   His wife remained at large until she was arrested in Florida on
Friday, June 2.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 18 months, starting in 1998, Brown said, the
couple and their assistants combed through hundreds of thousands of
pieces of mail to steal credit card applications, checks and
personal information like Social Security numbers and drivers'
license numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that the Irizarrys, who formerly lived in
Queens, set up a computer database of all the information and
applied for credit cards and cashed stolen checks. Some of those
checks were deposited in the bank accounts of two fictitious
corporations, Millennium Import/Export Co. and Genesis
Communications, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irizarrys were indicted on charges of grand larceny,
possessing forged checks, falsifying business records, scheming to
defraud and possessing stolen property. A conviction on grand
larceny, the most serious charge, could lead to up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Irizarry's lawyer, Salvatore Chetta of Queens, could not be
reached for comment. Lawyers at the public defender's office in
Dade County, Fla., who are representing Ms. Irizarry, did not
return calls seeking comment about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Queens district attorney's office and the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service found a list of 2,000 names of
victims in the computer database, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Irizarry was arrested by Florida police officers after she
tried to lease cars using stolen checks under the alias of Gloria
Casanove, Brown said. She was charged by the Miami police with auto
theft and assaulting a police officer, and is awaiting extradition
to New York, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added that she also faced outstanding warrants in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania for unspecified crimes.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Alan D. Bersin, superintendent of the San Diego
schools, is talking tough with 35 student teachers: ``Our reading
levels, by and large, are abysmal,'' he tells them. The dropout
rate is huge, he says, and he has laid off 600 paraprofessionals
because ``they have added virtually nothing to student
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bersin is arguing the case for his sweeping campaign to reshape
the schools, with prescribed blocks of time for teaching literacy,
and constant teacher training in the methods to be used.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' union objects to Bersin's approach, and his reform
plan squeaked through the school board on a 3-2 vote in March, but
his not being an educator is no longer much of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bersin is the former U.S. attorney for southern California, one
of the first of a new breed of high-profile outsiders taking over
big-city school districts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles board of education named Roy Romer,
the former Colorado governor, as its new superintendent. In May,
Harold O. Levy, a corporate lawyer, was chosen to lead the New York
City school system, the nation's largest. They are the first
non-educators ever chosen for those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other urban districts, too, have turned to law, business,
government and the military for new leadership and an outside
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these newcomers _ often the children of immigrants
who view their families' success as a direct result of public
schooling _ education is the era's biggest challenge and leading a
school system is today's Everest of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public education is what distinguishes this country, both
vertically, in history, and horizontally, from other societies
around the world,'' said Bersin. ``For the first time, there is a
real belief in this country that every child has the right to a
quality education. This is the most important challenge San Diego
faces. It gives reality to what is otherwise the empty myth that in
this country, you can do anything you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, in an effort to recruit teachers to the cause, has said
recently, ``Urban education is the equivalent of the Peace Corps of
the '60s or the civil rights movement of the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has had two nontraditional superintendents in a row, one
from the military, one from the private sector. Houston's
superintendent is a former school board member; Chicago's a former
city budget director; Kansas City's a former top federal aviation
official.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``These are all very smart, very talented individuals who
have a clear idea of where they're going, and how to get there,''
said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great
City Schools. ``What's not clear yet is whether they can produce
the same academic gains as a skilled educator.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts in educational administration say it is precisely
the sense that educators have failed the schools _ and that
outsiders may have an edge in effecting change.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts need to change how they conduct themselves if
we are to improve student achievement, and that kind of change does
not usually come from those inside the system,'' said Bersin, a
product of the New York City public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bersin was San Diego's chief federal law enforcement officer
when he was given the $165,000-a-year job of heading the nation's
eighth-largest urban school district, which has 145,000 students.
Now he is steeped in the language of education, talking
passionately about creating a community of learners, or about
children who score in the bottom quartile on the SAT 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take long to understand the issues, to see the
extraordinary talent of many of the people inside the system, and
the ways the system has functioned as an obstacle to their
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1990s, it was almost unthinkable to choose a big-city
superintendent from outside education. Traditionally, they were
former teachers who became principals and then superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nontraditional superintendents split the
responsibilities of leading their districts, handling school board
meetings, bond issues, union matters and politics themselves, but
leaving issues of pedagogy to a deputy with educational
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Bersin turned to Anthony Alvarado, a former New
York City educator best known for his success in raising student
achievement and creating innovative schools in two Manhattan
districts.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Alvarado's long history in New York included a difficult
chapter: in 1984, his year as chancellor ended with his resignation
amid charges of personal financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, he is the chancellor of instruction, and head of
the district's new Institute for Learning _ and, he said, delighted
to be able to focus on raising the quality of instruction. Alvarado
is not revered in San Diego as he was in New York. He knows that
many there see him as a brash outsider imposing heavy-handed
changes on a system he does not know. But, he argues, his changes
grow out of solid research, not personal whim.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of evidence about what helps kids learn,'' he
said. ``We know literacy and math are the gatekeeper skills that
give kids access to academic success for the rest of their lives.
We know summer school helps reduce the learning loss that occurs
when poor kids are out of school for a long time. It's not Tony
Alvarado doing summer school, it's what works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a surgeon, visiting hospitals in different cities,
there's a stunning similarity in the tools, the length of the
incision, the mortality rate. When we started, the elementary
programs here had 200 reading programs, sometimes four or five
different programs in the same school. And what all these programs
generated was only 41 percent of the kids reading at or above grade
level.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to systemic change is profound, according to
Kimiko Fukuda, a 33-year veteran of the San Diego system who is the
only one of the old assistant superintendents to remain as an
``instructional leader'' in the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd read Alvarado's work, and I understood the problem of
every teacher being in private practice, almost an independent
contractor,'' she said. ``But when I tried to change things as an
assistant superintendent, it didn't have much impact, because it
was voluntary, and the union didn't like it. You really can't make
this kind of change unless it's from the top, and it covers
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, each principal is required to spend two hours a day in
classrooms helping teachers improve their work. Peer coaches in the
schools help with teaching methods, too, and principals attend
weekly training sessions on literacy techniques such as ``guided
reading'' and ``shared reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Some principals love it.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Elementary School, a year-round school with 1,200
mostly Hispanic children crammed into a facility built for 800,
Elaine Arm, the principal, sings the praises of Bersin's
educational overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I've been reborn,'' she says. ``I feel powerful. I'm not just
an administrator now; I'm an instructional leader; I'm in
classrooms every day and I love it. There is real focus. We know
what we are supposed to do, and why. It's an enormous change, all
because of this superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   If something as abstract as school reform can be made visible,
Bersin's version is on view on the hallway bulletin boards, where
sweetly childish writings _ ``I like when the frog got the peach
down.'' _ are posted beneath the state learning standard that
prompted the assignment. ``3.1 We are learning to distinguish real
stories from make-believe,'' or ``2.6 We are learning to write a
response to literature.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is visible as the fourth graders write book essays
following a ``rubric'' that tell them the first paragraph should
contain the title, author and theme, the second should compare the
main characters and the third should compare the problems they
faced and the solutions they reached.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this approach is not universally accepted. Many San
Diego educators say the reforms impinge on their spontaneity and
overemphasize literacy, neglecting social studies and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher I work with is mostly hoping this will pass,''
said one of the student teachers Bersin was addressing. ``Her
attitude is `I've been teaching for 10 years, and what the heck is
guided reading?' She doesn't think the principal who's supposed to
be leading it understands all this new stuff any better than she
does.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The student teachers seem energized by Bersin's approach, but
wary, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's change, and it makes people nervous,'' said Les
Henderson, who expects teacher certification next month. `We're
talking about institutionalizing education, standardizing things,
and I'm on the fence about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years into Bersin's reign, some local educators question how
long he can talk about the district's poor performance without
being held responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes three to five years to bring real change,'' said
Bruce S. Cooper, a professor of educational administration at
Fordham University. ``The problem is that large districts are so
unmanageable and unstable that the average superintendent only
lasts two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can stay the course, it may be Bersin, a Brooklyn
native with an easy charm, a sharp mind, and a golden resume: Phi
Beta Kappa at Harvard, All Ivy and All-East Football Teams, and
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he overlapped a year with Bill
Clinton, and then, like the president, moved on to Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he headed west, first as special counsel to the
Los Angeles Police Commission, then handling commercial litigation
at Munger, Tolles &AMP; Olson. He moved to San Diego for a sabbatical
teaching law school in 1992, shortly after the birth of his second
daughter, now a second grader in the district. Bersin's oldest
daughter is at Harvard, and his youngest is in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you what a Republican town San Diego is that three
weeks after I got here, I was the head of Clinton for President.''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, President Clinton appointed him U.S. attorney, and
starting in 1995, he also served as Attorney General Janet Reno's
border czar. Faced with the intractable problems of the border _
drug trafficking and illegal immigration _ he gained attention by
reframing the issues in terms of public safety, making it possible
to work with Mexico toward some common goals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bersin keeps a politician's schedule: he goes from the student
teachers' visit to throwing the first ball at the Padres game, from
a visit to Central Elementary to teaching an eighth grade history
class at Correia Middle School, and on to a staff meeting on
portfolio assessment at Curie Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with every teacher, every administrator, asking lots of
questions, listening hard and saying how much he values their
ideas. He stops to ask a custodian how things are going. ``We've
made everyone in the system, the bus drivers, everyone, understand
that their job is to support learning in the classroom,'' Bersin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bersin has prodigious energy, and seems to take real pleasure in
all the public contact. But he is not, he says, headed for
political office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd wanted elective office, I'd have stayed in the U.S.
attorney's office, putting bad guys in jail, which plays to the
public,'' he said. ``I'm in a position to choose what I do and
where I can make a difference. And this is the most important
challenge.''

METS CRUSH ORIOLES, 11-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Edgardo Alfonzo, it was another typical game on
Wednesday night. He homered in the first inning to drive in the New
York Mets' first run, tripled in the sixth to score the go-ahead
run _ and somehow did nothing to draw attention to himself in an
11-3 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo is the Mets' stealth superstar, quietly posting great
numbers while others get more fanfare. He is probably the National
League's best second baseman, but he has never been an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a really special player when it's all said
and done,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``Right now, he's one of
the finest players in the game, but he keeps trying to improve. I'm
really proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo bats in front of Mike Piazza, the star catcher, and
after Alfonzo delivered a functional, 382-foot homer to left on
Wednesday night, Piazza followed with a mammoth blast that traveled
64 feet farther, over the fence beyond the visitors' bullpen in
left.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, when Alfonzo rifled a triple to right off Scott
Erickson, it took his average to .350 and was the pivotal hit in a
four-run inning that put the Mets ahead to stay. But the more
memorable at-bat that inning was the one that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Jason Tyner, a slap-hitting leadoff man who has not
homered since high school, turned on a pitch and sent Albert Belle
retreating for the catch, just in front of the warning track. Kurt
Abbott, who opened the inning with a triple, scored on the
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott later doubled to start a five-run seventh inning that
burst open the game.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, the game was still close; the Orioles were
leading, 3-2, when the Mets' starter, Rick Reed, left the game
after throwing 99 pitches in five unsteady innings. Reed, pitching
for the first time in 11 days after straining a muscle in his left
side, allowed three runs on eight hits, including a homer by Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he was too strong after the layoff, throwing fastballs
up in the zone _ dangerous territory for him. He said he finally
stopped doing that against the last batter he faced _ Belle, who
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to overpower anybody, that's for sure,'' said
Reed. ``That at-bat was probably the best I was throwing all night.
I guess if you're going to end your night, you might as well end it
on a positive note.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyner saved a run for Reed in the fourth inning, but it was
almost his duty: he had allowed B.J. Surhoff to reach third when he
dropped a fly ball by Ripken that went for a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Tyner got a running start on a fly by Charles
Johnson, and lofted his throw home as Surhoff tagged up. The ball
took one hop, Piazza reached up to get it and used his left foot to
block Surhoff's path to the plate, applying the tag and completing
the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, meanwhile, was happy to spread the credit among the
whole team. ``This was a pretty good game, from the first at-bat to
the end,'' Alfonzo said. ``It was a good sign that we put
everything together tonight.''

  (Eds: inserts new graf after lede to note Democrats have high hopes
for Montana; subs original 4th graf to change `number of families'
to `percentage of families') 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Montana Gov. Marc Racicot barred by law from seeking a
third consecutive term, his lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and
state Auditor Mark O'Keefe had little trouble winning their
gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday to face each other in the
November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats regard Montana as one of their best hopes for picking
up a governorship, as well as seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Martz, a Republican who has served with Racicot since 1996, had
57 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Rob Natelson, a law
professor who fared better this time than four years ago, when he
won only 24 percent in a primary challenge to Racicot. In the
Democratic primary, O'Keefe won 48 percent of the vote to defeat
two other high-ranking state officials, Attorney General Joe
Mazurek, with 36 percent, and Secretary of State Mike Cooney, with
16 percent. The voting reflected totals from all but two of
Montana's 867 voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was also one of several states that held congressional
primaries on Tuesday. In winning the Democratic U.S. Senate
primary, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made the high cost of
prescription drugs a campaign focus, easily defeated John Driscoll,
a former state public service commissioner who entered the campaign
late. Schweitzer, who won 66 percent of the vote to 34 percent for
Driscoll, will face the two-term Republican incumbent, Sen. Conrad
Burns, who had no primary opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While their approaches are certain to be different, Martz and
O'Keefe both said they would make statewide economic development a
high priority. Montana currently ranks lowest among the states in
average wages, 47th in per capita income and, as O'Keefe contended,
first in the percentage of families in which the chief wage earner
holds at least two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe said those rankings reflect how poorly the Racicot
administration had performed, but Martz said the situation was far
worse when Racicot took office in 1993, when the state was $200
million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re-did workmen's compensation, we reformed welfare, and
after the last legislative session, we enacted $116 million in tax
cuts,'' she said in an interview Wednesday, boasting of
administration successes.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not obscure the obvious, O'Keefe said, adding,
``We're having our first debate on Friday. One of things I'm sure
we'll talk about is the lieutenant governor's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Democrats held primaries in all three
congressional districts and one produced a close finish. Seeking to
oppose Rep. Joe Skeen, a 10-term Republican from the 2nd District,
state Treasurer Michael Montoya narrowly defeated Mike Runnels, a
district attorney, despite a recent investigation by New Mexico
State Police into accusations that Montoya's brother, Orlando
Montoya, diverted money from his construction business into the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Montoya won 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for
Runnels, a margin that Montoya said might have been helped by a
sympathetic backlash against the police investigation, which, so
far, has produced no charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1st District primary, former U.S. Attorney John J. Kelly
won 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race to face Rep. Heather
A. Wilson, a first-term Republican who is viewed by Democrats as
one of the most vulnerable members of the House majority. Kelly
defeated Sam Bregman, a former Albuquerque city councilman, who won
33 percent of the vote, and John V. Wertheim, the party's nominee
four years ago, who had 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Skeen and Wilson ran unopposed, but not so New Mexico's
other incumbent, Rep. Thomas Udall, a freshman Democrat who soundly
defeated Francesca Lobato, a tax lawyer from Santa Fe, with 83
percent of the balloting. Udall will face Lisa Lutz, a state
lawmaker, who ran unopposed to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican U.S. Senate primary, Bill Redmond, a former
congressman, breezed in a three-way race, with 60 percent of the
vote, to oppose Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat seeking his fourth term.
Two state lawmakers trailed, Steve Pearce with 22 percent and
William F. Davis, 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, Curt Hohn, general manager of the state's Water
Development Association, beat two other Democrats to oppose Rep.
John Thune, a two-term Republican who was expected to win in
November no matter who prevailed among the Democrats. With the
turnout extremely light, Hohn won 56 percent of the vote to 36
percent for Steve Sandven, a lawyer, and 7 percent for Raymond
Osloond, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Each party had two primaries in Iowa. In the 1st District,
Democrats elected Bob Simpson over Gregory Guy, by a margin of
almost 2-to-1, although Simpson is given only a slim chance against
Rep. Jim Leach, the 12-term Republican incumbent. In the 3rd, Jay
Marcus narrowly defeated Phil Ferren to oppose Iowa's only
Democratic House member, Leonard Boswell, who is seeking a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties held primaries in the 5th District. Mike Palecek
defeated Conrad Lawlor for the Democratic nomination, and Rep. Tom
Latham, who is seeking a fourth term, easily turned back Thomas
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the lone Alabama contest, Rep. Earl Hilliard, a four-term
Democrat from a solidly Democratic district, the 7th, won 58
percent of the vote to defeat two challengers, Arthur Davis and
Wayne Sowell. Ed Martin won the 7th District Republican nomination,
defeating Milton Bethune in a primary than drew less than a tenth
of the voters who cast ballots for Democrats.

LAKERS DEFEAT PACERS IN GAME 1, 104-87 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Being a former prime-time player himself, Larry
Bird decided before Game 1 that stopping Shaquille O'Neal was
useless. Bird, the coach of the Indiana Pacers, would concede
points to O'Neal, the game's most awesome physical presence, and
make the other Los Angeles Lakers beat his team _a strategy
employed often against Michael Jordan in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal's every unmolested spin toward the baseline, with
each soft hook and forceful dunk, Bird had to know: it did not work
then in the National Basketball Association finals and it does not
work now.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the league's reigning most valuable player, nearly
swallowed the Pacers whole on Wednesday night, powering the Lakers
to a 104-87 victory before nearly 20,000 people at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 1-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game finals, the
Lakers are host to Game 2 on Friday night, at which time Bird and
the Pacers may have to re-evaluate their game plan. Feasting on
single coverage for much of the evening on Wednesday night, O'Neal
did not take a rest until 1 minute 32 seconds remained in the first
half, leaving the floor with 21 points and a 15-point Laker lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana threatened several times _ once cutting to 71-69 with
less than two minutes remaining in the third quarter _ before the
Lakers buried them in the fourth, outscoring them by 27-16. Neither
Reggie Miller nor his teammates ever gave the impression that they
wanted the Lakers to be anything but huge favorites on their home
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not score until 8:19 remained in the third quarter,
and finished with 7 points on 1-of-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers with 43 points on 21-of-31 shooting, 19
rebounds and 4 assists in 44 minutes. Kobe Bryant was next, with 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pacers, Mark Jackson (18 points), Austin Croshere (16)
and Rik Smits and Jalen Rose (12 apiece) were the leading scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Except at the end of the third quarter, when the Pacers found
some life, O'Neal dominated. Backing in against Smits or simply
jumping over the Indiana front line, he could not be defended.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Ron Harper played nice supporting roles, giving the
Lakers 16 points and 8 assists combined by halftime. The Lakers
went to the locker room with a 55-43 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The first act of the coronation was going swell for Coach Phil
Jackson, most of his team's parts functioning well enough to keep
Indiana a double-digit lead away.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Lakers have done throughout the playoffs, they lost
their focus on offense and hung their heads on defense as the third
quarter wore on. A lead of 67-52 began dissipating and nearly was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   With Miller struggling badly, Jackson started penetrating as if
he was directing traffic at St. John's in the 1980s. Breaking
Bryant down on defense by backing in with a high power dribble or
merely waiting for his teammates to come open on a staggered fast
break, Jackson brought the Pacers back.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-4 binge featured 8 points by Jackson. In all, he had 10
points in the quarter and 3 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's knifing reverse layup with less than two minutes left
in the quarter cut Los Angeles's margin to 71-69 _ a development
that quieted the crowd and raised all the old lack-of-desire issues
on the Laker bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that O'Neal and Bryant made sure they finished the
task. Bryant sandwiched two hanging, pull-up jump shots between the
defining block of the game by O'Neal to give the Lakers a 75-69
lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, trying hard to get on track offensively, seemed to have
a lane on the left wing. He began dribbling in when he was
startlingly met by a leaping O'Neal. Lofting his shot high enough
to clear the painted square above the rim, Miller felt confident
that the shot would escape O'Neal's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   It did not. As the ball approached its apex, O'Neal sent it back
to the floor, the sequence sending his towel-waving teammates and
the fans into an uproarious state.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was not done. Finding open teammates cutting to the
basket or kicking out to whoever was standing alone on the
perimeter. With less than five minutes left, he had as many points
in the quarter (8) as the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had said before the series that the Pacers were decided
underdogs. ``They've got a lot of Goliaths and we have a lot of
Davids,'' he said. ``We also brought a lot of slingshots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller forgot his weapons, returning to the player who made
3 of 18 shots in Game6 of the Eastern Conference finals last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to his native Los Angeles for the first time in the
playoffs, he had one of his most forgettable performances in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Each time he went to the basket, he was swarmed by
purple-and-gold jerseys. With less than four minutes left, he
appeared to have another open lane on the right side of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   But in a blink, the Lakers converged and he threw up an
awful-looking, off-balance left-handed layup that made him 1 for 16
for the night. He had 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the other end, Brian Shaw caught O'Neal spinning
toward the rim out of the corner of his eye. He lobbed the ball,
and O'Neal caught it and dunked.
</P>
<P>
   As the final minutes wound down, Bird and the Pacers had yet
another difficult question to answer. How to stop O'Neal, of
course, is important. But here is another one: How to start

EARTHLY LIFE POSSIBLY BORN IN UNDERSEA INFERNO  &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
An Australian researcher probing the rocks of ancient deep-sea
volcanoes reported Wednesday that he has discovered the fossilized
remains of threadlike microbes that lived more than 3 billion years
ago.
<P>
   The discovery led other scientists to speculate that underwater
volcanoes might have been the birthplace of earthly life itself _ a
highly controversial theory first espoused by an American
oceanographer more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the deep-sea ``hydrothermal vents'' cradled life
emerging for the first time, the discovery does show that some of
the most primitive early life forms could have thrived amid the
viciously hot, sunless darkness of erupting matter _ and not only
on Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery is being reported Thursday in the journal
Nature by Birger Rasmussen, a research fellow in geology and
geophysics at the University of Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In an informal account that Rasmussen e-mailed to The Chronicle
Wednesday, he wrote: ``Rather than a warm little pond, the cradle
of life may have been a sulfurous, subterranean inferno, not unlike
a medieval version of hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery opens up new possibilities in the search for
ancient life on Earth, and can be applied to strategies for finding
primitive life elsewhere in the solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen's conclusions drew criticism, however, from several
space scientists, including Kevin Zahnle, an astronomer at NASA's
Astrobiology Institute at the Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, where scientists study the ingredients for life both on Earth
and on distant planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing at all that suggests this find has anything to
do with the origin of life, although it is likely to be the oldest
truly believable evidence for early life on the earth,'' Zahnle
said.
</P>
<P>
   To most scientists, the essential ingredients for life as we
know it would include sunlight as an energy source for
photosynthesis and a plentiful supply of complex organic compounds
that could evolve into living organisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could look around the solar system,'' Zahnle said, ``and
you'd find plenty of good candidates for the evolution of life _
like Titan, the moon of Saturn, for example, or Callisto or Europa,
two of Jupiter's moons.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest known life forms discovered so far include rock-like
clumps of fossilized blue-green algae, known as cyanobacteria,
found in ancient ocean sediments, which have been dated to 3.7
billion years ago. But they required sunlight to power
photosynthesis, and most scientists believe that on Earth, at
least, sunlight was essential for life to originate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is John B. Corliss, a former oceanographer at
Oregon State University who in 1977 was a lead scientist aboard an
expedition diving to a deep-sea volcanic vent off the Galapagos
Islands. That voyage brought back an astonishing and unexpected
trove of strange and unknown creatures and bacteria thriving in the
vent's boiling hot water. Two years later, he first proposed that
many such volcanic vents in the seas of the early Earth could have
been sites where life _ perhaps nourished by sulfides _ first
evolved from organic compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss' hypothesis was widely derided when he proposed it at a
meeting in San Francisco in 1980, but he continues to argue for his
thesis and elaborate on it. Now a director of the Systems
Laboratory at the Central European University in Budapest, Hungary,
Corliss called the Rasmussen account ``an exciting and beautiful
paper _ my vision turned into reality'' when he was informed of it
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen's report described how he found the ``fossil remains
of thread-like organisms'' in a massive sulfide deposit that
apparently once formed part of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent where
searing hot water erupted from the vent's chimney at a temperature
of 650 degrees Fahrenheit. The twisted tangle of microbes,
Rasmussen said, must have been alive some 3.235 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The region Rasmussen explored is known as the Pilbara Craton of
southwestern Australia, and it is known for the antiquity of many
of its rocks that once lay thousands of feet below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, twisting skeins of thread-like formations that
Rasmussen believes are the fossils of primitive microbes are only a
thousandth of a millimeter in diameter and three-tenths of a
millimeter long, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is probable, Rasmussen said, that submarine volcanic vents,
heated by semi-molten magma deep in the Earth's crust, were
abundant billions of years ago. ``It is possible that bacterial
communities flourished in similar settings long before these
findings would suggest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep beneath the ocean, hot springs would have been attractive
habitats for primitive microbes, protected from the effects of
early planetary bombardments, and bathed in a rich brew of metals
and (chemical) nutrients. Such environments could have provided a
safe setting for life hundreds of millions of years before the
Earth's surface was habitable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The undersea volcanoes, however, would have been a far cry from
the ``warm ponds'' and ``primordial soups'' that many evolutionary
biologists have considered as the most hospitable locales for life
to emerge. There, increasingly complex organic molecules might have
combined, learned to reproduce with the aid of primitive genetic
material, and finally built membranes around themselves to become
the first true harbingers of earthly life.
</P>
<P>
   Earth's earliest days are known as the Archaean, and in a
commentary on Rasmussen's paper in Thursday's Nature, Euan Nisbet,
a geologist at the University of London, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, then, the earliest Archaean life was confined to the
vicinity of hydrothermal systems.'' But he adds: ``Here we are deep
into guesswork, however ... we still know little about the far edge
of the world of life _ where did it come from?'' &LR;

YANKEES BEAT EXPOS, 7-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ With his peripheral vision, Carl Pavano could see
Yankees scurrying from corner to corner, but he could not catch
them. The bases were infested with base-stealers, and the Montreal
pitcher tried, stepping off the pitching rubber and threatening
them. Sometimes he just held the ball and hoped they'd stop.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Yankees kept running on Wednesday night,
swiping five bases and changing the basic dynamic of this game
early, then going on to win, 7-2. After his team's six-run rally in
the fifth inning, Orlando Hernandez breezed to his sixth victory,
allowing four hits and three walks in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won four of six games on this road trip, playing the
Atlanta Braves and the Expos. Over their last eight games, they are
batting .317 with 32 extra-base hits, and averaging 6.1 runs a
game. They will begin a three-game series against the New York Mets
at Yankee Stadium Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As spring training began, Manager Joe Torre met with his new
first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, and pushed him to push the Yankees'
base runners, who were somewhat lax in 1999, sometimes failing to
recognize opportunities to run. Mazzilli had played for Torre with
the Mets and was adept at stealing bases. ``Give them your mind and
their bodies,'' Torre told Mazzilli.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have run more this year, though with mixed results
in late April and into early May; after 34 games, the Yankees had
21 steals, but had been thrown out 16 times. But in the last 21
games, it's as if they've become mind readers, swiping 24 bases in
26 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees knew about Pavano was that he could be slow in
his delivery to home plate _ 1.3 seconds at his quickest. Ricky
Ledee led off the game with a single, took a lead. Mazzilli carries
a stopwatch and times pitchers, and Pavano was registering 1.5 or
1.6 seconds. Pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it took a while for me to get to the plate tonight,''
Pavano said later. ``I got the impression the last couple of starts
that guys are really starting to run on my delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way Pavano could have been rescued from the fate he
invited was if he had been paired with a strong-armed catcher. But
Charlie O'Brien turned 40 last month and is closing in on the end
of his career. As respected as he is for his ability to handle
pitchers, age has drained his arm strength and weakened his throws.
It was a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger reached first leading off the third inning when
Pavano grazed his left hand with a fastball. El Duque batted in an
obvious bunt situation. Lee Stevens, the Montreal first baseman,
charged on the third pitch _ the Yankees were playing hit-and-run _
and Bellinger broke for second.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien caught a fastball high and outside, a perfect pitch for
a throw to second, but the Montreal catcher bounced the ball 20
feet short of second base. Bellinger had gotten a huge jump, but
O'Brien's poor throw was an open invitation for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run,'' Derek Jeter said. ``We may not have the
fastest guys, but we're capable of stealing bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee singled with two out to score Bellinger, before Ledee
swiped second. Bernie Williams singled and stole second in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Montreal led by 2-1 after four innings, and with one out in
the fifth, Ledee chopped a routine grounder to shortstop, where
Geoff Blum fielded cleanly, set himself and threw high and wide, an
error. On the first pitch to Jeter, Ledee was running, and Jeter
grounded a single between the middle infielders as Ledee motored
into third.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch to Paul O'Neill, Jeter was running, and
O'Neill smashed a single to left-center; Ledee scored, Jeter
trotted into third.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano kept throwing to first base, trying to hold the runners,
but so long as he delivered the ball so deliberately, there was
nothing he could do; the Yankees were on the move. O'Neill swiped
second, and he and Jeter scored when Williams singled to center.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano could have been out of the inning, but Tino Martinez
drove the ball against the fence in left-center, a triple,
Martinez's fourth of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Manager Felipe Alou ambled out of the dugout, calling
for Mike Johnson, and when Jorge Posada smashed Johnson's second
pitch for a two-run homer, the Yankees led, 7-2, having scored six
runs with six batters, aided by Mazzilli's mind and their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the way we played tonight,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alou said: ``They probably could've stolen 10 bases tonight.''

SCIOSCIA STICKS UP FOR AL WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The American League West hasn't been mistaken lately
for, say, a black-and-blue division. Some go so far as to say it's
the weakest of the major leagues' divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy it,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said before
Wednesday night's interleague game against San Francisco at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, the AL West is one of the best divisions around.
Look at Texas, at Seattle, at us .. those are some pretty good
offensive clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division can swing the bats with anyone in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia wasn't merely plugging for votes as commissioner of the
AL West, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the records,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. It's the only division in which every club in it is over
.500.
</P>
<P>
   RECHARGING: Tim Salmon on Tuesday was the Angels' designated
hitter for a second successive night and for the third time in four
games, instead of taking his customary place in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving him of a couple of days off to recharge,''
Scioscia explained. ``We want to make sure he's ready when we play
at Arizona (this weekend) and we won't have the DH. Plus, he fouled
a ball off his right shin the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF THE DH ...: Like anyone who spent his entire playing
career in the National League, as Scioscia did (he was with Texas
one year but never played because of injuries), the mere thought of
the DH is, well, (ital) ugh! (endital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around the DH for the first time, I can see there are a
lot more offensive strategies than I thought there were,'' Scioscia
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he went on, ``I definitely prefer the National League
style of play which lets the pitchers hit.''
</P>
<P>
   PITCHERS HITTING: With interleague play moving into an NL park
this weekend in Arizona, indeed, the Angels' pitchers will have to
take their turn at the plate, some for the first time in the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For the past couple of weeks, the pitchers have been appearing
regularly in the batting cage at Edison Field in preparation,
mostly working on bunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a lot,'' Scioscia said, ``but I don't expect
injuries, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Angels pitchers were 4 for 21 (.190), including three
doubles and seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   DUSTY ON HOOPS: Dusty Baker, the Giants' manager, said he's
pulling for the Lakers in the NBA finals, which is understandable,
of course, since he grew up in Riverside and played nine years with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know Larry Bird,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Really? How's that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him in Cincinnati, when I was with the Dodgers,'' Baker
said. ``Tommy John, who was from Indiana, brought him into the
clubhouse one day ... like he was trying to recruit him to Indiana
State.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Bird, indeed. &QL; 
STILL A DIRTBAG: Angels second baseman Adam Kennedy said his
brother, Long Beach State catcher Brian Kennedy, will be playing
with the Dirtbags again in 2001, his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about whether he should stay in school or sign
(professionally),'' Adam said. ``He figured if he wasn't drafted in
the first 10 rounds he was going to go back (to Long Beach
State).''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the younger Kennedy wasn't drafted at all.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: The Giants' Barry Bonds is off the best homer
pace of his career. His home run in Tuesday night's game was his
25th, the most in the majors and also the most homers he's hit
prior to the All-Star break. His previous pre-All-Star break high
was 24 in 1993, one of his three MVP seasons. ... In the fifth
inning, Angels center fielder Garret Anderson grounded into a
double play for the 13th time this season. That tied him for the
major league lead in the dubious category. ... The Giants are in
the midst of a 24-game run exclusively within California (three in
Anaheim, three in Oakland and 18 at home). ... The Angels are idle
tonight, then begin a nine-game trip Friday night in Arizona.
They'll draw the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson Friday night. &QL;

HOLLYWOOD HISTORY UP FOR AUCTION

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Quick, you're being chased by a
charging buffalo. Do you: a) call for help on Maxwell Smart's
umbrella phone; b) jump on a plastic horse and try to outrun him;
or c) take aim with the Red Ryder BB-gun Peter Billingsley longed
for in ``A Christmas Story''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'd like to sit back to ponder the question in Grandpa
Munster's electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the oddest close-out sales in history, Ellis Props is
unloading all of its stock - nearly a million fake grenades, rubber
steaks and other items used in TV and film production will be
auctioned off over five days at the Universal City Hilton and on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a sense of Hollywood history and a letter of credit
can join in the bidding on Ellis' 92-year collection, including the
fake bison on casters used in early Western pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've struggled for 30 years to create a Hollywood Museum,
and one is going up for auction today,'' said Keith Burns, a pop
culture expert brought in by the current owners, Dan Pearlman and
Robert Wolf, to place value on items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's poetic that it's the auctioneer's gavel that will sound
off the end of an era.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even the Ellis name will be going up for bid, Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its opening by Ellis Zamansky in 1908, the facility and
its adjacent graphics house have gone through the hands of a few
different owners, one of which apparently allowed the destruction
of many of the records that would identify which items were used in
which films.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgic buyers could end up purchasing items for considerably
less than they would sell for if they were properly titled, Burns
said. Still, just the chance at owning something that could have
been worn by Marilyn Monroe or shot by John Wayne is expected to
draw plenty of bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Those expected to participate in the bidding include major
studios seeking to decorate their theme parks, productions
companies, collectors, professional dealers and representatives
from other prop houses, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   The auction will mark one of many sad moments in Hollywood's
history, Burns said, adding that during the past 30 years, he has
been appalled at the indifference to Hollywood's history.
</P>
<P>
   James Comisar, who boasts he has one of the world's largest
collection of television's artifacts, browsed the facility shaking
his head as he thought about all of the artifacts that have made
their way to landfills throughout the years. ``It's horrific how
these things end up in the garbage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In modern high-tech and special-effects driven films, there is
little use for Gatling guns or ``Star Trek'' space log books.
</P>
<P>
   But to fans, these auction items are still in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people shuffled through the Ellis La Brea Avenue
facility Wednesday afternoon, getting a first-hand look at what
will be auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Another prop house owner, who asked not to be identified, said
he has seemed to run into the same problem as the owners of the
Ellis facility: most items either run at once or just sit there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs us too much to just let it sit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Santa Clarita resident Susan Zatarain, 45, searched for movie
posters amid the vintage televisions and parking meters, she
surmised that this auction would be especially worthwhile for
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this auction will be huge,'' she said. ``You'll
literally be paying pennies on the dollar for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction will take place between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. beginning
today and ending Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders can either go to the hotel or visit livebid.amazon.com
on the Internet. Photos of the items will be presented at the hotel
and on the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Indiana Pacers' worst fears became a stark
reality last night at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers came out timid, fell into a 17-point hole in the
first period and had no answer for a major Shaq Attack as the Los
Angeles Lakers captured Game 1 of the NBA Finals, 104-87.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-seven series will be here at 8 p.m.
tomorrow before the series shifts to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off a heated seven-game series against Portland, the
Lakers pounced on the Pacers early. Shaquille O'Neal muscled in 43
points, collected 19 rebounds and blocked three shots as the Lakers
sifted through the porous Pacers defense almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's imposing presence, combined with an unusual
disappearing act by Pacers guard Reggie Miller, left Indiana in the
Lakers' dust. Miller, a Southern California native and UCLA
product, had one of his worst NBA games ever as he scored just
seven points on 1-of-16 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 21-of-31 from the field and overpowered a Pacers
squad that too often used single-coverage against the league's Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got the ball in deep positions and was making the quick
move and making high percentage shots,'' O'Neal said. ``Those shots
were falling. If a lot of those shots keep falling, we're going to
be a hard team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 51.1 percent from the field and outrebounded
Indiana, 48-36, in what Lakers coach Phil Jackson called ``a
feeling-out game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought neither team played exceptional good basketball,''
Jackson said. ``We rode Shaq's coattails tonight for that victory,
and we'll be prepared for a better game \Rtomorrow\S night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period of time where we were winded and they took
advantage of it and made it difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   If winning by 17 is difficult, then the Pacers are truly in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, in his first NBA Finals, remains confident despite his
rough outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put the ball in the basket,'' Miller said. ``But if
they continue to give me those looks they're going to be in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to continue to attack the basket. It was just one of
those off-nights, and Friday will be an on night.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird defended Miller's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a guy in his first Finals, after he
carried us in the playoffs, to go out and struggle,'' Bird said.
``He had one bad shooting night. There's no one giving up on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give up on Reggie Miller because he's too valuable to
this team. The next game I hope he takes another 17-20 shots,
because that's what he is; he's a shooter and a scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added 14 points for the Lakers, Ron Harper tallied
12 and Rick Fox 11. Mark Jackson paced the Pacers with 18 points,
Austin Croshere scored 16 and Jalen Rose and Rik Smith each scored
12.
</P>
<P>
   A nifty reverse layup by Jackson moved the Pacers within 71-69
late in the third period. But even then it was as if the Lakers
were toying with the Pacers as they went on a 25-10 run and a 96-79
lead with 4:02 left.
</P>
<P>

L.A NATIVE CROSHERE OUTPLAYS L.A. NATIVE MILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Well, at least one native Southern Californian _
playing in his first NBA Finals, eager to contribute but without
the pressure to lead his team _ had a memorable game.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Reggie Miller would be the one, but it was Santa
Monica native Austin Croshere, the 6-foot-10 standout from
Crossroads High, who stood out in Game 1 for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On a night Miller couldn't buy a basket (1-for-16 shooting),
Croshere scored 16 points off the bench (nine more than Miller) in
26 minutes and was the second highest scorer of any Pacer.
</P>
<P>
   He was the team-high scorer for most of the game until Mark
Jackson scored his 18th point late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   His six rebounds were second only to Dale Davis' eight in the
final Pacer stats.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on a night the team shot 42 percent from the field,
Croshere made 6 of 7 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the primary scoring option,'' he said, ``so I'm not
double-teamed.''
</P>
<P>
   He often had his way around the court, especially when Robert
Horry guarded him. He had a team-high 11 first-half points in just
14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere said he simply was taking advantage of the
opportunities the game presented, but he always has the potential
to score, especially in Game 1s.
</P>
<P>
   Against Philadelphia in the conference semifinals, he scored 11
points, grabbed 11 rebounds and added a season-high five assists.
</P>
<P>
   Against New York in the conference finals, he scored a playoff
career-high 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a double-double in the third game of the
Milwaukee series (11 points, 10 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things get overlooked in a game like this,'' teammate
Jalen Rose said. ``He led us in scoring in Game 1 of the last
series, so it's no surprise he can go out and score 16 points.''
</P>
<P>
   While the attention fell on Miller, the UCLA and Riverside star,
Croshere arrived in Los Angeles with his teammates amid no fanfare,
which he said helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last two days, I've been around family,'' he said,
``and haven't had time to think about the magnitude of the game,
the NBA Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams leave him alone in first games, then make adjustments.
Against New York, Croshere had five points. But against
Philadelphia, he scored 20 and put in 16 against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Which Croshere will show up in Friday's Game 2? He isn't sure,
but he hopes his performance Wednesday drew notices from the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make adjustments to stop me, that's going to make
other people a whole lot more open,'' he said. ``Obviously, I'd
like to remain a scoring threat, but we need more offense from
others.'' &QL;

RANDALL CUNNINGHAM, COWBOYS AGREE IN PRINCIPLE ON CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Free-agent quarterback Randall Cunningham has
agreed in principle with the Cowboys on a contract believed to be
worth close to $1 million in base salary and signing bonus for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, reportedly three years in length but possibly as
short as one year because of salary-cap reasons, includes a heavy
incentive package, said Cunningham, who will be Troy Aikman's
37-year-old backup with 130 NFL career starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I want to be in Dallas. It's very, very close to
getting done ... I just haven't signed anything yet,'' Cunningham
said by phone from Las Vegas last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon I get home \RHenderson, Nev.\S, I'm going to read the
contract over carefully and all the salary-cap stuff. If it's what
I think it is, I'll sign it. And I want it to be what I think it
is.'' Cunningham does not have an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones, Cowboys vice president//player personnel, has
been dealing with Cunningham. Jones didn't want to comment
yesterday, indicating that the team was waiting to hear from
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who was released by the Minnesota Vikings on Friday,
just 18 months after being the NFL's top-rated passer (1998), also
has had discussions with Detroit and Tampa Bay. The Bucs made him
an offer.
</P>
<P>
   His admiration for the Cowboys begins with owner Jerry Jones,
who impressed Cunningham with his desire to win another Super Bowl,
and his longtime respect for Aikman, a rival since 1989 when Aikman
broke into the NFL while Cunningham was at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of these guys who goes in and tries to take Troy's
job. I'm not one of these guys who's going to stir up things,''
Cunningham said. ``In Dallas, I know I can go into a camp, receive
the plays and have time to study them. My prayers are that Troy
stays healthy all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay appeared to be the favorite before the Cowboys entered
the bidding Saturday, when Jones and several Cowboys coaches met
Cunningham in Las Vegas during a three-day retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Jones has been very consistent with his words,''
Cunningham said. ``It's basically, `Hey, Randall, we want you.'
That's the bottom line. I want to be where I'm wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's backup is Paul Justin, 31, who previously played in
Indianapolis, Cincinnati and St. Louis. If Cunningham signs, Justin
may be in a fight for his job, or he could be kept as the No. 3
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   When Cunningham declined to take a $3 million cut in pay for
2000 on a five-year, $28-million contract that he signed with the
Vikings in December 1998, he was released. He collected a $1
million roster bonus on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the money because God is going to give
me what he believes I should have,'' Cunningham said. ``I just want
to be on the right team, with the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has been something of a Cowboys killer over the
years, 8-4 lifetime in games against Dallas. Overall, he's 79-50-1
in 14 NFL seasons, plus 3-6 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, favored to win the NFC East for a second year in a
row because of owner Daniel Snyder's aggressive off-season
spending, improved their quarterback depth by acquiring Jeff George
(who beat out Cunningham after 61/2 games last season at Minnesota)
to be Brad Johnson's backup. Jones could argue that
Aikman-Cunningham is a counter punch with clout. nn

SHAQ FINALLY HAS WIDE-OPEN SPACES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was like exiting a crowded freeway in Los
Angeles onto a wide-open dirt road in rural Indiana. Finally,
Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers could breathe again.
</P>
<P>
   Caged and locked down against the tall, fast, athletic Portland
Trail Blazers during the Western Conference finals, O'Neal was free
to roam in the Lakers' 104-87 victory over the Indiana Pacers
Wednesday in Game 1 of the NBA Finals at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the heavy leans of 7-foot-2 Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis and the help defense of long-armed defenders Rasheed
Wallace, Scottie Pippen and Brian Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Portland swarmed and harassed O'Neal, controlling him for long
stretches and forcing other Lakers to step up.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, not nearly as deep, quick or big, defended O'Neal
straight up with slow-footed, 7-foot-4 Rik Smits, then sent token
help from their guards and forwards. O'Neal's response? 43 points,
19 rebounds, three blocked shots and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got the ball in deep position and made a quick moves,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal attempted 31 shots Wednesday, making 21. He shot
!ital!nine!off! times Sunday against Portland in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a one-man show out there tonight,'' Pacers coach
Larry Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Portland, Indiana's double teams were passive,
allowing Shaq enough space to catch the ball easily, then punish
Indiana inside. The Pacers don't have enough bodies or athletic
ability to defend O'Neal the way Portland did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do a better job on Shaquille,'' Reggie Miller
said. ``We know he's going to get his looks, but when he's getting
his looks like that, a lot of them are too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were more aggressive in the third quarter after Smits
left the game with his fifth foul. Out of necessity, they started
crowding Shaq with two and three defenders when he caught the ball,
inviting him to find open teammates on the perimeter rather then
shoot over three bodies.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gamble, though. Indiana doesn't have the quickness to
double team then race back to close out shooters on kickbacks. As a
result, the Lakers were consistently getting open looks.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for a while. The Lakers went cold late in the third
and the Pacers responded with a 13-2 run to cut the lead to 75-71.
But in the fourth, L.A. made an adjustment, running players to the
basket rather than having them stand on the perimeter. O'Neal was
able to find them for easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing he started doing was hitting cutters coming in
and we weren't picking up guys,'' Bird said. &QL;

   AFGHANISTAN-DROUGHT (Nalgham, Afghanistan) _ Most often, drought
is a mere annoyance to the Kuchis of the Registan Desert, for these
nomads can find water where others cannot. They herd their sheep
and camels over great distances, resettling in an oasis. Or they
dig wells by hand, divining an aquifer and burrowing into the
hidden moistness as deep as 50 yards down. But rainfall has been a
rare visitor to Afghanistan for three years running, and even the
best of the desert dwellers have been humbled. The Kuchis of the
Registan have fled north only to find that the snow-melt from the
mountains has failed to refresh the rivers below. Their customary
refuges have become a broken thread of narrow, vanishing ponds. By

KOBE'S QUIET NIGHT OK BY HIM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reggie Miller might have been nearly invisible
because of his atrocious shooting Wednesday night, but Kobe
Bryant's low profile in Game 1 of the NBA Finals was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored a quiet 14 points in the Lakers' 104-87 victory
over the Indiana Pacers before 18,997 at Staples Center, but he
didn't mind being away from the spotlight, at least for one game.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal (43 points) nearly scoring at will against
the Pacers, Bryant saw little reason to try to disrupt the game
plan of constantly feeding the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's feeling it, you have to get him the ball,'' Bryant
said of O'Neal, who took 31 shots. ``Tonight I told him in the
locker room, `Thanks for the night off, Chief. Go get some rest.'
There are some nights when I was feeling it. It's great to roll
with the punches.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bryant and O'Neal didn't always so easily co-exist.
This season, Bryant's willingness to relinquish scoring in favor of
team success might explain why the Lakers have reached the NBA
Finals for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Kobe's) done that all season for us,'' Lakers guard
Derek Fisher said. ``Those guys respect each other's abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could have limited Bryant was foul trouble.
He had two fouls in the first half, then picked up two more in the
third quarter while trying to guard Indiana point guard Mark
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the fouls more on himself than anything the Pacers
were trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first foul was just my fault overplaying Mark Jackson,''
Bryant said. ``A couple other fouls were my fault as well. I don't
think they're doing anything in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored only seven more points than the struggling Miller,
but he came up huge when the Lakers needed a boost in the third
quarter. The Pacers had made up a 15-point deficit in the period,
cutting the lead to 71-69 with 1:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Bryant went to work. He hit a six-foot runner to
give the Lakers a 73-69 lead, then came back with a 13-foot running
jumper to increase the advantage to six points. It helped deflate
Indiana's momentum and restored the Lakers' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Bryant said. ``They got within two points and
the crowd started picking up and the intensity started picking up,
the pressure started building up.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was back into the shadows. He attempted just one
shot in the fourth quarter, and missed. HIs restraint was
remarkable. He even was caught in the game's final 2 minutes with
the ball in his hands as the shot clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that's almost never happened before for a
gunner like Bryant, but he's concentrating on team success at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're three games away from a championship and that's our
ultimate goal,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Pacers are probably going to pack their defense
inside against O'Neal and open up the perimeter in Game 2. It's a
trend that has occurred in the Lakers' previous playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make adjustments and I'm sure they'll concentrate
on Shaq,'' Fisher said. ``We have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bryant isn't forcing anything, while making
sure he soaks up the atmosphere of playing in his first career
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun looking up and seeing the banners. Seeing
(the words) NBA Finals on them, and on our jerseys,'' Bryant said.
``Normally, we're watching on TV and now we're playing in them.'' &QL;

LAKERS TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lest anybody doubted it, Game 1 of the NBA Finals
offered incontrovertible proof that the Lakers are a reflection of
their home. We're not talking about Hollywood and its
pretentiousness, Venice and its capriciousness, Beverly Hills and
its garishness, Malibu and its stubborn individualism, or South
Central and its unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The current object of greater L.A.'s magnificent obsession
looked like a team that belongs in an arena named for an
office-supply superstore. The Lakers' 104-87 victory over the
Indiana Pacers was so businesslike, the players might as well have
dispensed with their sweats and donned dress suits on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal produced points with all the efficiency of a
Xerox machine spitting out collated copies, collecting 43 points in
44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, with a little help from his teammates, reduced
Reggie Miller's scoring line until it was too small to matter.
Miller missed 15 of his 16 shots from the field on the way to seven
points, 17 less than his postseason average.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers stapled the Pacers to the floor, outrebounding them
under their own basket 24-3 over the final three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   From Derek Fisher's defense on Travis Best to Rick Fox's 11
points off the bench, everybody did his part to methodically
dismantle the Pacers. It was as precise a performance as the Lakers
have mustered in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went about business the way we haven't in a long time,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers came out incredibly clear-headed for a team that
could have been forgiven for being a step slow and a little
unsteady after three days of drinking in their success in Game 7 of
the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing the flashy plays for the fundamentally sound ones, the
Lakers left it to the likes of actress Salma Hayek, who came to the
Staples Center with her black hair dyed purple, to provide most of
the color.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Lakers maintained a collective demeanor that
was very monochromatic, in sharp contrast to the kaleidoscope of
emotions they showed in their victory over Portland Sunday that
secured their spot in this best-of-seven championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Their stolid expressions sent a message to the Pacers; namely
that the Lakers are not content merely to be here in these Finals.
They played as though they have unfinished business to attend to;
namely, bringing to Los Angeles the NBA title the city has been
lustily eyeing since Phil Jackson was hired as the head coach last
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling the guys for two days, we haven't done
anything yet,'' Harper said. ``All we did was get the spot we
should be at. Don't believe the hype, I told them, and go out there
and play basketball. It was good to see everybody come in and have
their heads on straight.''
</P>
<P>
   So determined were the Lakers to treat their first NBA
championship game in nine years as though it were just another day
at the office, Robert Horry shooed a television cameraman out of
the way after pregame introductions so he could spring to the rim
and hang on for good luck, per his custom.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers would prove just as accommodating as that cameraman,
clearing out from under the basket so the Lakers could score 32
points in the paint in the first half _ 64 for the night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal methodically set up his office in the low post and went
to work on Rik Smits and, when Smits repaired to the bench to
rearrange his ribs, Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-year center had 15 points after 12 minutes to set an
Indy 500-like pace. It was dizzying, really, to see O'Neal run laps
around Indiana, which stubbornly stuck to single-teaming him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq set the tone in the first quarter,'' Fox said. ``They
seem not to be very concerned about stopping Shaq. I hope that
remains the case. When he's able to get off to that kind of start,
his energy level goes up and he gets even more confident and he
starts to make plays for the others around him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Lakers looked as consolidated as the greater L.A.
metropolis is scattered. It's a breathtaking sign and we're not
talking about the block letters in the hills above Hollywood. &QL;

PACERS' MILLER VANISHES IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Swashbuckling into the NBA Finals in his old
hometown, Reggie Miller was his usual bashful self:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming in here to shock the world,'' the Indiana star
said before the series, apparently not anticipating that he would
accomplish the feat all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing so abruptly his last name could have been Dotcomstock,
Miller missed 15 of 16 field goal attempts in Game 1, shocking
those who thought Miller's preseries rhetoric was serious.
</P>
<P>
   The best way the Pacers could shock the world would have been to
do the right thing _ abdicate their position to the Portland Trail
Blazers. Making the Finals a best-of-14 between the Lakers and
Blazers ... now that would be not only a shock, but a delight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with apologies to the catchy-name skills of Shaquille
O'Neal, the Lakers-Pacers matchup Wednesday night at Staples Center
felt like The Big Anti-climax.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, unfortunately, are still so occupied peeling their
hands from their own throats that they are unavailable to accept
any invitations this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pity. The Pacers looked so overmatched Wednesday in the 104-87
defeat, particularly in view of the fact that the Lakers played,
for them, somewhat tepidly, that the remainder of this series would
be justified in avoiding release to movie houses and going straight
to video.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for those committed to seeing this thing through,
the Lakers have left enough evidence this postseason _ two losses
to Sacramento, three to Portland _ that nothing can be assumed of
them. Particularly in view of the fact that Miller can't possibly
be as bad as he was Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His driving one-hander halfway through the third period saved
him from replacing Seattle's Dennis Johnson in the Finals Hall of
Shame. In Game 7 of the 1978 Finals against Washington, Johnson
went 0-14.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Johnson had the summer. Miller at least has
Game 2 Friday, and he was already playing that game in the press
briefing, as if Game 1 didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   If the point was legitimate, that would give him eight for
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they continue to give me looks like that, they'll be in
trouble,'' he said defiantly. ``All my shots felt good. If they
play me like that, it's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   True to his reputation as a shooter without conscience, Miller
was unfazed by the fact that he was the biggest flop in this town
since ``Howard the Duck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad I got up only 16 shots,'' he said. ``I feel I
should have gotten 25 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Given LA's historic problems with random, reckless shooting, the
threat deserves at least a police inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to Miller's newness in the environment _ after years of
chronic bridesmaid-ism, Wednesday night was the Pacers' first
appearance at the altar of the Finals _ his coach was willing to
offer slack to his star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a guy in his first Finals to go out and
struggle a little bit,'' said Larry Bird. ``He's carried us a long
way. He'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was resolved enough to deliver a minor shot to the
Lakers: ``The (Lakers defense) wasn't physical at all. Compared to
our last two series, this was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers really didn't have to pound on the Pacers, who were
executing a self-thrashing that had a certain Blazers quality about
it. Absent the caliber of athletes found on the Blazers, the Pacers
decided to skip double-teaming O'Neal, which Wednesday night was a
bad idea that ranked with thatch roofs in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The large gentleman did a fair impression of the Romans as they
marched through Germania in ``Gladiator'' _ 43 points, 19 rebounds,
three blocks and a big hand in fouling out the Pacers center, Rik
Smits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so big, so powerful, he jumps so high ... he just
overpowered us,'' Bird said. ``If he keeps catching the ball in the
paint like he did tonight, we have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the carnage, the Pacers drew some resolve from the fact
that they knocked down a 17-point Lakers lead in the second quarter
to two in the third quarter and were still hanging in the game in
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy as it sounds, we feel good about where we are right
now,'' Pacers point guard Mark Jackson said. `We feel we can make
adjustments on Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   But after O'Neal scored eight more points Wednesday than he
scored the last two games combined against Portland, the
possibility exists that the Pacers are, in fact, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Even O'Neal was hard-pressed to devise a solution to his nimble
largeness. Asked how he would defend himself, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't. I'd just go home. Fake an injury, or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an adjustment the Pacers might consider. It would
also shock the world, just as Miller promised.

HOW TO SLOW DOWN SHAQ?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They widened the foul lane to try to stop Wilt
Chamberlain and they banned the college dunk to try to stop Lew
Alcindor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can be done to slow down Shaquille O'Neal? And how
soon will that revised rulebook be rolling off the presses?
</P>
<P>
   Ban the offensive rebound? Ban the jump-hook? Widen Rik Smits?
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers, the rest of the Eastern Conference and NBC
television are setting up a suggestions box at Staples Center.
Deadline for submissions, Friday at 6 o'clock, in time for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   What everybody suspected but the Pacers didn't want to admit was
confirmed Wednesday when O'Neal dropped 43 points on them in
leading the Lakers to a 104-87 victory in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers not only can't stop the Lakers' 7-foot-1, 335-pound
center, they can't even hope to contain him. Not without an act of
the rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (double-teamed) him, we played him straight up, and he
handled all of it,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said, holding his
exasperation inside. ``If he catches it in the paint, we'll be in
trouble. Somehow we've got to keep him out of that paint area.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if they didn't try.
</P>
<P>
   Smits, the 7-foot-4 Indiana center, and Dale Davis, its
6-foot-11 forward, took turns. Smits and Davis joined forces in the
second quarter. Forward-center Sam Perkins (6-foot-9) came off the
bench spend 20 minutes with his shoulder in the small of O'Neal's
back, trying to push a stone uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Mark Jackson (6-foot-3) made it a triple team for short
stretches, guarding Shaq from the front and trying to keep the ball
out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, raise your hand if you didn't take a turn at guarding
Shaq on Wednesday. At one point, I thought I saw Bird signal for
the guy in the Pacers-logoed tuxedo _ and his inflated flamingo _
to go in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The guy wouldn't have had a prayer. On the other hand, nobody's
ever tried a flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal played all but four minutes and hit 21 (matching his 2000
playoffs high) of 31 shots, while grabbing 19 rebounds, recording
four assists and three blocks, one of them particularly well-timed.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lakers opened a 53-36 lead in the second quarter, the
Pacers had pulled within 73-69 when Reggie Miller drove along the
left baseline late in the third, looking for his second basket of a
horrible NBA Finals debut. O'Neal bounded across the lane to swat
Miller's floater to the sideline, starting a Lakers fastbreak that
ended with a Kobe Bryant running jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like everytime we got within six or four _ we got
within two at one point _ Shaq just took over the game,'' Bird
said. ``I thought we did a good job of keeping a body in front of
him, but he's so strong and he jumps so high, he just went right
over us and got the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird hesitates to double-team O'Neal because, he admits, the
Pacers aren't quick enough to get back to the shooter if Shaq
passes the ball back out, as he does.
</P>
<P>
   And Bird doesn't sound like a Hack-a-Shaq man. He said fouling
O'Neal intentionally ``isn't in the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves ... ?
</P>
<P>
   If somebody doesn't come up with something, and quick, it's not
only the Pacers who are going to pay, and not only this week. It
might be the whole Eastern Conference and it might go on for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Western contenders have loaded up on big men with an eye on
Shaq, knowing they'll have to go through him _ or around him _ to
the Finals. Portland, with Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and
Brian Grant, thought it had the answer in the Western Conference
finals until about the 10-minute mark of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   But there are only so many good big men to go around. This could
become an annual event _ O'Neal faces his tests in the West, then
gets a walkover in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Hall of Famer lined up against him this time, as
there was in 1995 when Shaq's Orlando Magic was swept in the Finals
by Hakeem Olajuwon's Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of that embarrassment helps to inspire O'Neal on this
season's ``mission,'' as he calls it, to win his first title.
</P>
<P>
   He played like he meant it Wednesday, taking a big first step
toward joining Olajuwon, Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan
and Magic Johnson on the list of regular-season MVPs who earned the
same award in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   There's a sliver of hope for the Pacers. O'Neal has enjoyed many
of his finest moments this spring in series openers _ 46 points
against Sacramento, 37 against Phoenix, 41 against Portland.
Sometimes opponents figure something out before Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come at him a lot harder with our double- and
triple-teams,'' Smits said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a possibility. It's also a possibility the Pacers don't
have an answer. Then there's Shaquille O'Neal's answer when
somebody asked how he'd try to stop Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't,'' he said. ``I would go home. I'd fake an injury
or something.'' &QL;

ERSTAD, BATS DO IT FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mickey Hatcher, the irrepressible hitting
coach of the Angels, has an interesting twist on how to go about
winning games, which manager Mike Scioscia disclosed,
tongue-in-cheek, prior to Wednesday night's match with San
Francisco at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatch doesn't even know our pitchers' names,'' Scioscia was
saying. ``He just knows them by their numbers. All he asks is that
they get 27 outs, somehow, and no matter how many runs they give up
he figures his hitters will get more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher's somewhat unconventional theory then got a severe test
by the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   It was left for Darin Erstad, who had already slugged two home
runs, to single home Bengie Molina from second base with the
decisive run in the bottom of the eighth inning and the Angels came
away with a hard-earned 10-9 win in front of a crowd of 22,940.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who have displayed a remarkable knack of late by
coming from behind, this time came from ahead. They blew leads of
4-0 and 9-4, built primarily on the strength of Erstad's two home
runs, his 11th and 12th, and a three-run homer by Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bottom of the eighth with the score tied 9-9 Molina
singled off of reliever Alan Embree. With two outs, Edgard Clemente
ended an 0-for-17 skid with a single to left. Erstad followed with
his run-scoring single to left, giving him five runs batted in for
the night to match his career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing out, the ball is juiced, I use a corked
bat,'' he said, kidding, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, he added, ``I prepare, I work hard ...
sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't,'' said Erstad, who's
certainly making it happen far more than not.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting a stunning .388 for the season and, on the
just-completed homestand, he was 15 for 29 (.517) with six
successive multiple-hit games, giving him an American
League-leading 33 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one stat I care about is runs scored,'' Erstad said.
``When I cross the plate it means things are going well for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad crossed it twice Wednesday night. And, as he said, things
went well.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Kent Bottenfield let a 4-0 lead get away after only
three innings. And the bullpen, which, overall, has been superb,
was tagged for five runs in just three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has been great,'' Erstad said. ``This was a night
when we (the hitters) picked !ital!them!off! up.''
</P>
<P>
   The win enabled the Angels to complete a 4-2 homestand against
the Dodgers and Giants and climb to within a game of first place in
the tight-knit American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels jumped out quickly, jolting Giants starter Russ Ortiz
(Montclair Prep) for four runs in the first inning, three on Glaus'
17th home run.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lasted all the way to the third.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield had retired the first six Giants. But in the third
inning they batted around, scoring four runs to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels went to work again. Erstad slugged the first of his
two homers in the fifth inning, a two-run blow. And he hit another
two-run homer in the sixth when the Angels scored three more to
open a 9-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield left after six innings, but Al Levine certainly
didn't provide much relief. He was jarred for a pair of two-run
homers by Jeff Kent, his 17th, and by Armando Rios, his fourth. In
the space of six batters Levine's ERA shot from 3.00 to 3.74.
</P>
<P>
   And, suddenly, it was a one-run game, 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants then tied the score in the top of the eighth against
Shigetoshi Hasegawa, on J.T. Snow's one-out run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasegawa (5-1), the victim of a homer by Barry Bonds in
Monday night's 11-inning loss to the Giants, then hurled a 1-2-3
ninth to earn the win.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much as Hatcher had mapped it out. &QL;

REGGIE WAS A NO-SHOW IN GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The go-to guy was gone. He was somewhere else.
There was somebody in Reggie Miller's uniform, just not anyone that
could be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller doesn't go 1 for 16 from the field. He doesn't
miss every single jumpshot. Doesn't enter the wrong side of the
playoff record books.
</P>
<P>
   But there was Miller _ the man who stared down New York _
crumbling back home in his first appearance in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Riverside product and former UCLA star, was shooting
.466 percent from the field in the playoffs and leading the Pacers
with a 23.8 scoring average. Then, in the biggest game of his life,
he was a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   In a 104-87 loss to the Lakers Wednesday in the opener of the
Finals, Reggie Miller, one of the great shooters in NBA history,
hit one layup in 16 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward he was... well, defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put the ball in the basket, but I'll tell you what
_ if they keep giving me those looks, they're going to be in
trouble,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first four baskets went in and out, and every shot but one
felt good. If they're going to play me like that, it's only a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   See, Miller's a shooter and that's the way shooters think.
That's the way Pacers coach Larry Bird wants him to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for a guy in his first Finals, after he's
carried us all the way and led the offense, to go out and struggle
a bit in the first game,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept battling, he kept shooting. All Reggie has to do is
make a couple and he'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs he's been awesome. He had one bad shooting
night. There's no one giving up on him. We want him to continue to
shoot if he has the shot. We don't like him to force things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would like to take a lot of credit for the
outstanding defensive job they did on him, and they did play him
fairly well, but mostly he just missed ... and missed.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper, who spent many a season guarding Miller while with
the Bulls, started on Miller. Kobe Bryant and Brian Shaw also took
turns on him.
</P>
<P>
   But the way he was going, the Lakers could have guarded him with
Tex Winter. Miller kept firing and the ball kept hitting rim and
not net.
</P>
<P>
   His 1-for-16 shooting night was the sixth worst in NBA Finals
history for players who attempted at least 10 field goals. His
final seven points was a career playoff low. And he did his best to
shrug it all off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a long series,'' Miller said. ``It's what
adjustments you make and what you do the day after the game. So I'm
looking forward to it. Just one of those off nights. And Friday
will be our night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, too, are not counting on winning by watching Miller
go into the tank again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really seen him off for two games, so we know he's
going to come to play on Friday,'' said Lakers center Shaquille
O'Neal. ``We have to be ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Harper: ``His shot just didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers kept giving Miller the baseline, which he kept
driving to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just settle for jumpshots,'' Miller said. ``If
they're going to continue to give me baseline, I'm going to take it
every time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller almost sneered when it was suggested the Lakers
played him physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't physical at all,'' he said. ``Our last two series,
those were physical. This is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller might have appeared to press, but he claimed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't press on wide-open looks,'' he said. ``I feel
bad I only got off 16 shots. If I was going to be 1 for 16, I
should have been something like 1 for 25 or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooters shoot.'' &QL;

ALL SHAQ, ALL THE TIME IN LAKERS' GAME 1 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the Lakers' moment in the sun at long last
arrived, the crowd dispersed, a fog lifted, and there, standing in
the daylight _ standing all alone _ was the Lakers' offensive
machine, ready to churn out points by the dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal hardly remembers daylight, blanketed as he was
by an overcast sky of Wallaces and Pippens and various other shades
of Trail Blazer for the last two weeks. But no longer. O'Neal
roamed freely again through the paint Wednesday, with nary a
double-team in sight, and he did what 7-foot-1 MVPs do.
</P>
<P>
   Catch. Shoot. Catch. Shoot.
</P>
<P>
   With a steady, repetitive rhythm a metronome would envy, O'Neal
filled the Staples Center nets for 43 points, and the Lakers rolled
to a 104-87 victory over the Indiana Pacers to take a 1-0 lead in
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a familiar-enough sight as O'Neal hit 21 of 31 shots,
adding 19 rebounds, three blocks and four assists. But it's been
awhile since he could catch and move and jump _ or even breathe _
with such ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt pretty good to be able to get deep touches and go with
single coverage,'' said O'Neal, who faced nightly triple-teams by
Portland in the last round. ``I was just taking the high-percentage
shots, and those shots were falling.''
</P>
<P>
   So were the Pacers, to an early double-digit lead in a game they
never led after a 2-0 start. Coach Larry Bird started with single
coverage, switched to double coverage sometime after O'Neal had his
first two-dozen points, then found that wasn't much of an
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a good job keeping a body in front of him,''
Bird said, ``but he's so powerful, and he jumps so high, he's so
strong, he just went up over us and got the ball and put it in. So
it's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as rough for the Pacers was that their version of Superman
_ Reggie Miller, who like O'Neal has come to identify with the Man
of Steel _ was a super dud. Miller went 0 for 7 in the first half
and went to the bench late in the fourth quarter having scored just
seven points on 1-for-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A few more nights like that, and the Lakers will have their
first championship since 1988. But they were the first to warn
against using Game 1 as an indicator of things to come. O'Neal
might not get as much space to operate. Miller certainly won't
shoot that poorly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that once he came out early and made some
shots, his game was just there,'' teammate Ron Harper said of
O'Neal. ``And we kept throwing the ball into Shaq. And when you
throw the ball into a guy his size, the things he does, it's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper also had a successful night guarding Miller. But he
noted: ``First game. That's all it was, Game 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson said it was clear O'Neal felt more
comfortable with room to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could measure it tonight and see it,'' he said. ``You have
to remember, if you go back and look at all our beginning games
against all the teams in all the series we've played in the
playoffs, Shaq must be averaging close to 40 points a game in the
first games. Then things will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our first, frontal piece of our offensive machinery, and
our primary weapon, and teams are going to have to adjust if
they're going to beat us in a series,'' Jackson said. ``We do
anticipate they'll make adjustments at some level, and we'll have
to counter that and find a way to offensively play.''
</P>
<P>
   A third-quarter charge got the Pacers into the game for the
first and only time. Down 67-52, the Pacers went on a 17-4 run to
close the gap to two points, the closest they had been since the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson scored eight points in the run, and Dale Davis
scored twice on offensive rebounds as the Pacers briefly took
control of the boards. The Lakers absorbed the blow, and with two
quick jumpers from Kobe Bryant, then a bucket from Brian Shaw with
2.1 seconds left, pushed the lead to 77-71 to head into the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers cut a double-digit lead back to six again early in
the fourth, but O'Neal scored off an offensive rebound and Rick Fox
hit a jumper to make it 87-77. Minutes later, a Fox 3-pointer
pushed the lead to 15, and the Pacers were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We executed the game plan 10 times better than we have in any
game this playoff series,'' Fox said. ``That was due. It was due
that we look a lot sharper than we had.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 21 points by halftime as the Lakers raced to a 55-43
lead. Indiana had a difficult time keeping pace, with Miller
scoring zero points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (O'Neal) starts out like he did and he had the game he
had going, that's what opened it up for guys like myself and Rick
and whoever else out on the perimeter to have open shots,'' Shaw
said. ``But if we don't establish him early on in the game like
that and they play everybody else straight up, it's more of a
struggle.'' &QL;

BENCH GIVES LAKERS PLENTY OF HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don't forget about the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the glare of Shaquille O'Neal's supernova performance
Wednesday night was the play of two Laker reserves, Derek Fisher
and Rick Fox, who didn't light up the scoreboard near as
brilliantly as O'Neal but didn't seem to mind the lack of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The little-used Fisher and the often-maligned Fox both played
arguably their best games of the playoffs, but for different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's role in the NBA Finals can best be described as
``designated defender.'' Whenever Indiana's Travis Best enters the
game, Fisher is never far behind, charged with defending the
Pacers' quick guard. In 19 minutes, Best missed five of seven shots
and scored four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make life hard for Travis, and not even worry
about offense,'' said Fisher, who hit two of four shots and scored
five points. ``The biggest thing is just to stay in front of him.
He's going to make shots, but the biggest thing is to stay in front
of him and make him take tougher shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher averaged 14 minutes per game in the playoffs entering the
Finals, but much of that playing time came with the game already
decided. Fisher is now considered an important part of the Lakers'
success, and the mention of that fact draws a smile to his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easier when you know what your role is,'' Fisher
said. ``I know what I have to do out there, what I have to
concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, meanwhile, had his biggest offensive output of the playoffs
with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the Portland series, Fox had to forego offense and emphasize
physical play against the Trail Blazers' larger forwards, but
against the Pacers, Fox was able to roam the perimeter and made
three of four shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been able to do much in the playoffs, and it feels
good to make an impact now,'' said Fox, who played 24 minutes, most
among Laker reserves. ``It feels nice to break out of these limited
minutes and my limited effectiveness.'' &QL;

ROCKIES RUN WILD IN 6-1 VICTORY OVER SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sometimes the race does go to the swiftest.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was the case Wednesday night as the Colorado
Rockies ran the Mariners off their feet, with the pace-setter being
_ no surprise here _ Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet center fielder stole four bases, including a steal of
home in the first inning, leading the Rockies to a 6-1 victory at
Safeco Field in the final game of a homestand that saw the Mariners
finish a lackluster 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had hoped for more than just settling for a winning
record. Seattle came into the homestand with a 15-6 home record,
and six wins was the target this time around. Now, after a day off,
the Mariners hit the road for a tough 10-game road trip through San
Francisco, Kansas City and Minnesota starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how we came out of it tonight, we need to do better
on the road,'' manager Lou Piniella said, cognizant that his team's
10-16 road record is hardly the stuff of which champions are built.
``Outside of the third game against Chicago (a ninth-inning loss on
an error), we played all right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need to do better on the road, so we might as well
start on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, in addition to setting a new personal best with the
four steals, moved into a tie for the major-league lead with
Florida's Luis Castillo with 26. He put the Mariners in a
first-inning, 1-0 hole with a subtle execution of the double steal
with teammate Mike Lansing, then two innings later stole second and
third to set up and score Colorado's second run.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part in the series, the Mariners did what they
wanted to do _ they played exceptional defense, including plays by
shortstop Alex Rodriguez and second baseman Mark McLemore that made
a few highlight reels Wednesday night. And they kept baseball's
hottest hitter down _ the Rockies' Todd Helton, hitting .418 when
the series started, went just 2-for-11.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer gave the Mariners six decent innings in his second
start off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle couldn't do what it most wanted to do Wednesday _
finish the job and get that sixth win.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners couldn't do it because they couldn't shut down the
speed game. The Rockies finished with seven steals, most of them
instrumental in Colorado's minimalist offense.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Tom Lampkin said he was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had five throws (on steals) tonight, and I made four
horrible throws,'' Lampkin said. ``I had a chance to throw out all
of those guys. It was a lack of execution on my part. Usually the
runner steals off the pitcher. Tonight, they stole against me.''
</P>
<P>
   The more Lampkin thought about it, the more agitated he became
at his part in a game that gnawed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get so mad that I want them to try to steal,''
Lampkin said. ``My arm feels so good, I call pitches hoping that
I'll get a chance to throw. What happened tonight was that instead
of burying the throw right on the bag, I was guiding the ball, and
the ball sails on me when I do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners couldn't even get the minor satisfaction of scoring
the final run. John Olerud thought he'd led off the bottom of the
ninth with a home run into the right-field corner, but after
circling the bases, Olerud arrived home to find the call had been
overturned and his homer had been nothing but a long foul ball.
Olerud eventually struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first-base umpire (Laz Diaz) said he didn't get a real
good look at the ball,'' said Piniella, who argued the changed
call, then watched a replay later. ``And the other three umps
assured me the ball was foul. Turns out they were right.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, who has been struggling (8-for-34, .235) on the
homestand, needed the hit to stay above .300. He finished the night
at .299, and he's just one of the Mariners' struggling left-handed
hitters. Lampkin, who drove in Seattle's lone run with a sacrifice
fly but also hit into an inning-ending double play in the sixth, is
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many runs I cost the team tonight,'' Lampkin
said. ``Offensively, they gave me pitches to hit every at-bat, but
I didn't handle them good.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella isn't that jazzed about the rest of his left-handed
lineup, which Wednesday night included Raul Ibanez (0-for-2), John
Mabry (0-for-3) and Stan Javier (0-for-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact that some of our left-handed hitters need to start
hitting the ball better,'' Piniella said. ``It's one thing to give
players rest, but the players you use (instead) need to hit the
ball a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners managed only five hits, three by the right-handed
Rodriguez, one by Olerud and one by the right-handed Edgar
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Left or right, that's not enough.

NBA FINALS: IT'S SIMPLY A MISMATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the course of human events, there have been
some scandalous mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War in which an American-backed U.N. military
contingent crushed Iraq certainly was one.
</P>
<P>
   The fights of Joe Louis routinely deteriorated into such
one-sided recitals that his opponents became immortalized as
members of Louis' Bum of the Month Club.
</P>
<P>
   Guys who married Liz Taylor when she was young _ Eddie Fisher
comes to mind _ certainly found themselves in a harrowing struggle.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure anyone ever got the better of Howard Cosell in a
war of words.
</P>
<P>
   But for pure domination, for sheer violation, for downright
overwhelming, overpowering devastation, Shaquille's O'Neal one-man
wreckage of the Indiana Pacers Wednesday night ranks right up there
among the storied mismatches in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening moment of the NBA championship opener at
Staples Center, O'Neal turned the proceedings into his private
show, soaring above, around, over and through the awed Pacers for
43 points, 19 rebounds, three blocked shots, four assists and
thunderous ``MVP'' chants from the appreciative 18,997 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rode Shaq's coattails to victory,'' said the Lakers' coach,
Phil Jackson, in an understatement of epic proportion that,
nevertheless, aptly summed up his team's 104-87 win over the
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Neal did to Rik Smits, Dale Davis and Sam Perkins and
Austin Croshere _ the principal Pacer foils who vainly attempted to
defend the Laker center _ was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   If there was such a thing as a mercy rule in the NBA, the
referees Wednesday night would have stepped in and stopped the
plundering by O'Neal that left the Pacers battered, bruised,
bewildered, belittled and behind in this best-of-seven series that
won't go past four games unless the Pacers figure out how to slow
down O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew before the game that Shaq was going to go off
tonight,'' revealed Kobe Bryant, who gladly assumed a secondary
role _ he scored a mere 14 points _ on an evening when O'Neal sank
21 of 31 shots and failed to distinguish himself only at the free
throw line (1 of 6).
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq told me he was going to get in deep tonight. And that's
what happened. He got in deep early when they weren't
double-teaming him, and by the time they did start double-teaming
him it was too late. He was in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh was Shaquille O'Neal in a groove!
</P>
<P>
   He was Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
wrapped into one terrifying force that refused to be silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was thrilled that those Portland tormentors, Arvydas
Sabonis, Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace, no longer were in the
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was still seething over Sunday's Game 7 performance
against the Trail Blazers in which he scored a mere 18 points and
was limited to a mere 9 shot attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he desperately wanted to show Indiana the reason he was
the league's almost unanimous MVP _ some numskull sportscaster
thirsting for national publicity voted for that mighty force, Allen
Everson _ and establish early control of a series in which his team
is the huge favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Shaquille O'Neal played with a fierce passion for 44
minutes, and the beleaguered Pacers seemed intimidated by his
hulking, 7-1, 340-pound body that was as active as it as been at
anytime this season.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked O'Neal afterward if he thought the Pacer
players were shying away for him when he was leaping for rebounds,
or wheeling toward the basket for a shot, he replied, ``I'm just
doing what I've been doing my whole career, getting the ball deep
and taking shots. I think I'm one of the last true centers left.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the Pacers were scared of O'Neal, but none of
them came faintly close to handling him.
</P>
<P>
   And you got the impression from the opening tipoff which the
Lakers won that Phil Jackson's troops could do pretty well what
they wanted to do against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at times, they seemed to be toying with the Eastern
Conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   They built a 17-point first quarter lead (33-16), watched it cut
to 6 in the second (37-31), built it back to 17 again (53-36)
before intermission, watched it cut to 2 (71-69) in the third, and
then built it back to 17 (96-79) in a final period when O'Neal
erupted for 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to get our focus up,'' said O'Neal, whose
post-game utterances will never be entered into the National
Archives in Washington D.C. ``Game 1 is always a difficult one. We
got this one, and we just have to real ready and real focused for
Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   What can the poor Pacers did against Shaquille O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird said the double-teams were soft, and, of course,
Reggie Miller doesn't figure to miss 15 of 16 shots in an unique
achievement that was as inglorious as O'Neal's was glorious.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal caused two of Miller's misses with mighty blocks that
ignited the crowd and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal figures to dispense many more heroics before
this one is over, which could be soon if he continues his carnage
against the Pacers. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Space _ the final frontier. For advertising, that
is.
</P>
<P>
   The American space agency NASA intends to try to offset the cost
of the International Space Station (ISS) by selling advertising
access, and perhaps even advertising space.
</P>
<P>
   You will also be able to e-mail astronauts there, and perhaps
even talk directly to them, though they may be too busy assembling
the $60 billion ISS to take much time to reply.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was announced this week by Daniel Tam, assistant to the
administrator for commercialization of NASA. ``Some would argue
that there is nothing terribly new about viewing NASA images from
space,'' Tam told the International Advertising Association, in
London. ``After all, millions around the world watched the grainy
image of Neil Armstrong take the first walk on the moon in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet technologies able to ``stream'' data from
space, ``the images will be so clear that it would be like you are
there next to the astronauts and cosmonauts as they work and live
in space. It is very likely that you can actually talk to them live
as they go about their daily routine.''
</P>
<P>
   How the astronauts may feel about having one person, or one
million people, asking them through their headsets to wave as they
go past their house is not yet clear. But Tam insists: ``You
certainly will be able to send and receive e-mails from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has been forced on the agency by falling budgets from
the U.S. government for the past eight years. The ISS and the space
shuttle absorb half of the agency's $13 billion annual budget _ and
so they are going to have to pay their way.
</P>
<P>
   Tam will say that ``in the process of truly opening the space
frontier to all, the advertisers of the world will make it a better
world for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASA announced a joint venture with a Silicon Valley
start-up company, Dreamtime Holdings, to create a new Internet
``portal'' at www.dreamtime.com, to provide a commercial outlet for
the huge amount of NASA space data collected over the past 40
years. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tables may have been turned, finally, on the
bizarre cast of characters who tried to bring down President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A new book commissioned by Talk Miramax, the Disney-owned
publishing venture headed by Tina Brown, seeks to examine the
private lives of the investigators _ including Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who led the charge against Clinton and gave his
name to the famously lurid report into the presidential
pecadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the book was revealed Tuesday by Internet
journalist Matt Drudge, himself no friend of the Clintons, in an
apparent effort to derail it before it is even published.
</P>
<P>
   The author, John Connolly, a New York magazine journalist, has
entitled his book ``Insane Clown Posse,'' a reference to a
foul-mouthed rap group beloved of immature white American
teenagers, but also no bad way to describe the odd cast who tried
to oust the president.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``digs deep into the private sex lives and business
dealings of major and minor Clinton critics,'' wrote Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that it looked at the number of Starr's staff who
were gay, amongst other issues. ``There are no less than six gays
involved in the case. Two of the `elves,' and three of Starr's
young male protege's were gay,'' he quoted the book as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little has been written on the personal lives of the
people who were behind the Lewinsky case,'' writes Connolly,
according to Drudge. It seems unlikely he will find out much about
Starr, who lives a life of apparently irreproachable virtue in the
Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   One target is Ann Coulter, the blonde-maned, virulently
anti-Clinton columnist, who has complained of dirty tricks against
her by Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy began a program of harassment by calling me at home 6
times a day until I changed my number, sending me flowers, and
hiring a private investigator to look into my personal life,'' she
told Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a copy of the letter his P.I. sent to an ex-boyfriend
of mine, stating that he was hired by John Connolly to look into
me.'' The author spoke to at least one of Coulter's former
boyfriends, Bob Guccione, Jr., founder of the music magazine Spin,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter was introduced to Connolly by Lucianne Goldberg, another
key figure in the Clinton saga.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a New York literary agent who spied for the Nixon
White House in the 1972 election, is another likely target of any
probe. It was her idea for former White House employee Linda Tripp
to secretly record Monica Lewinsky's reports of sexual involvement
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg now runs a Web site where visitors can discuss whether
aliens are really Satan's angels and exchange vitriolically
anti-gay messages.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks seem to be working: Talk/Miramax seems suddenly to
have got cold feet about the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it emerges that John Connolly has been using the kind of
unprofessional means that are detailed in the Drudge Report, we
will consider cancelling the book,'' Jonathan Burnham, editor in
chief of the publisher, told the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who is gay, said the revelations about gay members of
Starr's staff concerned him. ``That disturbs me deeply, both for
personal and professional reasons,'' he told the Post. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Only five days after NATO was ``exonerated'' by the
International War Crimes Tribunal for its killing of civilians in
Yugoslavia last year, Amnesty International Wednesday published a
blistering attack on the Alliance, accusing it of committing
serious violations of the rules of war, unlawful killings and _ in
the case of the bombing of Serbia's television headquarters _ a war
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-page Amnesty report details a number of mass killings of
civilians in NATO raids and states that ``civilian deaths could
have been significantly reduced if NATO forces had fully adhered to
the rules of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Legalistic in nature but damning in content _ the document
reminds readers that Amnesty repeatedly condemned Serb atrocities
against Kosovo Albanians _ the report highlights inconsistencies
and obfuscation by NATO's official spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO told Amnesty that pilots operated under ``strict
Rules of Engagement,'' it refused to disclose details of the
``rules'' or the principles underlying them.
</P>
<P>
   The report says: ``They did not answer specific questions
Amnesty International raised about specific incidents...''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty records that NATO aircraft flew 10,484 strike missions
over Serbia and that Serbian statistics of civilian deaths in NATO
raids range from 400-600 up to 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   It specifically condemns NATO for an attack on a bridge at
Varvarin on May 30 last year, which killed at least 11 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO forces failed to suspend their attack after it was
evident that they had struck civilians,'' Amnesty says.
</P>
<P>
   When it attacked convoys of Albanian refugees near Djakovica on
April 14 and in Korisa on May 13, ``NATO failed to take necessary
precautions to minimize civilian casualties.'' The report says NATO
repeatedly gave priority to pilots' safety at the cost of civilian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In several investigations of civilian deaths, Amnesty quotes
from reports in The Independent, including an investigation into
the bombing of a hospital at Surdulica on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent disclosed in November that Serb soldiers were
sheltering on the ground floor of the hospital when it was bombed
but that all the casualties were civilian refugees living on the
upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty says: ``If NATO intentionally bombed the hospital
complex because it believed it was housing soldiers, it may well
have violated the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Article 50(3) of Protocol 1, (of the Geneva
Conventions) `the presence within the civilian population of
individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does
not deprive the population of its civilian character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital complex was clearly a civilian object with a
large civilian population; the presence of soldiers would not have
deprived the civilians or the hospital compound of their protected
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Amnesty's harshest criticism is directed at the April 23
bombing of Serb television headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Wesley Clark has stated, `We knew when we struck that
there would be alternate means of getting the Serb Television.
There's no single switch to turn off everything but we thought it
was a good move to strike it, and the political leadership agreed
with us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' the report continues, ``NATO deliberately
attacked a civilian object, killing 16 civilians, for the purpose
of disrupting Serb television broadcasts in the middle of the night
for approximately three hours. It is hard to see how this can be
consistent with the rule of proportionality.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 17 last year, NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana,
wrote to Amnesty in response to its ``grave concern'' over the TV
bombing, stating that RTS (Serb Radio and Television) facilities
``are being used as radio relay stations and transmitters to
support the activities of the...military and special police forces,
and therefore they represent legitimate military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting with NATO officials in Brussels early this year
Amnesty was informed that Solana's reference ``was to other attacks
on RTS infrastructure and not this particular attack on RTS
headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department, Amnesty recalls, justified the
television station bombing because it was ``a facility used for
propaganda purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty itself says that British Prime Minister Tony Blair
``appeared to be hinting (in a subsequent BBC documentary) that one
of the reasons that the station was targeted was because its video
footage of the human toll of NATO mistakes...was being re-broadcast
by Western media outlets and was thereby undermining support for
the war within the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the NATO destruction of the train at Gurdulica bridge on
April 12, Amnesty says: ``NATO's explanation of the bombing _
particularly General Clark's account of the pilot's rationale for
continuing the attack after he had hit the train _ suggests that
the (American) pilot had understood that the mission was to destroy
the bridge regardless of the cost in terms of civilian
casualties...''
</P>
<P>
   NATO had not, Amnesty adds, ``taken sufficient precautionary
measures to ensure there was no civilian traffic in the vicinity of
the bridge before launching the first attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty quotes the NATO spokesman James Shea as admitting that
the video of the train shown to the press at the time was speeded
up (to three times its original speed) because NATO analysts
routinely reviewed tapes at speed.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, Amnesty says, ``said that the (NATO) press office was at
fault for clearing the tape for public screening without slowing it
down to the original speed.'' &QL;

   ``NATO forces failed to suspend their attack after it was
evident that they had struck civilians,'' Amnesty says.
</P>
<P>
   When it attacked convoys of Albanian refugees near Djakovica on
April 14 and in Korisa on May 13, ``NATO failed to take necessary
precautions to minimize civilian casualties.'' The report says NATO
repeatedly gave priority to pilots' safety at the cost of civilian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In several investigations of civilian deaths, Amnesty quotes
from reports in The Independent, including an investigation into
the bombing of a hospital at Surdulica on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent disclosed in November that Serb soldiers were
sheltering on the ground floor of the hospital when it was bombed
but that all the casualties were civilian refugees living on the
upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty says: ``If NATO intentionally bombed the hospital
complex because it believed it was housing soldiers, it may well
have violated the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Article 50(3) of Protocol 1, (of the Geneva
Conventions) `the presence within the civilian population of
individuals who do not come within the definition of civilians does
not deprive the population of its civilian character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital complex was clearly a civilian object with a
large civilian population; the presence of soldiers would not have
deprived the civilians or the hospital compound of their protected
status.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Amnesty's harshest criticism is directed at the April 23
bombing of Serb television headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Wesley Clark has stated, `We knew when we struck that
there would be alternate means of getting the Serb Television.
There's no single switch to turn off everything but we thought it
was a good move to strike it, and the political leadership agreed
with us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' the report continues, ``NATO deliberately
attacked a civilian object, killing 16 civilians, for the purpose
of disrupting Serb television broadcasts in the middle of the night
for approximately three hours. It is hard to see how this can be
consistent with the rule of proportionality.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 17 last year, NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana,
wrote to Amnesty in response to its ``grave concern'' over the TV
bombing, stating that RTS (Serb Radio and Television) facilities
``are being used as radio relay stations and transmitters to
support the activities of the...military and special police forces,
and therefore they represent legitimate military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting with NATO officials in Brussels early this year
Amnesty was informed that Solana's reference ``was to other attacks
on RTS infrastructure and not this particular attack on RTS
headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department, Amnesty recalls, justified the
television station bombing because it was ``a facility used for
propaganda purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty itself says that British Prime Minister Tony Blair
``appeared to be hinting (in a subsequent BBC documentary) that one
of the reasons that the station was targeted was because its video
footage of the human toll of NATO mistakes...was being re-broadcast
by Western media outlets and was thereby undermining support for
the war within the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the NATO destruction of the train at Gurdulica bridge on
April 12, Amnesty says: ``NATO's explanation of the bombing _
particularly General Clark's account of the pilot's rationale for
continuing the attack after he had hit the train _ suggests that
the (American) pilot had understood that the mission was to destroy
the bridge regardless of the cost in terms of civilian
casualties...''
</P>
<P>
   NATO had not, Amnesty adds, ``taken sufficient precautionary
measures to ensure there was no civilian traffic in the vicinity of
the bridge before launching the first attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty quotes the NATO spokesman James Shea as admitting that
the video of the train shown to the press at the time was speeded
up (to three times its original speed) because NATO analysts
routinely reviewed tapes at speed.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, Amnesty says, ``said that the (NATO) press office was at
fault for clearing the tape for public screening without slowing it
down to the original speed.'' &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ Israel's precipitate withdrawal from southern Lebanon
offers huge challenges and opportunities to investors and the
millions of Lebanese emigres abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Beirut, the once vibrant economy and outward-looking
society were devastated by the civil wars from 1975 to 1990, but
repairs had been going reasonably well since.
</P>
<P>
   Then came recent violent exchanges between Israel's armed
forces, which left southern Lebanon at the end of May, and the
Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, now taking credit for driving them
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just how,'' asks a woman university professor with training in
both the Mideast and America, ``would you expect people to invest
or bring themselves and their money back here when from one moment
to the next you or your property might become a war victim?''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks from experience. In May, Israeli jets hit the
electric power station near her family apartment in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they set it afire,'' she recalls, ``and we lost our
electricity, their helicopter gunships came back and deliberately
strafed the fire engines and rescue crews, killing a fireman we
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Israeli raids in May followed an especially murderous
exchange in the former occupation zone between Hezbollah fighters
and Israeli occupation troops and their Lebanese mercenaries of the
former South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   For most people now, the SLA is becoming only an unpleasant
memory. Its fighters, hangers-on and camp followers, instead of
protecting the rear of the retreating Israelis as they were hired
to do, defected, surrendered to the authorities or fled to Israel
by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss along with his senior ally, Syria,
which still keeps 35,000 increasingly unpopular troops in Lebanon,
and relief agencies now must decide if and how to repatriate SLA
members who want to come home. Some would face prosecution for
offenses including high treason, for which they could be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Upwards of 5,000 former fighters and their families languish in
Israeli resort camps. ``We'll try to help anyone,'' says a Swiss
Red Cross official here, ``who wants to risk coming home to face
the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, my Lebanese-American driver who threaded his big Chevy
through chaotic traffic and Lebanese families gawking at Israel
through the border fence, mentioned another conundrum for the
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   As we sipped coffee in bracing, hilltop air on the edge of the
former Israeli occupation zone, there was general euphoria
generated by contented villagers and Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's extended Muslim family has lived for more than a
generation in Michigan, but he returned to his roots here a couple
of years ago to try to make a go of it. ``How,'' he asks, ``are you
going to get people like my family to come back here, as the
government wants?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Michigan, my family and relatives live in nice houses, like
those we saw a few minutes ago across the fence in Israel. Do they
want to come back to a ruined economy, few or no jobs, no schools
and anti-personnel mines the Israelis left behind, just because the
mountain air and the eggplants and tomatoes here taste so good?''
</P>
<P>
   In northern Lebanon, reconstruction after the civil wars revived
good hotels, restaurants, beach resorts, night life and other urban
amenities. These encouraged a few Western and Arab tourists to
return despite ruinously high real estate prices here.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Lebanon has always been a different, poorer world of
dirt farmers growing tobacco, vegetables and fruit on mostly small
plots, and undereducated villagers who dream only of emigrating to
Detroit, Los Angeles or Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting the two Lebanons would be a bit like trying to rejoin
long-separated Siamese twins. One has been growing and developing
sporadically, despite conflict and upheavals. The other is
dessicated, scarred, undernourished and weary.
</P>
<P>
   Teams from Lebanese ministries daily arrive in the south to try
get public clinics working, phones connected, tap water and
electricity connected, and roads and schools repaired. They are
finding that Hezbollah is already doing these jobs, as de facto
guardian of the south.
</P>
<P>
   As my friend Hussein reflected out loud on the road back north
to the other world in Beirut, preserving and rebuilding southern
Lebanon requires ``real peace both on the ground and on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, there is a kind of armistice, not too unlike the
one that Lebanon signed with the new state of Israel in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the needed peace accords between Israel and Syria and
Lebanon are still only hopeful memoranda. Providing the real thing
and guaranteeing it must now be the task of those in Damascus,
Jerusalem, London, Paris and Washington who are dedicated to
building a better Middle East. &QL;

   DINING-SANFRANCISCO _ SAN FRANCISCO _ You don't ask for seconds
at the French Laundry, the Napa Valley restaurant where any meal
may consist of 15 mini-courses. Each is a two-bite inspiration, an
arresting sensation of the here and now slipping down your throat.
That is the reason that people book their plane tickets around a
reservation at Thomas Keller's 62-seat sensation that has become
the non plus ultra of America's dining destinations. To reserve,
you must call two months to the exact calendar date ahead of time,
and be prepared for stinging rejection if others beat you to the
punch. But even if you can't book at the French Laundry, the Bay
Area has now more than ever enough outstanding dining options to
guarantee a thrill at every turn. To make the most of your vacation
you have to plan meal by meal ... which we are only too happy to do
for you. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

warning had all the concern of someone telling me I was about to
step on a wayward house cat or an errant ball instead of a highly
venomous tropical serpent. Welcome to the National Institute for
Biodiversity Park, a unique environmental theme park that opened in
February. (Martz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   GETAWAY _ ANNISTON, Ala. _ Driving I-20 between Atlanta and
Birmingham, skimming by fireworks bazaars and barbecue palaces, you
wouldn't imagine that Hitler's silver tea service and Napoleon's
good-luck charm are just beyond the Anniston exit ramp. Or that
those rarities keep company with dinosaurs, a savannah full of
mounted African wildlife, a century-old collection of extinct and
endangered birds, a pair of Egyptian mummies, and Jeff Davis'
pistols. They're all here, with much, much more, in the Berman
Museum and Anniston Museum of Natural History, side-by-side in
Lagarde Park. (Schemmel, Atlanta Journal-Constitution freelancer;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: OUR NEW DANCE OF DEATH
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From time to time during the Persian Gulf war,
Patriot missiles shot down incoming Iraqi Scuds on their way to
Saudi Arabia. But most Patriots couldn't hit their targets, and
those that did caused damage when their debris fell from above.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, President Clinton is on his way to deploying 100
interceptors in Alaska to shoot down incoming rockets from rogue
states or terrorists. Vice President Al Gore endorses the program,
while Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his likely rival to succeed
Clinton in the White House, wants to do even more.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks like the idea of having an umbrella around in case of
rain. It rains quite often in Seattle, where Boeing, as prime
contractor, has been billing taxpayers at a rate of $2 billion a
year for the current six-year phase of the anti-missile project.
</P>
<P>
   The big idea is to give Clinton technical cover by having the
system pass some tests before he gives Gore political cover by
approving ``limited'' deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign governments abhor the idea. They tend to view such
shields as destabilizing, following the same train of thought that
President Nixon followed when he signed the ABM Treaty in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   (Some Republicans in Congress hold the quaint view that the ABM
Treaty is dead because the Soviet Union is gone. Inconveniently,
the United States signs treaties that view Russia as the legitimate
successor to the Soviet Union.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, Boeing and Uncle Sam are batting .500 in the Missile
Defense League.
</P>
<P>
   The first test, last Oct. 2, proved that a homing mechanism
could intercept a target traveling at intercontinental-range speeds
when fired on a near-collision course under ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The second test, on Jan. 18, using more advanced components,
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another test, known as IFT-5, is scheduled soon. It will
take until IFT-19, to be held in 2005, before the project has its
first operational flight test.
</P>
<P>
   By then, many domestic politicians who like the missile project,
and many foreign leaders who don't, are likely to have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely that opinions will shift in the scientific
community, which by and large views the project as a waste of
money. On this issue, the scientists link arms with the arms
controllers, who recall engaging in the same sobering dance of
death during the Cold War and arguing, successfully, for a ban on
nuclear missile shields.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a policy analyst at the Federation of American
Scientists, said, ``It's fairly easy to imagine the Chinese
thinking, 'because China is now a great power, and because the
Americans and Russians won't build down to China's level of
strategic forces, maybe (we) should build up to theirs.' Looking
ahead 10 or 15 years, that's the main reason I would be sorry for
making these decisions today.''
</P>
<P>
   But most politicians find it hard to make decisions beyond the
next election. And Clinton, who for the first time has no elections
lying in wait, feels he must defend the National Missile Defense
Act, which he signed into law last July 23 and which mandates
deployment of a system ``as soon as is technologically possible.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: HAVING THE PRESIDENT FOR DINNER
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We were arguing politics. That's what friends do.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a successful president or was he not?
</P>
<P>
   I said he was. My friend said he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   I said, despite some ups and downs, he has to his credit a
general period of prosperity during his two terms in his office and
_ lest we forget _ he was the president who got us out of Korea.
</P>
<P>
   My friend said his creation of the Interstate highway system _
funded as a business favor to the auto industry _ pushed ugly,
urban sprawl across rural America, and, in addition, his botched
Cuban diplomacy was a legacy of disaster waiting to happen, and
which shortly did happen with the Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Old politics _ as far back as the Eisenhower administration _
was what we were arguing. That's what really old friends do.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I'm in Washington, he and I get together, convening at
a restaurant of his choosingto discuss politics, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   He talks pretty good politics. He picks very good restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   This was a small French place way out on Connecticut Avenue NW,
a long cab ride for me but only a short distance for him. As a
matter of logistics, it was the logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   Though still a world traveler, my friend is nearing 80 and has
been staying closer to home the past year after replacement surgery
on his knees. Everything seems to be going well, and the hope is
that he'll be going as strong as ever before too long.
</P>
<P>
   The other evening was the first time we had been together since
last fall. The first thing he did was apologize for the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be such a nice, dingy little place,'' he said,
looking with remorse around the clean, well-lighted, brightly
decorated interior. ``Then they remodeled it, the crowds started
coming and the food hasn't been the same since.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't have everything.
</P>
<P>
   I had the soft-shell crabs, he had the veal medallions and, in
honor of each other's company, we each had one more glass of
influential beverages than normally we allow ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, there were fresh raspberries and ice cream, frothy
coffee and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   That's as far as we had gotten, the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls JFK with a deep fondness for the fallen hero and all
the glory that once was Camelot, whose great promise likely would
have been fulfilled in a second term.
</P>
<P>
   I see Kennedy as a rogue aristocrat, but astute politician, who
had back-pedaled on the civil rights issues he supposedly
championed, and, moreover, was likely to be exposed during the
upcoming election for the womanizer that he was. Assassination, at
it turned out, was a good career move.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter. I had my say, my friend had his say, and we both
had a good dinner, parting friends the same as always.
</P>
<P>
   I can't imagine our ever falling out over politics, not with so
much still ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Johnson administration, the Nixon administration,
the Ford administration ... the list goes on and on, and then
starts over again.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cell phones and autos
 &HT;    For release June 11, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One of those sport utility vehicles the size of Montana
was lugging in on me from the center lane. As I looked up, way up,
I noted that the driver, cigarette dangling from her lips, was
otherwise occupied talking on her cellular phone. I sounded my horn
to gain her attention, thus saving me from extensive auto repairs
and, likely, a visit to the emergency room _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   I now know what I fear most: not the giant urban chariots
themselves but people in them (and other vehicles) who talk on cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a high school honors student who was skating on a
bicycle path near my home was struck and killed by a car that
veered off the road and came onto the parallel path. Reports say
the driver either was talking on her cell phone or had dropped it
and was leaning to pick it up. Either way, she was distracted from
her driving, lost control and someone died.
</P>
<P>
   The case against using cell phones while operating a vehicle has
been building for some time. Already, laws have been passed in
several states to deal with it. Now, such a movement is under way
in Florida; a direct result of the death of the young lady.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who maintain that hands-free cell phones will
remedy the problem, and there are those who insist that it will
not, that the real problem is the distraction of talking; of being
attentive to something other than your driving.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, I came upon an old newspaper clipping the other
day that would tend to agree with those who say it is the act of
talking on the phone, more than holding it, that poses the greatest
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1956, there was a story in the Miami Herald that a local
auto insurance agent would not write policies for people who had
radios in their cars. He referred to accidents with which he was
familiar that ``were the direct result of drivers' attention being
distracted because they were listening to ball games instead of
concentrating on driving safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the agent overreacting? Probably. An All-State sales
manager, interviewed in the same article, said there was ``no
evidence that the driver of a car which carries a radio is either
worse or better than the driver of an automobile not so equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I can recall quite a few times when I was listening to the
auto radio _ ball game, talk show, news _ and lost my concentration
on the road. In fact, even today, when one of those heavy South
Florida cloudbursts strike while I'm driving, I turn off my radio
because I feel it is interfering with my ability to concentrate on
that sheet of water running down my windshield, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Does this relate to cell phones? Yes it does. I have had an
automobile with a hands-free phone and ones that require
hand-helds. In either situation, I sometimes found myself
concentrating too much on what was being said, either by me or the
other party, and needed to take quick action to correct my driving.
</P>
<P>
   Distraction is a major danger to auto safety. It is not limited
to cell phones or radios and that's why selective bans may not be
the cure-all. There are also many out there who believe roadside
billboards can distract a driver from his or her attention to the
highway. Others, like me, believe they are a welcome break during
an otherwise monotonous, sleep-inducing long haul on a turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, cellular telephones have been under attack.
There's the brain tumor thing, and the driving safety factor, both
persistent arguments _ whether documented or not.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many cellular calls made from or to automobiles are
necessary and how many are just social, passing the time of day
while driving along; the latter to which I often would plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A cellular phone is a valuable instrument to have if your car
breaks down, if you are in an accident or if you become lost.
However, all three stated necessities can be handled by the
roadside, while the vehicle is not in motion.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the cell phone antagonists are contending, and the
death of that lovely girl on the bike path is just the sort of
tragedy that could lead to more legislative bodies passing
prohibitive laws about in-motion calls.

 &HT;    Remembering the Mick and his restaurant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ There is an 8x10, black-and-white photo of
Mickey Mantle hanging in my office. ``To Gary, Mickey Mantle'' is
scrawled in black ink. Mantle is in Yankee Stadium, down on one
knee, a Louisville Slugger leaning against his then-strong body, a
slight smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is sharp enough that you can read the inscription on
the bat: ``Genuine Mickey Mantle Louisville Slugger.'' What else?
</P>
<P>
   There is just a hint of crow's feet under his eyes. He was
probably just past his prime when the photo was taken. Maybe it was
1961, when Roger Maris hit 61 home runs to break the Babe's record,
and Mantle chased right behind him with 54. Or 1964, when the
Yankees won their fifth straight pennant but couldn't beat St.
Louis in the World Series, falling victim to Bob Gibson's fastball.
By then, Mantle's knees were beginning to give out. He would limp
along with only occasional flashes of his old brilliance for a few
more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   I got my photo when Mantle opened a restaurant in Longview, out
on Highway 80 west of town, down by the used-car lots.
</P>
<P>
   A new building was built a mile or so past Treasure City, an
early precursor to Wal-Mart, long gone now. The restaurant was
called something like ``Mickey Mantle's Country Cooking,'' and it
opened in 1970. Mantle planned to open a string of these
country-cooking places throughout Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   My parents took us to eat there when Mantle came to town for the
grand opening, and I stood in line for an hour or so to get his
autograph. Mantle stood patiently, signing a stack of 8x10s. I
shook his hand and got him to inscribe a photo to me. I remember
even in retirement he still seemed strong enough and fit enough to
play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant flopped. I don't know why. Maybe the food was
lousy. Maybe Mantle was ahead of his time. After all, country
cooking was what everybody ate at home in East Texas in 1970, or
maybe while on the road in places with names like ``Gladys' Cafe,''
or ``Mom's'' -- places with no air-conditioning and fly strips
hanging from the ceiling. If you planned to go to a nice, sit-down
restaurant, you probably wanted something more exotic than chicken
and dumplings. That's what I had on my only visit to Mickey's
place.
</P>
<P>
   These days, country cooking is all the rage, because hardly
anybody has time to cook those types of meals at home, and we're
all worried about cholesterol and fat. These days, chicken and
dumplings are an exotic treat.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I looked, a church was operating out of Mantle's old
restaurant site in Longview.
</P>
<P>
   I was not a Yankee fan as a child. Far from it. I was, and still
am, a Boston Red Sox fan, which means I view the Yankees with the
same low estimation as Teasips view Aggies. I am a Teasip too,
which means I get to suffer both through baseball and football
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 years of my life, the Yankees won the pennant
nine times. Lucky for me, I was blissfully ignorant of baseball
until I was about six or so and could read, so I only suffered for
five years or so. I learned to read as much by going over the
Boston Record-American box scores and game stories as I did
struggling through ``See Spot run.''
</P>
<P>
   I hated the Yankees, but I loved Mickey Mantle. It was hard not
to. He was that good. I would dream that the Yankees would go
insane and trade him to Boston. With my true baseball hero, Carl
Yastrzemski, batting third, and Mantle batting cleanup, maybe my
team could rise out of the cellar to the top. Thus are the dreams
of children.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, Mantle went over the edge from simply
a hard-drinking, carousing ballplayer whose most famous line was
``If I'd known I was going to live this long, I would've taken
better care of myself,'' to a full-blown alcoholic who went public
with his addiction after checking into the Betty Ford Clinic. By
last week, he was dying in a Dallas hospital, his liver ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle got lucky. A liver donor was found and transplanted. He's
not out of the woods, but his odds are improving.
</P>
<P>
   Root for him to make it. He has not exactly led an exemplary
life since leaving baseball, but man, he gave us baseball fanatics
some great memories. Even if it was against the home team.

 &HT;    Mr. Spock or Sgt. Schultz
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush is getting the oddest form of
political praise since, since _ uh, since Ronald Reagan was getting
it.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is getting the most curious slam since, since _ uh,
since Michael Dukakis was getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Here they are in tandem: Bush gets credited for saying ``I don't
know.'' Gore gets graded down for knowing too much.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stretch to say that Bush on the campaign trail is Sgt.
Schultz, whose ``I know nothing _ nothing!'' guarantees job
security. But Bush is not posing as a Star Trek commander, either.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, a reverse condition. Advisers urge that he drop the
Mr. Spock routine, lest one of his own aides one day writes the
fall-of-Gore memoir, ``All Too Humanoid.''
</P>
<P>
   These rivals offer a most interesting contrast when they debate
face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' Frank Bruni is among those who have observed
the apparent mileage Bush has gotten as the candidate who doesn't
read heavily, who doesn't know intricate details, and who indeed
appears to wear that condition as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this exchange relayed by New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson
when he and Bush were at a governor's conference with speakers
weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``George turns to me and says, `What are they talking about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   To this, Bush told his GOP compatriot, ``You don't know a thing,
do you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one thing,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush replied, ``Neither do I.'' And then they high-fived.
</P>
<P>
   A curious trait, Capt. Kirk. These beings apparently have a
secret code that includes hand-gesture greetings.
</P>
<P>
   NOT A DETAILS GUY
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who spends time with Bush should not be surprised at the
exchange. He does not present himself as the Answer Man. He is as
engaging as he is disengaged from nuts and bolts. He is one who
sets goals and who delegates the details.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, that is easier to pull off as governor of Texas.
The legislature meets every other year. The Reconstruction-era
constitution almost makes a governor subservient to the lieutenant
governor, who runs the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. presidency by contrast is only the most powerful
elected office in the solar system. So, what commander will it be,
voters?
</P>
<P>
   CURSE OF SPECIFICITY
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has learned the age-old lesson that
vagueness pays and details sometimes only incite.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security is one issue on which Bush has not sprinkled
generalities like Bac-Os. The experience shows that a little
specificity demands a lot.
</P>
<P>
   How much would the Bush plan syphon off for private retirement
accounts? And how to replace the money now being paid to cover
current retirees?
</P>
<P>
   Or take the issue of an anti-missile system, which under Bush
would be far more extensive than the limited system proposed by
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week said he envisions an umbrella not only for this
continent but for U.S. allies as well. Hmmm. Best be vague about
those costs.
</P>
<P>
   The time will come when the details guy, Gore, will square off
against Bush under studio lights. It will be fascinating to see if
Gore's background of having been in Congress for 16 years and vice
president for two terms will result in a technical knockout, or if
Bush will dance his way past the details and into America's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere right now someone is trying ``I don't know'' out as a
billboard slogan beside the candidate's smile, or maybe a bumper
sticker for the masses: ``Bush: He don't know.''

   DINING-SANFRANCISCO _ SAN FRANCISCO _ You don't ask for seconds
at the French Laundry, the Napa Valley restaurant where any meal
may consist of 15 mini-courses. Each is a two-bite inspiration, an
arresting sensation of the here and now slipping down your throat.
That is the reason that people book their plane tickets around a
reservation at Thomas Keller's 62-seat sensation that has become
the non plus ultra of America's dining destinations. To reserve,
you must call two months to the exact calendar date ahead of time,
and be prepared for stinging rejection if others beat you to the
punch. But even if you can't book at the French Laundry, the Bay
Area has now more than ever enough outstanding dining options to
guarantee a thrill at every turn. To make the most of your vacation
you have to plan meal by meal ... which we are only too happy to do
for you. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   DINING-SANFRANCISCO _ SAN FRANCISCO _ You don't ask for seconds
at the French Laundry, the Napa Valley restaurant where any meal
may consist of 15 mini-courses. Each is a two-bite inspiration, an
arresting sensation of the here and now slipping down your throat.
That is the reason that people book their plane tickets around a
reservation at Thomas Keller's 62-seat sensation that has become
the non plus ultra of America's dining destinations. To reserve,
you must call two months to the exact calendar date ahead of time,
and be prepared for stinging rejection if others beat you to the
punch. But even if you can't book at the French Laundry, the Bay
Area has now more than ever enough outstanding dining options to
guarantee a thrill at every turn. To make the most of your vacation
you have to plan meal by meal ... which we are only too happy to do
for you. (Kessler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   BIO-PARK _ SANTO DOMINGO DE HEREDIA, Costa Rica _ The guide's
voice was curiously lacking in urgency as she turned suddenly,
pointed to my feet and said: ``Watch out for the coral snake.'' Her
warning had all the concern of someone telling me I was about to
step on a wayward house cat or an errant ball instead of a highly
venomous tropical serpent. Welcome to the National Institute for
Biodiversity Park, a unique environmental theme park that opened in
February. (Martz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio was carrying on the other day about how he's a
genuine New Yorker who rides the subways, whereas Hillary uses a
``chauffeured limousine'' _ a vehicle never previously seen in New
York, apparently _ when, according to The New York Times, someone
asked him how much a MetroCard costs.
</P>
<P>
   It was slightly a trick question: You can buy the cards _ for
use in buses and subways _ in various amounts. Unfortunately $3 _
Lazio's guess _ isn't one of those amounts.
</P>
<P>
   No politician, I presume, ventures into public these days
without knowing the price of a gallon of milk, to show that they're
regular guys who go grocery shopping and need to worry about what
ordinary things cost (``I don't know, but a liter of gin is about
$15,'' would not be a good answer, even in New York).
</P>
<P>
   All that knowing the price of milk really proves is that you've
got good handlers. Lazio probably was ready for the milk question
when he got blindsided by the subway one. Serves him right, of
course, for his tiresome harping on what a real New Yorker and
regular guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-Lazio TV commercial being run by the Conservative Party
mysteriously picks up these very themes, although by law it is
supposed to be uncoordinated with the Lazio campaign. It's a photo
montage that (according to the voice-over) ``could be from any New
Yorker's life'' or ``could be from Rick Lazio's own photo album,''
but (according to the Times) is mostly stock images from ad agency
files.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Lazio was born and raised in New York. Went to
college there too (Vassar). He then went to law school in D.C.
(American University). A stint as a county prosecutor and then, in
his early 30s, he was elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now he wants to be a senator and probably dreams of being
president. He is, in short, a career politician and has been one
his whole adult life. His passions and aspirations are in
Washington, not New York. If he actually does know the price of
milk, he looks forward to forgetting it. He would like to have a
job that required you to ride around in a limousine without
requiring you to admit you like it.
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing wrong with any of that!
</P>
<P>
   Another way to put Lazio's story is that this man decided early
on to dedicate his life to public service. That he is directing his
brains and ambition toward democracy instead of capitalism. (You
get a limo if you win either of these lotteries.) Unfortunately,
while our culture currently treats naked business ambition as
almost saintlike, it treats naked political ambition as shameful.
</P>
<P>
   In a free-market economy, one person's business success can, and
often does, benefit everybody _ though it's not clear why we need
to be wildly grateful on top of the material rewards. Political
success, by contrast, requires at least some direct concern about
the general good. Yet political success in America also requires
pretending that political success is not your life's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's party is partly responsible for his tragic inability to
come out of the closet and admit his desires. The Republicans have
promoted a powerful variant on populism aimed at an elite of
politicians, professors, artsy-fartsy types, and suchlike
specimens. When this works, as it worked wonderfully from 1980
through 1992, it redirects public resentment from the traditional
financial elite and any favors the GOP may be doing for its members
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with those years, anti-pol populism seems like a spent
force. Gosh, remember term limits? What a frenzy that was. We
almost had a constitutional amendment! Millions of Americans, most
congressional Republicans, not a few Democrats, and George F. Will
all became convinced that life was unbearable if anyone could serve
in Congress for more than six years. Then Republicans won control
of Congress (running on term limits, among other issues), times got
good, people got bored, the issue disappeared, life went on.
</P>
<P>
   It's now safe for a politician _ even one who got elected
initially on term limit _ to run for a fourth or fifth term. But
it's still not safe to openly admit that you're a career
politician. Let alone add ``and proud of it.''

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 21st century, few concepts are so insane as to be
completely discounted.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of our political scandals, our hit TV shows, our
sensational murder cases, transcends almost any threshold of
disbelief. Unless we hear that Jesus is playing the World Music
Theater in Tinley Park (``He sold out faster than Buffet!'') or
Regis Philbin has mastered the art of flying by flapping his arms
really fast, we're not really surprised by anything any more.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an oxymoron, but we're gullible cynics. Hardly
anything surprises us, so we question the veracity of few things.
For example, would you be shocked if I told you about plans for a
chain of funeral theme parks?
</P>
<P>
   We live in a country where the Key West experience is sanitized
in a Key West theme park 300 miles from the real Key West. Where a
half-sized Eiffel Tower and a near-replica of the Statue of Liberty
rise above the Strip in Las Vegas. Where you can play the part of a
19th century slave being hunted down in a theme park in Indiana. So
why not a park about the most amazing journey of all?
</P>
<P>
   ``Death faces all of us,'' reads the message on the home page of
the Final Curtain Web site, at www.finalcurtain.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lack of imagination which accompanies our
passage. Until now, the handling of death has been regimented and
boring; limited by those who control it, whether the state, church,
morticians or our survivors. At the Final Curtain, we are throwing
away all the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Final Curtain is a series of memorial parks dedicated to
creative souls ... clients are encouraged to develop site-specific
works of passage _ their own tombstones, mausoleums, caskets or
urns _ as homage to their lives and spirit ...''
</P>
<P>
   The web site includes profiles of the Final Curtain's management
team, information for potential investors, links to media coverage,
and maps and descriptions of a typical theme park, with
restaurants, gift shops, galleries, a museum and other
``world-class facilities allowing for a spiritually invigorating
and aesthetically rewarding visit.''
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about features such as the Paradise Museum.
Dante's Grill. The Heaven's Gate Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Memorial Park is the cemetery proper,'' explains the site.
``This section of the park encompasses the artists' Monument
Gardens as well as the Timeshare Greenhouse and various ...
entertainment areas.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, timeshare. They're offering you the chance to
``join our timeshare program through which we transport your
remains to several of our parks on a rotational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   You think that's weird, consider the description of the eternal
flame exhibit: ``On a hill overlooking the lake and amphitheater, a
massive rectangular black granite wall stands engraved with the
names of innumerable art critics. At the center of this solitary
structure, a huge menacing flame burns in testament to the vitriol
and spiteful tongues of the not-so-dearly departed. Guests perusing
this structure will find the floor of the monument sloping down
toward the base of the eternal flame. A doorway is located at the
base of the flame and is the entrance to Dante's Grill.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the graffiti wall, where visitors can write
their own feelings about death, whether their own or someone
else's. Not to mention the children's playground. Talk about
morbid.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that about 40 newspapers, a dozen magazines and
more than 20 radio and TV stations have done stories about the
Final Curtain. The Los Angeles Times, the London Daily Telegraph,
the Boston Herald, NPR, Mother Jones magazine. Even in our crazy,
jaded times, some stories make you shake your head and say, ``Are
you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. Turns out The Final Curtain is pure hoax.
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't the work of some 19-year-old cyberprankster. The
creator of the elaborate Final Curtain hoax was Joey Skaggs, a
professional practical joker who has been yanking media chains for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   I could have fallen for this one myself. I remember seeing a
little item somewhere about the Final Curtain and writing a note to
myself: ``Possible column?'' If I'd logged onto the site, if I'd
interviewed Skaggs posing as one of the executives, if I'd read the
items and stories in The Los Angeles Times and Mother Jones and
heard the report on NPR, I would have been certain about Final
Curtain. And I would have been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for me and for other journalists who hadn't yet been
duped, Skaggs himself blew the whistle with a press release
explaining the joke. Some of the bamboozled reporters took the joke
in good stride; others were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Final Curtain is only a hoax for now. Someday,
somebody will come up with an afterlife theme park. Skaggs may be a
hoaxster, but don't be surprised when he turns out to be a
visionary.

   GECKO-STICKY-FEET (San Francisco) _ They're Tokay geckos _ big,
sometimes nasty-tempered lizards that resemble miniature dinosaurs.
Their feet are almost unbelievably sticky, which allows them to
scamper across walls and ceilings with ease. With so much ease, in
fact, that scientists at the University of California at Berkeley,
Stanford and elsewhere are investigating an astonishing possible
explanation for their stickiness based on invisible micro-forces of
the atomic world. By KEAY DAVIDSON.

<P>
   VOCATIONAL-EDUCATION (Albany, N.Y.) _ Facing fears that some
high school students won't pass the New York state exams to be
required for graduation, some Board of Regents members want tests
tailored to vocational students. The idea is to improve the
educational program _ and job prospects _ for the roughly 295,000
high school students in such courses as auto mechanics, building
trades and computer networking. But educators fear the new exams
may prove onerous to those who study trades and who previously were
not required to take the tests. By RICK KARLIN.

   CAREERS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The best employees think like

companies think like customers. If you consider yourself a good
employee and you see that your company is about to lose a customer,
do whatever you can to fix it. If your corporate culture frowns
upon that, think seriously about whether you're working for the

   LOLA-GLAUDINI (San Francisco) _ While writer and director Greg
Harrison makes an ambitious stab at exploring San Francisco's rave
subculture in his new film, ``Groove,'' it is actress Lola Glaudini
that most moviegoers will walk away remembering. Either Harrison
saved all of his best lines for Glaudini's character, Leyla, a
transplanted New Yorker whose dreams of continuing her education
seem to have once again dissolved into the nightlife, or Glaudini
is the one actor in the film capable of lending her character any
real depth. Let's go with the second option. By CRAIG MARINEB.

   PERFECT-WINE (Sebastopol, Calif.) _ As a single mother, Barbara
Hom often sits down to a meal of grilled cheese sandwiches and a

wine. But don't ever accuse her of being a wine snob. In fact, her
philosophy might be summed up this way: Never apologize for your

 &HT;    Refilling ink cartridges saves money but can be risky
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I read that a kit has been developed and is being sold that
allows you to refill black or color printer ink cartridges. I want
to try it but can't remember the company offering the kits. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Dobrin, Beachwood, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are two schools of thought on refilling ink
cartridges in printers. One is that you shouldn't do it because the
risk outweighs the cost savings. The other is to get a good kit and
do it right to save a buck or two.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, if you get a bad kit or refill the ink cartridges
improperly, you run you the risk of spilling ink inside your
printer. You could have quite a mess on your hands, literally. All
the money you would have saved is put toward getting your printer
cleaned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On the other hand, you can save quite a bit of money.
You'll pay $25 to $30 for four to six color refills. As for the
black cartridge, you'll pay about the same for the kit but get 10
to 15 refills. Think about it. Instead of paying 20 bucks a pop,
you're getting several refills for the price of one. Be aware,
different printers require different ink formulas. No one ink works
for every printer. Make sure you buy specifically for your printer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You cannot refill indefinitely. You may be able to refill
up to 20 times if you take care of your cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are many companies out there that provide this
service. Check out Richland Marketing at www.refills.com. They have
kits for Apple, Canon, Epson, HP and a few others. Other sites to
research are www.netwares.com or
www.affordableprinter.com/right.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing our PC, we want to ensure all personal account
numbers and information are removed. Is there software available?
One suggestion was to reformat the hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Nicolson, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Your concern is legitimate. Deleting files doesn't
necessarily erase those rascals. It just removes pointers or
references to where those files are located. Anybody who knows
squat about a computer can recover that data. Even reformatting the
hard drive can still leave data behind that somebody can ferret
out.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: The good news is that there are utilities that can zap your
data for good. They act as electronic paper shredders. One option
is BCWipe for Win 95/NT. It's a free disk tool that gets rid of
files permanently. Go to cnet.com, and search for BCWipe.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Another file-wipe freebie is Eraser for Win 95/98/NT. It
overwrites files over and over using carefully selected patterns.
It removes all the magnetic bits and pieces from the hard disk.
It's also at cnet.com. Also, a good source for these two utilities
and freeware in general is freewarefilez.com.

BODY-LANGUAGE RULES ARE CHANGING AT U.S.-RUSSIA SUMMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following ``separate buy'' article from SLATE, the premier
online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New
York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   (Anne Applebaum writes a column for the London Sunday Telegraph)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that the two presidents do not know each other,'' one
official cautioned The New York Times during the recent
Clinton-Putin summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Putin,'' opined their correspondent, ``seems unlikely to
achieve with Mr. Clinton the easy-going 'Boris and Bill' chemistry
that dominated during Mr. Yeltsin's two terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters put out a similar warning in the opening of one of its
dispatches:
</P>
<P>
   ``The normally gregarious U.S. president appeared cautious and
on guard at his joint news conference with Russian president
Vladimir Putin ... the body language and manners of the two leaders
throughout the summit were friendly and polite, but lacking
spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, President Putin felt obliged to reassure the
waiting cameras that ``we've established now not only good business
ties, but also personal ones,'' just in case anyone should doubt it
_ for clearly, it matters if they do.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton meets Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, no
one cares if the two strike up a friendship or instantly hate each
other. Nor is much interest raised by the warmth, or lack of it,
evinced by the American president toward his French counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   True, photographs have been taken of the Clintons eating dinner
with the Blairs, but these seem to have been carefully designed to
boost Tony Blair's image as a ``statesman'' in Britain and have had
no impact whatsoever in the United States, where no one knows Tony
and Cherie from Sonny and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is different: When the American head of state meets
the Russian head of state at a meeting which we still insist on
calling a ``summit,'' everyone instantly feels compelled to talk
personalities, friendship, small talk, and bear hugs, or absence
thereof. The habit dates from the days when Kremlinology _ the
science of who sat next to whom at the funeral _ was our principle
means of analyzing the internal workings of the Soviet elite.
</P>
<P>
   So addicted did we get to the idea that whoever was in power had
to be our president's friend, and whoever was not in power ought to
be treated with utmost suspicion, that, once upon a time, the
funerals of Soviet leaders were actually genuinely sad occasions _
for us.
</P>
<P>
   On the occasion of the death of Stalin, one of the most horrific
dictators of the 20th century, the Times of London (I once looked
it up) described him as ``successfully piloting his country through
periods of crisis'' and remembered him fondly as a man whose ``hair
was gray and stiff as a badger's ... he spoke softly, moved slowly,
but his expression was quizzical, like a man enjoying a hidden
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no mention of Stalin's fondness for little
children and flowers, there was, nevertheless, a word of warning
about the unknown ``hard-liners'' who might now be waiting in the
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it was easier in those days to be fooled. But
virtually the same language, I am sorry to say, was used 30 years
later when Brezhnev died: ``He was, above all, more predictable ...
he has helped to give the Soviet Union a degree of stability,''
opined the Times, before moving on to ruminate about the
``hard-liners'' of whom we must now beware.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, since the collapse of the Soviet Union nearly a
decade ago, we haven't managed to kick the habit: We still need to
feel some personal attachment to whoever is ruling Russia and to
interpret smiles and chitchat as signs of international ``warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, still obsessed with the hard-liners in
the wings, duly lauded Gorbachev when he was on the inside and made
a point of snubbing Yeltsin _ refusing him an official White House
meeting _ when he was president of a Russia which was still part of
the USSR.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when it was Yeltsin on the inside, the Clinton
administration, lulled by those bear hugs, directed vast quantities
of money and energy into ensuring that ``the president's friend''
stayed in charge, at one point urging the disbursement of a
disputed International Monetary Fund loan just in time for
Yeltsin's re-election campaign _ and just in time for Yeltsin to
quickly hand out months' worth of unpaid salaries to millions of
state workers.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin won, everyone felt relieved that someone we
``knew'' would still be in charge, all the while failing to notice
the growing corruption around Yeltsin, the endemic cronyism, and
the mysterious absence of the ``reforms'' that the IMF loans were
really meant to be promoting in the first place. Yeltsin, in the
end, became so closely associated with the United States that it
gave the United States a bad name in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Not much better, on another level, was Al Gore's equally
ill-advised ``friendship'' with Viktor Chernomyrdin, a Russian
prime minister and natural-gas mogul whose links were even shadier
than Yeltsin's. So angered was Gore by a CIA memo warning the vice
president of rumors of corruption swirling around Chernomyrdin,
that he is said to have scrawled the word ``bull__'' across the
top: That, after all, is what honorable men do when their dear
friends are slandered.
</P>
<P>
   But why should our leaders be ``friends'' with Russia's leaders?
Why our insistence on warm personal relations with this particular
set of foreigners? Partly, as I say, it's got to be a Cold War
hangover. Partly, perhaps, it is something to do with legitimate
fear of Russia's nukes. Yet this isn't sufficient either: The Cold
War has been over for a decade, and although the Chinese have nukes
too, you don't hear anyone worrying about how Clinton is going to
get along with Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   My last guess is that it is something to do with a subliminal
American longing to have a ``soul mate'' in Europe: not some ditsy
country the size of Alabama, full of dukes and duchesses, but
another big, multiethnic land mass with a president, lots of time
zones, and acres of empty space.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Russia is never quite the way we imagine it to be
_ nor are ``friendships'' between statesmen worth much if they
blind us to what is actually happening abroad. We shouldn't be
supporting individuals in Moscow anyway, only policies.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of positive body language at the recent ``summit''
ought to be seen as step forward: If the arrival of the distinctly
impersonal, uncharismatic, and unfriendly Vladimir Putin helps rob
us of the illusion that, deep down, the Russians are just like us,
perhaps that is no bad thing.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cell phones and autos
 &HT;    For release June 11, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One of those sport utility vehicles the size of Montana
was lugging in on me from the center lane. As I looked up, way up,
I noted that the driver, cigarette dangling from her lips, was
otherwise occupied talking on her cellular phone. I sounded my horn
to gain her attention, thus saving me from extensive auto repairs
and, likely, a visit to the emergency room _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   I now know what I fear most: not the giant urban chariots
themselves but people in them (and other vehicles) who talk on cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a high school honors student who was skating on a
bicycle path near my home was struck and killed by a car that
veered off the road and came onto the parallel path. Reports say
the driver either was talking on her cell phone or had dropped it
and was leaning to pick it up. Either way, she was distracted from
her driving, lost control and someone died.
</P>
<P>
   The case against using cell phones while operating a vehicle has
been building for some time. Already, laws have been passed in
several states to deal with it. Now, such a movement is under way
in Florida; a direct result of the death of the young lady.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who maintain that hands-free cell phones will
remedy the problem, and there are those who insist that it will
not, that the real problem is the distraction of talking; of being
attentive to something other than your driving.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, I came upon an old newspaper clipping the other
day that would tend to agree with those who say it is the act of
talking on the phone, more than holding it, that poses the greatest
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1956, there was a story in the Miami Herald that a local
auto insurance agent would not write policies for people who had
radios in their cars. He referred to accidents with which he was
familiar that ``were the direct result of drivers' attention being
distracted because they were listening to ball games instead of
concentrating on driving safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the agent overreacting? Probably. An All-State sales
manager, interviewed in the same article, said there was ``no
evidence that the driver of a car which carries a radio is either
worse or better than the driver of an automobile not so equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I can recall quite a few times when I was listening to the
auto radio _ ball game, talk show, news _ and lost my concentration
on the road. In fact, even today, when one of those heavy South
Florida cloudbursts strike while I'm driving, I turn off my radio
because I feel it is interfering with my ability to concentrate on
that sheet of water running down my windshield, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Does this relate to cell phones? Yes it does. I have had an
automobile with a hands-free phone and ones that require
hand-helds. In either situation, I sometimes found myself
concentrating too much on what was being said, either by me or the
other party, and needed to take quick action to correct my driving.
</P>
<P>
   Distraction is a major danger to auto safety. It is not limited
to cell phones or radios and that's why selective bans may not be
the cure-all. There are also many out there who believe roadside
billboards can distract a driver from his or her attention to the
highway. Others, like me, believe they are a welcome break during
an otherwise monotonous, sleep-inducing long haul on a turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, cellular telephones have been under attack.
There's the brain tumor thing, and the driving safety factor, both
persistent arguments _ whether documented or not.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many cellular calls made from or to automobiles are
necessary and how many are just social, passing the time of day
while driving along; the latter to which I often would plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A cellular phone is a valuable instrument to have if your car
breaks down, if you are in an accident or if you become lost.
However, all three stated necessities can be handled by the
roadside, while the vehicle is not in motion.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the cell phone antagonists are contending, and the
death of that lovely girl on the bike path is just the sort of
tragedy that could lead to more legislative bodies passing
prohibitive laws about in-motion calls.

SCIENCE ENCROACHES ON FANTASY'S LAST REDOUBTS

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CHARLES PAUL FREUND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a former Trappist monk named Laurence James Downey
hijacked an Aer Lingus flight over France. He didn't want money,
and he wasn't demanding the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted was for Pope John Paul II to reveal the dreaded
Third Secret of Fatima, first vouchsafed, according to Catholic
tradition, to three Portuguese children in 1917 during a series of
visions of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Downey thus earned a special place in the curious world of wild
history, a tradition that seeks solutions to the past's more
intriguing unanswered questions. It is an often-fascinating world
of mystery, anomaly, hidden history, and occult knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one that is suddenly shrinking. More and more of the
past's secrets are being revealed, especially in the laboratory,
and the results are considerably different from the drama and
romance that are at the heart of the wild historical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The last secret of Fatima _ the others had long ago been
revealed _ was certainly one of the world's best-kept secrets; some
Catholics had staged hunger strikes to force Rome to reveal it, and
even many non-Catholics wondered what sort of apocalypse the
Vatican could find literally unspeakable. Nuclear war? Schism? The
Antichrist?
</P>
<P>
   The associated papal folklore was quite promising: Popes, on
learning the secret, were reputed to have fainted or to have been
left speechless for days.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Vatican finally resolved the matter: Fatima's
remaining secret, it said, prophesied the 1981 shooting of Pope
John Paul II. While dramatic, the news fell short of the Apocalypse
that had dominated speculation for over 80 years. That the
much-feared prophecy had been fulfilled 20 years ago was, for some,
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks before the church revealed its Fatima secret, a
pair of geneticists announced that they had resolved the mystery of
the Lost Dauphin. In 1795, the 10-year-old son of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette died in prison. Or did he? As soon as the boy was
reported dead, stories arose that the real dauphin had been rescued
and a substitute left in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   People have been arguing about little Louis XVII for 200 years.
Hundreds of books address the mystery, including Huckleberry Finn,
and a long line of claimants has intrigued their contemporaries.
Indeed, one claimant is buried in the Netherlands under a headstone
that identifies him as the heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists have now compared DNA from locks of Marie
Antoinette's hair with DNA extracted from the heart of the boy who
died in the French prison. They match. The Lost Dauphin has been
found, and disappointed romantics will have to take what succor
they can from the unlikely fact that a succession of people
harbored the little prince's desiccated heart as a curio for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, disappointed romantics of history had best keep a
careful eye out for such succor. Last year, DNA findings also ended
speculation about the ``real'' fate of Czar Nicholas II and his
family. That wild history had included the names of the Romanovs'
courageous rescuers, their escape route, a history of sightings, a
parade of claimants, a hit movie, and a Pat Boone record.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerating use of modern laboratory techniques in
resolving old mysteries is very good news for history. But it may
not be such good news for the cause of enchantment. Since at least
the Enlightenment, enchantment _ a sense of wonder at the anomalous
and the seemingly inexplicable _ has been in rapid retreat from the
world. One of its last redoubts (if one omits the purely spiritual,
a quite different category) has been in the odd nooks and crannies
of history's unanswered questions. There, nourished by an infinity
of possibility, history is transmuted into the Romantic.
</P>
<P>
   There are compelling themes running through wild history. Among
the most common is the Secret Survival. The desire to believe that
a particular figure is actually alive, despite reports to the
contrary, is a powerful aspect of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   In our own time, JFK supposedly lived on a remote island
belonging to Aristotle Onassis, and Elvis has of course been
sighted in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that the Doors' Jim Morrison faked his death is
virtually interchangeable with once-popular beliefs about the
19th-century Czar Alexander I. He was said to have faked his death
to become a monk.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent survival stories are attached even to such figures as
John Dillinger, John Wilkes Booth, and comedian Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, not all such alternate histories gain followings.
For example, there is an intriguing case to be made that Joan of
Arc was not burned at the stake after all, but returned to France,
married, raised two children, and died the peaceful death of a
country woman. The tale of the post-stake Joan was told
exhaustively by Jules Quicherat in 1841, but the material is
infrequently cited. What wish is fulfilled by a Joan who survives
her burning?
</P>
<P>
   Lost Identity is nearly as popular. Instances are relatively
rare _ the mysterious identities of Kaspar Hauser and ``The Man in
the Iron Mask'' are the best-known examples _ but the enthusiasm is
bottomless. Wild histories have turned both figures into secret
royalty (though the most likely candidate for the man behind the
mask _ actually made of cloth _ is Gen. Vivien de Bulonde,
imprisoned for cowardice).
</P>
<P>
   Hauser, the total innocent who turned up in Nuremberg in 1828 _
only to be mysteriously murdered in 1833 _ is approaching the
transcendent: The point of Werner Herzog's 1975 film about Hauser
is his very lack of an identity or place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other such themes. Unacknowledged Genius cults
honor Wilhelm Reich, inventor Nikola Tesla, and the Earl of Oxford
(as the true Bard). Hidden Murder theorists re-examine the deaths
of Napoleon, Warren Harding, and Meriwether Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of these themes are necessarily false by any means; many
reasonable persons have been drawn to such subjects, sometimes to
the benefit of ``mainstream'' history.
</P>
<P>
   But what often marks wild history as a field is its tendency to
solve one mystery by positing another, often greater one. The case
of Jack the Ripper is a legitimate whodunit, but its wild versions
involve not only the British royal family but also the Freemasons.
The suicides of Habsburg Crown Prince Rudolph and Mary Vetsera at
Mayerling in 1889 are certainly bizarre, but wild history turned
them into an assassination with international implications.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing such case involves a place called
Rennes-le-Chateau, where wild history has grown to unprecedented
proportions. In 1885, Beranger Saunier, priest of a poor, remote
French parish, was repairing his dilapidated church and found a
pair of unusual old documents. He was soon very wealthy. Just why
is not known, but proffered solutions have included the Holy Grail,
the Cathar heresy, the Knights Templar, the lost treasures of the
Jerusalem Temple, and the possible survival of Jesus. And these are
the comparatively reasonable elements of an expanding library of
wild, cosmic histories.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy enough to dismiss wild history as tabloid
history, but that would be missing the point _ not only of the
histories but of tabloids as well. Wild history is often a popular
art, offering similar satisfactions. The admirable survive death;
the lost are found; the guilty accused.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, wild history takes that which is extraordinary but
incomplete and fills it out to the most extraordinary dimensions
imaginable. The world is then made marvelous again, enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   Comes science with its DNA and its bioarchaeology, its mummy CAT
scans, its satellite imaging, its sonar, its computer analysis, and
soon lost cities are found, dead royalty turns out really to be
dead, pretenders to be but pretenders. The past must then reveal
itself in fantasy's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the past pays its debt. Who would have dared
imagine that a child's heart could have been lovingly saved until
it could, in effect, speak for the Lost Dauphin and return him to
history?

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CHARLES PAUL FREUND &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a former Trappist monk named Laurence James Downey
hijacked an Aer Lingus flight over France. He didn't want money,
and he wasn't demanding the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted was for Pope John Paul II to reveal the dreaded
Third Secret of Fatima, first vouchsafed, according to Catholic
tradition, to three Portuguese children in 1917 during a series of
visions of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Downey thus earned a special place in the curious world of wild
history, a tradition that seeks solutions to the past's more
intriguing unanswered questions. It is an often-fascinating world
of mystery, anomaly, hidden history, and occult knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But it is one that is suddenly shrinking. More and more of the
past's secrets are being revealed, especially in the laboratory,
and the results are considerably different from the drama and
romance that are at the heart of the wild historical tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The last secret of Fatima _ the others had long ago been
revealed _ was certainly one of the world's best-kept secrets; some
Catholics had staged hunger strikes to force Rome to reveal it, and
even many non-Catholics wondered what sort of apocalypse the
Vatican could find literally unspeakable. Nuclear war? Schism? The
Antichrist?
</P>
<P>
   The associated papal folklore was quite promising: Popes, on
learning the secret, were reputed to have fainted or to have been
left speechless for days.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Vatican finally resolved the matter: Fatima's
remaining secret, it said, prophesied the 1981 shooting of Pope
John Paul II. While dramatic, the news fell short of the Apocalypse
that had dominated speculation for over 80 years. That the
much-feared prophecy had been fulfilled 20 years ago was, for some,
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks before the church revealed its Fatima secret, a
pair of geneticists announced that they had resolved the mystery of
the Lost Dauphin. In 1795, the 10-year-old son of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette died in prison. Or did he? As soon as the boy was
reported dead, stories arose that the real dauphin had been rescued
and a substitute left in his cell.
</P>
<P>
   People have been arguing about little Louis XVII for 200 years.
Hundreds of books address the mystery, including Huckleberry Finn,
and a long line of claimants has intrigued their contemporaries.
Indeed, one claimant is buried in the Netherlands under a headstone
that identifies him as the heir to the French throne.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists have now compared DNA from locks of Marie
Antoinette's hair with DNA extracted from the heart of the boy who
died in the French prison. They match. The Lost Dauphin has been
found, and disappointed romantics will have to take what succor
they can from the unlikely fact that a succession of people
harbored the little prince's desiccated heart as a curio for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, disappointed romantics of history had best keep a
careful eye out for such succor. Last year, DNA findings also ended
speculation about the ``real'' fate of Czar Nicholas II and his
family. That wild history had included the names of the Romanovs'
courageous rescuers, their escape route, a history of sightings, a
parade of claimants, a hit movie, and a Pat Boone record.
</P>

EASING INTO BACKYARD BLISS

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
So you want to get away without taking an elaborate vacation? OK.
Pick a nice warm day _ which shouldn't be difficult these days.
Step outside, take a good look around and repeat the following
(mood music and chanting rhythm optional):
</P>
<P>
   My yard is my sanctuary ... My yard is my sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it can be. With a little bit of work, that little
bit of at-home seclusion will be yours for the enjoying _ during
the warm summer and all year long.
</P>
<P>
   How much work, and what kind, is strictly up to you. Homeowners
have been known to hire a landscaper to redo their entire garden or
build an enclosed atrium or gazebo. Creating your sanctuary could
involve bringing in some comfortable patio furniture, or installing
a hammock that practically screams ``Relax!'' _ or perhaps simply a
chaise and some strategically hung wind chimes will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to part with a little more cash might install a
pond, a fountain or both. The sound of water, say garden and design
experts, is a tranquillity enhancer. Ditto, the presence of
chirping birds, which a well-stocked feeder or bird bath is likely
to bring. Plants like columbine and buddleia will attract birds and
butterflies. Use ferns for the shadier areas. Trees can be soothing
and effective as a buffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when people do some privacy planting of trees around
the perimeter zone,'' says Randy Mineo, owner of the Chatsworth
Nursery Center and Custom Landscaping. ``You won't have anyone
staring in. Plus, it's greenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Landscaping is by no means your only option. You can carve out a
bit of seclusion using anything from a simple bench to some
decorative lighting to careful use of shade. Maybe the aromatic
plants will help you set the mood. Or maybe, it's all in the
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Fritz, home decorating consultant for Target stores, says
glass gazing balls that reflect surrounding areas are gaining
popularity as well. Officials from Home Designs say little outdoor
wood fireplaces called chimeneas are starting to ... er ... heat up
with customers anxious for some evening outdoor lounging.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing balls, stepping stones, outdoor fireplaces ... where to
even begin?
</P>
<P>
   First, consider your space, experts say. Determine what sorts of
atmosphere enhancers you find relaxing, then figure out what works.
Develop a philosophy about what you're trying to achieve, whether
the goal is to re-create a Mediterranean garden or simply to carve
out a little hideaway where you can sneak off to be alone and quiet
with your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I describe it, the idea is to bring the indoors
outside and the outdoors inside, blurring the lines between the
two,'' says Linda Hallam, the Iowa-based editor and writer of two
outdoor decorating books (``Garden Style'' and its follow-up
``Garden Style Projects'') published by Better Homes and Gardens.
``Just going outside isn't all that comfortable if you don't have
the shade and somewhere comfortable to sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Shade from the summer heat is critical, which is one reason
large market umbrellas will never be out of style. Only the shapes
and colors will change says Gil Kemp, president of the Home
Decorators Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the person with the 1/2-acre yard has more options
than the one with the townhouse balcony. If you've got enough yard
space to make strolling a viable option, landscape designer Rita
Goodman recommends incorporating elements of the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little meandering pathways, with a little surprise at the end
like a fountain or a bench,'' says Goodman, the owner of Rita
Marshall Goodman Designs in Tarzana. ``Something where you don't
see everything at once. Maybe you'll have a gateway or a trellis
leading into another area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do really lovely things in a very small space with
furniture, the right lighting and plants if you lay everything out
properly,'' she added. ``Figure out what's going to be dominant and
what's not so important.''
</P>
<P>
   A small and somewhat challenging space is precisely what Mary
Stephenson had to work with, since her Saugus home is built into a
hillside. She ended up putting in a pond and a waterfall, but
didn't make that area a place to sit and relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no walkway, but you can look out over it and just get
an overall feeling of calmness,'' says Stephenson. ``I can hear the
waterfall through all of my windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson works at Garden Concepts in Santa Clarita, a store
that specializes in fountains, statues and ponds. Garden Concepts
recently helped restore and enhance a 1-million-gallon outdoor fish
pond and fountain at the Norton Simon Museum of Art in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of us don't need something on quite that large a
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like whimsical,'' says Garden Concepts co-owner Melissa
Moat. ``We've built a pond out of a whiskey barrel with a little
sprayer frog. Some people only want to spend $300. Others will
spend $5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   A secluded bit of backyard bliss doesn't necessarily mean your
entire yard has to be off limits. When she moved into her Agoura
Hills home, Carlyn Medaglia says she and her husband expected to
leave her large yard rustic and parklike. A portion of the hillside
was lost during flooding, so the Medaglias had to resurface with
railroad ties and overhanging bushes. They also have a somewhat
tucked-away gazebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've left it pretty natural,'' Medaglia says.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of it. The family also had growing children who
would later use the large grassy area to practice soccer and
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking to do some evening outdoor lounging can do a lot
with mood lighting. Votive candles and luminarias are popular, as
are many different types of lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always use one color, usually a warm light with a low
voltage,'' says Goodman. ``It adds an extra sparkle to the trees.''

<P>
   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Should the United States worry about a nuclear strike on one of
our cities by a rogue nation in the next few years? Can we build a
system that would shoot down such missiles?
</P>
<P>
   If so, should we spend tens of billions of dollars on a limited
system or hundreds of billions on a more ambitious plan? Would
Russia and China retaliate by building up their nuclear arsenals to
overwhelm our defenses?
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 presidential campaign has now turned to these important
questions. George W. Bush proposes to build a complete missile
defense system while making major cuts in our nuclear arsenal. Al
Gore proposes a lesser defensive system combined with less drastic
reductions. Here's how they're framing the issues.
</P>
<P>
   GOAL VS. PROCESS -- Bush focuses on numbers and timetables. He
talks about how many missiles we need (a lot fewer), how much
missile defense we need (a lot more), and how fast we can get
there. Gore argues that we should focus less on reaching numerical
targets than on moving carefully and nurturing the arms control
process. ``Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' says
Gore. ``It is how reductions are made and how they interact with
defensive systems that makes the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   LEADERSHIP VS. COOPERATION -- To Bush, individual initiative is
virtuous. He says he'll sharply cut U.S. nukes no matter what the
Russians think of it. This, he repeatedly argues, demonstrates
``leadership.'' He promises to ``seize the moment'' and ``lead by
example'' rather than wait for ``years and years of detailed arms
control negotiations.'' To Gore, this kind of spontaneity is
dangerous. Along with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Gore uses the word
``unilateral'' as a pejorative. ``Nuclear unilateralism will
hinder, rather than help, arms control,'' Gore argues. ``Strategic
stability can never be a one-way street.'' Instead, Gore recommends
``cooperation,'' ``negotiation,'' and ``agreements'' with Russia
and other nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE VS. STABILITY -- Bush loves to talk about how ``new'' his
ideas about nuclear defense are. He's got a ``new vision,'' a ``new
concept,'' and a ``new approach.'' He says Clinton and Gore
inexcusably ``delayed'' building a missile defense. Bush wants as
big a missile defense as possible, at the ``earliest possible
date.'' Newer, bigger, faster, better. Gore rejects this equation.
His principal buzzword is ``stability.'' Gore shuffles verbs to
make Bush's proposals look like destructive change, as opposed to
the constructive change advocated by Gore. Bush's plans would
``destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' which ``is the
cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with
Russia.'' Gore's plans, on the other hand, would merely ``adjust''
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE VS. THREAT -- Bush and his Republican supporters see
missile defense as an issue separate from and morally untainted by
the question of U.S. nuclear weapons. ``These are defensive
systems. They harm no one,'' pleads Sen. John McCain. Gore,
however, sees the two issues as dynamically linked, on the theory
that a stronger U.S. missile defense reduces the retaliatory power
and thus the deterrent effect of Russian nukes, leaving Russia
naked to a U.S. strike. Arms reductions, according to Gore, must be
considered in terms of ``how they interact with defensive
systems.'' Likewise, Albright says the United States must ``try to
make sure that the offensive and defensive weapons systems continue
to be linked to each other, not to separate'' them.
</P>
<P>
   PERSUASION VS. ANTICIPATION -- In the Kosovo war, congressional
Republicans argued that NATO military action was unwise because the
Serbs would react aggressively. Clinton and Gore took the opposite
view: Rather than allow the Serbs to impose consequences on NATO,
NATO would impose consequences on the Serbs. We, not they, would
set the terms. In the missile defense debate, these roles are
reversed. Gore argues that the Bush missile defense plan is unwise,
because ``the Russians have made clear that their response to a
powerful U.S. defensive system would be to halt arms control and
increase the numbers of their offensive nuclear weapons.'' Bush
rejects the assumption that Russia will necessarily retaliate. He
believes that the United States can set new terms and persuade
Russia to react differently.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's persuasion plan has two elements. First, he's going to
convey his peace-loving sincerity to Russian President Vladimir
Putin. ``I'm going to look him right in the eye and say, 'You're no
longer the enemy, and we're not your enemy,''' says the governor.
Bush adds that he will ``clearly state the intentions of the United
States, that we're a peaceful nation and that we look forward to
working together with Russia to keep the peace.'' Second, he's
going to ``invite'' and ``convince'' Putin to go along. ``We should
invite the Russian government to accept the new vision I have
outlined, and act on it,'' says Bush. ``I would work closely with
the Russians to convince them to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   URGENCY VS. HAND-TYING -- Clinton is pressing the missile
defense issue with Putin because the United States has set a
timetable that requires a decision by the end of this year in order
to build a system capable of shooting down a rogue-state missile by
2005. But Bush thinks Clinton's system is insufficient, and he
worries that Clinton will cut a deal with Putin limiting the
missile defense plan in exchange for modifying the ABM treaty. This
puts Bush in an awkward position. While pleading for the ``earliest
possible'' deployment of his own system, he accuses Clinton of
``driving toward a hasty decision, on a political timetable. No
decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the
hands of the next president and prevents America from defending
itself'' with a more robust missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments in this debate are as hard to keep track of as the
missiles. Eight years ago, Clinton and Gore were posturing about
boldness and change, while Bush's father was defending the virtues
of patience, steadiness, and diplomacy. It was Bush's father, too,
who struck an agreement on missile reduction in the last year of
his term, tying the hands of the next president. And it was Richard
Nixon who signed the ABM treaty that tied everyone's hands. But
that didn't stop Nixon's national security adviser, Henry
Kissinger, from showing up at a press conference two weeks ago to
tout George W. Bush's plan for dumping that treaty.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Vision so dominates our perception that we give precedence to
what our eyes tell us _ even when that information contradicts more
accurate data coming from other senses.
 &HT;    When you watch television, for example, dialogue seems to emerge
from the actors' mouths, not the set's speakers.
 &HT;    And although many mammals overindulge their eyes as we do, a
few, such as bats and dolphins, navigate by sonar, emitting clicks,
chirps and grunts and using the echoes to determine the location of
things around them.
 &HT;    Sonar may seem a bizarre method of finding one's way, but humans
can be surprisingly good at it. Blind people, for instance,
navigate pretty well by listening to echoes from the tapping of
their canes. We can locate where sounds originate because we have
two ears and a brain that automatically analyzes differences in the
timing and intensity of sounds.
 &HT;    When a noise is closer to one ear than the other, its acoustic
energy will reach that ear faster and louder than the other ear.
Try these experiments to see how well your brain extracts location
from time and intensity cues.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    With a friend, 10 feet of string, a nine-inch square of
cardboard, a straight pin, a soda straw and some tape, make a
``sound locator'' as shown in the accompanying photo. Make sure the
string rests on top of the cardboard and that the straw and the
string don't touch.
 &HT;    Sit in a large, quiet room with your eyes shut and your head
facing forward, holding the locator in front of you. Your friend
grasps the loose end of the string and stands 10 feet away at seven
different points: directly in front of you at 12 (as on the face of
a clock) and near but not exactly at 9, 10, 11, 1, 2 and 3 _ but in
random sequence.
 &HT;    At each new position, your friend sings a single note _ bong _
for two seconds in the lowest pitch he or she can muster. Be
careful that your friend doesn't tug the string too hard _ it will
give her location away.
 &HT;    Point the short end of the straw in the direction you think the
bong came from. Then open your eyes and note if the straw and the
string agree. The difference between the two marks represents the
degree of accuracy with which you locate each sound.
 &HT;    Now repeat the experiment at each of the seven positions _ only
this time have your partner emit a loud click with his or her
tongue and palate. Switch places with your accomplice and compare
performances.
 &HT;    If you're like most people, your errors were small but probably
increased as the bongs and clicks moved farther away from 12. You
should have done better with the clicks, which carry a wider range
of tones for acoustic neurons to work with.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    While voicing bongs in experiment 1, you might have noticed that
the person holding the locator tilted his head. Some blind people _
or those who are deaf in one ear _ do this because the head
rotation provides the brain with information about the intensity of
sounds and their arrival times from different positions, making
noise localization more accurate.
 &HT;    Now, have your friend repeat the bong and click experiment while
you hold the locator. Move your head quickly from side to side to
see if this reduces localization errors. Switch positions and
repeat.
 &HT;    Paying close attention to the acoustic world can help you get
around better in the dark and keep your brain healthy by vigorously
exercising seldom-used auditory pathways.
 &HT;    Visit www.discover.com/brainworks for more sound effects that
exploit time/intensity differences _ but with a riveting third
dimension guaranteed to astonish you.

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.

demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck

blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.

 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves

possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.

 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

WHAT'S DOING IN SALT LAKE CITY  
 &HT;

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By MATTHEW BROWN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Mormon pioneers came to this once desolate, high-desert valley
to get away from the rest of the world. But 153 years later, the
roughly 1 million people living at the base of the Wsatch
Mountains are preparing to welcome the world for the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
 &HT;    In Salt Lake City, work crews are erecting two hotels and
expanding the Salt Palace Convention Center. Interstate 15, widened
to 12 lanes, will stretch the length of the valley, joining a new
light-rail train to help handle the expected crowds of athletes,
spectators and workers.
 &HT;    Athletes are already training at the Utah Olympic Park, about 30
miles east of the city. Visitors can tour the park ($5 a car) and
even try out some of the courses.
 &HT;    But sports aren't the only attractions this summer: The city is
host to an international music competition and the Utah Arts
Festival.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    At Olympic Park in Park City, every Saturday beginning July 1
spectators will be able to watch members of the American and other
free-style ski teams slide down an artificial surface to a ramp
that sends aerialists twisting and flipping in the air before
splashing into a 750,000-gallon pool.
 &HT;    And you can try it yourself: for $125, intermediate skiers 15
years and older can be coached for a day in free-style aerial
skiing on July 8, 15 and 22 and Aug. 5 and 19.
 &HT;    Even nonskiers can get a taste of the sport daily from July 1 to
Sept. 1 by strapping into a harness attached to thick bungee chords
while an instructor helps with back flips and other maneuvers. The
cost is $5 for up to five minutes.
 &HT;    For the less adventurous, tours of the bobsled run and ski jumps
are given daily 11 a.m., and 12:30 and 2 p.m. The 60- to 90-minute
tours cost $6; $4 for seniors and children 5 to 11. For park
information, call (435) 658-4200.
 &HT;    A different kind of challenge is the Gina Bachauer International
Junior Piano Competition and International Piano Festival. The
competition _ among 27 contestants ages 11 to 13 from nine
countries _ takes place June 13 to 17 in Assembly Hall on Temple
Square downtown and is free. The top six contestants play a concert
June 24 at 7:30 p.m.
 &HT;    The festival, honoring the 250th anniversary of the death of
Johann Sebastian Bach, includes guest artists performing recitals,
lecturing and teaching master classes, in which a pianist is given
a lesson before an audience. Tickets to the master classes, June 19
to 23, cost $20 a day or $75 for five days from (888) 521-9200. The
free recitals, June 1 to 28, feature the complete keyboard works of
Bach.
 &HT;    The Utah Arts Festival takes place noon to 10 p.m. June 22 to 25
at the Utah State Fairpark, 155 North 1000 West. Jazz, folk, pop
and classical music, modern dance and poetry readings will take
place on five stages. Food from around the world will be available,
125 artists will sell their works and there will be hands-on art
projects. Admission is $5, $2 for age 60 and older and for everyone
on Thursday and Friday from noon to 3 p.m.; children under 12 are
admitted free.
 &HT;    Fourth of July celebrations will take place at Sugarhouse Park,
1500 East 2100 South, and Rice-Eccles Stadium, at the University of
Utah. Beginning at 1 p.m. in the park, there will be food, an arts
festival, activities for children, and in the evening, a
performance by the Utah Symphony and fireworks. The celebration is
free but parking is limited; (801) 535-6323.
 &HT;    At the stadium, the Red Hot 4th Stadium Extravaganza will
feature music by the bands Chicago and They Might Be Giants.
Tickets are $12, $18 and $24 from the Huntsman Center, (801)
581-6641, or Smith's Tix, (800) 888-8499.
 &HT;    From July 17 to 24, world champion cowboys converge on Salt Lake
City for the Days of '47 Rodeo in the Delta Center, 301 West South
Temple. Competition is nightly at 7:30. Tickets cost $10.50 to
$29.50 from Ticketmaster, (801) 325-7328. Information: (801)
325-2000.
 &HT;    The city will nearly shut down on July 24 for the 153rd
anniversary of the Mormon pioneers' arrival to the valley. Salt
Lake residents hold services, parades, road races, festivals and
fireworks. The Days of '47 Parade begins at 9 a.m. along 200 East
and ends up at Liberty Park, 600 East 1300 South, where a
Neighborhood Fair and Native-American celebration and fireworks
will take place.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Visitors and lifelong residents alike marvel at the majestic
mountains that ring the Salt Lake Valley, which offer hiking for
all levels.
 &HT;    For an easy walk, head to City Creek Canyon just north of
downtown. From Second Avenue and Canyon Road, walk north through a
residential area and Memory Grove Park, then follow the road to a
gatehouse, where a five-mile paved road begins. Walkers and
cyclists have it to themselves on odd-numbered dates, and walkers
share the road with cars ($2.50 a vehicle) on other days. The
canyon is open 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Call (801) 483-6880 to reserve
picnic sites, which cost $2.50 to $30.
 &HT;    More demanding trails and climbing can be found in Millcreek
Canyon, east of the city _ (801) 483-5473 for information _ and Big
Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Canyons, to the southeast, (801)
466-6411.
 &HT;    They say the sunsets are beautiful from Buffalo Point on
Antelope Island. But the best time to visit the largest island in
the Great Salt Lake may be in the morning, when the pesky gnats and
mosquitoes are not swarming.
 &HT;    Antelope Island State Park, 30 miles northwest of Salt Lake City
off I-15, is home to a 500 buffaloes that roam freely, along with
mule deer, big horn sheep, antelope and coyotes. More than 30 miles
of hiking trails reach vantage points that offer spectacular views
of the lake. Take your own water. The island's beach at Bridger Bay
is the best place to experience the sensation of floating on the
salt water.
 &HT;    Park fees are $7 a vehicle or $4 per cyclist or pedestrian. The
30 camp sites cost $10 a night. Information: (801) 773-2941; camp
site reservations: (800) 322-3770.
 &HT;    At Temple Square, visitors can learn about Mormonism, get a
close-up view of the six-spired Salt Lake Temple and walk inside
the domed Tabernacle.
 &HT;    But another popular place is across the street in the church's
Family History Library, 35 North West Temple, (801) 240-2331. The
library has the largest archive of its kind in the world and is a
gold mine for genealogists of any faith or belief.
 &HT;    For newcomers to the searching out of one's roots, the library
has computer terminals with easy-to-use software. Terminals are
also at the Family Search Center in the Joseph Smith Memorial
Building, 15 East South Temple. Use of the library and center is
free. The library is open Tuesday through Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 10
p.m. and Monday 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Center hours are 9 a.m. to 9
p.m., Monday through Saturday.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel Monaco, 15 West 200 South, with 1930s French decor, is a
lively addition to the downtown hotel scene. The daily manager's
social at 5 p.m. offers guests a free neck and shoulder massage
with a glass of wine. The hotel is a refurbished 15-story bank
building with 225 rooms, a restaurant and a bar.
 &HT;    The 10-foot ceilings and extra-long beds make it a favorite for
visiting professional basketball teams. A double room is $149;
(801) 595-0000, fax (801) 532-8500.
 &HT;    For a more conservative setting there is The Inn at Temple
Square, 71 West South Temple. The 90 rooms, most of which have
views of either the Mormon Temple or Abravanel Hall, the city's
premier concert hall, have the look and feel of a country inn. The
inn and its restaurant do not serve alcohol. A double with a
king-size four-poster bed is $130 on weekdays and $99 on weekends.
 &HT;    Rates include a hot breakfast; (800) 843-4668, fax (801)
536-7272.
 &HT;    Little America Hotel and Towers, 500 South Main St., offers a
broad selection of accommodations _ from the Governor's suite for
$800 a night to motel-style rooms for $59 on weekends. There are
850 rooms in the tower and other buildings, two restaurants, two
swimming pools, a fitness room, a hair salon and four gift shops. A
double in the spacious tower suites is $164, while smaller garden
rooms go for $129. Rates drop about $35 or more on weekends; (800)
453-9450, fax (801) 596-5911.
 &HT;    Budget: Downtown Hampton Inn, 425 South 300 West, is close to
some of the city's best restaurants and microbreweries. The
158-room hotel has an indoor pool, hot tub and exercise room. A
double is $79, with Continental breakfast; (801) 741-1110, fax
(801) 741-1171.
 &HT;    Luxury: Wolfe Krest Bed and Breakfast, 273 North East Capitol
Blvd., is the newest and one of most luxurious B&AMP;Bs in the area.
The three-level Georgian revival mansion was built in 1905 and has
13 rooms, one with wheelchair access, all with fireplaces. Rates
are $150 to $300, with a hot breakfast either in your room or in
the dining area; (800) 669-4525, fax (801) 531-0522.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Under state liquor laws, the New Yorker Club, 60 West Market
St., (801) 363-0166, is considered a private club, but nonmembers
can buy a two-week membership for $10, which is valid for six
people. It offers elegant rooms with Italian marble floors and soft
lighting.
 &HT;    Appetizers include ahi tuna roll with a rich wasabi butter
sauce; a popular entree is roast rack of lamb with rosemary cream
and fresh vegetables. Try the raspberry almond tart for dessert. A
meal for two with wine is about $150. Like all but one of these
restaurants, it is closed Sunday.
 &HT;    The owners of the Metropolitan, 173 West Broadway (at 300
South), (801) 364-3472, have transformed a former warehouse into a
chic, pricey spot. The intriguing menu includes a pudding-like
Maine lobster tapioca brulee, Asian pear salad, and seared
yellowfin tuna in a citrus sauce. A dessert of fruit soup comes
with a corkscrew of caramelized sugar. Dinner for two with wine,
$160.
 &HT;    The basement location in a dingy strip mall belies the excellent
Tuscan food at Michelangelo Ristorante, 2156 South Highland Drive,
(801) 466-0961. Ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms and Parmesan
cheese is served in a rich sauce of truffle oil and butter. The
tiramisu is excellent. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    To get out of the punishing summer heat, head up Emigration
Canyon to Ruth's Diner, 2100 Emigration Canyon Road, (801)
582-5807, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can sit in the
original dining car or on the patio next to the creek and try
anything from burgers and salads to spicy coconut curried shrimp. A
favored dessert is Ruth's bananas _ a parfait of sliced bananas,
vanilla ice cream and warm rum sauce. Dinner for two with wine,
$50. No reservations, and the wait can be long for Sunday brunch.
 &HT;    For a step back to the time of car hops, burgers and malts, head
to Hires Big H, 425 South 700 East. The place is swarming with
teen-agers and families craving the Big H burger on a soft
flour-dusted bun ($2.65), greasy fries ($1.65), and thick malts
($2.29). You can order from your car or eat inside.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By MAC GRISWOLD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There is now another pressing reason to visit Wales this summer,
besides Welsh Black beef, cut from the only cattle in Britain that
have never been fed anything but good green Welsh grass, or so the
Welsh say.
 &HT;    After dining royally on one of those filets cooked by Rod
Peterson, the acclaimed chef at the Cawdor Arms Hotel in Llandeilo,
I headed for the new National Botanic Garden of Wales in nearby
Llanarthne. There I was delighted to find the same natural-systems
approach to the world, but transformed into the most advanced _ and
good-looking _ sustainable machinery for keeping plants, people and
interior climates in sync.
 &HT;    The heart of the 568-acre garden, the first new national botanic
garden in Britain in two centuries, is Sir Norman Foster's
312-foot-long transparent oval bubble, the Great Glass House,
rising lopsidedly above what was once private parkland and pasture.
 &HT;    It is sunk into the hillside to conserve heat and tilted to
offer views of the countryside as well as to receive maximum sun.
The garden hadn't opened when I visited in December, but the solar
machinery was already cranking comfortably.
 &HT;    Additional heat comes from an environmentally friendly ``biomass
burner,'' also handsomely housed by Foster &AMP; Partners and fueled by
wood cut from a nearby coppice of trees, the kind that can be cut
back to stubs that will continually sprout new shoots (poplars,
willows).
 &HT;    These are especially vigorous thanks to a boost from the
nutrient-rich water produced by a natural waste treatment system
that handles all effluents. And if that hard-working coppice
doesn't provide enough fuel, local contractors will be given tax
rebates to haul in clean lumber waste.
 &HT;    The botanical garden is the first in the world where the energy
demands required to care for rare and endangered plants have been
designed to have as little impact on the environment as possible.
It is also the first to group together in one macroclimate the
flora of a single ecosystem from all continents, instead of having
a little glass-enclosed rain forest, say, followed by a separate
desert enclave.
 &HT;    The computer-generated high-precision geometry that has made
global architecture more curvaceous and freeform (Frank Gehry's
Bilbao Guggenheim, or Foster &AMP; Partners' Canary Wharf station
entrances to the London Underground) has been used here to make one
large arched chamber, the largest single-span glass greenhouse ever
built.
 &HT;    The ecosystem it displays is what is known as ``Mediterranean,''
which confusingly includes other regions that are nowhere near the
Mediterranean itself.
 &HT;    Chile, California, Southwest Australia, South Africa and the
Canary Islands all possess geographic areas and climatic conditions
that are similar to those of Cannes, Morocco or Israel. Together
these regions account for only 1.7 percent of the Earth's surface,
but they provide habitat for over 20 percent of all known plant
species. Many of them, such as tender ceanothus or plumbago vine,
are among the most beautiful garden plants, those that American
temperate-zone gardeners like me long to grow.
 &HT;    Inside, under the spare arches of Sir Norman's building, lies an
18-foot gorge slashed into the earth by the American landscape
architect Kathryn Gustafson, whose radically pared-down designs can
be seen in France, England and the Netherlands. (She has also been
commissioned to design the terrace for the new Rose Center for
Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New
York.)
 &HT;    A walk down between its pale buff sandstone ``cliffs,'' now clad
in plants grouped by their regions, is a conservatory experience
different from any other because of the dramatic change in levels.
At the bottom lies my favorite of these Mediterranean zones, the
low evergreen ``forest'' of the Canary Islands, one of the most
endangered and unknown habitats on earth.
 &HT;    A mere 115 square feet, this ``forest'' has a waterfall and a
sunken pool and is planted with lovely, rare laurels, willows and
viburnums that are barely hanging on in their native home. Up at
the top, on the concourse level, there is a restaurant serving
light fare tucked under the north rim of the building with a view
over Gustafson's ``canyon'' and the Welsh hills beyond. (A more
substantial restaurant occupies a former stable.)
 &HT;    The garden's decision to know its plants from birth was very
important, considering how threatened many of the plants in this
glass house are. Though the staff now depends on some nursery-grown
stock for immediate effect, it eventually aims to have plants only
from seeds of known natural provenance, in order to preserve stocks
of genetic diversity and vigor.
 &HT;    There is a lot more going on at the garden, much of it rather
elaborate and symbolic (groups of rocks represent Wales' geologic
ages, for example). The plantings seem too sketchy to support the
heavy theoretical freight. They will grow and soften and be better
in a decade. Now, much of the garden has that bare, just-planted
look.
 &HT;    In the meantime I found that the best thing to do, besides
wander through the Great Glass House and marvel at the brainy
sustainable systems, was to climb Paxton's Tower. This 18th-century
folly perched on a nearby hill offered a marvelous chance to look
down on the design for the future I had just wandered through.
 &HT;    The other Welsh garden I visited, nearby Aberglasney, definitely
looks to the past. In 1471 when a Welsh bard, Lewis Glyn Cothi,
wrote about ``A fortress made bright by whitewash,
/And encompassing it all around, nine green gardens ...'' he was
probably thinking of Aberglasney and its owner at the time,
Rhydderch ap Rhys, whose skills the poet compared to those of Adam,
the first gardener.
 &HT;    Current archaeology has turned up nothing that links the
present-day garden layout with that 15th-century paradise, but it
has revealed something almost as rare: a Renaissance garden with
high walls, a cloister, a parapet walk _ the works _ the only such
design in the country known to have survived.
 &HT;    A gatehouse once thought to be a garden folly is in fact the
original 17th-century entrance to a courtyard. From there an
archway opens into the enclosed garden that lies just below the
much later (Queen Anne) house.
 &HT;    The remains of a delicate double flight of stairs leads to the
spot on top of the wall where a summer pavilion once stood. It
faced what are now the crumbled outlines of an airy banquet room.
From there, Sir Rice Rudd, owner of the garden in the mid-17th
century, would have looked down onto his parterres.
 &HT;    Parterres of what? Grass? Gravel? Boxwood? Nobody yet knows.
Part of the excitement here is the uncertainty of date and purpose
of many of the garden features.
 &HT;    Stories of recovering and saving this mystery buried under as
much as five feet of soil, trash and stinging nettles keep
horticulturists and preservationists agog, however.
 &HT;    Aberglasney changed hands many times and has suffered many
vicissitudes, including having the Ionic columns of its fine
porticoed house mysteriously ``disappear,'' only to turn up in a
Christie's catalog. They were set back in place late in 1999, part
of the overall plan of the Aberglasney Restoration Trust, financed
by an anonymous American benefactor, beginning in 1995.
 &HT;    This is the first spring that Aberglasney will be open to the
public. Though excavations continue inside the cloister, a fine
trio of gardens in adjoining walled enclosures has been recently
planted and still looks new. One surrounds a 17th-century oblong
pool; another is a typical kitchen garden; the third was designed
in concentric ovals by Penelope Hobhouse, the noted English garden
designer.
 &HT;    For the framework, she used only evergreens known to gardeners
during the Rudd period of the garden, but boldly filled her design
in with top-class ornamental plants, ancient and modern, from every
corner of the globe.
 &HT;    Hardly a Welsh garden but a good stop en route to the other two
is Hergest Croft, in Kington, Herefordshire, close to the border.
Gardened intensively for over a hundred years by three generations
of plant collectors and aficionados who luckily also had a sense of
design, Hergest should be better known to Americans _ if only
because it is so quintessentially English.
 &HT;    Paradoxically, when the English garden, they often want to leave
home, in the sense of letting their imaginations wander wildly to
exotic places. Does this happen because they live on such a small
island or because they once had such a large empire?
 &HT;    The reasons are not clear, but at Hergest, the 50-acre garden
begins at home in England in the exuberant conservatory of a robust
Victorian red brick house. It adjoins a picture-perfect kitchen
garden furnished with crooked old apple trees and a pair of
herbaceous borders.
 &HT;    Next comes a series of linked spaces, mostly planted with the
trees and shrubs for which Hergest is famous, including 59
Champions of the British Isles (the largest trees of their kinds).
There are more than 4,000 species and hybrids planted with tutelary
intelligence and high art, and about as many ways to enclose or
open views both large and small as exist in the world.
 &HT;    A visitor finishes in the Himalayas, in what is known as Park
Wood, a secret valley high-shaded by oaks and beeches where
rhododendrons bloom from January to August. Many specimens were
planted as early as 1910; they tower 20 feet tall or higher as they
do in their native habitat. Cascades of flowers rush down their
sides.
 &HT;    I walked into this wood on a June morning when the mist was
curling up from the pond at the rhododendrons' feet, and knew I was
traveling with Kubla Khan in Xanadu.
 &HT;    After a trip to the future at the Great Glass House, into the
past at Aberglasney, and far into a Coleridgean fantasy at Hergest,
I was ready for another piece of Welsh Black beef.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: THREE GARDENS IN FOUR DAYS  
 &HT;    Following is a proposed four-day itinerary for seeing the three
gardens:
 &HT;     DAY 1  _ Take the train from Paddington Station (three hours)
to Swansea to pick up a car rental (Alamo has locations in both
Swansea and Worcester). Train fare $102 first class, $69 standard
class, at $1.60 to the pound. From Swansea take the M4 to exit 49
for Llandeilo _ about 35 minutes.
 &HT;    Spend the night in Llandeilo at the Cawdor Arms Hotel. You can
walk to the ruins of nearby Dinefyr Castle and back in the
afternoon. Dine at the Cawdor Arms. Walk around the pretty town of
Llandeilo.
 &HT;     DAY 2  _ After seeing the National Botanical Garden (morning)
and Aberglasney (afternoon) _ a picnic lunch can be packed by the
hotel or you can have lunch at the botanical garden _ spend a
second night at the Cawdor Arms. (Aberglasney can provide a list of
other nearby hotels and B&AMP;Bs.)
 &HT;     DAY 3  _ Head to Hergest Croft in Kington, Herefordshire, near
the Welsh border, taking a picnic (available from the Cawdor Arms).
A two-hour drive via the A40 north to Llandovery, the A483 to Buith
Wells, then the A481 and then the A44 to Kington.
 &HT;    The place for dinner and the night after seeing Hergest is
Broxwood Court, with an 1858 garden by the Victorian landscape
designer William Nesfield, 10 minutes away.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN K. LUDWIG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Blanketed with snow until midsummer, Mount Shasta's Upper
Panther Meadow was warm early last September and bright with Indian
paintbrush, yarrow and cliff penstimon.
 &HT;    From the trailhead at around 7,600 feet, my husband, Karl, and I
had walked gently uphill along a grassy creek to the source spring
considered sacred by Indians, who still conduct ceremonies there.
It is a small sandy pool rimmed by flowers and rocks, with lovely
cold water bubbling out.
 &HT;    After tasting the spring water we joined several others who sat
nearby meditating. Then we climbed a bit higher for another view of
the snowy slopes rising above us.
 &HT;    At 14,162 feet, Mount Shasta towers above the surrounding hills
and dominates the Northern California landscape for hundreds of
miles. It has long exerted an almost mystical pull on climbers,
philosophers and naturalists.
 &HT;    On his first view of it, the naturalist John Muir wrote, ``my
blood turned to wine,'' and in 1888 he proposed preserving the
region as a national park. It was an idea whose time never came,
although a fraction of the originally proposed acreage was finally
added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1983.
 &HT;    By the time of the Wilderness designation, the pristine rivers
that burst from mountain springs in the area and still make it a
prime fishing destination had long been harnessed by Shasta Dam
about 50 miles to the south near Redding, Calif.
 &HT;    Completed in 1945, the dam created Shasta Lake, whose placid
waters and 365 miles of shoreline offer tamer alternatives to
fishing and boating enthusiasts as well as providing water and
hydroelectric power for an area stretching 500 miles south,
including Sacramento.
 &HT;    Fortunately for preservation, the mountain itself is far from a
large urban area, though the region is served by a major
north-south highway, Interstate 5.
 &HT;    In all of surrounding Siskiyou County there are fewer than
50,000 people; the City of Mount Shasta has only about 3,600
inhabitants. The other small towns that skirt the mountain, Weed,
McCloud, and Dunsmuir, also offer dramatic views of the dual-cone
peak and the curious lens-shaped cloud formations that gather above
it.
 &HT;    All four towns, which grew out of the region's early lumber and
railroad-based economy, now enjoy clear air and clean water; they
also assume the risks of living beneath a volcano that is currently
dormant but fully capable of erupting again.
 &HT;    Although Mount Shasta's last reported eruption was around 200
years ago, bubbling sulfurous springs near the summit are a
reminder of the mountain's turbulent inner life. Historically,
eruptions have occurred on average every 600 years, but today
careful seismic monitoring of the peak offers the prospect of early
warning.
 &HT;    Unfazed, or perhaps attracted, by the risks, thousands of
climbers annually attempt the ascent. However, fewer than a third
of them reach the summit, according to the United States Forest
Service, often because they've failed to train and acclimate or to
inform themselves about route and weather conditions.
 &HT;    A few years ago my husband, Karl, and I spent several days near
the City of Mount Shasta while he prepared to climb the mountain.
(He succeeded.) Charmed by the area, we returned early last
September for a more leisurely four-day stay.
 &HT;    After savoring Mount Shasta's presence from the other historic
and picturesque towns, we paid a brief visit to Lake Shasta where
we toured ancient Shasta Caverns and Shasta Dam, whose completion
transformed the region.
 &HT;    This mountain is extraordinarily buoyant and powerful. Not
surprisingly, many Indians view it as a spiritual center, and
traditionally considered it the Great Spirit's teepee or the
gateway to the inner earth.
 &HT;    The magic of the setting has also attracted strange myths that
have the mountain inhabited by ancient civilizations or UFO-flying
aliens.
 &HT;    After checking in at the popular Strawberry Valley Inn on the
main street of the City of Mount Shasta _ challenging because the
reservation system was as quaint as the setting _ we walked to
Village Books nearby.
 &HT;    Over an espresso we scanned books about the mysterious races
said to live within the mountain, the Lemurians and Yaktayvians,
and recalled that in August 1987, the mountain was one of the
gathering sites for the Harmonic Convergence, a worldwide event
marking a particular planetary alignment. In the store, notices of
services and events were evidence of the metaphysical and
alternative-healing community drawn to the mountain.
 &HT;    After breakfast at the inn, based in a 1920s stone house that
has a lovely terrace with a mountain view, we were off to City Park
to see the spring that supplies the headwaters of the Sacramento
River.
 &HT;    A man was balancing on the mossy rocks filling plastic water
bottles with the freshest of water, which flows in a gushing stream
out of the hillside and tumbles down an incline past picnic tables
and sports fields.
 &HT;    Our next destination was a contemporary war memorial outside the
nearby town of Weed, and apparently one of its chief attractions.
To reach the Living Memorial Sculpture Garden, we drove a dozen
miles northeast of Weed on Highway 97 alongside desolate black
mesas of lava flow.
 &HT;    The sculptor and Vietnam veteran Dennis Smith has dedicated to
all veterans his 10 works in metal (he is finishing the 11th),
groups of larger-than-life human figures with vaguely alien
features, including ``The Refugees,'' ``POW-MIA'' and ``Coming
Home.'' They stand in an austere but pleasingly laid-out garden of
Ponderosa pine, manzanita and chaparral with an exhilarating view
of the glacier-covered north side of Mount Shasta. No one else was
there.
 &HT;    Later that afternoon, back in the City of Mount Shasta, we drove
up the mountain's Everitt Memorial Highway about 14 miles to the
Upper Panther Meadow trailhead to visit the sacred spring. At
around 7,600 feet, it is just half a mile from the highest point
accessible by car.
 &HT;    The next day we turned our attention from the natural world to
humans' impact on it. The Mount Shasta Fish Hatchery stocks many of
the streams and lakes of Northern California with catchable trout.
One of the oldest operating fish hatcheries west of the
Mississippi, it began production in 1888.
 &HT;    An original hatchery building now houses the Sisson Museum, the
local history and ecology museum named for the town founder, Justin
Sisson. Photographs and artifacts chronicle the early climbing
history of Mount Shasta, and working models reflect the importance
of the Southern Pacific Railroad that was an essential lifeline
from San Francisco to the north.
 &HT;    The nearby historic lumber mill town of McCloud was our
destination for the night. Founded more than 100 years ago, it
ceased being a company town in 1965, and the Champion International
Mill closed in 1979.
 &HT;    However, the McCloud Railway Company and the McCloud Hotel have
been rejuvenated to take advantage of its picturesque setting and
its proximity to fine fishing and winter sports. Layoffs at the
remaining mill, P&AMP;M Cedar Mill, which processes cedar for pencils,
had just been announced, a reminder of the lumber economy's
fragility.
 &HT;    The McCloud Hotel is a handsome three-story building, yellow
trimmed in forest green. From its front porch bordered with pansies
and garlanded with wisteria, we could see Mount Shasta. Our
attractive and comfortable standard room combined two original
rooms and provided an up-to-date bathroom.
 &HT;    Though our schedule didn't permit it, many hotel guests cross
the street to board either an open-air excursion train or the
Shasta Sunset Dinner Train.
 &HT;    Before moving on the next day, we drove about seven miles east
of town to see McCloud Falls. Accessible by car, the three-stage
falls and river provide inviting swimming and fishing holes, but in
September we saw only a few other people.
 &HT;    On a hike from the lower to the middle falls we saw a fisherman
catch a nice trout, lending credence to the McCloud River's
reputation. Back in town we made a short stop at the Heritage
Junction Museum, whose eclectic, well cared for collection of
community artifacts, displayed in one large room, includes logging
equipment, sporting goods and household items.
 &HT;    Back on Interstate 5, it is only five miles south to Dunsmuir, a
town built in the 1880s to serve the Central Pacific Railroad.
Originally called Pusher, it was named for the helper engines that
boosted trains over daunting grades along the Sacramento River
Canyon.
 &HT;    The small, old-fashioned downtown, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, retains much of the 1920s architecture
of its heyday, and the trains (mostly freight) still roll through
the railyard almost hourly.
 &HT;    Just off the main street, Dunsmuir Avenue, are the visitors
center and the Enchanted Forest Porcelain Doll Factory. Here the
proprietor, Marian Anderson, produces collector-quality dolls with
some 650 faces and various ethnicities. Her not-for-children dolls
range in price from $169 to $2,000.
 &HT;    In the spirit of this historic railroad town, we spent the night
in a converted caboose. One exit south of Dunsmuir is the Railroad
Park Resort, where we checked into the Caboose Motel, where 22
cabooses and one boxcar, each an individual room, encircle a pool
and hot tub. We climbed aboard attractively decorated No. 17,
``Southern Pacific'' emblazoned on its side.
 &HT;    Our brass king-sized bed just left passage to the bathroom and
cupola, to which we climbed to enjoy our view of the towering
granite formations in nearby Castle Crags State Park.
 &HT;    After a smooth night on board our caboose, we headed to Lake
Shasta, about 35 miles south. The wild forested canyon and rushing
Sacramento River give way to the serene lake which forms arms and
fingers stretching into the neighboring hills.
 &HT;    Our first destination, Shasta Caverns, required a short boat
ride across the lake and a bus ride uphill. Even in September the
cool damp interior of the cave was a welcome relief from
temperatures in the '90s. We had to earn it on the tour, however,
by climbing up and down stairs, a total of 650 steps.
 &HT;    I'm not much of a spelunker, so I was happy that lighting was
good and stairs and paths well maintained. The limestone cave, long
known to Wintu Indians, was first explored by a white man, James
Richardson, with a Wintu guide, Charles Morton, in 1878 and opened
to the public in 1964.
 &HT;    Our hourlong tour refreshed our memories of stalactites and
stalagmites and unloosed our imaginations. Surrounding us were
dreamlike formations resembling popcorn and broccoli, or graceful
drapery and columns, and, directed by the guide's flashlight, a
tiger, pipe organ and castle.
 &HT;    Continuing on about 15 miles to 55-year-old Shasta Dam, the
second largest dam in mass in the United States, we parked right on
top. Down the 487-foot high spillway, three times the height of
Niagara Falls and the largest manmade waterfall in the world, only
a trickle of water flowed. Our guide explained that the lake was
down about 43 feet; in spring, with the winter rains and runoff, it
would probably be around eight feet from the crest.
 &HT;    He described construction of the dam from 1938 to 1945, a story
that is astonishing, both statistically and in human terms. For
instance, first a diversion tunnel 1,821 feet long had to be built
for the main line track of the Southern Pacific Railroad; then
workers labored for five and a half years pouring concrete 24 hours
a day to create the wall of the dam.
 &HT;    The tour included an echo chamber, the old railway tunnel that
later served to divert the river, and a view of osprey nests on a
power plant tower. A good tour, perhaps even, as the guide
maintained, ``the best dam tour in the USA.''
 &HT;    Leaving the area, we stopped at the vista point about a mile
from the dam, where we could see three Shastas: the dam and the
lake in the foreground and gleaming regal Mount Shasta in the
distance. While the dam was a powerful example of man's ability to
transform nature for better or worse, we were thankful for Mount
Shasta's mighty and humbling presence.

 PLEASE NOTE: We have included some optional trims in this article
to make cutting the piece for length an easier task. 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When are Americans going to stop obsessing about airline
prices and look at their hotel bills?'' asked Ed Perkins during the
recent meeting of the Editors' Council of the Society of American
Travel Writers.
 &HT;    Like many mature travelers, Perkins, retired editor of the
Consumer Reports Travel Newsletter, knows that when you analyze the
expenses for almost any trip, the biggest cost is often lodging.
 &HT;    I heard that loud and clear nearly a decade ago when Bill Todd,
then marketing director of Choice Hotels, told The Mature Traveler
that hotel discounts for seniors should be large enough to make it
worthwhile for them to want to alter their travel itineraries _ be
it driving 50 or 100 miles farther than planned or changing travel
dates from weekend to midweek or from high to low season _ to
capture the biggest savings.
 &HT;    This year, the dividing line between perfunctory discounts _
those offered because other establishments are doing so _ and
discounts of real value to seniors is much clearer, as I learned
while doing The Mature Traveler's annual survey of senior discounts
at hotels nationwide. Some promotional strategies that hotels are
using are not only elusive, but are a downright disservice to
customers of all ages. Here are some observations.
 &HT;    Many reservation operators are unfamiliar with their company's
senior programs. In fact, several had to look up the most basic
information, such as the eligibility age.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The concept of a flat percentage discount for seniors is
beginning to disappear. This became clear when many lodging
reservation centers explained that they couldn't disclose their
discount until I told them my destination and dates. This has to do
in part with room availability, which all discounts rely on, but it
certainly shouldn't affect a company's basic senior discount
policy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Many hotel reservationists at their 800 numbers even refused to
quote a senior discount price of any kind. In one instance, an
operator told TMT that she would provide ``the best price'' for a
specified hotel and date and make a reservation. She then said that
when I appear at the front desk to check in, ``You may get a senior
discount. I have no way to know for sure.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    More of the smaller, regional chains are giving discounts of
around 10 percent, but the offer is not necessarily chainwide since
each establishment decides whether or not it wants to participate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A great many chains have a two-tier discount system. One
discount is for members of AARP, CARP and Mature Outlook. The
second is offered by the hotel chain itself, can be a different and
lower percentage for non-members and, in many cases, has different
age requirements.
 &HT;    When a property or chain works to understand the mature-traveler
market and then develops a program based on what it has learned,
the programs are more usefulnot only to the hotel, but also to
seniors' pocketbooks and travel plans. For example, Hilton's Senior
HHonors program, one of the better deals in the industry, now
includes new brands that extends the program to nearly 2,000
locations compared to last year's 450.
 &HT;    The program, once limited to Hilton and Conrad International
hotels, is now available at Doubletree, Hampton Inns, Homewood
Suites and Embassy Suites. Open to those ages 60 and older, the
program costs $55 the first year in the United States, or $75
outside, and can result in discounts of up to 50 percent or better.
Benefits also include restaurant discounts and frequent-stayer
rewards.
 &HT;    The global impact of such a change: More overseas lodging groups
probably will be examining _ and changing _ their own offerings for
senior travelers to meet the competition.
 &HT;    Some special promotion packages include travel with
grandchildren, while others take into account the special interests
of the senior set by including anniversary offers _ activities such
as nostalgic music events and trips that commemorate moments of our
youth, like the end of World War II, the start of the Korean War or
the day Elvis Presley died.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, there's a downside to all these wonderful, new
options: For some, hotel-shopping has become a time-consuming
chore. Here are some strategies to simplify the process:
 &HT;     _ GO OUTSIDE THE BOX.  If your hotel of choice is known as a
``business hotel,'' catering mostly to corporate world, it is
likely to have special deals on weekends when business people are
home. A resort may have openings midweek when business people are
at work. If the location makes the bulk of its money during the ski
season, look for summer deals, etc. As mature travelers, we have
more flexibility than others on the road.
 &HT;     _ TRY ALTERNATIVES.  Investigate programs that offer other
travel benefits, such as homestays, home exchanges or bed and
breakfasts. These offer travelers the opportunity to learn about an
area from local residents _ and to get a good night's sleep.
 &HT;    A condo or apartment can supply much more space and freedom for
a group of two or four while helping to cut costs on meals. (Why
eat out when you've got your own kitchen?)
 &HT;    Campus accommodations or hostels can also lower your travel
budget. Lodging brokers or Web auction sites can be helpful, too,
however many mature travelers complain that the time it takes do to
a Web search detracts from the savings they might find.
 &HT;     _ DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM.  Make sure to carry that
all-important identification that can help cut costs _ namely, your
AARP/CARP card; frequent-stay hotel group cards; or proof of
membership to any lodging discount programs, such as the
Entertainment 2000 directories, which entitle members to discounts
of up to 50 percent off published room rates at certain hotel
chains.
 &HT;    One reader recently wrote to me about her experience trying to
locate lodging near the airport when her flight was canceled. She
found herself within walking distance of a hotel with a great
senior discount program while her peers paid two and three times
more. Guess her pals didn't know how important it is to ask for the
senior discount.

SHOPPING AROUND: WEEKEND DEALS IN AMERICAN CITIES  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Let's hear it for the big-city weekend trip. Maybe the agenda is
to sleep late and breakfast in the room. Or spend the day wandering
through museums and shops before working out in the hotel health
club. Or dine well and see a show. But whether it's San Francisco,
Chicago or New York (or Atlanta, Minneapolis or Boston), the
two-nighter in the big city is a time-tested formula for
stimulation and restoration.
 &HT;    Weekend city deals are often a good buy because business
travelers are a Sunday-to-Thursday phenomenon. Come Friday and
Saturday, those giant Hyatts and Hiltons have rooms to spare. But
shop around to make sure that a big-city weekend doesn't add up to
credit-card shock a month later.
 &HT;    Thanks to the Internet, hotels have the ability to calculate
occupancy and sell rooms much faster and more efficiently than ever
before. This means that there are many room rates floating around
out there.
 &HT;    Sure, a low rate may sound good, but the extras can be painful.
The $20-a-day parking fee, the $15 continental breakfast and the
$8-per-person fee to use the health club are how hotels derive a
significant amount of their revenue. So try to get a low rate and
as many perks as possible up front.
 &HT;    The first step: Do your research. This is crucial for first-time
visitors to a city, but since hotels open, close and get renovated
all the time, it's essential for returning visitors to do as well.
A good city guidebook from Fodor's or TimeOut is fine, as are
Internet city guides such Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) and
Citysearch.com (www.citysearch.com).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can be a good way to find affordable big-city
lodging. The best, nationally known ones, such as Quikbook (381
Park Ave. South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887;
www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill
Lane, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com), offer discounts from 15 percent to 40 percent
off the so-called ``rack'' or published room rates in dozens of
cities around the country.
 &HT;    Other brokers, such as Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave.,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123; www.express-res.com), work only
with New York and Los Angeles, while companies such as Washington
D.C. Accommodations (2201 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Suite C-110,
Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-554-2220; www.dcaccommodations.com)
specialize in a single city _ in this case our nation's capital.
 &HT;    The advantages to working with a hotel broker are
straightforward. They promise to save a traveler money. Period.
Hotels are grouped by price range, and there's no charge for their
services. But not every hotel is available through a hotel broker,
and smart travelers call a property directly to check the price.
Because room inventory fluctuates, hotels sometimes have a lower
price rate than discounters in order to sell off empty beds.
 &HT;    Another good source for weekend deals are the major lodging
chains, which frequently have lots of empty rooms on weekends.
Again, smart travelers call a property directly, call the chain's
toll-free number, visit the chain's Web site and see if the
property is available through a hotel broker. That may sound
time-consuming, and even overkill, but the room rates can vary
widely for the same room at the same property.
 &HT;    Some rates may include breakfast or parking privileges, while
others may be cheap, bare-bones room prices that can jump
dramatically once extras such as parking and breakfast are added
on.
 &HT;    Some hotel Web sites, like Marriott International
(www.marriott.com), require consumers to go through a
trial-and-error process for the best rates. Others are easier to
navigate and advertise their deals. Hilton Hotels (www.hilton.com)
has ``Hilton Value Rates'' for its properties _ rates that can also
be e-mailed to travelers every week.
 &HT;    Both Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.westin.com) and Sheraton
Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.sheraton.com) have ``Hot Rates'' _
Internet-only specials that provide up to 20 percent discounts on
weekends.
 &HT;    Hyatt Hotels and Resorts' Web site (www.hyatt.com) features
``Special Offers,'' with rates for ``Value,'' ``Getaway Next
Weekend'' and ``Packages.'' For a given property, the prices and
perks can greatly differ.
 &HT;    The two on-line giants, Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com)
and Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), are also sources for weekend
deals. The latter recently purchased Travelscape.com, which gives
it a base of thousands of hotel rooms around the country. They also
send out periodic discount hotel e-mailings.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, yet another source of weekend hotel
deals are offered by the airlines. Although the number of cities is
limited in nature, virtually all of the major carriers offer such
deals, often through their Web sites, including Delta
(www.delta-air.com), American (www.aa.com) and Continental
(www.continental.coml).
 &HT;    Delta Vacations, for example, has Standard, Preferred and
Ultimate air/hotel/transfers-inclusive vacations, based on hotel
categories. The cost obviously depends on the city chosen. But
because of the highly changeable nature of airfares between major
American cities, this convenient way of booking a city weekend may
not yield the best price.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, free spirits can let their trip be
dictated by the e-fares that the airlines post every week and which
Smarter Living.com (www.smarterliving.com) collates and sends out.
Just remember that most of these last-minute fares are only good
from Saturday to Monday or Tuesday.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I frequently travel to Italy on business and am tired of
the hotels my company books for me. Could you recommend affordable
lodging in hotels there that are authentic in design and cater to
American road warriors?
 &HT;     A  Golden Tulip Hotels and Summit Hotels &AMP; Resorts accommodate
guests in some of Italy's best locations and uniquely embody
classic Italian architecture, design and art. These hotels are
situated where visitors have complete access to the sites and
routines of Italy's greatest cities.
 &HT;    In Rome's city center, the four-star Bernini Bristol, Hotel
Giulio Cesare and GT Mecenate Palace have cozy, pastel-colored
rooms and characteristic Roman atmosphere ripe with detailed
columns and arches.
 &HT;    Naples boasts the gorgeous seaside Grand Hotel Santa Lucia with
ocean views and breezy enchantment in its marble lobby and bar. The
GT Grand Hotel Baglioni and Hotel Minerva keep guests in the middle
of the action as Florentines stroll by and congregate in the many
squares and bars that surround these stylish Tuscan hotels.
 &HT;    Also in Florence, Summit's exciting Hotel Brunelleschi
integrates a sixth-century Byzantine tower and 12th-century church
into the facade of their 96 rooms and private museum.
 &HT;    However, in Florence nothing quite captivates travelers like the
palatial Grand Hotel Villa Cora. In the center of exclusive Viale
Machiavelli Park, this mansion provides its visitors with a chance
to live like royalty in an extravagant house of riches.
 &HT;    All these hotels have dazzling restaurants with creative local
specialties and imaginative preparation. Most hotels provide
well-equipped conference rooms, fitness rooms and garden terraces,
as well as special services and suites for the American business
traveler.
 &HT;    Continental Airlines' partner, AerItalia, offers incredible
BusinessFirst seating to most destinations in Italy at a reasonable
price. Golden Tulip and Summit Hotels deliver the best of Italy at
very reasonable rates. For more information, call Summit at (800)
457-4000 and Golden Tulip at (800) 344-1212.
 &HT;     Q:  I am one of the few females that I know who enjoys playing
golf. But sometimes I find it intimidating to play with men, and I
rarely have the time to drive long distances to get to courses. Do
you know of any golf facilities near New York City?
 &HT;     A:  Why not make the most of a weekend by spending it golfing
and relaxing at Manhattan's Doral Park Avenue Hotel? This hotel
offers female guests an ``Afternoon Tee Golf Package'' that caters
to female golfers of all levels.
 &HT;    The package includes deluxe room accommodations, a complimentary
golfing book for women by Cheryl A. Leonhardt and a number of
members-only privileges at The Golf Club at Chelsea Piers, just
minutes from the hotel.
 &HT;    Also included is a one-hour private lesson (designed especially
for women) with a PGA instructor, club rentals and video analysis
of technique.
 &HT;    The Doral Park Avenue Hotel, located at Park Avenue and 38th
Street, has the feel of a European boutique hotel with Italian
marble baths and neoclassical furnishings and provides guests with
data ports, delivery of The New York Times daily and views of Park
Avenue and the Murray Hill district.
 &HT;    Prices for the ``Afternoon Tee Golf Package'' start at $305 per
weekend night and $345 for midweek nights.
 &HT;    For more information and reservations, call (877) 99-DORAL or
(212) 687-7050, or visit www.doralparkavenue.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are traveling more frequently to
developing countries for both business and pleasure. We always make
sure to get the necessary immunizations prior to departure.
However, where can we turn if, despite our efforts, one or both of
us becomes ill while traveling abroad?
 &HT;     A:  You are smart to be concerned, because 40 percent of
Americans traveling to developing countries contract illnesses from
bacteria, viruses or parasites that are unknown at home.
 &HT;    Although there are many travel-assistance or medical-evacuation
options available to international travelers, a new standard of
distance medical care is emerging thanks to technology.
 &HT;    WorldClinic at Lahey of Burlington, Mass., is setting such a
standard by providing patients abroad with immediate access to U.S.
board-certified emergency physicians 24 hours a day.
 &HT;    No matter how minor the illness, WorldClinic's physicians can
evaluate any medical situation, diagnose and treat the problem and
oversee all medical care until your return home. The firm prepares
its patients for departure by assembling medical records and
preparing custom prescription medical kits.
 &HT;    For more information, contact WorldClinic at Lahey at (800)
636-9186, or visit www.worldclinic.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  Help me find the perfect Mexican restaurant in Manhattan.
 &HT;     A:  Coming from Southern California, I consider myself a good
judge of Mexican restaurants, and for years have found that New
York City has few places for great South-of-the-border food.
 &HT;    Therefore, I was happy to encounter Casa Mexicana while passing
through the city. Here, Chef Luis Herrera and owner Ramon Angeles
create authentic dishes from different regions of Mexico and bring
dignity to the Tex-Mex scene.
 &HT;    Placing a romantic, hacienda-style space in the trendy Lower
East Side shows an ingenious stroke of imagination and common
sense. The cooking combines Mexican ingredients with creative
French culinary technique to create clever and tasty dishes, such
as chicken tamales wrapped in a banana leaf with sunflower seeds
and a mole poblano. Fresh sangria, Spanish wines and Mexican beers
are on hand. Don't miss pastry chef Josefina Hernandez's desserts,
such as rose tequila sabayon with rose-petal sorbet.
 &HT;    Casa Mexicana has a downstairs lounge with music for guests who
have given up the night's decision-making to the tequila and
sangria. Located at 133 Ludlow St., Casa Mexicana is a great way to
start a night out or to end one. For more information, call (212)
473-4100.
 &HT;     Q:  I would love to send my daughter on an exotic trip as a
graduation present, but I can't afford to go overboard. Do you have
any recommendations for spectacular but reasonably priced
vacations?
 &HT;     A:  Because it is considered the low season, right now is the
perfect time to visit the hip Caribbean island of St. Barts. Hotel
Guanahani, the island's only full-service small luxury resort, is
currently offering off-season packages through October.
 &HT;    Guanahani's ``St. Barts Spree'' gives guests a luxury ocean-view
room for five nights and includes round-trip airport
transportation, two meals daily, tax and service charges and either
a complimentary one-hour jet ski rental or two one-hour tennis
lessons. The best part of this package is the price _ only $1,650
for two people.
 &HT;    Most guests find the low season at St. Barts the ideal time to
visit since crowds have thinned and the weather is still sunny and
warm.
 &HT;    Boasting private gardens, colorful bungalows and two stunning
beaches, Hotel Guanahani provides everything a vacationer could
want _ from aquatic sports such as snorkeling and windsurfing to
tennis facilities (with a pro on hand to give advice and
instruction) to a tranquil lagoon where you can just unwind.
 &HT;    Hotel Guanahani also offers other low-season packages at
incredible rates from three to seven nights. Packages must be
reserved and fully paid before arrival.
 &HT;    For more information, visit http://www.leguanahani.com/, or call
Leading Hotels of the World at (800) 223-6800. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

WHAT'S DOING IN SALT LAKE CITY

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By MATTHEW BROWN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Mormon pioneers came to this once desolate, high-desert valley
to get away from the rest of the world. But 153 years later, the
roughly 1 million people living at the base of the Wasatch
Mountains are preparing to welcome the world for the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
 &HT;    In Salt Lake City, work crews are erecting two hotels and
expanding the Salt Palace Convention Center. Interstate 15, widened
to 12 lanes, will stretch the length of the valley, joining a new
light-rail train to help handle the expected crowds of athletes,
spectators and workers.
 &HT;    Athletes are already training at the Utah Olympic Park, about 30
miles east of the city. Visitors can tour the park ($5 a car) and
even try out some of the courses.
 &HT;    But sports aren't the only attractions this summer: The city is
host to an international music competition and the Utah Arts
Festival.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    At Olympic Park in Park City, every Saturday beginning July 1
spectators will be able to watch members of the American and other
free-style ski teams slide down an artificial surface to a ramp
that sends aerialists twisting and flipping in the air before
splashing into a 750,000-gallon pool.
 &HT;    And you can try it yourself: for $125, intermediate skiers 15
years and older can be coached for a day in free-style aerial
skiing on July 8, 15 and 22 and Aug. 5 and 19.
 &HT;    Even nonskiers can get a taste of the sport daily from July 1 to
Sept. 1 by strapping into a harness attached to thick bungee chords
while an instructor helps with back flips and other maneuvers. The
cost is $5 for up to five minutes.
 &HT;    For the less adventurous, tours of the bobsled run and ski jumps
are given daily 11 a.m., and 12:30 and 2 p.m. The 60- to 90-minute
tours cost $6; $4 for seniors and children 5 to 11. For park
information, call (435) 658-4200.
 &HT;    A different kind of challenge is the Gina Bachauer International
Junior Piano Competition and International Piano Festival. The
competition _ among 27 contestants ages 11 to 13 from nine
countries _ takes place June 13 to 17 in Assembly Hall on Temple
Square downtown and is free. The top six contestants play a concert
June 24 at 7:30 p.m.
 &HT;    The festival, honoring the 250th anniversary of the death of
Johann Sebastian Bach, includes guest artists performing recitals,
lecturing and teaching master classes, in which a pianist is given
a lesson before an audience. Tickets to the master classes, June 19
to 23, cost $20 a day or $75 for five days from (888) 521-9200. The
free recitals, June 1 to 28, feature the complete keyboard works of
Bach.
 &HT;    The Utah Arts Festival takes place noon to 10 p.m. June 22 to 25
at the Utah State Fairpark, 155 North 1000 West. Jazz, folk, pop
and classical music, modern dance and poetry readings will take
place on five stages. Food from around the world will be available,
125 artists will sell their works and there will be hands-on art
projects. Admission is $5, $2 for age 60 and older and for everyone
on Thursday and Friday from noon to 3 p.m.; children under 12 are
admitted free.
 &HT;    Fourth of July celebrations will take place at Sugarhouse Park,
1500 East 2100 South, and Rice-Eccles Stadium, at the University of
Utah. Beginning at 1 p.m. in the park, there will be food, an arts
festival, activities for children, and in the evening, a
performance by the Utah Symphony and fireworks. The celebration is
free but parking is limited; (801) 535-6323.
 &HT;    At the stadium, the Red Hot 4th Stadium Extravaganza will
feature music by the bands Chicago and They Might Be Giants.
Tickets are $12, $18 and $24 from the Huntsman Center, (801)
581-6641, or Smith's Tix, (800) 888-8499.
 &HT;    From July 17 to 24, world champion cowboys converge on Salt Lake
City for the Days of '47 Rodeo in the Delta Center, 301 West South
Temple. Competition is nightly at 7:30. Tickets cost $10.50 to
$29.50 from Ticketmaster, (801) 325-7328. Information: (801)
325-2000.
 &HT;    The city will nearly shut down on July 24 for the 153rd
anniversary of the Mormon pioneers' arrival to the valley. Salt
Lake residents hold services, parades, road races, festivals and
fireworks. The Days of '47 Parade begins at 9 a.m. along 200 East
and ends up at Liberty Park, 600 East 1300 South, where a
Neighborhood Fair and Native-American celebration and fireworks
will take place.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Visitors and lifelong residents alike marvel at the majestic
mountains that ring the Salt Lake Valley, which offer hiking for
all levels.
 &HT;    For an easy walk, head to City Creek Canyon just north of
downtown. From Second Avenue and Canyon Road, walk north through a
residential area and Memory Grove Park, then follow the road to a
gatehouse, where a five-mile paved road begins. Walkers and
cyclists have it to themselves on odd-numbered dates, and walkers
share the road with cars ($2.50 a vehicle) on other days. The
canyon is open 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Call (801) 483-6880 to reserve
picnic sites, which cost $2.50 to $30.
 &HT;    More demanding trails and climbing can be found in Millcreek
Canyon, east of the city _ (801) 483-5473 for information _ and Big
Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Canyons, to the southeast, (801)
466-6411.
 &HT;    They say the sunsets are beautiful from Buffalo Point on
Antelope Island. But the best time to visit the largest island in
the Great Salt Lake may be in the morning, when the pesky gnats and
mosquitoes are not swarming.
 &HT;    Antelope Island State Park, 30 miles northwest of Salt Lake City
off I-15, is home to a 500 buffaloes that roam freely, along with
mule deer, big horn sheep, antelope and coyotes. More than 30 miles
of hiking trails reach vantage points that offer spectacular views
of the lake. Take your own water. The island's beach at Bridger Bay
is the best place to experience the sensation of floating on the
salt water.
 &HT;    Park fees are $7 a vehicle or $4 per cyclist or pedestrian. The
30 camp sites cost $10 a night. Information: (801) 773-2941; camp
site reservations: (800) 322-3770.
 &HT;    At Temple Square, visitors can learn about Mormonism, get a
close-up view of the six-spired Salt Lake Temple and walk inside
the domed Tabernacle.
 &HT;    But another popular place is across the street in the church's
Family History Library, 35 North West Temple, (801) 240-2331. The
library has the largest archive of its kind in the world and is a
gold mine for genealogists of any faith or belief.
 &HT;    For newcomers to the searching out of one's roots, the library
has computer terminals with easy-to-use software. Terminals are
also at the Family Search Center in the Joseph Smith Memorial
Building, 15 East South Temple. Use of the library and center is
free. The library is open Tuesday through Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 10
p.m. and Monday 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Center hours are 9 a.m. to 9
p.m., Monday through Saturday.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Hotel Monaco, 15 West 200 South, with 1930s French decor, is a
lively addition to the downtown hotel scene. The daily manager's
social at 5 p.m. offers guests a free neck and shoulder massage
with a glass of wine. The hotel is a refurbished 15-story bank
building with 225 rooms, a restaurant and a bar.
 &HT;    The 10-foot ceilings and extra-long beds make it a favorite for
visiting professional basketball teams. A double room is $149;
(801) 595-0000, fax (801) 532-8500.
 &HT;    For a more conservative setting there is The Inn at Temple
Square, 71 West South Temple. The 90 rooms, most of which have
views of either the Mormon Temple or Abravanel Hall, the city's
premier concert hall, have the look and feel of a country inn. The
inn and its restaurant do not serve alcohol. A double with a
king-size four-poster bed is $130 on weekdays and $99 on weekends.
 &HT;    Rates include a hot breakfast; (800) 843-4668, fax (801)
536-7272.
 &HT;    Little America Hotel and Towers, 500 South Main St., offers a
broad selection of accommodations _ from the Governor's suite for
$800 a night to motel-style rooms for $59 on weekends. There are
850 rooms in the tower and other buildings, two restaurants, two
swimming pools, a fitness room, a hair salon and four gift shops. A
double in the spacious tower suites is $164, while smaller garden
rooms go for $129. Rates drop about $35 or more on weekends; (800)
453-9450, fax (801) 596-5911.
 &HT;    Budget: Downtown Hampton Inn, 425 South 300 West, is close to
some of the city's best restaurants and microbreweries. The
158-room hotel has an indoor pool, hot tub and exercise room. A
double is $79, with Continental breakfast; (801) 741-1110, fax
(801) 741-1171.
 &HT;    Luxury: Wolfe Krest Bed and Breakfast, 273 North East Capitol
Blvd., is the newest and one of most luxurious B&AMP;Bs in the area.
The three-level Georgian revival mansion was built in 1905 and has
13 rooms, one with wheelchair access, all with fireplaces. Rates
are $150 to $300, with a hot breakfast either in your room or in
the dining area; (800) 669-4525, fax (801) 531-0522.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Under state liquor laws, the New Yorker Club, 60 West Market
St., (801) 363-0166, is considered a private club, but nonmembers
can buy a two-week membership for $10, which is valid for six
people. It offers elegant rooms with Italian marble floors and soft
lighting.
 &HT;    Appetizers include ahi tuna roll with a rich wasabi butter
sauce; a popular entree is roast rack of lamb with rosemary cream
and fresh vegetables. Try the raspberry almond tart for dessert. A
meal for two with wine is about $150. Like all but one of these
restaurants, it is closed Sunday.
 &HT;    The owners of the Metropolitan, 173 West Broadway (at 300
South), (801) 364-3472, have transformed a former warehouse into a
chic, pricey spot. The intriguing menu includes a pudding-like
Maine lobster tapioca brulee, Asian pear salad, and seared
yellowfin tuna in a citrus sauce. A dessert of fruit soup comes
with a corkscrew of caramelized sugar. Dinner for two with wine,
$160.
 &HT;    The basement location in a dingy strip mall belies the excellent
Tuscan food at Michelangelo Ristorante, 2156 South Highland Drive,
(801) 466-0961. Ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms and Parmesan
cheese is served in a rich sauce of truffle oil and butter. The
tiramisu is excellent. Dinner for two with wine, $75.
 &HT;    To get out of the punishing summer heat, head up Emigration
Canyon to Ruth's Diner, 2100 Emigration Canyon Road, (801)
582-5807, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can sit in the
original dining car or on the patio next to the creek and try
anything from burgers and salads to spicy coconut curried shrimp. A
favored dessert is Ruth's bananas _ a parfait of sliced bananas,
vanilla ice cream and warm rum sauce. Dinner for two with wine,
$50. No reservations, and the wait can be long for Sunday brunch.
 &HT;    For a step back to the time of car hops, burgers and malts, head
to Hires Big H, 425 South 700 East. The place is swarming with
teen-agers and families craving the Big H burger on a soft
flour-dusted bun ($2.65), greasy fries ($1.65), and thick malts
($2.29). You can order from your car or eat inside.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By MAC GRISWOLD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    There is now another pressing reason to visit Wales this summer,
besides Welsh Black beef, cut from the only cattle in Britain that
have never been fed anything but good green Welsh grass, or so the
Welsh say.
 &HT;    After dining royally on one of those filets cooked by Rod
Peterson, the acclaimed chef at the Cawdor Arms Hotel in Llandeilo,
I headed for the new National Botanic Garden of Wales in nearby
Llanarthne. There I was delighted to find the same natural-systems
approach to the world, but transformed into the most advanced _ and
good-looking _ sustainable machinery for keeping plants, people and
interior climates in sync.
 &HT;    The heart of the 568-acre garden, the first new national botanic
garden in Britain in two centuries, is Sir Norman Foster's
312-foot-long transparent oval bubble, the Great Glass House,
rising lopsidedly above what was once private parkland and pasture.
 &HT;    It is sunk into the hillside to conserve heat and tilted to
offer views of the countryside as well as to receive maximum sun.
The garden hadn't opened when I visited in December, but the solar
machinery was already cranking comfortably.
 &HT;    Additional heat comes from an environmentally friendly ``biomass
burner,'' also handsomely housed by Foster &AMP; Partners and fueled by
wood cut from a nearby coppice of trees, the kind that can be cut
back to stubs that will continually sprout new shoots (poplars,
willows).
 &HT;    These are especially vigorous thanks to a boost from the
nutrient-rich water produced by a natural waste treatment system
that handles all effluents. And if that hard-working coppice
doesn't provide enough fuel, local contractors will be given tax
rebates to haul in clean lumber waste.
 &HT;    The botanical garden is the first in the world where the energy
demands required to care for rare and endangered plants have been
designed to have as little impact on the environment as possible.
It is also the first to group together in one macroclimate the
flora of a single ecosystem from all continents, instead of having
a little glass-enclosed rain forest, say, followed by a separate
desert enclave.
 &HT;    The computer-generated high-precision geometry that has made
global architecture more curvaceous and freeform (Frank Gehry's
Bilbao Guggenheim, or Foster &AMP; Partners' Canary Wharf station
entrances to the London Underground) has been used here to make one
large arched chamber, the largest single-span glass greenhouse ever
built.
 &HT;    The ecosystem it displays is what is known as ``Mediterranean,''
which confusingly includes other regions that are nowhere near the
Mediterranean itself.
 &HT;    Chile, California, Southwest Australia, South Africa and the
Canary Islands all possess geographic areas and climatic conditions
that are similar to those of Cannes, Morocco or Israel. Together
these regions account for only 1.7 percent of the Earth's surface,
but they provide habitat for over 20 percent of all known plant
species. Many of them, such as tender ceanothus or plumbago vine,
are among the most beautiful garden plants, those that American
temperate-zone gardeners like me long to grow.
 &HT;    Inside, under the spare arches of Sir Norman's building, lies an
18-foot gorge slashed into the earth by the American landscape
architect Kathryn Gustafson, whose radically pared-down designs can
be seen in France, England and the Netherlands. (She has also been
commissioned to design the terrace for the new Rose Center for
Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New
York.)
 &HT;    A walk down between its pale buff sandstone ``cliffs,'' now clad
in plants grouped by their regions, is a conservatory experience
different from any other because of the dramatic change in levels.
At the bottom lies my favorite of these Mediterranean zones, the
low evergreen ``forest'' of the Canary Islands, one of the most
endangered and unknown habitats on earth.
 &HT;    A mere 115 square feet, this ``forest'' has a waterfall and a
sunken pool and is planted with lovely, rare laurels, willows and
viburnums that are barely hanging on in their native home. Up at
the top, on the concourse level, there is a restaurant serving
light fare tucked under the north rim of the building with a view
over Gustafson's ``canyon'' and the Welsh hills beyond. (A more
substantial restaurant occupies a former stable.)
 &HT;    The garden's decision to know its plants from birth was very
important, considering how threatened many of the plants in this
glass house are. Though the staff now depends on some nursery-grown
stock for immediate effect, it eventually aims to have plants only
from seeds of known natural provenance, in order to preserve stocks
of genetic diversity and vigor.
 &HT;    There is a lot more going on at the garden, much of it rather
elaborate and symbolic (groups of rocks represent Wales' geologic
ages, for example). The plantings seem too sketchy to support the
heavy theoretical freight. They will grow and soften and be better
in a decade. Now, much of the garden has that bare, just-planted
look.
 &HT;    In the meantime I found that the best thing to do, besides
wander through the Great Glass House and marvel at the brainy
sustainable systems, was to climb Paxton's Tower. This 18th-century
folly perched on a nearby hill offered a marvelous chance to look
down on the design for the future I had just wandered through.
 &HT;    The other Welsh garden I visited, nearby Aberglasney, definitely
looks to the past. In 1471 when a Welsh bard, Lewis Glyn Cothi,
wrote about ``A fortress made bright by whitewash,
/And encompassing it all around, nine green gardens ...'' he was
probably thinking of Aberglasney and its owner at the time,
Rhydderch ap Rhys, whose skills the poet compared to those of Adam,
the first gardener.
 &HT;    Current archaeology has turned up nothing that links the
present-day garden layout with that 15th-century paradise, but it
has revealed something almost as rare: a Renaissance garden with
high walls, a cloister, a parapet walk _ the works _ the only such
design in the country known to have survived.
 &HT;    A gatehouse once thought to be a garden folly is in fact the
original 17th-century entrance to a courtyard. From there an
archway opens into the enclosed garden that lies just below the
much later (Queen Anne) house.
 &HT;    The remains of a delicate double flight of stairs leads to the
spot on top of the wall where a summer pavilion once stood. It
faced what are now the crumbled outlines of an airy banquet room.
From there, Sir Rice Rudd, owner of the garden in the mid-17th
century, would have looked down onto his parterres.
 &HT;    Parterres of what? Grass? Gravel? Boxwood? Nobody yet knows.
Part of the excitement here is the uncertainty of date and purpose
of many of the garden features.
 &HT;    Stories of recovering and saving this mystery buried under as
much as five feet of soil, trash and stinging nettles keep
horticulturists and preservationists agog, however.
 &HT;    Aberglasney changed hands many times and has suffered many
vicissitudes, including having the Ionic columns of its fine
porticoed house mysteriously ``disappear,'' only to turn up in a
Christie's catalog. They were set back in place late in 1999, part
of the overall plan of the Aberglasney Restoration Trust, financed
by an anonymous American benefactor, beginning in 1995.
 &HT;    This is the first spring that Aberglasney will be open to the
public. Though excavations continue inside the cloister, a fine
trio of gardens in adjoining walled enclosures has been recently
planted and still looks new. One surrounds a 17th-century oblong
pool; another is a typical kitchen garden; the third was designed
in concentric ovals by Penelope Hobhouse, the noted English garden
designer.
 &HT;    For the framework, she used only evergreens known to gardeners
during the Rudd period of the garden, but boldly filled her design
in with top-class ornamental plants, ancient and modern, from every
corner of the globe.
 &HT;    Hardly a Welsh garden but a good stop en route to the other two
is Hergest Croft, in Kington, Herefordshire, close to the border.
Gardened intensively for over a hundred years by three generations
of plant collectors and aficionados who luckily also had a sense of
design, Hergest should be better known to Americans _ if only
because it is so quintessentially English.
 &HT;    Paradoxically, when the English garden, they often want to leave
home, in the sense of letting their imaginations wander wildly to
exotic places. Does this happen because they live on such a small
island or because they once had such a large empire?
 &HT;    The reasons are not clear, but at Hergest, the 50-acre garden
begins at home in England in the exuberant conservatory of a robust
Victorian red brick house. It adjoins a picture-perfect kitchen
garden furnished with crooked old apple trees and a pair of
herbaceous borders.
 &HT;    Next comes a series of linked spaces, mostly planted with the
trees and shrubs for which Hergest is famous, including 59
Champions of the British Isles (the largest trees of their kinds).
There are more than 4,000 species and hybrids planted with tutelary
intelligence and high art, and about as many ways to enclose or
open views both large and small as exist in the world.
 &HT;    A visitor finishes in the Himalayas, in what is known as Park
Wood, a secret valley high-shaded by oaks and beeches where
rhododendrons bloom from January to August. Many specimens were
planted as early as 1910; they tower 20 feet tall or higher as they
do in their native habitat. Cascades of flowers rush down their
sides.
 &HT;    I walked into this wood on a June morning when the mist was
curling up from the pond at the rhododendrons' feet, and knew I was
traveling with Kubla Khan in Xanadu.
 &HT;    After a trip to the future at the Great Glass House, into the
past at Aberglasney, and far into a Coleridgean fantasy at Hergest,
I was ready for another piece of Welsh Black beef.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: THREE GARDENS IN FOUR DAYS  
 &HT;    Following is a proposed four-day itinerary for seeing the three
gardens:
 &HT;     DAY 1  _ Take the train from Paddington Station (three hours)
to Swansea to pick up a car rental (Alamo has locations in both
Swansea and Worcester). Train fare $102 first class, $69 standard
class, at $1.60 to the pound. From Swansea take the M4 to exit 49
for Llandeilo _ about 35 minutes.
 &HT;    Spend the night in Llandeilo at the Cawdor Arms Hotel. You can
walk to the ruins of nearby Dinefyr Castle and back in the
afternoon. Dine at the Cawdor Arms. Walk around the pretty town of
Llandeilo.
 &HT;     DAY 2  _ After seeing the National Botanical Garden (morning)
and Aberglasney (afternoon) _ a picnic lunch can be packed by the
hotel or you can have lunch at the botanical garden _ spend a
second night at the Cawdor Arms. (Aberglasney can provide a list of
other nearby hotels and B&AMP;Bs.)
 &HT;     DAY 3  _ Head to Hergest Croft in Kington, Herefordshire, near
the Welsh border, taking a picnic (available from the Cawdor Arms).
A two-hour drive via the A40 north to Llandovery, the A483 to Buith
Wells, then the A481 and then the A44 to Kington.
 &HT;    The place for dinner and the night after seeing Hergest is
Broxwood Court, with an 1858 garden by the Victorian landscape
designer William Nesfield, 10 minutes away.
 &HT;     DAY 4  _ Turn in the car in Worcester, about 35 miles from
Broxwood on the A44, or drive back to London.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN K. LUDWIG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Blanketed with snow until midsummer, Mount Shasta's Upper
Panther Meadow was warm early last September and bright with Indian
paintbrush, yarrow and cliff penstimon.
 &HT;    From the trailhead at around 7,600 feet, my husband, Karl, and I
had walked gently uphill along a grassy creek to the source spring
considered sacred by Indians, who still conduct ceremonies there.
It is a small sandy pool rimmed by flowers and rocks, with lovely
cold water bubbling out.
 &HT;    After tasting the spring water we joined several others who sat
nearby meditating. Then we climbed a bit higher for another view of
the snowy slopes rising above us.
 &HT;    At 14,162 feet, Mount Shasta towers above the surrounding hills
and dominates the Northern California landscape for hundreds of
miles. It has long exerted an almost mystical pull on climbers,
philosophers and naturalists.
 &HT;    On his first view of it, the naturalist John Muir wrote, ``my
blood turned to wine,'' and in 1888 he proposed preserving the
region as a national park. It was an idea whose time never came,
although a fraction of the originally proposed acreage was finally
added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1983.
 &HT;    By the time of the Wilderness designation, the pristine rivers
that burst from mountain springs in the area and still make it a
prime fishing destination had long been harnessed by Shasta Dam
about 50 miles to the south near Redding, Calif.
 &HT;    Completed in 1945, the dam created Shasta Lake, whose placid
waters and 365 miles of shoreline offer tamer alternatives to
fishing and boating enthusiasts as well as providing water and
hydroelectric power for an area stretching 500 miles south,
including Sacramento.
 &HT;    Fortunately for preservation, the mountain itself is far from a
large urban area, though the region is served by a major
north-south highway, Interstate 5.
 &HT;    In all of surrounding Siskiyou County there are fewer than
50,000 people; the City of Mount Shasta has only about 3,600
inhabitants. The other small towns that skirt the mountain, Weed,
McCloud, and Dunsmuir, also offer dramatic views of the dual-cone
peak and the curious lens-shaped cloud formations that gather above
it.
 &HT;    All four towns, which grew out of the region's early lumber and
railroad-based economy, now enjoy clear air and clean water; they
also assume the risks of living beneath a volcano that is currently
dormant but fully capable of erupting again.
 &HT;    Although Mount Shasta's last reported eruption was around 200
years ago, bubbling sulfurous springs near the summit are a
reminder of the mountain's turbulent inner life. Historically,
eruptions have occurred on average every 600 years, but today
careful seismic monitoring of the peak offers the prospect of early
warning.
 &HT;    Unfazed, or perhaps attracted, by the risks, thousands of
climbers annually attempt the ascent. However, fewer than a third
of them reach the summit, according to the United States Forest
Service, often because they've failed to train and acclimate or to
inform themselves about route and weather conditions.
 &HT;    A few years ago my husband, Karl, and I spent several days near
the City of Mount Shasta while he prepared to climb the mountain.
(He succeeded.) Charmed by the area, we returned early last
September for a more leisurely four-day stay.
 &HT;    After savoring Mount Shasta's presence from the other historic
and picturesque towns, we paid a brief visit to Lake Shasta where
we toured ancient Shasta Caverns and Shasta Dam, whose completion
transformed the region.
 &HT;    This mountain is extraordinarily buoyant and powerful. Not
surprisingly, many Indians view it as a spiritual center, and
traditionally considered it the Great Spirit's teepee or the
gateway to the inner earth.
 &HT;    The magic of the setting has also attracted strange myths that
have the mountain inhabited by ancient civilizations or UFO-flying
aliens.
 &HT;    After checking in at the popular Strawberry Valley Inn on the
main street of the City of Mount Shasta _ challenging because the
reservation system was as quaint as the setting _ we walked to
Village Books nearby.
 &HT;    Over an espresso we scanned books about the mysterious races
said to live within the mountain, the Lemurians and Yaktayvians,
and recalled that in August 1987, the mountain was one of the
gathering sites for the Harmonic Convergence, a worldwide event
marking a particular planetary alignment. In the store, notices of
services and events were evidence of the metaphysical and
alternative-healing community drawn to the mountain.
 &HT;    After breakfast at the inn, based in a 1920s stone house that
has a lovely terrace with a mountain view, we were off to City Park
to see the spring that supplies the headwaters of the Sacramento
River.
 &HT;    A man was balancing on the mossy rocks filling plastic water
bottles with the freshest of water, which flows in a gushing stream
out of the hillside and tumbles down an incline past picnic tables
and sports fields.
 &HT;    Our next destination was a contemporary war memorial outside the
nearby town of Weed, and apparently one of its chief attractions.
To reach the Living Memorial Sculpture Garden, we drove a dozen
miles northeast of Weed on Highway 97 alongside desolate black
mesas of lava flow.
 &HT;    The sculptor and Vietnam veteran Dennis Smith has dedicated to
all veterans his 10 works in metal (he is finishing the 11th),
groups of larger-than-life human figures with vaguely alien
features, including ``The Refugees,'' ``POW-MIA'' and ``Coming
Home.'' They stand in an austere but pleasingly laid-out garden of
Ponderosa pine, manzanita and chaparral with an exhilarating view
of the glacier-covered north side of Mount Shasta. No one else was
there.
 &HT;    Later that afternoon, back in the City of Mount Shasta, we drove
up the mountain's Everitt Memorial Highway about 14 miles to the
Upper Panther Meadow trailhead to visit the sacred spring. At
around 7,600 feet, it is just half a mile from the highest point
accessible by car.
 &HT;    The next day we turned our attention from the natural world to
humans' impact on it. The Mount Shasta Fish Hatchery stocks many of
the streams and lakes of Northern California with catchable trout.
One of the oldest operating fish hatcheries west of the
Mississippi, it began production in 1888.
 &HT;    An original hatchery building now houses the Sisson Museum, the
local history and ecology museum named for the town founder, Justin
Sisson. Photographs and artifacts chronicle the early climbing
history of Mount Shasta, and working models reflect the importance
of the Southern Pacific Railroad that was an essential lifeline
from San Francisco to the north.
 &HT;    The nearby historic lumber mill town of McCloud was our
destination for the night. Founded more than 100 years ago, it
ceased being a company town in 1965, and the Champion International
Mill closed in 1979.
 &HT;    However, the McCloud Railway Company and the McCloud Hotel have
been rejuvenated to take advantage of its picturesque setting and
its proximity to fine fishing and winter sports. Layoffs at the
remaining mill, P&AMP;M Cedar Mill, which processes cedar for pencils,
had just been announced, a reminder of the lumber economy's
fragility.
 &HT;    The McCloud Hotel is a handsome three-story building, yellow
trimmed in forest green. From its front porch bordered with pansies
and garlanded with wisteria, we could see Mount Shasta. Our
attractive and comfortable standard room combined two original
rooms and provided an up-to-date bathroom.
 &HT;    Though our schedule didn't permit it, many hotel guests cross
the street to board either an open-air excursion train or the
Shasta Sunset Dinner Train.
 &HT;    Before moving on the next day, we drove about seven miles east
of town to see McCloud Falls. Accessible by car, the three-stage
falls and river provide inviting swimming and fishing holes, but in
September we saw only a few other people.
 &HT;    On a hike from the lower to the middle falls we saw a fisherman
catch a nice trout, lending credence to the McCloud River's
reputation. Back in town we made a short stop at the Heritage
Junction Museum, whose eclectic, well cared for collection of
community artifacts, displayed in one large room, includes logging
equipment, sporting goods and household items.
 &HT;    Back on Interstate 5, it is only five miles south to Dunsmuir, a
town built in the 1880s to serve the Central Pacific Railroad.
Originally called Pusher, it was named for the helper engines that
boosted trains over daunting grades along the Sacramento River
Canyon.
 &HT;    The small, old-fashioned downtown, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, retains much of the 1920s architecture
of its heyday, and the trains (mostly freight) still roll through
the railyard almost hourly.
 &HT;    Just off the main street, Dunsmuir Avenue, are the visitors
center and the Enchanted Forest Porcelain Doll Factory. Here the
proprietor, Marian Anderson, produces collector-quality dolls with
some 650 faces and various ethnicities. Her not-for-children dolls
range in price from $169 to $2,000.
 &HT;    In the spirit of this historic railroad town, we spent the night
in a converted caboose. One exit south of Dunsmuir is the Railroad
Park Resort, where we checked into the Caboose Motel, where 22
cabooses and one boxcar, each an individual room, encircle a pool
and hot tub. We climbed aboard attractively decorated No. 17,
``Southern Pacific'' emblazoned on its side.
 &HT;    Our brass king-sized bed just left passage to the bathroom and
cupola, to which we climbed to enjoy our view of the towering
granite formations in nearby Castle Crags State Park.
 &HT;    After a smooth night on board our caboose, we headed to Lake
Shasta, about 35 miles south. The wild forested canyon and rushing
Sacramento River give way to the serene lake which forms arms and
fingers stretching into the neighboring hills.
 &HT;    Our first destination, Shasta Caverns, required a short boat
ride across the lake and a bus ride uphill. Even in September the
cool damp interior of the cave was a welcome relief from
temperatures in the '90s. We had to earn it on the tour, however,
by climbing up and down stairs, a total of 650 steps.
 &HT;    I'm not much of a spelunker, so I was happy that lighting was
good and stairs and paths well maintained. The limestone cave, long
known to Wintu Indians, was first explored by a white man, James
Richardson, with a Wintu guide, Charles Morton, in 1878 and opened
to the public in 1964.
 &HT;    Our hourlong tour refreshed our memories of stalactites and
stalagmites and unloosed our imaginations. Surrounding us were
dreamlike formations resembling popcorn and broccoli, or graceful
drapery and columns, and, directed by the guide's flashlight, a
tiger, pipe organ and castle.
 &HT;    Continuing on about 15 miles to 55-year-old Shasta Dam, the
second largest dam in mass in the United States, we parked right on
top. Down the 487-foot high spillway, three times the height of
Niagara Falls and the largest manmade waterfall in the world, only
a trickle of water flowed. Our guide explained that the lake was
down about 43 feet; in spring, with the winter rains and runoff, it
would probably be around eight feet from the crest.
 &HT;    He described construction of the dam from 1938 to 1945, a story
that is astonishing, both statistically and in human terms. For
instance, first a diversion tunnel 1,821 feet long had to be built
for the main line track of the Southern Pacific Railroad; then
workers labored for five and a half years pouring concrete 24 hours
a day to create the wall of the dam.
 &HT;    The tour included an echo chamber, the old railway tunnel that
later served to divert the river, and a view of osprey nests on a
power plant tower. A good tour, perhaps even, as the guide
maintained, ``the best dam tour in the USA.''
 &HT;    Leaving the area, we stopped at the vista point about a mile
from the dam, where we could see three Shastas: the dam and the
lake in the foreground and gleaming regal Mount Shasta in the
distance. While the dam was a powerful example of man's ability to
transform nature for better or worse, we were thankful for Mount
Shasta's mighty and humbling presence.

 PLEASE NOTE: We have included some optional trims in this article
to make cutting the piece for length an easier task. 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When are Americans going to stop obsessing about airline
prices and look at their hotel bills?'' asked Ed Perkins during the
recent meeting of the Editors' Council of the Society of American
Travel Writers.
 &HT;    Like many mature travelers, Perkins, retired editor of the
Consumer Reports Travel Newsletter, knows that when you analyze the
expenses for almost any trip, the biggest cost is often lodging.
 &HT;    I heard that loud and clear nearly a decade ago when Bill Todd,
then marketing director of Choice Hotels, told The Mature Traveler
that hotel discounts for seniors should be large enough to make it
worthwhile for them to want to alter their travel itineraries _ be
it driving 50 or 100 miles farther than planned or changing travel
dates from weekend to midweek or from high to low season _ to
capture the biggest savings.
 &HT;    This year, the dividing line between perfunctory discounts _
those offered because other establishments are doing so _ and
discounts of real value to seniors is much clearer, as I learned
while doing The Mature Traveler's annual survey of senior discounts
at hotels nationwide. Some promotional strategies that hotels are
using are not only elusive, but are a downright disservice to
customers of all ages. Here are some observations.
 &HT;    Many reservation operators are unfamiliar with their company's
senior programs. In fact, several had to look up the most basic
information, such as the eligibility age.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The concept of a flat percentage discount for seniors is
beginning to disappear. This became clear when many lodging
reservation centers explained that they couldn't disclose their
discount until I told them my destination and dates. This has to do
in part with room availability, which all discounts rely on, but it
certainly shouldn't affect a company's basic senior discount
policy.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Many hotel reservationists at their 800 numbers even refused to
quote a senior discount price of any kind. In one instance, an
operator told TMT that she would provide ``the best price'' for a
specified hotel and date and make a reservation. She then said that
when I appear at the front desk to check in, ``You may get a senior
discount. I have no way to know for sure.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    More of the smaller, regional chains are giving discounts of
around 10 percent, but the offer is not necessarily chainwide since
each establishment decides whether or not it wants to participate.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A great many chains have a two-tier discount system. One
discount is for members of AARP, CARP and Mature Outlook. The
second is offered by the hotel chain itself, can be a different and
lower percentage for non-members and, in many cases, has different
age requirements.
 &HT;    When a property or chain works to understand the mature-traveler
market and then develops a program based on what it has learned,
the programs are more usefulnot only to the hotel, but also to
seniors' pocketbooks and travel plans. For example, Hilton's Senior
HHonors program, one of the better deals in the industry, now
includes new brands that extends the program to nearly 2,000
locations compared to last year's 450.
 &HT;    The program, once limited to Hilton and Conrad International
hotels, is now available at Doubletree, Hampton Inns, Homewood
Suites and Embassy Suites. Open to those ages 60 and older, the
program costs $55 the first year in the United States, or $75
outside, and can result in discounts of up to 50 percent or better.
Benefits also include restaurant discounts and frequent-stayer
rewards.
 &HT;    The global impact of such a change: More overseas lodging groups
probably will be examining _ and changing _ their own offerings for
senior travelers to meet the competition.
 &HT;    Some special promotion packages include travel with
grandchildren, while others take into account the special interests
of the senior set by including anniversary offers _ activities such
as nostalgic music events and trips that commemorate moments of our
youth, like the end of World War II, the start of the Korean War or
the day Elvis Presley died.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, there's a downside to all these wonderful, new
options: For some, hotel-shopping has become a time-consuming
chore. Here are some strategies to simplify the process:
 &HT;     _ GO OUTSIDE THE BOX.  If your hotel of choice is known as a
``business hotel,'' catering mostly to corporate world, it is
likely to have special deals on weekends when business people are
home. A resort may have openings midweek when business people are
at work. If the location makes the bulk of its money during the ski
season, look for summer deals, etc. As mature travelers, we have
more flexibility than others on the road.
 &HT;     _ TRY ALTERNATIVES.  Investigate programs that offer other
travel benefits, such as homestays, home exchanges or bed and
breakfasts. These offer travelers the opportunity to learn about an
area from local residents _ and to get a good night's sleep.
 &HT;    A condo or apartment can supply much more space and freedom for
a group of two or four while helping to cut costs on meals. (Why
eat out when you've got your own kitchen?)
 &HT;    Campus accommodations or hostels can also lower your travel
budget. Lodging brokers or Web auction sites can be helpful, too,
however many mature travelers complain that the time it takes do to
a Web search detracts from the savings they might find.
 &HT;     _ DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM.  Make sure to carry that
all-important identification that can help cut costs _ namely, your
AARP/CARP card; frequent-stay hotel group cards; or proof of
membership to any lodging discount programs, such as the
Entertainment 2000 directories, which entitle members to discounts
of up to 50 percent off published room rates at certain hotel
chains.
 &HT;    One reader recently wrote to me about her experience trying to
locate lodging near the airport when her flight was canceled. She
found herself within walking distance of a hotel with a great
senior discount program while her peers paid two and three times
more. Guess her pals didn't know how important it is to ask for the
senior discount.

SHOPPING AROUND: WEEKEND DEALS IN AMERICAN CITIES  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Let's hear it for the big-city weekend trip. Maybe the agenda is
to sleep late and breakfast in the room. Or spend the day wandering
through museums and shops before working out in the hotel health
club. Or dine well and see a show. But whether it's San Francisco,
Chicago or New York (or Atlanta, Minneapolis or Boston), the
two-nighter in the big city is a time-tested formula for
stimulation and restoration.
 &HT;    Weekend city deals are often a good buy because business
travelers are a Sunday-to-Thursday phenomenon. Come Friday and
Saturday, those giant Hyatts and Hiltons have rooms to spare. But
shop around to make sure that a big-city weekend doesn't add up to
credit-card shock a month later.
 &HT;    Thanks to the Internet, hotels have the ability to calculate
occupancy and sell rooms much faster and more efficiently than ever
before. This means that there are many room rates floating around
out there.
 &HT;    Sure, a low rate may sound good, but the extras can be painful.
The $20-a-day parking fee, the $15 continental breakfast and the
$8-per-person fee to use the health club are how hotels derive a
significant amount of their revenue. So try to get a low rate and
as many perks as possible up front.
 &HT;    The first step: Do your research. This is crucial for first-time
visitors to a city, but since hotels open, close and get renovated
all the time, it's essential for returning visitors to do as well.
A good city guidebook from Fodor's or TimeOut is fine, as are
Internet city guides such Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) and
Citysearch.com (www.citysearch.com).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can be a good way to find affordable big-city
lodging. The best, nationally known ones, such as Quikbook (381
Park Ave. South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887;
www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill
Lane, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com), offer discounts from 15 percent to 40 percent
off the so-called ``rack'' or published room rates in dozens of
cities around the country.
 &HT;    Other brokers, such as Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave.,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123; www.express-res.com), work only
with New York and Los Angeles, while companies such as Washington
D.C. Accommodations (2201 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Suite C-110,
Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-554-2220; www.dcaccommodations.com)
specialize in a single city _ in this case our nation's capital.
 &HT;    The advantages to working with a hotel broker are
straightforward. They promise to save a traveler money. Period.
Hotels are grouped by price range, and there's no charge for their
services. But not every hotel is available through a hotel broker,
and smart travelers call a property directly to check the price.
Because room inventory fluctuates, hotels sometimes have a lower
price rate than discounters in order to sell off empty beds.
 &HT;    Another good source for weekend deals are the major lodging
chains, which frequently have lots of empty rooms on weekends.
Again, smart travelers call a property directly, call the chain's
toll-free number, visit the chain's Web site and see if the
property is available through a hotel broker. That may sound
time-consuming, and even overkill, but the room rates can vary
widely for the same room at the same property.
 &HT;    Some rates may include breakfast or parking privileges, while
others may be cheap, bare-bones room prices that can jump
dramatically once extras such as parking and breakfast are added
on.
 &HT;    Some hotel Web sites, like Marriott International
(www.marriott.com), require consumers to go through a
trial-and-error process for the best rates. Others are easier to
navigate and advertise their deals. Hilton Hotels (www.hilton.com)
has ``Hilton Value Rates'' for its properties _ rates that can also
be e-mailed to travelers every week.
 &HT;    Both Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.westin.com) and Sheraton
Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.sheraton.com) have ``Hot Rates'' _
Internet-only specials that provide up to 20 percent discounts on
weekends.
 &HT;    Hyatt Hotels and Resorts' Web site (www.hyatt.com) features
``Special Offers,'' with rates for ``Value,'' ``Getaway Next
Weekend'' and ``Packages.'' For a given property, the prices and
perks can greatly differ.
 &HT;    The two on-line giants, Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com)
and Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), are also sources for weekend
deals. The latter recently purchased Travelscape.com, which gives
it a base of thousands of hotel rooms around the country. They also
send out periodic discount hotel e-mailings.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, yet another source of weekend hotel
deals are offered by the airlines. Although the number of cities is
limited in nature, virtually all of the major carriers offer such
deals, often through their Web sites, including Delta
(www.delta-air.com), American (www.aa.com) and Continental
(www.continental.coml).
 &HT;    Delta Vacations, for example, has Standard, Preferred and
Ultimate air/hotel/transfers-inclusive vacations, based on hotel
categories. The cost obviously depends on the city chosen. But
because of the highly changeable nature of airfares between major
American cities, this convenient way of booking a city weekend may
not yield the best price.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, free spirits can let their trip be
dictated by the e-fares that the airlines post every week and which
Smarter Living.com (www.smarterliving.com) collates and sends out.
Just remember that most of these last-minute fares are only good
from Saturday to Monday or Tuesday.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I frequently travel to Italy on business and am tired of
the hotels my company books for me. Could you recommend affordable
lodging in hotels there that are authentic in design and cater to
American road warriors?
 &HT;     A:  Golden Tulip Hotels and Summit Hotels &AMP; Resorts accommodate
guests in some of Italy's best locations and uniquely embody
classic Italian architecture, design and art. These hotels are
situated where visitors have complete access to the sites and
routines of Italy's greatest cities.
 &HT;    In Rome's city center, the four-star Bernini Bristol, Hotel
Giulio Cesare and GT Mecenate Palace have cozy, pastel-colored
rooms and characteristic Roman atmosphere ripe with detailed
columns and arches.
 &HT;    Naples boasts the gorgeous seaside Grand Hotel Santa Lucia with
ocean views and breezy enchantment in its marble lobby and bar. The
GT Grand Hotel Baglioni and Hotel Minerva keep guests in the middle
of the action as Florentines stroll by and congregate in the many
squares and bars that surround these stylish Tuscan hotels.
 &HT;    Also in Florence, Summit's exciting Hotel Brunelleschi
integrates a sixth-century Byzantine tower and 12th-century church
into the facade of their 96 rooms and private museum.
 &HT;    However, in Florence nothing quite captivates travelers like the
palatial Grand Hotel Villa Cora. In the center of exclusive Viale
Machiavelli Park, this mansion provides its visitors with a chance
to live like royalty in an extravagant house of riches.
 &HT;    All these hotels have dazzling restaurants with creative local
specialties and imaginative preparation. Most hotels provide
well-equipped conference rooms, fitness rooms and garden terraces,
as well as special services and suites for the American business
traveler.
 &HT;    Continental Airlines' partner, AerItalia, offers incredible
BusinessFirst seating to most destinations in Italy at a reasonable
price. Golden Tulip and Summit Hotels deliver the best of Italy at
very reasonable rates. For more information, call Summit at (800)
457-4000 and Golden Tulip at (800) 344-1212.
 &HT;     Q:  I am one of the few females that I know who enjoys playing
golf. But sometimes I find it intimidating to play with men, and I
rarely have the time to drive long distances to get to courses. Do
you know of any golf facilities near New York City?
 &HT;     A:  Why not make the most of a weekend by spending it golfing
and relaxing at Manhattan's Doral Park Avenue Hotel? This hotel
offers female guests an ``Afternoon Tee Golf Package'' that caters
to female golfers of all levels.
 &HT;    The package includes deluxe room accommodations, a complimentary
golfing book for women by Cheryl A. Leonhardt and a number of
members-only privileges at The Golf Club at Chelsea Piers, just
minutes from the hotel.
 &HT;    Also included is a one-hour private lesson (designed especially
for women) with a PGA instructor, club rentals and video analysis
of technique.
 &HT;    The Doral Park Avenue Hotel, located at Park Avenue and 38th
Street, has the feel of a European boutique hotel with Italian
marble baths and neoclassical furnishings and provides guests with
data ports, delivery of The New York Times daily and views of Park
Avenue and the Murray Hill district.
 &HT;    Prices for the ``Afternoon Tee Golf Package'' start at $305 per
weekend night and $345 for midweek nights.
 &HT;    For more information and reservations, call (877) 99-DORAL or
(212) 687-7050, or visit www.doralparkavenue.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are traveling more frequently to
developing countries for both business and pleasure. We always make
sure to get the necessary immunizations prior to departure.
However, where can we turn if, despite our efforts, one or both of
us becomes ill while traveling abroad?
 &HT;     A:  You are smart to be concerned, because 40 percent of
Americans traveling to developing countries contract illnesses from
bacteria, viruses or parasites that are unknown at home.
 &HT;    Although there are many travel-assistance or medical-evacuation
options available to international travelers, a new standard of
distance medical care is emerging thanks to technology.
 &HT;    WorldClinic at Lahey of Burlington, Mass., is setting such a
standard by providing patients abroad with immediate access to U.S.
board-certified emergency physicians 24 hours a day.
 &HT;    No matter how minor the illness, WorldClinic's physicians can
evaluate any medical situation, diagnose and treat the problem and
oversee all medical care until your return home. The firm prepares
its patients for departure by assembling medical records and
preparing custom prescription medical kits.
 &HT;    For more information, contact WorldClinic at Lahey at (800)
636-9186, or visit www.worldclinic.com on the Web.
 &HT;     Q:  Help me find the perfect Mexican restaurant in Manhattan.
 &HT;     A:  Coming from Southern California, I consider myself a good
judge of Mexican restaurants, and for years have found that New
York City has few places for great South-of-the-border food.
 &HT;    Therefore, I was happy to encounter Casa Mexicana while passing
through the city. Here, Chef Luis Herrera and owner Ramon Angeles
create authentic dishes from different regions of Mexico and bring
dignity to the Tex-Mex scene.
 &HT;    Placing a romantic, hacienda-style space in the trendy Lower
East Side shows an ingenious stroke of imagination and common
sense. The cooking combines Mexican ingredients with creative
French culinary technique to create clever and tasty dishes, such
as chicken tamales wrapped in a banana leaf with sunflower seeds
and a mole poblano. Fresh sangria, Spanish wines and Mexican beers
are on hand. Don't miss pastry chef Josefina Hernandez's desserts,
such as rose tequila sabayon with rose-petal sorbet.
 &HT;    Casa Mexicana has a downstairs lounge with music for guests who
have given up the night's decision-making to the tequila and
sangria. Located at 133 Ludlow St., Casa Mexicana is a great way to
start a night out or to end one. For more information, call (212)
473-4100.
 &HT;     Q:  I would love to send my daughter on an exotic trip as a
graduation present, but I can't afford to go overboard. Do you have
any recommendations for spectacular but reasonably priced
vacations?
 &HT;     A:  Because it is considered the low season, right now is the
perfect time to visit the hip Caribbean island of St. Barts. Hotel
Guanahani, the island's only full-service small luxury resort, is
currently offering off-season packages through October.
 &HT;    Guanahani's ``St. Barts Spree'' gives guests a luxury ocean-view
room for five nights and includes round-trip airport
transportation, two meals daily, tax and service charges and either
a complimentary one-hour jet ski rental or two one-hour tennis
lessons. The best part of this package is the price _ only $1,650
for two people.
 &HT;    Most guests find the low season at St. Barts the ideal time to
visit since crowds have thinned and the weather is still sunny and
warm.
 &HT;    Boasting private gardens, colorful bungalows and two stunning
beaches, Hotel Guanahani provides everything a vacationer could
want _ from aquatic sports such as snorkeling and windsurfing to
tennis facilities (with a pro on hand to give advice and
instruction) to a tranquil lagoon where you can just unwind.
 &HT;    Hotel Guanahani also offers other low-season packages at
incredible rates from three to seven nights. Packages must be
reserved and fully paid before arrival.
 &HT;    For more information, visit http://www.leguanahani.com/, or call
Leading Hotels of the World at (800) 223-6800.

WASHINGTON SHOULD BE KNOWN FOR HIS PROJECT, NOT HIS PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the name Kermit Washington resonates in the mind of the
average sports fan it is more than likely because it is inevitably
linked to the name Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   The name should stand for achievement, both athletic and
academic. Kermit Washington was the last career 20-point,
20-rebound man in college basketball. Kermit Washington played in
an NBA All-Star game. Kermit Washington stood for unrelenting
hustle and professionalism. Kermit Washington also embodied the
concept of student-athlete, joining the likes of Bill Bradley, Tom
McMillen, Bill Walton, Bob Elliott, and Doug Collins as a GTE
Lifetime Hall of Famer for combining athletic and academic
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   More than any of this, Kermit Washington is a compassionate
human being who has made 10 trips to Africa in the past five years,
and not to take fancy pictures on a photographic safari, either. He
runs Project Contact, a movement that brings much-needed medical
attention to suffering people in such war-, famine-, and
disease-wracked countries as Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great, great, great thing he does,'' says Dale
Steininger, a friend who has been to Africa with Washington. ``I
think the NBA has a lot of misconceptions about Kermit, and it's
all because of the Rudy Tomjanovich thing. If you mention Kermit's
name, they don't know what he does there.''
</P>
<P>
   They should. The medical community in Portland, Ore., certainly
does. The 40,000 people who have been served by Project Contact
surely do. And Kermit has tried to tell them, not because he's
looking for a plaque, but because he thought the world's most
prestigious and richest basketball organization might be interested
in making a contribution to a worthy cause run by an unjustifiably
demonized alumnus to whom the league owes a long overdue apology.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kermit Washington tried to go through channels to
inquire about a league donation, he was rebuffed, and chillingly
so, by a functionary whose name he does not recall. ``They made me
feel like a piece of trash,'' he says. ``I was told, `Well, we've
already allocated our fine money.' I said, `How can you do that?
The season hasn't even started yet. You don't know what you'll be
taking in. Dennis Rodman might contribute a million dollars
himself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kermit Washington became part of the American sports dialogue on
the night of December 9, 1977, when he punched Rudy Tomjanovich in
the face so severely that the Houston forward required extensive
plastic surgery and was prevented from playing for the remainder of
the season. Kermit Washington was big and black and Rudy T was
not-quite-as-big and white, and so guess which one became an
instant national villain?
</P>
<P>
   He was finishing a fight he did not start. It began with an
elbow from Kevin Kunnert and ended when Washington, sensing that
someone was rushing toward him from the rear, turned and landed
what can only be described as the Perfect Punch, a ferocious blow
delivered by a great physical specimen to a man approaching at full
speed. Moving past the gory details, Kermit Washington basically
punched Rudy T's face in.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Larry O'Brien suspended Washington without pay for
two months, representing an approximate $80,000 hit. Kunnert was
neither fined nor suspended. Kermit Washington never played another
game for the Lakers. He was traded to the Celtics, for whom he
played 35 games before being part of the deal with the Clippers
that brought Tiny Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes to
Boston. He spent three years in Portland (making the All-Star team
in 1980) and finished his career with Golden State in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But he was always The Wild Man Who Punched Rudy T. Never mind
that the real Kermit Washington was a bookworm of a family man with
a strong social conscience. Never mind that the easily available
videotape evidence from that fateful game substantiated his story
that he was merely defending himself from God-knows-what when he
realized someone was speeding toward him from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if I were walking down the street and was attacked by
a mugger,'' Washington said in a 1978 Globe interview. ``I fight
him off when his buddy comes in from nowhere to help. I nail him.
Now here comes the police and there is the mugger and his friend,
lying there. I am hauled off to prove my innocence. If I hadn't
protected myself from (the 7-foot) Kunnert, I might be the one
lying in the hospital. And how did I know what was on Rudy's
mind?''
</P>
<P>
   The question posed then was, ``Will this thing ever die?'' The
answer, Washington says, is ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just yesterday,'' he was saying recently, ``three people asked
me about the Rudy thing. It amazes me. It never dies. So many times
when people meet me, it's `Aren't you the one . . . ' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Punch and its aftermath have haunted Washington for 23
years. The name association, he believes, has prevented potential
NBA employers from taking his job applications seriously. One
former NBA coach, an ex-teammate no less, said, frankly, ``If I
hire you as an assistant, they'll think there's something wrong
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington became so frustrated by all this he decided to take a
lie detector test a while back. He wanted tangible proof he was
telling the truth when he said he was only trying to protect
himself when he threw the fateful punch. ``I passed with a score
they told me was two or three times higher than necessary to verify
truthfullness,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit Washington is in both the restaurant and radio business.
He owns ``Le Slam Sports Cafe'' in Vancouver, Wash., and he does
morning radio on KKGT in Portland. But more than anything, he is in
the humanity business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching television,'' he says, ``and I'd see people
suffering. I don't like bullies, and I think poverty is a bully,
disease is a bully, and ignorance is a bully. Being in the
restaurant business is not much fun. Radio is not that rewarding.
If I become a bum tomorrow, I can now say with a smile on my face
that I did something good with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't take doctors and nurses to Africa without dealing with
the M-word. You don't buy medicine without paying for it. Kermit
Washington is no millionaire. He raised money for one trip by
raffling off a car (OK, it was a Porsche). He raised money for
another trip by holding off on paying his taxes. He got money for
another trip by trading an original LeRoy Neiman print to Clyde
Drexler for his 1992 Dream Team jersey and then auctioned the
jersey for some 15 grand. ``Make sure you point out that Clyde just
gave me the jersey without asking for anything,'' Washington says.
``I wanted him to have something, so I gave him the print.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's first trip in 1995 was in the company of someone
else's group. He decided he wanted more personal freedom to do what
he wanted to, so he formed his own organization. When he needs
volunteers for a trip, he simply gets on the radio and asks for
them. ``You get as many as you want,'' he says. He makes sure they
know what to expect. Africa is unlike anything they have ever
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been robbed. I've lost 15 pounds in three weeks. It can
be pretty rough,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Once he saw for himself what conditions are like for
people in these countries, he knew he had to keep trying to bring
help. ``I think it's unacceptable behavior not to at least try to
help people in need,'' he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've helped over 40,000 people, and it costs less than a
dollar a person,'' he says. ``I know that sounds like a commercial.
But it's true. With $100,000 we could help 100,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA may still think Kermit Washington is a pariah, but the
people who work for, and who have been treated by, Project Contact
think he is a permanent MVP (Most Valuable Person). If you agree,
you might want to contact them at the GTE Web site,
lifesplaybook.com. But it's not about him. It's about people in
desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit Washington knows who he is. More people should.

DEATH PENALTY IS NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should capital punishment be abolished because of the risk that
an innocent defendant might be killed? It is an increasingly
popular argument. But is it a principled one?
</P>
<P>
   When the New Hampshire Legislature voted in May to repeal the
state's death penalty, state Senator Rick Trombly reversed his
lifelong support for executing murderers. ``If scientific evidence
shows that we're making mistake after mistake after mistake,'' he
said, ``the Legislature ought not to allow for the possibility of
that mistake being made. The only way to do that is to abolish the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``mistake after mistake after mistake,'' Trombly did not mean
that New Hampshire had repeatedly sent innocent men to the chair _
New Hampshire hasn't executed anyone since 1939. Nor could he have
been talking about any other state. In the 24 years since the
Supreme Court authorized the resumption of capital punishment, 620
convicted murderers have been executed. Not one has subsequently
been proven innocent, despite the intense scrutiny these cases draw
from death penalty foes.
</P>
<P>
   What Trombly had in mind were the DNA tests that in recent years
have led to the release of 63 convicted inmates, including eight
men on death row. Opponents of capital punishment argue that these
tests raise grave new doubts about the reliability of criminal
justice in America.
</P>
<P>
   Trombly is not the only one the opponents have persuaded. In a
recent column, George F. Will concluded that ``Actual Innocence,''
a new book by death penalty abolitionists Barry Scheck, Peter
Neufeld, and Jim Dwyer, ``compels the conclusion that many innocent
people are in prison, and some innocent people have been
executed.'' Conservatives in particular, he said, should not assume
too hastily that death row inmates are really guilty. ``Capital
punishment, like the rest of the criminal justice system, is a
government program, so skepticism is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary. The growing infallibility of forensic science
should if anything increase, not lessen, our confidence in the
accuracy of criminal verdicts. And if that is true of convictions
in general, it is especially true in death penalty cases, which are
subject to multiple levels of posttrial review and intricate layers
of due process.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the sanctions in our criminal code, a death sentence is
the least likely to be the result of error or caprice.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, let us suppose the worst. For the sake of
argument, let us assume that the death penalty _ despite all our
best efforts, despite all the safeguards and caution built into the
system _ leads to the deaths of a few innocent people. Is that a
good reason to do away with capital punishment?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it isn't. Every institution that is of benefit to
society also poses risks to society _ including the risk that
innocent victims will die. Patients die on the operating table
because their surgeon made a mistake. Forty thousand Americans die
in car accidents every year. Are those good reasons to abolish
surgery and interstate highways? Anyone who said so would be
dismissed as a crank.
</P>
<P>
   Should policemen be allowed to carry guns? After all, if law
enforcement officers go armed, innocent victims will sometimes lose
their lives, as the recent deaths of Amadou Diallo in New York and
Cornel Young in Providence, so tragically prove.
</P>
<P>
   If death penalty abolitionists really want to make sure that no
one is unjustly killed by an agent of the state, they ought to call
for disarming cops.
</P>
<P>
   But is that what they really want? Is it the threat to innocent
life that truly galvanizes the abolitionists, or is it simply their
visceral dislike for capital punishment?
</P>
<P>
   No one who genuinely worries about the legal system putting
innocent people at risk can afford to waste time denouncing the
death penalty. Not when probation and parole are costing so many
Americans their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In one 17-month period, the US Department of Justice calculated
in 1995, criminals released ``under supervision'' committed 13,200
murders (and 200,000 other violent crimes). Why is it that the
enemies of capital punishment never have a word to say about those
innocent victims?
</P>
<P>
   To say that society should refrain from executing murderers for
fear of making a mistake is not noble. It is a copout. A soldier on
the battlefield who refuses to shoot at the enemy lest he
inadvertently hit the wrong man is no moral hero, and neither are
those who demand that all murderers be kept alive so that we never
face the risk of executing an innocent defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is not easy to condemn someone to death, still less
to carry out the sentence. Executions are irrevocable and
irreversible; to take away anyone's life _ even a brutal criminal's
_ involves an assertion of moral certainty that might make many of
us tremble.
</P>
<P>
   But trembling or not, we have a duty to carry out. A duty to
proclaim that murder is evil and will not be tolerated. That it is
the worst of all crimes and deserves the worst of all punishments.
And that while we will bend over backward not to hurt the innocent,
we will not let that paralyze us from punishing the guilty.

NEARING PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 4 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless your travels regularly take you to Gold's Gym in West
Hollywood, you won't see more high-grade beefcake on display
anywhere in Los Angeles these days than in ``Billy Budd,'' Benjamin
Britten's brawny musical treatise on divine authority versus human
expediency.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you're planning a trip to the sweet hereafter, you'll
be hard-pressed to witness a more perfect presentation than the one
currently docked at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Not that director Francesca Zambello's production is simply a
triumph of muscle over mind. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching these shores via London and Geneva, this production
reminds us what exuberant power opera has when exactly the right
singers, musicians, sets, lights and costumes converge at the right
time, in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Fortifying her rep as a rising visionary, Zambello and company
achieve a remarkable synthesis of naturalism and abstraction,
clarity and ambiguity, the bulky imperatives of narrative form with
the ethereal majesty and streamlined gravity of Britten's score and
E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier's sinewy libretto.
</P>
<P>
   That's not even mentioning the magnificent central triad of
singers aboard the British warship Indomitable: bass Jeffrey Wells,
a touch stiff but otherwise excellent; baritone Rodney Gilfry, the
closest most of us probably will see to a definitive Billy Budd,
and, in his Los Angeles Opera debut, the superb tenor Robert Tear,
a model of anguished vocal integrity as the spiritually tortured
Captain Vere.
</P>
<P>
   Together, and supported by an all-male ensemble that's solid
from stem to stern, they maintain an exquisite equilibrium among
Britten's warring chords. Conductor Roderick Brydon martials the
gently billowing strings, shimmering woodwinds and awesome
batteries of blazing horns with great authority and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the darkly mystical Herman Melville novella that inspired
it, Britten's opera tracks a wavering course between good and evil.
``Billy Budd'' is a moral as well as musical odyssey that carries
us through the blue mists enshrouding the envious, scheming
Master-at-Arms John Claggart (Wells), then launches us into the
pure, major-key light that crowns Claggart's prey, the innocent
sailor Billy Budd (Gilfry).
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, Gilfry has publicly pondered hanging up his signature
role for good. When that day comes, please break the news to me
gently. Watch how Gilfry's stoic Billy plumbs the paradoxical joy
in his death-row aria, neither Christlike abstraction nor naive
man-boy. Listen how gracefully he bends the notes while bidding
farewell to the ship, the Rights o' Man. No wonder Wells' Claggart
is clearly ga-ga over him.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder, too, at Alison Chitty's split-level, hydraulically
powered set, which mirrors the upstairs/downstairs divide between
officers and men and reinforces the brutal claustrophobia of ocean
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Budd,'' which one critic described as Melville's ``final
testament of acceptance,'' is a swan song for Peter Hemmings, L.A.
Opera's retiring founding general director, who has been working to
bring this production here for years. Hemmings is England-bound
next month. The rest of us may rejoice that his ship has come in. &QL;

<P>
   C. Wright Mills was to social science in his day what the Beats
were to literature: a stranger in a '50s land who stormed through
the decade hellbent for the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best-known sociologist of his day, thanks to such
books as ``White Collar'' and ``The Power Elite,'' Mills died
before the '60s became The Sixties. Yet in everything from
enthusiasms (Fidel Castro, jeans, motorcycles) to vocabulary (it
was Mills who coined the term ``New Left''), he presaged the
counterculture that was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wright Mills was just 45 when he died, in 1962. His
daughter Kathryn was 6. Thus the five years she spent gathering her
father's correspondence for the just-published ``C. Wright Mills:
Letters and Autobiographical Writings'' was an opportunity to
deepen a relationship death denied her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was valuable for me to learn more about my father through
adult eyes instead of kid's eyes,'' she said over lunch last week.
``When you read 600 letters someone wrote over the course of their
adulthood you learn a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills did not lack for detractors. As his onetime Columbia
colleague Daniel Bell wrote in 1960, in much of his work ``no point
is ever argued or developed, it is only asserted'' and ``Vulgar
Marxism has become vulgar sociology.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills preferred to see himself as an anarchist rather than
Marxist. The vulgar part he probably didn't mind so much. A
self-described ``North American aboriginal,'' he was the sort of
man who could go into a steakhouse, order a full meal, eat it, then
order another. He wrote for 15-hour stretches and boasted of having
once racked up an 800-mile day on his motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it big, boy!'' he'd urge his students. For him, those
were words to live by. Always juggling too many projects, he didn't
restrict himself to sociology. Several times he wrote to
correspondents of his intention to write a novel, a play, or even a
movie script. One screenplay he wanted to call ``Enthusiasm.''
Perhaps it was autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was a six-footer who weighed 200 pounds, but size wasn't
what made him seem larger than life. It was his energy, his
ambition, his forcefulness. He failed his draft physical because,
as he writes in a letter, ``They told me I ticked too fast
inside.'' In the end, his heart failed him. But it took at least
three coronaries to do it _ and before he died, he managed to marry
three times, build two houses with his own hands, and father three
children (Kathryn Mills has a half-sister Pamela, who collaborated
on the new book, and a half-brother, Nik).
</P>
<P>
   ``He was exhausting, a man whose pressure never let up,'' the
literary critic Irving Howe once wrote. Howe, who was friendly with
Mills until they parted politically, recalled him as ``a figure of
power, a fiercely grinding power that came down like a fist.''
</P>
<P>
   The man his daughter remembers was exhilarating rather than
exhausting. ``He may have been fatiguing for adults sometimes,
because he would challenge them and be demanding _ he demanded a
lot of himself _ but from a kid's point of view, he wasn't tiring
at all. He was just fun. He would joke around and be dramatic. He'd
take me to nursery school on his motorcycle _ and I really liked
that! And I remember him resting on the study couch. That's where
we watched Westerns together on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   After her father's death, Mills was raised by her mother in
suburban Washington, D.C. She graduated in 1976 from Hampshire
College, where the focus of her studies was political economics
(``I wonder where that interest came from,'' she laughs). After a
year at Boston University Law School, she became a VISTA volunteer
in Framingham, Mass., then spent four years working as a community
organizer in Mission Hill in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, slender woman with a fondness for detail, Mills lives in
Brookline, Mass. with her husband and their 13-year-old son. She
oversees the contracts department at a local publisher, where she
has worked since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   It gives Kathryn Mills considerable satisfaction to see the
volume she's edited contributing to a larger revival of her
father's work. This year has seen reissues of ``The Power Elite''
and ``The Sociological Imagination'' (both from Oxford University
Press), and the University of Illinois Press is planning to reissue
his first book, ``The New Men of Power: America's Labor Leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   On a much more personal level, assembling the letters solved a
longstanding problem for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I didn't have a good way of referring to my
father in conversation. When he was alive, I called him `Daddy,' of
course. But as I got older, that sounded funny. If I said to
someone, `Daddy's book is being misrepresented,' calling him
`Daddy' didn't sound right since I was all grown up (or at least as
grown up as I was likely to become any time soon). So I tried
calling him `Mills,' but that seemed even more odd. Now I call him
`Wright,' and that feels comfortable. After spending years going
through his old mail, it's only natural that I'm on a first-name
basis with him.''

<P>
   NEWBURYPORT, Mass. _ If you build it, they will putt.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that hypothesis plus a few hand tools, Leo Melanson,
a Bell Atlantic sales manager, set out six years ago to construct
every duffer's dream: a backyard golf facility that's open 24/7 and
thrives on sunlight and water, making it a rough facsimile of the
grass, if not the manicured courses, on which Tiger Woods makes his
handsome living. Think ``Field of Dreams'' with a hole and
flagstick out the back door instead of four bases and a pitcher's
mound.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Karen, ``thought I was crazy,'' Melanson remembers,
while the neighbors were mostly baffled by the sight of dump
trucks, bags of designer grass seed, and a sand trap blooming amid
the swale on his half-acre lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured we were putting in a swimming pool,'' says
Melanson, 36, who tore up his first two attempts before achieving
the desired results. ``But like Kevin Costner says in the movie, if
you build it, they will come. And they do now, four or five at a
time. They don't even bother to call ahead anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanson and his 1,000-square-foot, non-USGA-approved bentgrass
putting green _ built, he says, at an initial cost of around $500
(excluding maintenance equipment) _ occupy the low-cost, high-labor
end of a burgeoning phenomenon: backyard golf that has graduated
from tin cups and Whiffle balls to Stimpmeters and Titleists,
becoming the newest yardstick of suburban status and golf mania.
</P>
<P>
   While Melanson's represents the do-it-yourselfer's version, and
vision, there are other paths to the same clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   For $10,000 and up, for instance, companies like the Putting
Green in Hudson will embellish your yard with synthetic greens that
require no more maintenance gear than a snow shovel or leaf blower.
Company president Jim Goodman, a landscaper by trade, has installed
several hundred in the six years he's been in the golf construction
business, from attic putting greens to 3,500-square-foot monsters
and even par-3 courses with multiple sand traps and greens. Costs
can easily reach six figures, Goodman says, as property owners'
fantasies progress from pebble driveways to Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to understand you can do this,'' says
Goodman. ``Socially, backyard greens are fantastic. They're great
for practicing your short game. Kids love 'em, and you can play on
them all winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mazzola of Shrewsbury, like Melanson an avid golfer,
strolled into the Boston Flower Show a couple of years ago, saw a
Putting Green Co. exhibit, and decided instantly that his
little-used tennis court had to go. Result? A split-level,
600-square-foot putting surface where his court used to be, offset
by a sand trap and water hazard _ er, swimming pool. Mazzola claims
no broken windows yet but admits he has to be careful about those
50-yard chip shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want your ball to wind up in the neighbor's yard,''
says Mazzola, who, perhaps not coincidentally, makes his living in
the automobile repair business.
</P>
<P>
   One thing upon which amateurs and professionals agree is that
the Melanson model is not for everyone. ``I don't know of many
people who can maintain a bentgrass green in their backyard,'' says
Goodman. Melanson heartily concurs. ``For those who really want to
practice their golf,'' he says, ``synthetic is the way to go. This
is more a landscaping hobby than golf hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is it? One clue would be the 50-page manual
Melanson has published, available through his Web site
(www.putting-greens.com). It includes sections on equipment and
suppliers, site planning, drainage, turf selection, trap
construction, green maintenance, pests and disease, soil problems,
irrigation, weeds, and mowing, as well as a short chapter
(finally!) titled ``Games and Family Fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Melanson writes that building and maintaining a natural-turf
green is a ``complex and sometimes mysterious'' undertaking and
lavishes praise on professional greenskeepers. You may love ice
cream, his guidebook suggests, but that doesn't mean you should
take up dairy farming.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says Melanson, part of the fun has been
learning the art of greenskeeping on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat of a pioneer,'' he says modestly. ``When I
started, there was very little information on this available.
 &UR; Today &LR;  a lot of people are giving it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of shots, this reporter challenged the resident club
pro to a match on his single-hole green, converted, via tees placed
strategically around his property, into a 9-hole course.
</P>
<P>
   Melanson, a 12-handicapper on real golf courses, readily
accepted, explaining as he fetched his pitching wedge and putter
how he had laid out the backyard tee boxes ``to beat my dad,'' also
an avid duffer. Par for the course is 27. The course record is
6-under, shared by Melanson and a handful of his golfing neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The first two chip-shot ``drives'' were routine enough, but the
third required a lob wedge over a child's swing set, and the fourth
over a bed of perennials brandishing a ``PLEASE REPAIR BALL MARKS''
sign. After three holes, Melanson was two-up and cruising like
Tiger on a Sunday  &UR; afternoon &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   To reach the seventh tee, golfers must cross a footbridge into a
neighboring yard, whose occupants _ one is an engineer and bridge
designer _ fortunately bought wholeheartedly into the home-course
concept. Melanson sank a 5-foot putt that settled the match. Unlike
last summer's US Ryder Cup team, he resisted celebrating and kept
on playing.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth hole, a par-4, began at one side of Melanson's house:
the only side lacking windows, it was duly noted. The host barely
cleared the dog fence with his tee shot. The visitor fared somewhat
better, surprisingly enough, making a rare birdie and closing the
match with the kind of shot-making that moves born-again golfers to
tear up their tennis courts. Melanson finished the match at four
holes up and two over par.
</P>
<P>
   His final piece of wisdom on backyard putting greens? ``The only
thing you don't want on it is a dog,'' he advises.

&HT;     NO MEDAL FOR STEELY DAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAIG MARINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Calif. _ It has taken nearly 30 years to fully
appreciate, but Steely Dan really did pick the perfect name for
their band.
</P>
<P>
   When polished studio pros Donald Fagen and Walter Becker
assembled more of their kind for the ``Can't Buy a Thrill'' album
in 1972, the name just seemed like an oh-so-clever literary nod to
their oh-so-clever-to-be listeners. These were the kinds of people
who hung around in coffeehouses before there were coffeehouses on
every corner _ and back when it was still considered perfectly fine
to sit around in bars instead.
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to Fagen and Becker and their latest
collection of expert musicians one recent night at the Chronicle
Pavilion in Concord, there really could be no other name. The
original Steely Dan, after all, was a famed sexual stand-in. And
what Fagen and Becker and their bunch put out onstage is exactly
the same thing musically: a stand-in for the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   The second biggest problem with Steely Dan the group _ the first
being, naturally, their mere existence _ is that the group always
includes some of the best musicians around. The cream of the crop,
the best guitarists and horn players and back-up singers and you
name it. So that makes it nearly impossible to dismiss Steely Dan
out of hand as being lousy.
</P>
<P>
   They are not lousy musicians, they are just playing lousy music,
a kind of hybrid form that takes a bit of rock and a bit of jazz
and a bit of soul and screws up the best parts of each. Toss in
pretentiously innocuous lyrics and what you have is the ``Star
Wars'' of music _ geek worship. It's not a pretty sight, watching
the aging masses shaking their expanding bottoms to tunes that you
used to dive to the radio dial to shut off. Toss in the
Concord-ness of it all, and it was altogether a frightening
evening.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like this was a nostalgia tour, since these guys never
toured when they were huge. With good reason. Fagen looks like a
singing accountant, and Becker looks like that embarrassing uncle
everyone's got who just won't own up to the times and cut off that
gray pony tail that hangs behind his bald dome.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just as easy to see why these guys sold millions of
records. Just when you thought it was safe to turn on the radio
again, they come out with a new album, ``Two Against Nature,'' that
includes some creepy song about incest with an infectious hook that
sounds like every other song they ever did.
</P>
<P>
   And they did every other song they ever did in Concord, or all
one long version of the same song. It was nearly impossible to tell
the difference. Each song let one or more of the musicians take an
extended solo that bordered on the self-indulgent. Yet every song
stuck into the inside of your brain like some alien life form,
whether it was ``Do It Again,'' or ``Black Friday,'' or ``Deacon
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially ``Deacon Blue,'' with that bit about drinking whisky
all night long and dying behind the wheel _ man did that get a
cheer, and this from a bunch that could probably remember each time
they got drunk in college.
</P>
<P>
   The only way a song could be mercifully purged from the brain
was with the group's vicious tactic of playing the next tune, which
would then occupy the vacated area until it was, in turn,
exorcised. Luckily, the band took a half-hour break after being
onstage for 60 minutes or so. As luck would have it, however,
someone allowed them back onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it was disappointing to see such obvious musical
talent wasted on songs like . . . well, any of them, ``Royal
Scam,'' for instance. The horn players alone could have given the
crowd two hours or more of pure entertainment if they were cut
loose on some real material, their skills were that apparent. On
``Royal Scam,'' they got to play six notes at the beginning, then
build to an annoying crescendo that did manage to drown out even
more irritating lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Fagen and Becker to set their people free _ if
they're lucky, the band is probably only making union scale per
night anyway. You know the trombone player isn't seeing a big chunk
of those $75 seats down in front, or pride alone would have allowed
him to bail out somewhere on this tour by now.

PARENTING IN THE LAND OF NO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Antarctic, there are more than 80 words to describe snow.
Toddlers have almost as many meanings for the word ``no.''
Sometimes it actually means no, as in absolutely not. Mostly it
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The typical 2-year-old arrives in the land of no at about the
same time she's making physical and cognitive leaps from being a
tentative walker to a confident, proficient one who can run, climb,
and even go backward; from taking the world at face value to being
able to make some cause-and-effect links.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is no coincidence, says psychologist Alicia
Lieberman, a leading specialist in toddler development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capacity to go where they want transforms their feelings
about themselves, enabling them to see themselves in a new way,''
she says: `` `I run so fast, Daddy can't catch me! I climb so high,
Mama can't see me! I can make things happen, I can shape my own
experience!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of noes is a natural byproduct of this
newfound sense of power. ``It's the password of autonomy,'' says
psychiatrist Kyle Pruett of Yale University. Rather than see it as
an act of defiance or disobedience, he and Lieberman say, parents
should interpret ``No!'' as a plea for participation: ``Remember,
I'm a partner now. I can have input into what happens to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``no'' is intended to be the beginning of a
conversation, not the end of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell parents to pretend your child has uttered a whole
phrase after the `no,' '' says child developmentalist Maureen
O'Brien, TouchPoints consultant at Children's Hospital in Boston.
For instance: ``No, I have something to say''; ``No, I need more
time''; ``Tell me more, I'm scared/unsure''; ``I want to be in
charge, how about some choices?'' O'Brien is the author of a
forthcoming HarperCollins series of books on 1-, 2-, and
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that toddlers don't yet have many
words available to them, says pediatrician Leonard Rappaport,
director of developmental medicine at Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want control and they want our involvement. `No' is one
of the few ways they have to engage us,'' he says. That the
engagement is often negative doesn't matter. ``It's still
interesting to them,'' Rappaport says, almost as if they are
fact-finding.
</P>
<P>
   Because this dialogue between parent and child plays out in a
society that places a high value on the individual, we walk a
tightrope: Give a toddler too much control and he feels unsafe and
insecure and likely turns into a brat; don't give him enough and he
lacks a sense of competence, feels bad about himself, and becomes
even more negative.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the middle ground?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Pruett say it lies within parents' ability to read
a toddler's signals, to know when it's OK to provide structure to
move them away from ``no'' and when it's important for ``no'' to
count. ``That helps them learn to label feelings and regulate
emotions,'' says Lieberman. ``If we don't do that, we leave them at
the mercy of feelings they can't control.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
What to look for &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are the signals to pay attention to:
</P>
<P>
   --Context. What is he doing when he says no, what's going on
around him? If you say it's time to go to the playground and he
says no, perhaps it's because he's intent on what he's doing right
now and needs time to accept that he has to stop and then to
actually prepare to leave. Maybe something frightened him at the
playground last time, a dog, perhaps, and he's worried it might
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   --Mood. Is this often a time of day when he gets angry and
negative? Maybe he's hungry. Was he up twice last night? Maybe he's
overtired. Has it been a busy day? Maybe he's overstimulated and
feels out of control. ``When a `no' is global rather than in
response to something specific, being held is almost always what
they need,'' says Pruett, who is president of Zero to Three, the
National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families. He is also the
author of ``Me, Myself and I: How Children Build Their Sense of
Self, 18 to 36 months'' (Goddard).
</P>
<P>
   --Tone. Is this a ``no'' with a lot of passion behind it or is
it matter-of-fact? Maybe it's a question, as in ``Are you serious
or not, Mom?'' If there's passion _ and 2-year-olds can have a lot
of it _ there may also be fear: ``I don't want to pet this dog
because I'm terrified of it!'' ``That's a `no' that absolutely
should be respected,'' says Lieberman. She is a professor at the
University of California/San Francisco and author of ``The
Emotional Life of the Toddler'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   --Body language. What are his eyes telling you? Is there an
angry glint or a playful twinkle? If he's digging himself in, you
have to decide how important this issue is and whether it will be
worth the struggle. If it's playful, play along: ``What happened to
Mr. Yes? Where did he go?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A possible scenario &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's how all of this can play out together:
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get dressed, and your 2-year-old says ``No!'' and
grabs her shoe. If you assume she's saying ``No way, I refuse to
get dressed, you can't make me,'' there's bound to be a power
struggle. But maybe she's showing spunk in the name of autonomy.
Maybe grabbing the shoe isn't an aggressive act but a way to tell
you, ``These shoes hurt.'' Maybe she's saying ``I want to be in
charge!''
</P>
<P>
   Test out the possibilities, suggests O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, put her other shoe in front of her and say
brightly, ``Let me see you do it!'' Or put sandals out: ``Would you
rather wear these today?'' If your interpretation is accurate,
she'll move along happily. If you get another ``no,'' pay more
attention to tone and body langauge. Is this ``no'' less forceful,
with a slightly quizzical look? Perhaps she's checking to see how
serious you are: ``Do I really have to do this now or can I stretch
it out?'' In that case, says O'Brien, ``Validate: `That's right,
Mattie. It's really time. Mom is in a hurry.' '' Your tone will
tell her you mean business.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all this interpreting takes a lot of time,
something we often don't have. O'Brien says her worst moments in
the land of no were almost always in the morning, trying to get
twins dressed and out of the door. ``I would say, `I know you want
to do it yourself, but Mommy has to rush. On another day, you can
do it.' My words were understanding but my tone let them know I was
serious,'' she says. ``On Saturday when I had all the time in the
world, I would say, `Now it's your turn.' If it took them 25
minutes to put on one shoe, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Empathizing with a toddler and validating her emotions _ ``I
know it's hard not to get what you want''; ``I know you don't want
to do this right now'' _ is often a winning strategy. ``When their
emotions get acknowledged instead of just their behaviors, they
feel understood on a deeper level and it's easier for them to move
on,'' Pruett says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Alternative approaches &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other strategies to get beyond ``no'':
</P>
<P>
   --Ignore it. ``Proceed matter-of-factly, without registering the
`no,' as if nothing has happened. You'd be surprised at how often
she'll go along with you,'' says Lieberman. Don't overdo this,
however; it can be disrespectful. (If this works, by the way, it
can mean two things: ``no'' can also sometimes mean ``yes''; ``no''
was simply a chance to vocalize and didn't necessarily have any
real meaning.)
</P>
<P>
   --Distract him. The trick is to engage his imagination. A
playful tone _ ``What do you mean, no? Are you a Silly Billy?'' _
has a powerful effect to help a child out of a negative pattern,
says Pruett. Lieberman likes to tell a story: ``When we ride in the
car, I wonder if we'll see the yellow cat . . .''
</P>
<P>
   --Offer choices. This works magic, says Pruett, father of a
toddler himself. But he cautions, ``Only give a toddler choices
you're prepared to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   --Provide more information. When you interrupt him at play to
say it's time to change a diaper, he may not realize he can go back
to the sandbox immediately. Tell him so, says O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   --Rephrase. When you say, ``Alex, let's get dressed and go to
the playground,'' he may only hear the first part. ``If he heard
the whole thing, he might agree,'' says O'Brien. ``Rephrase it: `We
can go to the playground, but first let's put on shoes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the typical toddler's one-note symphony doesn't last
forever. That's the good news. The bad news? It often gets replaced
by two notes: ``Me do!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --The typical toddler hears ``no'' once every three minutes,
according to researcher. The more frequently we use it, the more
we'll hear it back; the more inconsistent we are in its use,
sometimes meaning no, sometimes not, the more difficult it will be
to interpret what she means by it.
</P>
<P>
   --Children whose parents beg _ ``Please, please, please do this
now'' _ or bargain their way out of everything _ ``If you come now,
we can get ice cream'' _ get the message that if they say no loud
and long enough, they'll get their way. On the other hand, a reward
now and then is OK: ``You were so helpful when I needed to hurry!
That deserves a special treat!''
</P>
<P>
   --Practitioners generally agree that refusal to toilet train is
a child's ultimate no, a general protest to feeling overly
controlled. (This is most likely in a child 3 or older.)
</P>
<P>
   --By 2 1/2, most toddlers understand more words than they can
speak. If you find substitutes for your ``no'' _ ``Watch out!''
``Be careful!'' ``Look out!'' ``Danger!'' _ he will, too.
</P>
<P>
   --Avoid asking your toddler ``Why?'' or ``Why not?'' Young
children often misunderstand it and think you're scolding. Try
instead ``Tell me what you mean.''
</P>
<P>
   --For us, ``OK?'' is a rhetorical question; to a toddler, it's
veto power: ``Let's go to the store now, OK?'' Drop the ``OK'' and
simply state what you want: ``We're going to the store now.''

   The industry has taken steps to clean up its business practices,
says Craig Tant of CCBill Inc., a third-party billing company in
Phoenix that handles merchant accounts for more than 10,000 porn
sites. He notes that about 95 percent of his customers run an
honest business. But, he admits, ``we have seen scams that are
outrageous.'' Service companies like CCBill and SexTracker are
reaping huge profits, although their founders won't say exactly how
much. The real money in Internet pornography, some say, is being
made by the business-to-business companies that provide hardware
and services to Webmasters. ``The people who made the money in the
gold rush were the people selling the stuff to the miners, not the
miners themselves,'' says Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Edmond of SexTracker is riding high in Seattle these
days. At 26, he oversees a company with 100 employees and more than
29,000 clients. He fashions himself as a kind of sheriff bringing
order to the wild, wild West of the adult Internet. ``We take
professionalism very seriously,'' he says. ``This is not a
fly-by-night operation where there are a bunch of guys with
strippers sitting on their laps.'' In fact, many virtual porn shops
are run in makeshift home offices where computer programmers type
at keyboards and customer-service operators take technical
questions and complaints. ``You can be an adult-content provider
and live in an upscale neighborhood, and no one is the wiser,''
says Hardie.
</P>
<P>
   At the offices of the New Hampshire Phoenix Group, for instance,
three women smoke cigarettes and field phone calls in a relaxed
suburban setting.
</P>
<P>
   Customer-service representative Mercedes Taylor (a pseudonym)
says she was attracted to the job because smoking is permitted and
casual dress is encouraged. A single mother, she makes more money
now than she did as a teacher. ``I'm not the morality police,'' she
says. ``This is not my lifestyle, but I love my job. It's creative.
It's cutting-edge.'' Why would Daniels, a classically trained
musician who still conducts a local chorus, turn his basement into
a porn shop as opposed to, say, a Web business that sells sheet
music? ``This business makes money,'' he says simply.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL; 
SIDEBAR: SOME PIONEERS OF THE PORN SITES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, when the Web was in its infancy, Colin Daniels (a
pseudonym) and his wife ran a small giftware business specializing
in new-age jewelry, or ``goddess sort of stuff.'' On a whim, they
put their brochure on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much happened - until they added a catalog of ``funky
Goth lingerie.'' Suddenly, the site was swamped with traffic, and
their computer server costs soared. As an experiment, they asked
users to subscribe for $10 a year. ``Lo and behold, people were
sending checks and e-mailing credit card numbers,'' says Daniels,
who now runs an online adult entertainment business from the
basement of his home in southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels is not alone. In the past few years, the Internet has
given rise to a new breed of porn merchant, a group of
computer-savvy entrepreneurs with plenty of ambition and few
inhibitions. Most of them got into the business by accident during
the early days of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Tant, for instance, is vice president of CCBill Inc., a
Phoenix-based company that hosts Web sites and handles credit card
processing for the adult entertainment industry. Four years ago, he
and his brother-in-law were selling juice bars on the Internet;
they were looking for someone to share a server with when they were
introduced to their first client in the porn field. ``We didn't
start out or plan to be in this business,'' says Tant. ``It was an
opportunity that just sort of appeared.'' One of the largest sites
was launched in 1995 by Beth Mansfield, an accountant in Tacoma,
Wash., who was worried about how to pay for her children's
education. Jane Duvall was selling advertising for a newspaper near
Seattle when adult sites emerged online; she and her husband, a
former scientist, set out to monitor the scams in the industry with
Jane's Guide, an online consumer magazine for the skin scene.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first adult entertainment sites was born in 1995,
when an MIT graduate (who requested anonymity) registered, on a
whim, a domain name with a common sexual reference. For kicks, he
downloaded a few dirty pictures from the Usenet news groups and put
them online. When the site was bombarded with traffic, he asked
users to pay $5 a month; the checks rolled in. This computer
programmer suffers from a chronic illness; when he started the
site, he couldn't work outside the house. ``I was sitting around in
my living room wondering what to do with myself,'' he recalls. ``I
wasn't dead yet, but I only offered people three-month
subscriptions because I didn't want people to be ripped off by
sending me money and then I dropped dead.'' Today, he still makes
enough to support himself and to run free online support groups for
people with HIV and other chronic illnesses. But he doesn't
consider himself a pornographer. ``I'm actually more of a computer
consultant, and I do a lot of public advocacy work,'' he says.

&HT;     MARTHA STEWART: QUEEN OF THE SURVIVORS? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No question about it. ``Survivor'' is a treat for viewers.
Strangers tossed together in a riot of stink, hunger, greed and
fear. We should all be glued to the set every Wednesday until the
bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   But how great would it be if there were actual celebrities
spending 39 days on that island, battling to be the last one
standing in this cruelest of popularity contests?
</P>
<P>
   Very great.
</P>
<P>
   So we've drafted eight women and eight men celebrities employing
the same philosophy CBS used with ``Survivor'' _ pick people who
will quarrel and who will divide the viewing audience to make it
more exciting. Here are our celebrity castaways and the odds of
them surviving until the end:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tony Danza. Yeah, big surprise here. He'd turn the whole
island into one boring sitcom about a single dad. But then again,
he can box. And those awful shows of his did last a long time.
Somebody likes him. (500-to-1 odds).
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathie Lee Gifford. Hmmm. Kind of a no-brainer on this one.
She can allegedly sing. And making fun of her might make the time
pass. On the plus side, she's vicious when pushed. And if natives
were found on the island, she could whip up a sweat shop.
(1,000-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Billy Blanks. Oh, come on, you know: the Tae-Bo guy.
Profoundly annoying and yet he's buff. He could get everyone in
shape. You could kick box some coconuts down from the trees. But
he'd talk a lot. And fitness fanatics are wearisome. (200-to-1.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Diane Sawyer. Let's see now. Good looking. Sweet on the
outside. Gives the impression that she cares and might be a helpful
shoulder to cry on (provided she gets a close-up of your tears).
But wouldn't all her false sincerity and bad interviewing be
annoying? No prima donnas. (400-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ George Costanza. OK, technically not a real person. But the
``Seinfeld'' character has worst-nightmare written all over him.
All the whining and complaining _ who could stand it? But nobody
schemes more than George. He'd be very handy getting other people
in trouble. (50-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Britney Spears. It's just 39 days _ not a three-hour tour that
takes 15 years. Nobody's procreating here. Her value, then? The
singing is bad. She seems a tad spoiled. You know for sure that
Kathie Lee's going take her out anyway. Plus, what physical work
could she provide? Think with your brain. (300-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Robin Williams. A real star. And he's a big burly guy who
could haul logs and stuff. He's a runner _ people in shape count.
Plus, he could make you laugh a lot. But what of the downside _ the
Comic's Disease of never having an off button? Thirty-nine days of
Robin being Robin. You'd be exhausted. (25-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricki Lake. The beauty of a show like ``Survivor'' is that you
rush to judgment and then find out your feelings have changed. See
_ you thought Kathie Lee would be first off the island. No chance.
Ricki has no redeeming value. She must go. (2,500-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ George Clooney. And now things get complicated. He's not just
good-looking, he's great-looking. Worse, he's a nice guy. And he's
athletic. On the other hand, you'd never win with him on the
island. You'd have to get Costanza to get rid of him. (2-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Roseanne. Wow. Now things are murky. She's been out of the
limelight long enough to forget that she's Annoying Squared. But
her voice would grate on you in the first few minutes. However, she
could destroy Britney _ and the Tae-Bo guy for that matter _ so she
has value. She goes early or stays late. (30-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Christopher Walken. He's our team leader. He'd have no problem
eating rats or taming snakes. And the others would fear him. But
you'd never sleep, wondering if he'd cut your throat or just look
at you a long time without saying anything. (20-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Starr Jones. She's a lawyer, good at settling disputes (or
starting them). She's smart, sassy, opinionated. Perfect person to
get rid of immediately. Then again, she's not going without a
fight. Work her last nerve, and she's likely to make Walken cry. A
wild card. Watch your back. (75-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Sean ``Puffy'' Combs. This guy builds empires. That's handy.
Even on an island. He's famous despite being fairly mediocre. A
better business man than artist, he nevertheless dates Jennifer
Lopez and that alone may be worth eight or nine nights of campfire
stories. Plus, we know he carries a gun. Very valuable. (5-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Martha Stewart. Ah, not so fast. People's knee-jerk reaction
is to hate her for being perfect. But she's more valuable than the
Professor on ``Gilligan's Island.'' Not only can she cook up a mean
rat, she could make the beach hut look fabulous. She's
indispensable. Also, she'll win _ so you better try to vote her off
quickly. (Even).
</P>
<P>
   _ Maury Povich. Conflict resolution, people. That's what it's
all about. Jerry Springer can't put out a match, but Maury, he can
change lives. Face it _ you're a living freak show, and he
specializes in that. Then again, he's icky. And horrible.
(100-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Tori Spelling. All of a sudden Britney looks like the Virgin
Mary. And think about this: Daddy's connected. Daddy's the
electricity that lights up TV Land. Befriend her and you know
there's a rescue copter coming over the ridge. Or at least the Love
Boat will pull up. But if it doesn't come in 24 hours or sooner,
forget it. (400-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   Our pick for survivor: Martha, Queen of the Island.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is unlikely to take our advice, anyway. And knowing CBS, the
network would give us Bea Arthur and Andy Rooney for stars. So
we'll have to stay with the original line-up of no-name strangers.
That's fine. It's a fun show and almost makes us forget Gilligan.

 BOAT BUILDER REACHES FOR A BIT OF ANTARCTIC HISTORY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELSEA, Mass. _ Shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday, a crane was
preparing to plop a 23-foot-long boat freshly hewn from mahogany
and white oak timbers into the Mystic River, its shipwright and
captain a 54-year-old salt who has ridden many an Antarctic gale.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, Bob Wallace was airborne, riding his newest
boat, slung from the crane's cables, en route to its inaugural
splash into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, a bespectacled resident of Carver, has taken on a
somewhat unlikely hobby. He builds replicas of the James Caird, the
little open boat that in 1916 carried Sir Ernest Shackleton and
five crewmates into history as survivors of one of the greatest
adventures of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also has a somewhat unlikely goal. But he doesn't talk
about it much because Bob Wallace doesn't talk about anything much,
according to friends.
</P>
<P>
   If finances, crew, and logistics fall into place, he would like
in the next year or two to be the first person to duplicate
Shackleton's 800-mile crossing from Elephant Island to South
Georgia Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, a feat three
expeditions in the past nine years have tried, but failed, to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The boat launched Wednesday will spend the summer at the Peabody
Essex Museum in Salem, where remarkable photographs taken during
Shackleton's Antarctic survival epic will be displayed from June 23
until Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace built his first copy of the James Caird last year in
Uruguay. It was used for shooting an Imax film and a WGBH-TV
``Nova'' special, both of which are still in production. The boat
was destroyed in a storm off Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   So one might have thought that Wallace would have been thinking
about ballast, bracing, joinery, and rigging at 1:44 p.m. when this
newest James Caird first touched the saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn,'' said Wallace, a man who seldom swears. ``I forgot the
champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been chasing the shadow of Sir Ernest Shackleton since the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy veteran, sea captain, and wooden boat builder, Wallace
was camping year-round on Bassett Island in the Bourne village of
Pocasset, rowing ashore each day to work in a nearby boatyard, and
generally believing he was roughing it in the manliest of ways.
Then he heard about Shackleton, and started reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I had thought all along I was a tough guy,'' he said with
a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Wallace has been captain of the
oceanographic research ship Abel-Jay. The job has taken him to
Antarctic waters a half-dozen times. The father of a 12-year-old
son, Wallace is married to a psychologist. What probing questions
might she ask about his goal?
</P>
<P>
   `` `How's your life insurance? Don't let it lapse,' '' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Shacketon's journey, Wallace suggested imagining a
cat trying to cross an interstate highway cluttered with speeding
18-wheelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trucks are storms,'' he said. ``They come that fast.
You've got to thread between them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, Shackleton and a crew of 27 other men set out from
England intent on becoming the first expedition to walk across the
Antarctic continent. But they never even reached dry land. For the
next two years, the men, foiled by an ice sheet that smashed their
ship, survived on rations of penguin meat and self-discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort for help, six men sailed and rowed one of
the mother ship's lifeboats to South Georgia Island. Everyone
lived, eventually returning in 1916 to a world at war and a country
that did not particularly care about the heroics of a band of men
who got themselves in deep trouble looking for glory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the publication of all-but-forgotten photographs
taken on the expedition kindled interest in the Shackleton story.
The photographs' only appearance in New England will be at the
Peabody.
</P>
<P>
   As Shackleton's journey became better known, adventurers from
Germany, Ireland, and other countries sought to retrace his
passage. None, so far, have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Wallace) doesn't talk about his abilities, but if there is
one guy truly competent enough to do the job, that would be Bob,''
said John Fish, a Cape Cod-based underwater surveyor who has put to
sea a number of times with Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace isn't offering a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do it, I'm going to have to get things rolling this year.
This interest in Shackleton is at its peak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What did he learn Wednesday after just a few hours on the water?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of tender, this one,'' Wallace said, laconic as
always. ``Ballast is going to be critical. Pretty tight space, too.
If I go, a total crew of four should do it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Scott makes his money on cranberry lemonade and orange mango
juice. But he's a BlackBerry addict.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Nectars cofounder, a self-described ``juice guy,''
is part of a growing cult of hyperconnected entrepreneurs. Scott
swears by his BlackBerry, a calculator-size wireless e-mail device
that's the hottest new gadget on the street _ and on the beach and
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried everything,'' Scott says. ``Most of it, I think, is
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's a BlackBerry evangelist. He uses it all day, every day,
he says, to answer more than 100 messages sent to his regular
e-mail address, to maintain his calendar and address book, and to
check his to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   As summer kicks in, the BlackBerry is just one of many high-tech
tools business people are plunking in their pockets to stay in
touch, whether they're working or slipping out for an afternoon in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy digital phones that work for talking and trading stocks,
Palms, two-way pagers, and tiny computers top the list of gadgets
the 24/7 crowd can't live without.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the surprise: Toting technology isn't just about
fueling workaholic tendencies. It's about getting work done fast,
so there's more time for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Scott calls his BlackBerry ``my greatest freedom provider
ever.'' It has cut down on his cell phone use, because he can
respond quickly via e-mail to simple business inquiries. He can get
a question answered while he's in a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a bonus: ``Your friends start to realize they can
reach you on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He and venture capitalist Jonathan Guerster, of Charles River
Ventures in Waltham, Mass., are lobbying to improve the telephone
signals that power the BlackBerry on Nantucket. Guerster, whose
summer refuge is also on the island, says, ``This device has
totally influenced the way I get business done.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerster says the berry fits the typical venture capitalist's
attention deficit disorder. The landscape of meetings is changing
dramatically, as people sit and surreptitiously respond to e-mails
with deft thumbs on tiny keypads.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Fillat, managing director at Advent International in
Boston, keeps his BlackBerry clipped to his belt. Polaris Venture
Partners in Waltham just ordered the product for its staff. They
cost about $400 a pop, plus $40 a month for e-mail service.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Curvey, online brokerage chief at Fidelity Investments, is
addicted to her two-way wireless pager, an Interactive 950 by
BlackBerry's maker, Research in Motion Ltd. of Ontario. It's
wireless messaging, as opposed to e-mail. She takes it everywhere
and says she'd give up her phone if she were forced to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't live without it,'' Curvey confesses. Hundreds of
Fidelity executives use the same pager _ a device Fidelity also
sells to its brokerage clients. Key features include automatic
indications that people have received and read messages _ and the
ability to get timely market information. Want to check Nasdaq or a
certain stock price every two hours? You can program the pager to
send it to you.
</P>
<P>
   Most business people say they rely on two gadgets. The most
frequent picks: a cell phone and a Palm, the popular line of
hand-held computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Michl, gadget guru and managing director at Ascent Venture
Partners in Boston, says he was disappointed by the Palm when he
rushed out to grab the first one on the market a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it,'' he says. He didn't like the pen technology _
using an attached penlike tool instead of a keypad. He returned his
first two Palms within 30 days of buying them. But now he has a
Palm 5X, and he's a convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finally ready for prime time,'' Michl says. It's fast,
and the screen's easy to read. It can store up to 10,000 addresses,
400 e-mails, and 3,000 to-do items. Michl uses it for Lotus Notes,
and he can download books and calculators, even games. It weighs 4
ounces and costs about $400. Another model, the Palm VII, is
Internet-enabled.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone's still important, too, Michl says. He uses
Motorola's StarTac, a common favorite. Jon Flint, founding partner
at Polaris, says that on his weekly treks on planes, trains, and
automobiles, he stays in touch with a cell phone and a Palm.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Nadig is Boston chief for MetaMarkets, manager of the
OpenFund, an online mutual fund that posts all its trades
real-time. He stays glued to his cell phone but loves his Casio
Pocket PC. It's only a little bigger than a Palm III, he says,
``and infinitely more powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   For $600 (plus add-ons that quickly get you to $1,000) Nadig
does all his e-mail on the Casio, including receiving attachments.
On top of the usual conveniences of address book, calendar and task
list, he can download books, his daily newspaper, and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important, it loads the spreadsheets we use to run the
fund,'' says Nadig, an information animal who's balancing the
demands of a young, venture-backed company with a new family.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has abandoned the laptop for hand-held toys. Tony
Zona, chief executive of Quantum Bridge Communications Inc., a
North Andover, Mass. fiber-optics start-up, says his laptop goes
with him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC allows me to do virtually everything (besides make
calls) _ email, research, calendar management, presentations, and
budgets.'' And Zona still believes in the cell phone: ``It's
important to stay connected _ anywhere, any time.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a downside to all of the gadgetry, business people
say, it's that they're essentially always on call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, you're always accessible,'' says Charles
River's Guerster. ``The bad news is, you're always accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Alper, an analyst at Gomez Advisors in Lincoln, Mass., says
the need to stay in touch is concentrated among a high-powered
minority. For other people, he suggests, the technology is
expensive, inconvenient overkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a subset of hyperactives out there who always have to
be connected,'' Alper says. ``When I go away, I don't even check my
e-mail. It can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he says, ``It's a balance you have to strike between
your professional and personal lives. Otherwise, you never get off
the fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   A cell phone and Palm are enough for Gautam Prakash, a partner
with Bessemer Venture Partners in Wellesley Hills, Mass. Beyond
that, he says, ``My brain gets fried.'' Forget the Blackberry, he
adds. ``I don't want to be that connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the juice guy, has the answer to that. ``If it ties you
up more than it helps you,'' he says, ``shut it off.''

CANADA BLAZES THE TRAIL ON AFFORDABLE DAY CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Imagine dropping your child off at a high-quality
day-care center where the flat-rate tuition is $3.40 a day,
regardless of the family income level.
</P>
<P>
   That's not happening in the United States anytime soon _ but
it's a reality for growing numbers of Canadian families.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, an innovative government-sponsored program has won
wide praise from child-care specialists, educators and parents
groups. This week, British Columbia became the second Canadian
province to create a publicly funded day-care system open to all
families _ rich, poor, and the sprawling majority in between.
</P>
<P>
   As in Quebec, day-care centers in the western province will
charge a minimal fee for care in licensed centers staffed by
trained teachers and paraprofessionals.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Canada carved a defining social policy line
between itself and the United States with the adoption of a
national health care system, free to all citizens. Now this country
appears to be blazing a similar path in day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``These provinces are taking pioneering steps that could be
followed by the rest of the country, as happened with the medical
system,'' said Gillian Doherty, adjunct professor of family
relations at Ontario's University of Guelph. ``It shows Canadians
remain committed to publicly funded social support systems, as
opposed to the (American-style) obsession with cutting government
expenditures no matter what the social cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest contrast between day care in United States and the
two Canadian provinces shows on the bottom line, with Quebec and
British Columbia families paying about $70 a month for the same
level of care for which middle-income families in New England shell
out $800- to $1,200 a month, on average, per child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long ways to go to make child care as affordable for
working class families as it is becoming in Canada,'' said Mark
Smith, coordinating director for the Massachusetts-based Parents
United for Child Care.
</P>
<P>
   The British Columbia program will be less innovative and
far-reaching than that of Quebec, which has doubled provincial
spending on day care while slashing fees and is also underwriting
related programs such as government-subsidized extended maternity
leave. Nonetheless, the British Columbia move marks a dramatic step
toward a system providing affordable, licensed care to all
families.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the best day-care services in Canada tended to be
those offered the poor or the rich, with middle-income families
unable to afford the top echelon centers and unable to qualify for
government-funded programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what all governments should be doing,'' said Sharon
Gregson, a mother of four in Vancouver, where the provincial
Ministry of Social Development has pledged to spend $30 million to
launch a new program open to all families on equal terms.
``Parents, some of whom are paying as much as $1,000 a month, are
going to be getting a break that is literally going to change
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Other provinces may follow the lead set by Quebec and British
Columbia, raising the possibility that Canada will join Scandinavia
in offering a national system of day-care centers staffed by
teachers and licensed child-care specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The path taken in Quebec and British Columbia seems to suggest
that Canada is still a long way from shedding its precept that
government programs _ as opposed to private initiative _ form the
bedrock of social policy. That notion, long representing a major
ideological difference between Canada and its southern neighbor,
has eroded somewhat in recent years as the federal government and
several provinces, notably Ontario and Alberta, have touted
tax-slashing as the first duty of government.
</P>
<P>
   But British Columbia and Quebec represent a contrary trend that
suggests many Canadians want to stick to the course of socialized
democracy, even with the burden of higher tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is moving quickly toward recognizing that child care
is a critical part of a child's development,'' said Jan Pullinger,
the province's minister of Social Development. ``A publicly funded
system makes sure that everyone's children get to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Quebec's 2-year-old $1 billion day-care program is
considered by some observers to be the most innovative in North
America, with more than 100,000 children enrolled in government-run
programs that cost parents 5 Canadian dollars a day, the equivalent
of $3.40 US dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebec is in the forefront of recognizing that a regulated
system is more likely to provide more consistent standards of care
than the hodgepodge of private and subsidized programs now typical
for Canada and the US,'' said Doherty, one of five authors of a
major day-care study that was recently released by the University
of Guelph's Center for Families, Work and Well-Being.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hallmarks of the Quebec system is the doubling of
salaries of day-care workers, a bid to attract more trained
child-specialists to what has long been perceived as a dead-end job
for unskilled women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quebec recognizes that support for young families accomplishes
a greater social good,'' Doherty said. ``In the end, it's about
helping families bring up children who will become good, productive
citizens.''

WHEN BAD NEWS MAY BE GOOD NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was chaos and shock at APBnews.com's (www.apbnews.com) New
York headquarters this week as the respected crime-news Web site
fought for its survival. The 18-month-old operation had attracted
contributors _ ranging from Pulitzer Prize winner Sydney Schanberg
to former O.J. prosecutor Marcia Clark _ won lots of critical
praise, and taken numerous journalism honors. On Tuesday, reporter
Kevin Heldman won a prestigious Livingston Award _ for excellence
by journalists under 35 _ for his coverage of the Japanese penal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, APBnews.com ran out of money, pink-slipped 140
employees and, by midweek, was running on volunteers while
desperately seeking new investors. ``I'm hopeful we'll get
something done this week,'' declared a harried Mark Sauter, a
cofounder and the site's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news generated genuine condolences. ``This particular
company, it's just a shame,'' says Kevin Clark, CEO of
ScreamingMedia (www.screamingmedia.net), which distributes online
content. But a number of analysts also view the APBnews.com
predicament, like the NASDAQ correction and e-commerce shakeout, as
a healthy signal to venture capitalists and cyber entrepreneurs
that reality has finally overtaken exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of shakeup is a good thing,'' says Dan O'Brien,
senior analyst at Forrester Research. ``It's going to shake out
some of the nonsense and the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   The current ``retraction'' is ``going to be healthy over an
extended period,'' says Larry Pryor, executive news editor of the
Online Journalism Review (www.usc.edu), who thinks APBnews.com may
have been a victim of its overarching and expensive ambitions to be
the worldwide leader in crime news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specialize, concentrate, focus,'' Pryor advises online
journalists. ``Come up with a quality product that fills a
speciality niche.''
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com wasn't the only recent online media casualty. On one
end of the spectrum, CBS laid off 24 of its Internet division
staffers this week. On the other, NewsWatch.org _ a modest online
media criticism magazine published by the nonprofit Center for
Media and Public Affairs _ closed up shop last week when its
benefactor cut the fiscal lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com's troubles were the most noteworthy, however,
because the company looked so promising. According to spokesman Joe
Krakoviak, the site had more than 1 million unique viewers in
April. And it was working on new revenue sources, having just
reached agreement with the Prentice Hall publishing company to
develop a Web site for students studying criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a round of financing last summer netted APBnews.com a
healthy $20 million. ``People were literally trying to force money
on us,'' recalls Sauter, son of former CBS News president Van
Gordon Sauter. Then came the technology sector market shock and the
dough dried up. Sauter says investors went from being
``irrationally supportive'' of online journalism ventures to
``irrationally set against them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years, if you had dot.com on your name, you got all
the money you could possibly misspend,'' says Krakoviak. Now,
venture capitalists want revenue streams before the content
schemes. Given that environment, a number of analysts say the moral
of the APBnews.com story is to think smaller and smarter.
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com ``tried to do too much too soon,'' says Online
Journalism Review editor Joshua Fouts. ``There's this gold rush
mentality that we have to have the buffet meal instead of a salad
first.'' Fouts says the shrewder business models belong to more
modest, niched sites like the comedy-oriented Suck.com
(www.suck.com) and The Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com), which
unearths ``confidential and quirky'' documents like Billy Bob
Thornton's and Angelina Jolie's marriage license.
</P>
<P>
   According to ScreamingMedia's Clark, there's another dark cloud
on the horizon for online journalism innovators _ the approach of
old media companies who have finally concluded that ``the Internet
is to be embraced instead of feared.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the online content companies are going to experience
competition from some of the more traditional content companies who
are aggressively moving online,'' he says. If so, the Internet obit
pages may fill up with more victims like APBnews.com.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Jim Romenesko is becoming a victim of his own success. The
proprietor of a wildly popular journalism-news Web site
(www.poynter.org), the low-keyed Romenesko recently won a Webby
Award for best news site, was profiled by New York magazine, and
receives 200-300 e-mails a day from journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Given that volume, Romenesko has begun changing the character of
his site. Where it once relied heavily on stories and items written
by media reporters, it now contains a growing number of e-mails
that create a forum for intramedia skirmishing. Visitors recently
witnessed one APBnews.com staffer e-mailing another ``to go shove
it,'' and a heated debate about whether the Saturday Philadelphia
Daily News is published before the bulldog edition of the Sunday
Philadelphia Inquirer. (Whew!)
</P>
<P>
   Romenesko says he's created a ``pub atmosphere,'' by opening up
the e-mail debate. But here's a vote against it. Anyone interested
in hearing fellow journalists whine, accuse, and speculate can
simply wander into his or her newsroom. Romenesko's site was better
when it eschewed such chatter for more emphasis on ``just the
facts, ma'am.''

WHEN PARTS ARE UNOBTAINABLE, IMPROVISE

   Q. The glass top of my dining table is 60 inches in diameter and
sits on suction cups attached to a bamboo frame. The suction cups
are worn and won't hold. I bought some new ones but they are too
small and also will not hold. What can I use to keep that big glass
on an even keel and safe?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA HANLON, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I looked in my catalogs _ without success. You would think
someone would sell big old suction cups for various purposes, but
not to my knowledge, or that I could discover. So, you have to play
it by ear, and I suggest this: Take off the suction cups, if they
are still there, and put a neat, medium-size dab of adhesive caulk
on each upright support on the frame. Then press the glass in
place. You may have sort of a blob of adhesive that you can see,
but that stuff holds like crazy. Adhesive caulk is sold in caulking
cartridges or tubes at hardware and building stores. Two good
brands are PhenoSeal and PolySeamSeal. The handyman, who has glued
tile with the stuff, can attest to how strong it is.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe a piece of soft, flat rubber secured to the posts will
hold the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to fasten is to drill holes, if the glass is not
tempered, and screw the glass top onto the framework with solid
brass screws. You can buy special bits for drilling into glass, but
I have to repeat: Do not try this on tempered glass; it will
explode if tampered with. Or, have a glass company drill the holes
for you. And, caveat emptor: There is always a chance of breaking
the glass while drilling holes.

   The saga of smelly houses from downdrafts in chimneys continues.
The problem is that some houses have downdrafts in their chimneys,
even with the damper tightly closed, and those downdrafts bring in
the repulsive odor of burnt wood, creosote, and other wondrous
things. One solution is to close off the firebox opening, very
tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cassidy of Chelmsford, Mass. has a better idea, and called
to tell us about it: ``My problem was aggravated by a whole-house
fan, which drew in some pretty powerful odors when I turned it on.
My fireplace damper is the kind you push to open and pull to close,
and is pretty tight but not tight enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a piece of plastic, opened the flue damper, put the
plastic up across the opening, and then closed the damper onto the
plastic, creating a seal. It worked great.
</P>
<P>
   ``One word of caution: Tell your wife what you have done because
mine was seconds away from starting a fire without taking out the
plastic one chilly day last fall. That would have been a real smoky
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Good point, Bill, and thanks for the tip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wood front door is 60 years old and has tiny cracks, big
enough to see daylight through. How can I fill them, and how can I
paint the door to fill the cracks?
</P>
<P>
   JOY GENTLE, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint is unlikely to fill even tiny cracks; if you tried it,
the wood would expand and contract and the cracks would open again.
So, try this: Apply a bead of caulk to the cracks, then press the
caulk in with your fingers. Scrape off excess and wipe smooth with
a wet sponge, or wait a few days and sand smooth. Do this on both
sides of the door. The caulking should be flexible enough to be
pressed into small cracks; no other material will do. The caulk
will expand and contract with the movement of the wood, so the
cracks are less likely to open again.
</P>
<P>
   To paint, sand heavily, wash with a strong detergent, and rinse.
Apply a latex exterior primer and finish off with two coats of a
latex trim or housepaint. And remember: thin coats. Exterior
oil-based primer used to be the state of the art primer to go with
a latex finish paint, but the new latex primers are close to the
quality of the oil primers.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny; sometimes in the maintenance of your house you will
do a remarkable paint job (or other project) that lasts far beyond
its expected life. You must have done something right, you say, but
no doubt you have forgotten what you used. It matters not; if you
remember what you used and try to use it again, chances are it is
not sold anymore, or its formula has been changed, or it has been
banned because it was toxic.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman's front door is like that. It has lasted close to
20 years, and has not faded or peeled. It is alligatoring a bit,
but not so much that it has to be redone immediately. I remember
using an oil-based primer and a latex trim paint. Brand? Haven't
the faintest clue.

 WEB CAMERAS AT DAY-CARE CENTERS CAPTURE PARENTS' ATTENTION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if parents are confident about the safety of a day care
center, worries often haunt them throughout the work day. Does the
timid toddler morph into the diapered despot when mother and father
are out of sight? Or the greedy grabber? Or, worse yet, the lonely
left-out?
</P>
<P>
   Curious parents no longer have to peek from behind the cubbies
to see what's going on: they use a Web camera.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a controversial frill in the day-care
industry, a growing number of parents are getting the chance to
become a cyberfly on the day-care wall. At work or at home, they
simply log onto a Web site, type in a password, then enter the
world of Playground Time, Nap Time, and Circle Time.
</P>
<P>
   Via video cameras installed in each room, parents see their
child's activities in images delivered as slowly as snapshots
updated every few seconds or as quickly as a real-time movie. The
footage comes without audio, so there are no squeals of delight or
shouts of a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   The security benefits are obvious, but some child psychologists
worry that these centers aren't giving enough thought to how the
spontaneous and often wild world of childhood can be misinterpreted
on film.
</P>
<P>
   And will the staff and children become more inhibited if they
know parents will watch them at random moments of the day?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a staff member, you will never pick your nose
again,'' said Jacqueline Olds, a Cambridge, Mass. child
psychiatrist. ``And if you're a child, you feel that loss of
privacy in spades.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, these Web cameras have been hooked into
the ceilings of a growing number of child-care centers nationwide
over the past year, especially those catering to computer-savvy
two-career couples. National groups overseeing day-care groups
don't have any figures, but several major companies that run these
video services report wiring hundreds of centers in dozens of
states.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will see an influx of wired centers this summer
when Knowledge Beginnings, a company based in San Rafael, Calif.,
activates five sites around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   These Web cameras, however, are not just part of the high-tech
beltway. Bright Beginnings in Winthrop, Mass., which became perhaps
the state's first wired center last summer, is located between two
auto body shops on a semicommercial strip. And in the coming year,
Knowledge Beginnings will unveil sites in Littleton, Concord,
Newburyport, Peabody, and Hyannis, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For parents who are only too familiar with the heart-wrenching
details of the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen while in the
care of Louise Woodward as well as the sexual molestation
convictions at the Fells Acres Day School, these video cameras can
seem like a godsend, judging by the early reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear so many horror stories,'' said Bob Scalli, 38, a real
estate investor whose 4-year-old son is enrolled at Bright
Beginnings. ``To me, a picture is worth a thousand words. With the
cameras, we are connected even when we're away.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hatch, regional director for operations for Knowledge
Beginnings, said the Web cameras ease the minds of parents who are
away 8 to 10 hours a day. He said grandparents who live abroad, as
long as they have Internet access and know the password, also can
watch their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing another window for them to peek into,'' he
said. ``It's an extension of our open-door policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said his center's Web site offers more than photo images;
it provides chat rooms for parents to ask questions about topics
ranging from toilet training to reading. The site lists the menus
for lunch and snack, progress reports, and curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   These amenities come at a price. Knowledge Beginnings is at the
high end, charging $800 to $1,170 a month for a five-day program,
with infant care costing the most. Parents pay an extra $15 or so a
month if they want the video-viewing option.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bright Beginnings site, which has fewer amenities, the
monthly charges are $560 to $780 a month, and the video services
are included.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the video option, however, may be worth it to
parents who want the reassurance that their child who was sobbing
at drop-off time was laughing in the dress-up area minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful to know that 20 minutes after you got to
work, the child was really OK,'' said Ellen Modica, family services
coordinator for the Child Care Resource Center in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some early-childhood specialists warn parents not to have
a knee-jerk positive reaction to anything related to the word
``computer.'' They expect that the cameras will influence
children's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   They say children as young as 2 or 3 years old may interpret the
cameras as a symbol of their parents' overwhelming power, and delay
their struggles toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   Several children interviewed at centers that have cameras
described them as tools to monitor their behavior, much like the
Santa Claus notion of knowing whether ``you've been naughty or
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They watch people when they do bad things,'' said Huy Pham, 5,
who is enrolled at Knowledge Beginnings in Chelmsford, where the
cameras are scheduled to be activated in two months.
</P>
<P>
   While some children said the cameras were simply for fun or a
way to say hello to parents, a 4-year-old boy said the devices were
the video eyes of the staff. ``If the teachers are somewhere else,
they can say, `This is a good boy or this is a bad boy,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Olds, the child psychiatrist, said hard-working parents should
guard against becoming the ``over-scrutinizing'' parent, the one
who confronts the day-care staff because the video showed their
child getting pushed one day. She emphasized that the camera should
work to enhance, not erode, a trusting relationship between staff
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Hooper, director of the Arlington Children's Center, which
does not have video cameras, said she can imagine a scenario in
which a teacher has to intervene in a crowd of children. Depending
on the context, that teacher's actions could seem tyrannical or
timid _ or totally appropriate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists also wondered whether parents may feel free
to work longer hours, as long as they see the reassuring image of
their happy child on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the psychological impact of these cameras appears to
have taken a back seat to the security issues. Day-care operators
go to great lengths to reassure parents that each family has a
special password, so Web-surfing strangers cannot view the
children. Cameras are not aimed at bathrooms or diaper-changing
areas, and images cannot be printed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers write, suspicious about nefarious uses of Night Vision,
angry that I even review SUVs and pickup trucks, wondering why
their tires are lasting so long. They want answers. I've got 'em.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have over 85,000 miles on . . . my 1995 Buick Regal. The
tires are Goodyear Invicta GS. I have checked the tread regularly
using the Lincoln's head-on-the-penny technique and looked at them
carefully when the car is on the lift for an oil change. I have
never had tires last this long . . . . This is making me nervous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Not to worry, says Dave Wilkins, a Goodyear spokesman. The
reason you can insert the penny upside down in a groove and still
have enough tread to touch part of the dead president's head is
that you obviously know about tires and take care of them, keeping
them inflated properly, rotated regularly, and aligned. Wilkins
says he often gets calls from folks with 100,000 miles on their
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to check for wear on tires, he says, is to watch for
a ``wear indicator.'' It is a small band of rubber that will appear
running across the tread groove when the tires wear to a certain
point.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have heard that Ford has delayed the introduction of the
new Thunderbird. A dealer said they were afraid there would be too
much demand and they want to be sure they can build enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  An auto manufacturer holding off on production because of
fears that demand might be too high? Right. Here's the plan for the
new Thunderbird, according to Ford's Kathleen Hamilton. Production
starts in 2001. The T-Birds will be ready for sale in the 2002
model year. My advice: Get in line.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  After a column on Cadillac's new Night Vision system, which
lets the driver see objects well beyond the range of headlights,
one reader asked if Night Vision would allow ``young kids'' to
drive without lights for kicks or criminals to flee the law.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Stuart Klapper, director of automotive programs for
Raytheon, which developed Night Vision along with General Motors,
says it can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Night Vision system is linked to the headlights. If
the headlights aren't on, neither is Night Vision.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he explains, the system for civilian autos is weak
compared to what Raytheon builds for the military. You couldn't
drive at night with just the former. You can with the latter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  Most of the vehicles you review fall into the category of
gas-guzzling, overpowered, destructive trucks . . . . The
glamorization of SUVs makes you responsible for the environmental
and safety hazards they create. Do you want this on your shoulders?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Here is how I choose what I write about: which vehicles are
people most interested in buying; which vehicles represent a step
forward in what and how we drive; which vehicles are ``fantasies''
that most of us will never be able to buy but we can share
vicarious thrills about because I drive them.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, truck sales (including SUVs) exceed auto sales. When
I am write about them, I am writing about what people obviously
want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, I wrote 38 reviews of cars and 13 reviews of
SUVs, trucks, and vans. Anger at the thought of me even reviewing
an SUV apparently blinded this reader, who probably did not see
reviews of the Honda Insight, Toyota Echo, Ford Focus, and lots of
little two-seat sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, I've got big shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  My husband and I are looking to replace our pickup tuck.
The truck we want is too expensive. We are interested in the Subaru
Outback, but magazines have warned it has poor pickup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Subaru has an answer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Detroit International Auto Show this year, the company
unveiled a new engine for the Outback, an H-6 (that's
horizontally-opposed cylinders) 3.0 liter. It will generate 212
horsepower _ plenty to give the small SUV the pop you want.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have heard Toyota has a new SUV ready to hit the market.
What is it called?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Actually, Toyota, even while saying it would like to be a
greener company but these are what customers are demanding, is
introducing two SUVs. If you want big and luxurious, go for the
Sequoia, a V8 Suburban-sized beast based on the Tundra pickup
truck. If a more car-like SUV is your desire, they will have the
Highlander, all-wheel-drive, not as high from the ground, not
really meant for off-road travel but good for winter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  When I asked in a column how it can be that the outside,
commuter lane on Interstate 93 north comes to a complete halt as
you approach the 128 intersection while cars three lanes over on
the right are making their exit _ and how if one jerk trying to get
by just one more car by using the passing lane before swerving to
exit causes the backup _ a reader had a question: Didn't I mean the
inside lane, when I spoke of the commuter lane, and isn't the exit
lane the outside lane?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  Well, sign me ``Confused.'' I always considered the lane I
passed people in and commuted in to be the outside lane, and that I
exited from the inside lane, much as a race car going into the pits
from the inside lane on a track. Maybe the reader is right. What do
the rest of you think?

 THE ROUSH VERSION: SUV'S DELUSION  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is for all those folks who drive their big SUVs like
idiots, weaving in traffic at high speed, tailgating at any speed,
snapping through lane changes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the SUV you think you are driving.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is not the top-heavy, ready-to-roll, hard-to-stop rig
you really do drive and with which you endanger others when you
shift into nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   This one started out as a Ford Expedition XLT. The Expedition
was introduced in 1997 and has done quite well up against the
Suburban and other competitors. Like most big SUVs, it is based on
a pickup truck, in this case the F150. In its original form, this
test Expedition was a solid, dependable SUV with all the inherent
benefits and dangers of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Then the folks at Roush Performance in Detroit got their hands
on it. If you're a NASCAR fan, you'll recognize the name Roush and
know where we're headed here. If not, a briefing: Jack Roush owns
Roush Industries. It has three divisions: Racing (he sponsors five
Winston Cup teams), Technology, and Performance.
</P>
<P>
   The latter group, drawing on the engineering that comes out of
Technology and the brand recognition that Racing provides, takes
certain Fords _ the F150, the Mustang, and the Expedition _ and
tweaks them big-time, with their own suspensions, interior options,
supercharged engines.
</P>
<P>
   Which gave us this beast we just spent a week driving.
</P>
<P>
   Now before all you folks who get upset when I test a big
gas-guzzler of an SUV begin firing off your hate mail, I've got
something in the weeks ahead for you. I'll be in Arizona in the
middle of June at a competition called FutureTruck. There, 10
engineering schools from around the country will each take a
Suburban that they have rebuilt to make them more environmentally
friendly, and run through tests to see who has done the best job.
It's important because it represents where SUVs, if they continue
to be mass produced, will have to go.
</P>
<P>
   Roush only sells about 250 of these special Expeditions a year,
so we're not talking huge environmental impact here. This is a car
for special people with special wants _ mostly guys over 35 with
healthy incomes and a need for speed, even in a big rig.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it sells best in Southern California and
Texas, according to Joe Thompson, the national sales manager for
Roush Performance.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with the 5.4-liter V-8 that is an Expedition. They do
only one thing to the engine, but it is a big thing: Roush bolts on
a Paxton supercharger, but limits it to 6-8 pounds of boost.
Enough, says Thompson, for ``exhilaration without destroying the
power train.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it gives a 40 percent increase in horsepower to 365.
Torque is up 30 percent, to a whopping 483 lb.-ft. Of course, that
helps cut gasoline mileage to 10.25, but folks who buy this car _
with more than $17,000 in Roush goodies added to the Expedition's
sticker _ probably aren't looking to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a 3 1/2-ton rocket that seems launched at start
and pounds through a seemingly endless torque curve.
</P>
<P>
   It's lowered by two inches for stability and the suspension has
a big upgrade that includes high performance Billstein shock
absorbers, lowered springs, and thicker sway bars.
</P>
<P>
   It works, as the big rig is remarkably nimble and virtually free
of the dangerous pitch and roll you get in standard SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   The inside is luxurious and headroom and legroom abound. The
Roush package includes wood-grain dash inserts, leather seats with
extra side bolsters, and machined billet floor pedals. The Roush
logo is everywhere _ floor mats, pedals, front and rear windows.
The seats are solid and supportive, and even the middle bench has
the feel of three buckets. The rear bench is more spartan, but is
comfortable as well.
</P>
<P>
   Television sets in the back of each front bucket keep middle
seat passengers happy. Ergonomically, it's very well designed with
pockets and bins everywhere and a huge center console that holds a
CD changer and still has big space.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 dealers nationwide are authorized to sell Roush
Fords (see www.roushperf.com for details). You can buy what a
dealer may have in stock, or order an Expedition, which Ford will
ship to Roush for the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   This is not for everyone, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the car that many jerks think they are driving _
although they are not.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   Cupholders with slots cut away from the circle for _ amazing _
coffee cup handles.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   A speedometer that only goes to 100. Not that we need to go
there, but who are they kidding?

SURVIVING THE ATTACK OF A BESTSELLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook'' comes with a
warning: ``Do not attempt to undertake any of the activities
described in this book yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a survival handbook, no? In the event I find myself,
say, entwined in a python, the authors' advice (``Try to unwrap the
coils, starting from whichever end is available'') seems like it
might be useful. So, given the warning, am I supposed to just let
the thing squeeze me to death?
</P>
<P>
   David Borgenicht assured me that I should feel free to wrestle
the python, but if anything goes wrong I should consider myself
warned. In other words, I shouldn't call James ``Helping Injured
People'' Sokolove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook'' is a publishing
phenomenon. The little yellow book came out late last year with no
fanfare, but it quickly became a word-of-mouth success. There are
now 500,000 copies in print, and it's about to go to its ninth
printing. Last Sunday it was on The New York Times bestseller's
list at No. 4 in the advice, how-to, and miscellaneous category. On
Sunday it will jump to No. 2, just behind ``Chicken Soup for the
Teenage Soul III.'' All of this has surprised the authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in publishing long enough to know that the odds of
having a bestseller are about as long as finding yourself in some
of the scenarios in our book,'' said Borgenicht, from his office in
Philadelphia. ``Actually, you're probably more likely to be
attacked by a shark than have a bestseller.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has obvious appeal for those of a paranoid disposition.
Others read it for laughs; some bookstores stock it on the
``humor'' shelf. But the book taps into something bigger: the
current rage for stories about nature-as-ordeal. It appeals to many
of the same readers who loved ``The Perfect Storm'' and ``Into Thin
Air.'' Borgenicht describes these types as ``people who want to
think of themselves as adventurous even if they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Borgenicht said he came up with the idea for the book while
reading an article on how to land a plane in an emergency. ``I
started thinking about all the cool stuff I've seen in action
movies, the situations the heroes get into,'' he said. ``But
they've got stunt men and trick photography. What about the rest of
us?''
</P>
<P>
   The authors interviewed experts in various fields, among them
Coleman Cooney, director of the Bullfight School (``How to Deal
With a Charging Bull'') and Chris Caso, stuntman (``How to Jump
From a Building Into a Dumpster'') and Joe Jennings, skydiving
coordination specialist (``How to Survive If Your Parachute Fails
to Open'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these situations are not likely to happen, but they do
happen to people now and then, so you never know,'' Borgenicht
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance you may have to wrestle an alligator, here's
some advice: ``Cover the alligator's eyes. This will usually make
it more sedate.'' The handbook doesn't say just what you're
supposed to cover the alligator's eyes with. Your hands?
Peek-a-boo, Mr. Alligator. The advice about how to escape from a
swarm of killer bees seems easier to implement. It boils down to
this: Run for your life.
</P>
<P>
   Borgenicht and Piven are working on a related book, ``The
Worst-Case Scenario Travel Handbook,'' a collection of advice from
experts on subjects such as how to survive a plane crash, how to
deal with terrorists, how to avoid being rude to people in other
countries. ``Everything,'' says Borgenicht, ``from insult to
injury.''

LOOK WHO'S BEHIND THE FINAL CURTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, dear reader, you have a rare opportunity to participate
in a historic event. This column, you see, isn't destined for the
bottom of the bird cage or the recycling bin. No, today's column is
a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about art: It is art. Some day soon, these humble
words will end up in the archives of conceptual artist Joey Skaggs
as part of the documentation of his latest opus. Skaggs is a
culture jammer who has spent the last 30 years fooling the media
with elaborate hoaxes. The media, he says, is his medium, so
everything written about him immediately becomes part of his work.
Voila: Art.
</P>
<P>
   This creative exercise begins at the end _ as in death, the
ultimate exit, the inevitable last call. In October, Skaggs's alter
ego Stuart MacLelland sent out a press release announcing
finalcurtain.com, the Web site for a chain of funeral theme parks.
``Death got you down?'' it asked. ``At last an alternative!'' The
concept, complete with time shares, vacation packages, galleries,
and restaurants called Dante's Grill and Heaven's Gate Cafe, proved
that you don't have to go gentle into that good night: Instead, you
can dance merrily on the tombstones, or ``site-specific works of
passage.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was a prank orchestrated to satirize the death
industry and to expose the media's willingness to jump all over a
to-die-for story. And jump they did. Stories about Final Curtain
appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines, including ``The Los
Angeles Times'' and ``Mother Jones,'' as well as on radio stations
and Web sites. Skaggs exposed the prank himself by issuing another
press release last month, explaining how he had spent two years
hatching his hoax.
</P>
<P>
   So who is this crazy character and why does he do this? ``I'm an
artist, and the media is my canvas,'' says Skaggs during a
telephone interview from Hawaii, where he says he is vacationing in
a sort of ``birdcage, tree house by the beach.'' Something,
allegedly a cardinal, chirps in the background. ``In my own
self-righteous way,'' he continues, ``I think there are
sociopolitical issues that need to be examined. That's what my art
is. It's not wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The person in the bird cage claiming to be Skaggs is an outgoing
fellow, certainly not lacking in self-esteem. But he's spent his
whole career hoodwinking journalists and proving that they
shouldn't believe a word anyone says without doing a thorough
background check. So how do we know this guy is really Skaggs? He
sent somebody else to represent himself on a segment of ``To Tell
the Truth'' and pulled the same stunt on ``Entertainment Tonight.''
And he won't give his age _ ``You don't need to know that'' _ but a
1994 ``New York Times'' article put his age at 48 in 1994, which
would make him 54, give or take a year. When he isn't hanging out
in Hawaii, he says he lives in SoHo and makes a living teaching at
schools including his alma mater, New York's School for the Visual
Arts. A Joey Skaggs is, in fact, listed in the Manhattan phonebook,
and the registrar at the School for the Visual Arts confirmed that
Skaggs is on the list of occasional instructors there and that he
graduated with a degree in advertising in 1982. Hmm. He must have
been a late bloomer: Do the math.
</P>
<P>
   A quick check of Dow Jones Interactive unveils scads of articles
written about Skaggs and his scams over the past 20 years. (They're
also documented at www.joeyskaggs.com.) These include: The Fat
Squad, a team of calorie cops run by Joe Bones; Portofess, a
confessional on wheels featured at the 1992 Democratic Convention;
and Cathouse for Dogs, a bow-wow bordello. And then there was the
Celebrity Sperm Bank, a scheme launched in 1976 that caused outrage
among the media and the moralists. The Internet, of course, makes
it easy to make money off such stunts. Remember all the attention
given last year to RonAngels.com, the Web site ostensibly
auctioning off model's donor eggs that was run by a notorious
pornographer?
</P>
<P>
   Skaggs, the performance artist, differentiates himself from the
con artists: ``It's all in the intent,'' he says. ``There's no
money in it.'' He also says he would be happy if some hard-working
journalist sniffed out the truth. ``I have never been busted,'' he
says, sighing. ``That is the sad truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But not exactly the whole truth. Journalist Brock Meeks exposed
his Sexonix project in 1993 when Skaggs claimed to have invented a
cybersex apparatus that was confiscated by Canadian customs agents.
And in 1992, nobody showed up when he announced a press conference
at New York City Hall to unveil a Brooklyn Bridge lotto.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, however, that many media outlets don't own up to
their mistakes when they fall for his tricks. ``Everyone wants
acknowledgment and verification,'' he says. The media hacktivist,
it turns out, craves media attention. ``Satirists don't have a lot
of friends,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have quite a scrapbook. Scaggs maintains an
extensive archive of articles written about his culture jams.
``Like it or not, you are part of my art,'' he says. ``You're very
brave _ and foolish, too.'' So you, dear reader, have a choice. You
can keep this column for your own art collection, you can put it in
your birdcage, or you can send it to Skaggs to add to the Final
Curtain memorial. He, or one of his aliases, can be reached at
info(at)joeyskaggs.com or P.O. Box 212, Anahola, Hawaii 96703.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The folks who run a bizarre Web site called Temple ov Thee Lemur
(www.totl.net) don't try to pass themselves off as culture jammers
or artists. They're just a bunch of British blokes with a strange
sense of humor. (Don't ask about the name: It's based on an obscure
pun and would take way too long to explain.) Last week, they
announced that they had created a potato-powered computer. The site
even had an FAQ. Sample queries: How long do the potatoes last? Can
you eat them?
</P>
<P>
   The BBC ran a serious piece about this nonexistent invention,
illustrated with a photograph of ``the potatoes in action.'' USA
Today and other august media outlets picked up the story. But Web
master Steve Harris says he never expected anyone to believe you
could run a microchip off a potato chip. ``We never intended to
fool anyone,'' says Harris, 25, of Southampton, England, one of
seven tech heads who run the site. ``Most of our readers are geeks,
and we thought it was obvious that it was a windup.'' Translation:
Windup is British for hoax.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enough windups. The following items are entirely true.
</P>
<P>
   --Texas death row inmate Michael Toney tried to auction off five
seats to his execution on eBay. The auction site shut down the sale
a few hours after it began, and Toney's lawyer said his client's
action was ``totally inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   --Teen pop icon Britney Spears and bad boy rapper Eminem are
working together in cyberspace. No joke. The latest song making the
rounds online is an unauthorized remix called ``My Name is Crazy.''
It pairs the raunchy lyrics to Eminem's ```My Name Is'' with
Spear's slick pop hit ``Crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   --Newt Gingrich and his lovely fiance Callista Bisek (No. 3!)
are in dire need of a tart tin and a citrus zester _ along with
every kind of wine glass, champagne flute, and brandy snifter
imaginable. The lovebirds are registered online at Williams-Sonoma

   The Williams-Sonoma gift list is the featured document this week

investigative reporters who have dug up incriminating evidence on
everyone from Howard Stern to alleged multimillionaire Rick
Rockwell. These guys would never fall for something like The Final

Skaggs some day.

 SEX-DOOR NEIGHBORS: WEB PORN DOES SUBURBIA  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The four-bedroom brick colonial seems to be the very model of
mainstream suburbia: two cars in the driveway, friendly dogs at the
door, a pool in the backyard, a grand piano in the
climate-controlled library. The owners are Internet entrepreneurs.
In their spare time, they like to garden, rock climb, and sail.
</P>
<P>
   And down in the basement, they run a profitable online
pornography business that specializes in bondage and domination.
</P>
<P>
   When the neighbors ask what they do, the owners say, ``We're in
e-commerce.'' Located in southern New Hampshire, the Phoenix Group
is a multimillion-dollar operation that employs a staff of seven,
including a former middle school teacher. ``We're not doing as well
as Bill Gates, but we have a nice nest egg,'' says Phoenix Group
founder Colin Daniels (a pseudonym), 45, a former professional
musician. Daniels says his business, which includes a flagship
site, boasts a cumulative total of 150,000 customers a year; he
points out that many of these customers sign on for the service for
short periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when venture capitalists and business leaders are
falling all over themselves trying to figure out how to make money
on the Web, entrepreneurs in the online adult entertainment
industry are floating in profits. With its global reach, instant
accessibility, and anonymity, the Internet has brought pornography
into the mainstream, taking it out of the penthouses and mansions
of porn kings and placing it smack in the basements and garages of
middle America.
</P>
<P>
   Since virtually all of the companies are private and many of the
merchants tend to be cagey and circumspect, it's hard to determine
the exact size of the industry. Most analysts steer clear of the
trade, and ratings services like Media Metrix don't track adult
sites as a separate category. But according to a 1999 study by the
New York-based research firm Datamonitor, adult content accounts
for 69 percent of the $1.4 billion market for online services;
other estimates put the online porn business at between $1 billion
and $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In April, some 17.6 million users, or 22 percent of all Internet
users, visited an adult site, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings. And
the top-rated porn site in April received more traffic than such
popular mainstream sites as AskJeeves .com, Priceline.com, and
Barnes andNoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ranging content Industry sources estimate that there are
tens of thousands of porn sites on the Internet, offering
everything from still photographs to live Webcams and streaming
video. The content is all over the map; virtual sex shops sport
names like Lust Highway, Sex on the Strip, Busty Amateurs, and
Granny Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Run by amateurs and semi-pros all over the country, many of
these sites are turning a handsome profit. While the top few sites
are run by a handful of old-fashioned porn purveyors, there is a
brand-new group of proprietors that includes slick young computer
wizards, former porn stars, and suburban swingers. Young and old,
male and female, they pioneer new technologies and marketing
methods years before they are adopted by the mainstream corporate
world. Almost all of them use pseudonyms, and many of them defy
stereotypes, like the Cambridge programmer who runs a paid porn
site so he can afford to run free support groups for people with
HIV and other chronic disorders. ``A lot of these people are geeks
who obsess about code, not content,'' says Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the adult entertainment industry exists in its own
alternative universe on the Internet, independent of the vagaries
of venture capitalists and the Nasdaq market. It has its own
villains and heroines, its own search engines and service
organizations, its own award ceremonies and trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   It has a fair share of hucksters and rip-off artists, but it
also has its own self-appointed consumer watchdog, a former
advertising saleswoman named Jane Duvall who runs Jane's Guide, a
popular Web site that monitors industry fraud.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's part of a college curriculum: Last month, San
Francisco State University launched a course that studies the
online skin scene.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is: Sex sells.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Danni Ashe, a former centerfold who has become a sort
of poster girl for the flourishing industry. She started her
soft-core site, Danni's Hard Drive, for $8,000 in 1995; her
business now employs 38 people and grossed $5.2 million last year,
with projected earnings of $7 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are all genetically programmed to want to have
sex and talk about sex and look at sex,'' says Ashe, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated technology But the success of the industry doesn't
ride on hormonal instinct alone.
</P>
<P>
   Porn has always driven the development of media technology, from
nickelodeon peep shows to videocassettes to Webcams to live,
streaming video. The next generation of Internet add-ons is already
in development; one company is marketing a line of tactile devices
called ``cyberdildonics,'' and Vivid Entertainment Inc. invented a
neoprene cybersex bodysuit with 36 built-in sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware manufacturers often test new high-end systems on porn
sites, which generate heavy traffic and require high bandwidth.
``It's all very confidential, but the major vendors do it all the
time,'' says Chris Buerger, manager of networking for Datamonitor.
</P>
<P>
   The online pornographers also pioneered marketing techniques
that have been adopted by mainstream merchants and publishers all
over the Internet. They were early adapters of pop-up windows and
exit consoles that invite users to visit affiliated Web sites; the
referring site gets a cut of any business conducted at the next
site. Amazon.com and other e-merchants now have similar referring
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The free porn sites, or ``farm'' sites, make decent money this
way; many of them are run by the same folks who operate the
subscription sites, which charge up to $25 a month. Cooperation is
the name of the game in the industry: Large or small, providers are
all involved in a complex web of partnerships and profit-sharing
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The adult sites also expertly monitor and filter traffic,
building demographic profiles of customers to target ads
specifically to users. ``You don't try to sell a lawnmower during
`Oprah,' `` explains Andrew Edmond, chief executive officer of
SexTracker, a Seattle-based service company that hosts porn sites
and markets statistical analysis tools.
</P>
<P>
   The porn industry has always been a few steps ahead of the
mainstream entertainment industry, which is embroiled in lawsuits
involving Internet piracy and hasn't figured out how to make money
of its own online. Likewise, none of the megahyped start-ups
offering mainstream online entertainment have been able to develop
a following, sustain a profit, or pay back their investors. Two
high-profile Net entertainment start-ups, DEN and Pixelon, are both
mired in scandal and headed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream attention To be sure, Hollywood executives are
watching the adult world, but they're doing it quietly. ``It's not
like they have big board meetings and trot out the porn and say,
`Get me some of that,' `` says Mark Hardie, a former analyst with
Forrester Research. ``But they are looking at areas where money is
being made and asking, `If they're making money, why can't we?' ``
That is, of course, the question of the moment on Wall Street and
Main Street alike. But even the porn sites are seeing a drop in
profits these days, in part because the credit card companies are
putting the squeeze on shady operators, instituting higher fees and
penalties for merchant accounts.
</P>
<P>
   American Express recently announced it was dropping all merchant
accounts for online porn sites. And the scams in the industry are
notorious. Some sites are rigged so that users trying to exit are
bombarded by page after page of smut; other sites offer ``free
trial'' periods and then bill customers before they can cancel.
Late last year, Seth Warshavsky, the Seattle wheeler-dealer
infamous for selling the Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson Lee sex
video online, was accused by his employees of double-billing
thousands of customers. And in April, a scam artist duped Web users
out of thousands of dollars by using software that reset their
modems to dial the African nation of Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Some adult entertainment moguls turn a blind eye to such fraud,
but others in the business are trying to force the industry to
police itself. ``There is an attitude in the adult industry of
`Rah, rah, we're all in this together,' `` says Duvall of Jane's
Guide. ``But my big thing is that people should know what they're
getting and they shouldn't get ripped off.'' Her site crusades
against scams and evaluates porn sites on such consumer issues as
customer service and user agreements.

&HT;     ADVICE ON CHOOSING A WINE FOR ANY TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE WALKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEBASTOPOL, Calif. _ How does a woman's love for a grilled
cheese sandwich with a glass of wine lead to the creation of an
unusual wine-food pairing system?
</P>
<P>
   For Barbara Hom, it was simple. As a single mother, she often
sat down to a meal of grilled cheese sandwiches, or maybe even a
bowl of ramen noodles. And she'd reach for a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she began to refine a system she calls the ``flavor
spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things are never quite this easy. Hom, in fact, had a
solid resume and history of hard work to back up her theories about
food and wine pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly the owner of an award-winning restaurant in Santa Rosa,
Calif., Hom began her culinary career working with her father, a
Chinese master chef who came to the United States in the 1940s.
From him, she learned the basics of Asian cuisine, which figure
strongly in her cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Though she got a college degree in mathematics, her first love
was cooking. She won a trip to Europe after she graduated from
college, fell in love with it and stayed two years by picking up
cooking jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to California, she opened a restaurant, Fans,
but decided to close the eatery a few years after she became a mom.
Before long, she was back at work, however, as chef/owner of Night
Owl Catering in Sebastopol and contracting her services out as chef
to Sonoma County wineries and wine groups.
</P>
<P>
   But don't ever accuse her of being a wine snob. In fact, her
philosophy might be summed up this way: Never apologize for your
taste in food or wine, because everybody's palate is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snobbery doesn't encourage people to drink wine,'' said Hom.
</P>
<P>
   At a March media seminar for Huntington Wines, a member of the
Wimbledon Wine Group, Hom paired the wines with some of her dishes,
such as Salmon in a Coriander and Lemongrass Crust or a tart Lemon
Custard ice cream, to show how food works in unexpected ways with
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Her flavor spectrum is basically a four-part approach.
</P>
<P>
   First, you can take the traditional approach, which she calls
``mirroring.'' Find a flavor in the food, such as duck with a black
cherry sauce, then match it to a wine with similar flavors, such as
a zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the contrast approach. ``This takes the characteristic
of the wine and balances or complements it with the food.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a food is big and bold, everyone automatically thinks you
have to have a big, bold wine. But sometimes, something delicate
will work if there is a flavor contrast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth aspects to her flavor spectrum are where
she diverges from the traditional. These are the ``controversial
matches'' and ``outside-the-box'' pairings.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of controversy arose, for instance, when she was sitting
around with chef friends to plan a high-profile event. The dessert
was supposed to be chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found we had mixed opinions about what should be served
with chocolate and everyone felt very strongly about it. Then I
realized it just had to do with your individual palate. When I read
up on the subject, I found that people's body chemistry really does
make a difference in how they perceive tastes,'' said Hom.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking ``outside the box,'' the fourth aspect to her pairing
system, led to pairing the lemon ice cream with a Huntington
chardonnay, as an example. ``Everyone says wine can't go with ice
cream, but the Huntington had all this citrus in it _ and it just
worked,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I've done (with the flavor spectrum) is put into
words things we all have felt. If you go into a restaurant and
order wine, you don't want to be intimidated. So you might say
(about your wine choice), `I know (there) is a controversy on
this,' and go ahead and just order what you feel like ordering.''
</P>
<P>
   By presenting these and other seminars to the public and groups
of restaurant employees, Hom says she is hoping to bridge the gap
that sometimes develops between the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to say is that everyone has an opinion _ and
everyone's opinion has validity.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does she drink with that grilled cheese sandwich?
Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can take a thin wine, like some of the Napa
chards that are reaching for a rich, buttery taste but not quite
getting there, and find that the fat in the food actually helps the
wine taste better,'' she said.

AUTHENTIC VOICES THAT SPEAK OF THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four or five times a year I get a packet in the mail. I know
immediately what's inside _ essays a reader wants to share with me.
</P>
<P>
   A mother has discovered a child is gay, or a wife is struggling
to comprehend her husband's sudden abandonment. A child has watched
an estranged parent die, or a woman is trying to come to terms with
her infertility. I read these stories, deeply moved by the effort
these women have made to understand the hand life has dealt them.
Having wrestled with questions of meaning and identity, they have
moved beyond depression, rage, and fear to gain valuable insights
into how to survive and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   I find that the literary quality is usually outstanding, the
content compelling and affecting. The accompanying letter usually
asks if I can suggest a way to get their work published, but
although such sharing was once an essential part of the
transmission of culture, I have to report that there is almost no
market for this kind of writing now.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of columnists in newspapers and magazines,
but with few exceptions, they write about contemporary events. They
analyze them and have lively and often controversial opinions about
them. On any given day, many write about the same subject _ Bush
vs. Gore, Columbine, or Elian _ helping us make sense of the
information flooding us, giving it context and spin. We give them
the power to tell the rest of us what's important in the external
world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what of the inner world? There's little mention of it in the
media until it reveals itself in acts of dishonesty, violence, or
madness, but in reality every current event reflects a myriad of
inner worlds. The actions of Bush and Gore are a result of
character and private intentions. Our fascination with Columbine
fixes on the motivation of children who kill. Our passionate
convictions about Elian stem from our feelings _ pro or con _ about
the nature of the father-son bond.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these seem vast unknowables. As a culture, we now disdain
``confessional'' writing and distrust the self-serving admissions
of politicians and celebrities. We swim in a glut of secondhand
theories and opinions while starving for trustworthy accounts of
real experience. Women no longer routinely confide in one another
while jointly tending children. Married couples rarely live near
parents to whom they can turn for seasoned advice. Most of us have
few close intergenerational contacts. Consciousness raising has
given way to less intimate book groups. And we're far too busy to
linger on the phone with a friend, go out for a heart-to-heart talk
with a colleague after a meeting, or study the inner workings of
any family but our own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we still long for contact, connection, and communion.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Self-Disclosure: An Experimental Analysis of the
Transparent Self,'' Sidney Jourard states that writers who are
authentically self-revealing enrich other people's ability to live
in the world more fully. ``To learn of another's experiencing is to
broaden and deepen the dimensions of one's own experience,'' he
writes. ``The disclosed experience of the other person enables us
to see things, feel things, imagine things, hope for things that we
could never even have imagined before we were exposed to the
revelations of the discloser. . . . The vicarious experience (of
reading) can shape our essence, change us, just as firsthand
experience can. Experience seems to be as transfusable as blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of our grandparents had the certainties offered by
religion, but we are expected to create our own values. Where can
we find inspiration without voices that speak of the heart? How can
we understand extreme behavior unless we observe how ordinary
people falter under stress and then find the strength to go on? How
can we benefit from what others have learned? Why aren't we
surrounded in our daily life by writers willing to face the
complexity of their lives and thus help us to reflect more deeply
upon our own?
</P>
<P>
   This culture dizzies us with commercials and dazzles us with
entertainment. Somewhere, unacknowledged and unpublished, someone
is recording her own authentic experience, addressing herself to
people who wish to expand their lives by reflecting on the truth of
another's. It takes courage to reveal oneself in the face of
disdain and disparagement; it takes courage to be open to the views
of a person very different from oneself. But there are such writers
and such readers.
</P>
<P>
   I have been privileged to know both.

IN MAINE, CONSTERNATION OVER A PYRAMID SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Maine _ For the hundreds of Mainers who have made
thousands of dollars through what state officials consider a
high-priced pyramid scheme, the clock is ticking good and loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changing Lives'' hit the Lewiston-Auburn area three weeks ago,
promising participants an ``unconditional gift'' of $14,000.
Participants say packets of cash have circulated among many of this
area's prominent residents _ including city officials and police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts say this chronically cashed-strapped region came to
life with the new windfall, with strangers bonding over ``the
game'' and restaurants filling up with newly-rich diners.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Attorney General Andrew Ketterer called an end to
the euphoria, giving players until June 14 to return the money or
risk prosecution. But to his surprise, this time the participants
aren't all listening.
</P>
<P>
   Several participants in Lewiston-Auburn have challenged
Ketterer's grasp of legal matters, arguing that Changing Lives is a
perpetual-motion ``game,'' not a pyramid scheme. They say they
should not have to return winnings, which Ketterer says amount to
$100,000 in some cases. ``If we're just spreading wealth around our
community, I don't see what the problem is,'' said Laurie Appleton,
25, of Auburn, who said she was introduced to Changing Lives by a
friend who is a police officer in a nearby town. ``I'd like to see
anyone tell me that I'm going to be prosecuted for giving gifts to
people. I'm pretty sure that I didn't wake up in Russia this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the streets and storefronts of Auburn and Lewiston,
participants like Appleton were weighing their options, waiting to
see how serious Ketterer's threats would be. Many were scurrying to
collect and return money in exchange for receipts they could show
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the scheme is now too large for authorities to
prosecute everyone. It has moved beyond Maine and has planted deep
roots in other states, including New Hampshire and Massachusetts,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `Look, they're just telling you that
because the government's not getting their share of the action.
They're mad,''' Ketterer said. ``It's bizarre, in that sense. It's
like a fire that you're not able to stomp out.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they could confirm that at least several
hundred Mainers participated in the scheme. Participants
interviewed put the figure much higher, at 2,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   There are internal investigations going on in both the Lewiston
and Auburn police department concerning the possible involvement of
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's experience has been duplicated in other states in recent
weeks, where unusually high-priced and resilient money-making
schemes have reminded authorities of the rise in such activities
during the late 1970s and early '80s. In Florida's Panhandle, it
was a very similar scheme called ``Gifts from the Heart,'' which
reportedly drew dozens of law enforcement officials and resulted in
charges against 19 people, including a former investigator from the
state Attorney General's office. In Texas, an arrangment called
``Women Helping Women'' promised participants as much as $40,000
for an initial pay-in of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   A similar arrangement called ``Women Helping Women'' cropped up
in Maine's Washington County a few months ago, said Brian
MacMaster, chief investigator in Ketterer's office.
</P>
<P>
   In a packet of informational materials that has been distributed
among scores of area businessmen, Changing Lives is billed as a
``simple, natural activity that has changed many lives.'' New
recruits _ known as ``freshmen'' _ ship by overnight mail a $2,000
cash gift to a ``senior'' at the top of a four-level board. After a
senior has received eight gifts, he or she ``graduates'' from the
game with $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Participants are supplied with telephone introduction scripts.
One begins, ``Hi, Joe, (small talk if needed, but very short) I
have something I want to show you.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lewiston-Auburn, money began changing hands so quickly that
Mike Gilbert, a restaurant owner from South Paris, made $40,000 in
seven days. When he began to get dozens of friends and relatives
involved, ``it took off like wildfire'' and his home began to look
``like Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get a copy machine, a fax machine,'' he said. ``I
spent more money at Office Max.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettering says he has shut down many smaller pyramid schemes in
the past without much of a fight. Since he learned of Changing
Lives three weeks ago, Attorney General Ketterer's tactics have
become increasingly aggressive. Within his office, five
investigators are working on tracing the scheme _ more than he has
ever assigned to one investigation except for a police shooting,
Ketterer said. Once the grace period has expired, Ketterer has
promised to punish everyone involved with civil penalties of stiff
fines and restitution orders.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, 28, is among those who are hurrying to comply with the
attorney general's orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nightmare waiting to happen,'' he said. ``It's like
playing musical chairs. You hope the music doesn't stop on you, but
sometimes it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The get-rich-quick schemes seem to be growing again now after a
dip during the early- to mid-1990s, said James Kohm, a lawyer with
the Federal Trade Commission, which oversees those pyramid schemes
that involve products.
</P>
<P>
   People persist in investing in pyramid schemes because they
can't grasp the vast human involvement that would be necessary to
sustain a scheme over the long-term, according to Kohm. In a scheme
with a ``matrix of three'' _ meaning each person involved is
required to recruit three more people _ taking the project to its
18th or 19th level would mean involving every inhabitant of the
United States and Canada, he said. ``Most of us don't realize how
incredibly powerful geometric multiplication is,'' Kohm said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous participants argued that Changing Lives was immune from
those warnings because past participants were likely to re-enroll
as freshmen after they had received their first $16,000. That feeds
more and more money into the system so that it could have gone on
on forever, they said.

   ``People were feeling positive,'' she said. ``It's hard to
explain. People were being good to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the coffee shops and storefronts of Auburn Wednesday,
there were also those whose suspicions had kept them from getting
involved, and they watched the chaos from a philosophical distance.
Harlan Emory, a contractor from Lisbon, said three people had
approached him with offers to get involved in Changing Lives. Three
times, he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the type of deal where if it's too good a deal it can't
be true,'' he said. ``They run a quick bit by me, I said no, and
away I ran.''

THE PARANOIA PAID OFF AT INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. chairman Andrew Grove is a smart man, so he probably
knows the German word ``Schadenfreude'' _ pleasure at the
misfortunes of others. I could have asked him when he visited the
Globe last week, but he would not have appreciated the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cheap thing to gloat,'' Grove said, without a trace of
irony. He knows too well that his company could have been sharing a
cabin on the Titanic with Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, at times, has dominated the microprocessor business
almost as completely as Microsoft controls desktop computer
software. And Grove is just as competitive as his ally and sometime
rival, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   So how has Intel dodged the antitrust bullet that's liable to
blow Microsoft apart? Because Grove knew when to duck. Fifteen
years ago, to be exact. Grove is famous for his quip that ``only
the paranoid survive.'' Last week, he described just how paranoid
he really is.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in 1985 antitrust should have been the least of
Intel's worries. America was Reagan country then and had little use
for antitrust enforcement. His administration, remember, had
abandoned the 11-year-old case against IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Intel in 1985 was on the brink of annihilation. Back
then, much of its revenue came from the production of memory chips,
and the Japanese were cutting Intel's throat with better products
at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   This was the year Grove and his colleagues made the decision
that saved their company: no more memory chips. Intel would bail
out of the business and concentrate on microprocessors, a market in
which the Japanese had never gained a foothold.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the year of the first truly modern Intel processor,
the 386. This chip processed data 32 bits at a time, compared to
the eight- or 16-bit capacities of earlier Intel chips. That made
the 386 the first Intel chip powerful enough for multitasking, or
running multiple programs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It took another five years for Microsoft Corp. to deliver a
decent version of Windows software capable of using the power of
the 386. But Grove says that even in 1985, Intel expected the 386
and its descendants to dominate the market. And even then, a
staggering, bloodied Intel began to plan for the day it would
become a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we decided was, we've got to play this very carefully,''
Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   The company started hiring antitrust experts to master the
relevant laws. It wasn't just a matter of beefing up the legal
department. Intel's executives and sales people were also taught
the new rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Intel went so far as to hire attorneys to browbeat employees.
``People knew what cross-examination was like,'' said Grove. ``We
brought in outside lawyers to take mock depositions.'' They weren't
gentle about it, either. The sessions left many an Intel exec
sweaty and terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsofties are a pretty paranoid lot, as well, but they mainly
learned to fear Bill Gates, a man who has displayed a John
Gotti-like contempt for the federal government. Grove, a refugee
from communist Hungary, would never make such a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Federal Trade Commission launched an antitrust
investigation of Intel a couple of years ago, the company didn't
rant or rail or vow to fight to the last ditch. Instead, it
settled. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of spending his days huddled with corporate
attorneys, Grove can focus on securing Intel's future.
</P>
<P>
   The company has made an $800 million commitment to Massachusetts
at its chip factory in Hudson. Furious demand for Pentium chips has
led to shortages; by this time next year, Hudson should be banging
them out, along with its present output of networking chips and
StrongARM processors for hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   There are already 1,800 Intel workers in the state, with another
1,000 hires likely in the next year or so. There's also the launch
later this year of Itanium, Intel's biggest processor upgrade since
the first generation of Pentiums.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Intel must figure out how to do business in a
world with multiple Microsofts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a split-up,'' said Grove, ``it's fair to say that
we'd have a much more complex relationship.'' Maybe so. But Grove
probably started planning for it 15 years ago.

NEARING PERFECTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 4 stars 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless your travels regularly take you to Gold's Gym in West
Hollywood, you won't see more high-grade beefcake on display
anywhere in Los Angeles these days than in ``Billy Budd,'' Benjamin
Britten's brawny musical treatise on divine authority versus human
expediency.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you're planning a trip to the sweet hereafter, you'll
be hard-pressed to witness a more perfect presentation than the one
currently docked at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Not that director Francesca Zambello's production is simply a
triumph of muscle over mind. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching these shores via London and Geneva, this production
reminds us what exuberant power opera has when exactly the right
singers, musicians, sets, lights and costumes converge at the right
time, in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Fortifying her rep as a rising visionary, Zambello and company
achieve a remarkable synthesis of naturalism and abstraction,
clarity and ambiguity, the bulky imperatives of narrative form with
the ethereal majesty and streamlined gravity of Britten's score and
E.M. Forster and Eric Crozier's sinewy libretto.
</P>
<P>
   That's not even mentioning the magnificent central triad of
singers aboard the British warship Indomitable: bass Jeffrey Wells,
a touch stiff but otherwise excellent; baritone Rodney Gilfry, the
closest most of us probably will see to a definitive Billy Budd,
and, in his Los Angeles Opera debut, the superb tenor Robert Tear,
a model of anguished vocal integrity as the spiritually tortured
Captain Vere.
</P>
<P>
   Together, and supported by an all-male ensemble that's solid
from stem to stern, they maintain an exquisite equilibrium among
Britten's warring chords. Conductor Roderick Brydon martials the
gently billowing strings, shimmering woodwinds and awesome
batteries of blazing horns with great authority and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the darkly mystical Herman Melville novella that inspired
it, Britten's opera tracks a wavering course between good and evil.
``Billy Budd'' is a moral as well as musical odyssey that carries
us through the blue mists enshrouding the envious, scheming
Master-at-Arms John Claggart (Wells), then launches us into the
pure, major-key light that crowns Claggart's prey, the innocent
sailor Billy Budd (Gilfry).
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, Gilfry has publicly pondered hanging up his signature
role for good. When that day comes, please break the news to me
gently. Watch how Gilfry's stoic Billy plumbs the paradoxical joy
in his death-row aria, neither Christlike abstraction nor naive
man-boy. Listen how gracefully he bends the notes while bidding
farewell to the ship, the Rights o' Man. No wonder Wells' Claggart
is clearly ga-ga over him.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder, too, at Alison Chitty's split-level, hydraulically
powered set, which mirrors the upstairs/downstairs divide between
officers and men and reinforces the brutal claustrophobia of ocean
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Budd,'' which one critic described as Melville's ``final
testament of acceptance,'' is a swan song for Peter Hemmings, L.A.
Opera's retiring founding general director, who has been working to
bring this production here for years. Hemmings is England-bound
next month. The rest of us may rejoice that his ship has come in. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
- What: ``Billy Budd.'' &QL; 
- Where: Los Angeles Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,
Performing Arts Center of Los Angeles County, 135 N. Grand Ave.,
downtown. &QL; 
- When: 7:30 p.m. today and June 11 and 14; 2 p.m. June 17. &QL;

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Snap on your Speedos. Get ready to surf!
</P>
<P>
   The online travel industry welcomes you with an ocean of summer
perks that include bargains on last-minute travel, discounts on
family vacations, and free flight information sent to your
hand-held Palm computers.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Although most Web travel sites have made advances,
they have a long way to go. Many still aren't delivering on
promises to provide the fastest service, lowest prices, and best
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The worst performers were the big hotel chains and car rental
firms. If you're in a rush, consider bypassing them. Try booking
rooms and cars through online travel agencies like Travelocity.com
and Expedia.com _ two comprehensive sites that allow customers to
compare prices on large numbers of hotels and car-rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   Travel shoppers will find abundant bargains as travel sites
fight for dominance. Last month, customers of Expedia.com could buy
a US Airways ticket and get 50 percent off their next ticket with
the same airline. Budget.com has been promoting a $19.99-a-day rate
on a Ford Ranger pick-up truck.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunters also should check out Hoteldiscounts.com, which
promises the lowest prices. Extra enticements at this site include
last-minute bargains on hotel rooms, such as the Doubletree in
Orlando, Fla., for $70 a night.
</P>
<P>
   For new online travel shoppers, Expedia.com is a good starting
place. Its site has dedicated areas for family, cruise, and
adventure vacations. It also offers multiple tools for finding the
lowest air fares. It matches airlines' lowest rates and e-mails
alerts on air fare deals. Like Priceline.com, Expedia.com allows
customers to name their own fare and see if an airline will match
it.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently Expedia.com had offered weaker tools for hotel
shopping, but the company recently revamped its lodging section.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Expedia.com's chief competitor _ Travelocity.com _ may be
a better bet for some shoppers looking for lodging. Travelocity.com
offers reviews from travelers as well as message boards where
tourists can rant and rave.
</P>
<P>
   For seaside cottages and other off-the-beaten track lodgings,
try clicking on Placestostay.com or bedandbreakfast.com. Here's a
friendly warning: Do your homework. Placestostay.com offers
customers reviews, but we were suspicious after finding only raves.
</P>
<P>
   After perusing the Web sites of chain hotels, we decided not to
rate them. It was too hard to find summer vacancies, and virtual
travel sites did a better job of steering customers to available
hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In your online travels, do not anticipate the same customer
service you received during the Internet holiday shopping season.
Expect much worse. In cyberspace, the travel industry is about two
years behind online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., eToys Inc.,
and Jcrew.com.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile rental sites, for instance, are making the buying
process long and painful. At Budget's site, several attempts to
place an order resulted in errors. When we called the company's
toll-free number for help, a customer service representative blamed
the problems on us.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites want your money, but they don't necessarily want to
hear from you. Only a handful of travel sites bothered to respond
to e-mail messages. Toll-free telephone numbers were often hidden
inside Web pages and, in some cases, were not listed.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few bright spots. Hertz was the only automobile
rental center to respond intelligently to an e-mailed request for
information, and United Airlines the only airline to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Customer representatives at Hoteldiscounts.com and
Vacationspot.com took extra time to type out personalized
responses. Expedia.com responded in a day but told us to call an
airline for information about a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Finding help at Travelocity.com, however, took some time because
the site's e-mail customer service box was buried at the bottom of
a Web page. Somehow, we managed to click on a promotion to Radisson
and ended up with the hotel's customer service staff.
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines, as well as online travel agency Uniglobe.com,
responded with preformulated e-mail responses _ a tactic used to
save labor costs. These canned answers don't count, especially when
they have nothing to do with the questions.
</P>
<P>
   One site, Budget, yanked an e-mail box from its Web pages
because too many people sent messages. The company made the
decision after its customer service people got swamped with
requests for information, a Budget spokeswoman explained.
</P>
<P>
   On the other extreme is Travelocity.com, which demands that
customers send e-mail rather than pick up the phone. The site
intentionally did not list a toll-free number because it doesn't
want calls from the masses (yes, that includes you). It considers
its phone number to be a customer perquisite, not a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, we make it more available to people who
make bookings,'' said Terry Jones, chief executive of
Travelocity.com.
</P>
<P>
   What you find off-line is often what you'll get online. We
called US Airways to ask whether a meal was served on a flight, and
a representative didn't know the answer. When we asked again, she
huffed, ``I'll have to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Travelocity.com takes the prize for the longest hold
times. Hoteldiscounts.com had the most complex voice-mail system.
``Press 1 if you blah blah, Press 2 if you want to do this . . .
Hey, we're sending you back to the beginning again! Press 1 if you
blah blah.''
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Press as many buttons as you can.

PLAN TO ABUSE THE PC? THINK `RUGGEDIZED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer's approaching, and the time is right to head for the
hills. And for some people that means the most distant hills they
can think of. These adventurous types go mountaineering in the
Canadian Rockies or ride a train across Siberia, in their quest to
get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are still phone messages to be checked and e-mail
to be read. And why shouldn't a fellow be able to do that sort of
thing when he's halfway across the Atlantic in a sailboat, or
halfway up Mount Kilimanjaro?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he can. Some hard-core adventurers carry computers that
are even tougher than they are, and communications gear that puts
them within reach of any phone on earth, no matter where on earth
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping in touch is the most important thing, and the most
difficult. Cell phones are handy and relatively cheap. Too bad they
tend not to work in the planet's more remote locations.
</P>
<P>
   This problem was to have been solved by Iridium, a global
telephone system bound together by a network of 66 low-orbiting
space satellites. Anyone armed with a heavy, clunky Iridium phone
could make phone calls from virtually anywhere on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Just the thing for ``the Rambo of the seas.'' That's what they
call French explorer Philippe Monnet. He has sailed around the
world alone, and he holds the speed records for sailing alone from
New York to San Francisco and from Hong Kong to London. Monnet's
not bad on land, either; he won the notorious Paris-to-Dakar
automobile race and the Paris-to-Cape Town rally, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Monnet took along an Iridium phone when he set sail from France
in January for another round-the-world voyage. The phone worked
well enough to deliver some awful news. ``When I was in the South
Pacific,'' Monnet says, ``Iridium called me to tell me Iridium had
failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium consortium had gone broke _ there just weren't
enough world explorers out there to make a go of the business. The
company phoned Monnet to tell him that his phone would soon be good
for nothing but ballast.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Rambo brought along backup. Along with the Iridium
handset, he carried a laptop-size device that lets him use an
entirely different satellite telephone system called Inmarsat.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1979, Inmarsat is accessible from about 98 percent of
the planet's surface, petering out only when you're near the poles.
Monnet was out of touch for a while as he sailed past Antarctica,
but once he headed north, the intrepid explorer was back on the
air, happily accepting phone calls from nosy Boston journalists.
</P>
<P>
   An Inmarsat phone isn't cheap. The least powerful laptop-size
version costs $2,500; a suitcase-size heavy-duty model, capable of
transmitting digital data at 64,000 bits per second, costs $10,000.
But then, data transmission is Inmarsat's chief business. Its
leading customers are corporations that need to relay data from
remote locations. That includes audio and video files. Many foreign
television correspondents digitally compress their videotapes and
beam them to the news desk over an Inmarsat phone at $7 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, TV networks can afford it. And they can also afford
to provide another vital tool _ a portable computer for digitizing
and compressing video data. Indeed, in our Internet-happy world, a
computer is vital for any world traveler who wants to stay in
touch. But you don't want just any laptop.
</P>
<P>
   When the nearest repair shop is hundreds of miles away, you had
better pack something that will keep working, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   One popular choice is the Panasonic Toughbook, a line of
``ruggedized'' portable computers designed to take severe abuse.
Instead of plastic, a Toughbook's case is made out of magnesium
alloy, and most of them have keyboards and data ports that are
shielded against dust and moisture. An ultralight version costs
about $3,500; a hefty briefcase-size version goes for about $5,700.
</P>
<P>
   John Harris, vice president of marketing for Panasonic Personal
Computer Co., says his company doesn't go out of its way to market
Toughbooks to adventurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary business is a business-to-business model,'' Harris
says. ``We do almost no consumer or one-to-one sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most Toughbooks are used by road warriors, traveling
techs who need a machine that takes a pounding. They're also
popular with police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one that actually took a bullet,'' Harris says. ``Half
the LCD (display screen) still worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, adventurous folk have heard of the Toughbook and seek
them out. When Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International mounted
an expedition to Mount Everest this year, it took along a
Toughbook, as well as an Inmarsat telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But Toughbook gets some tough competition in the hard-core
computing market, from a Fremont, Calif., company that most people
have never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   If you're familiar with Dolch Computer Systems Inc., you've
probably spent too much time flying the Space Shuttle, or driving
an armored personnel carrier, or exploring for oil in Siberia.
Those are the the sorts of environments in which Dolch products are
common. Or maybe you've been to a computer trade show and seen a
Dolch computer on display inside a sealed plastic box. The computer
sits there hour after hour, under a constant spray of water. With
its sealed data ports and monitor, and its rubber keyboard, a Dolch
computer just doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our notebooks have been on a dog sled mission to the North
Pole, where they used a solar cell to recharge the battery. We've
had several mountain-climbing expeditions,'' says Bob Pruitt,
Dolch's Northeast territory manager. But as with the Toughbooks,
most customers just want a super-reliable machine for use in
hostile conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people in the stone quarries in Vermont that use them
to control the crushing and grinding equipment,'' says Pruitt. ``We
put them on aircraft carriers. We put them in submarines.''
</P>
<P>
   For $5,000, you can get a Dolch NotePAC. That's pretty expensive
for a machine with an outdated Intel Pentium II processor and a
mere 64 megabytes of memory. On the other hand, you'll get a
machine sheathed in sexy-looking magnesium, a computer that will
run in a rainstorm and won't notice if you drop it three feet onto
a stone floor.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, it will survive your summer vacation.

MICROSOFT'S WOES GO BEYOND LEGAL TRAVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a Microsoft Corp. shareholder to do now?
</P>
<P>
   That is no casual question in this town, where practically every
diversified money manager owns at least a small piece of the
Microsoft action. Boston's most interested party of all: Fidelity
Magellan manager Bob Stansky and his 42 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from Stansky to the man on the street with just a few
shares in his portfolio will tell you this has been a nasty year.
Microsoft stock is down 39 percent so far in 2000 and the future
is, well, cloudy. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling Wednesday
was entirely expected bad news, but negative nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to blame all of Microsoft's stock weakness this year
and uncertain outlook on the company's travails in court. It would
also be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the government's case against Microsoft has depressed the
stock and has serious implications for the management of the
company's buisness. But even bigger corporate challenges are taking
a toll away from the headlines, and these issues, perhaps as much
as the antitrust case, will likely determine how the stock moves in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue is sheer corporate physics. On Microsoft's
gigantic scale, it is already difficult and eventually will become
impossible to maintain hyper percentage growth rates that commanded
lofty stock price-earnings ratios. While attention was focused on
court in the spring, Microsoft said it was falling short of sales
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``While people weren't watching, the growth was slowing on the
top (revenue) and bottom (profit) lines,'' said Brian Grove, a
technology portfolio manager at Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &AMP;
McCullough, an Nvest LP investment firm. ``Ultimatley that's going
to have more impact on the stock than the court will.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growth rate in the high teens or 20 percent is still doable
but, at least before the stock imploded, the market was (expecting)
30 and 40 percent growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the unstoppable evolution of technology which,
history proves, is extremely difficult to manage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Microsoft was valued as a virtual monopoly by
Wall Street. But as electronic communications moves further away
from the computer desktop, where Microsoft does enjoy the spoils of
monopoly, the competitive action gets fierce and less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward wireless communications to access the Internet
has created a hotbed of new competition that cedes nothing to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Microsoft today is how they get anywhere
near the footprint they have on the PC in the wireless world,''
said Grove.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet traffic grows, computer servers become an important
growth area where Microsoft is a leader but only in a tight and
crowded race. Throw in new Internet applications services and
software, where Microsoft is turning in mixed results, and you've
got a much more competitive world to manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's success and its ability to remain a dominant
company over the next three years is more dependant on its ability
to execute in all these new areas,'' said Tony Ursillo, a software
analyst at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in Boston. ``It's less dependant on
what structure the company takes and what sort of constraints may
be put on its conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't start a collection for Bill Gates just yet.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Microsoft's operating system business may not
generate whopping percentage growth but its still one of the
world's biggest cash machines running 95 percent of all personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the company's best weapons: Microsoft worked hard to
hire the smartest people available long after it had buried the
competition and could be justified in coasting a bit. In short,
Microsoft has brains to burn and its not just sitting around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a big head start because they have a lot of smart
people, a lot of money and a great understanding of technology,''
said Ursillo.
</P>
<P>
   We know Microsoft will fight for every market from the set-top
TV box, to the wireless Internet connection, to Web browers. It may
find a new way to thrive, or slide to mere mortal stature.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all attention is focused on the Appeals Court, as
Microsoft begins the legal battle to overturn Jackson's order to
break up the company. But the future for Microsoft and its
shareholders won't be decided in a court alone.

A SOFTWARE GIANT IN A TECHNOLOGICAL LIMBO

<P>
   For an attorney whose client had just received the corporate
equivalent of the death penalty, Bill Neukom sounded remarkably
upbeat Wednesday. Microsoft Corp.'s executive vice president for
law and corporate affairs left the impression that he can hardly
wait to get in front of an appeals court and start shredding the
antitrust judgment against his company.
</P>
<P>
   Newsanalysis
</P>
<P>
   ``Today begins a new chapter in this case,'' said Neukom. ``It
is a chapter Microsoft looks forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals process certainly can't get any worse for Microsoft.
In a terse ruling laced with hostility, federal Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ordered that the company be carved into two
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom responded in kind, describing the proceedings in
Jackson's courtroom as ``flawed from the beginning,'' and declaring
that the court's findings of fact were riddled with errors and
contradictions. Neukom added that Jackson ``misapplied the
pertinent law'' when he decided that Microsoft violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act. In all, Neukom sounded like a man certain of
ultimate victory.
</P>
<P>
   But as the case wends its way through the appeals courts,
Microsoft finds itself in legal and technological limbo. Many
customers will remain loyal, if only because switching to other
products is so costly and difficult. But the lingering threat of
corporate demolition could undermine Microsoft's plans for a new
generation of Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft does have some cards to play in the appeals process.
If the normal procedures are followed, the case goes next to the US
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court has
already held that Microsoft was legally entitled to add its
Internet Explorer browser to the Windows operating system. That
ruling directly contradicts one of Jackson's key findings, and if
the appeals court reaffirms it, much of the government's
anti-Microsoft case collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, while the threat of a breakup has hammered Microsoft's
stock price in recent months, it's done no harm to the company's
sales, which hit $5.65 billion last quarter, up a billion from the
same period last year. Industry-watchers don't see any short-term
moves to abandon the company, as there are few inexpensive
alternatives to Microsoft products, and most consumers don't seem
interested in seeking them out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this is what the US Justice Department had in mind
when it requested that Microsoft be divided into a company that
makes the Windows operating system and another firm that handles
all other Microsoft activities. Buyers of Windows will still be
able to obtain the same operating system software available now;
the same applies to buyers of Microsoft's office software suite.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators hope that this kind of breakup will
minimize any disruption that a split might cause consumers. But it
also makes it easier for Microsoft to hold onto those customers
through the appeals process. And even if the breakup does take
place, many suspect that consumers would just keep buying their
favorite Microsoft products from the separate companies and give
little support to any new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ePresence Inc. of Westborough, Mass. has a worldwide partnership
with Microsoft to deploy the company's software in corporate
networks. Scott Silk, senior vice president of marketing and
business development at ePresence, says his firm's clients aren't
holding off on Windows deployments for fear of a Microsoft breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the customers I've spoken to it's almost been more of a
human interest story than a business story,'' said Silk. ``The
customers haven't been saying, `We'd better re-evaluate our whole
strategy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And what if Microsoft is split into two parts? ``They're both
very strong businesses,'' said Silk, ``and Microsoft has a dominant
position in both of those businesses.'' So corporate buyers would
just stick with software from the two Microsofts.
</P>
<P>
   To Jonathan Zuck, the world looks very different. Zuck leads the
Association for Competitive Technology, which represents small- to
medium-sized companies that write software for businesses that use
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Zuck says, members of his organization report that
customers are hesitating to place new orders, because of
uncertainty over Microsoft's future. ``There's a panic in the
industry surrounding this,'' said Zuck, who says 700 software
developers have joined his group in the past week to express their
opposition to a Microsoft breakup.
</P>
<P>
   But a loss of influence for Microsoft doesn't fill Ken Wasch
with panic. ``Consumers win,'' said Wasch, president of the
Software and Information Industry Association, a group that
supports the government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Wasch believes his members and other companies will respond to a
Microsoft breakup with a torrent of innovative new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dead zone of major software applications is about to show
some life,'' said Wasch. ``Suddenly, in word processors,
spreadsheets, databases, presentation graphics, there will be
competition in them, and that can only be good for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, said Dan Kusnetzky, a software-industry analyst with
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are driven by the applications they know how to
use, the applications their company is using, the applications
their friends are using,'' said Kusnetzky. ``The people who want to
continue to use software that's compatible with what other people
are using will keep buying Microsoft Office products.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusnetzky doubts that corporate software buying patterns will
shift radically, even if the Microsoft breakup finally goes
through. ``Will people go out tomorrow and buy Corel Office?'' he
wondered. ``I'm not sure if people even know what Corel Office
is.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Microsoft's existing customer base does remain
loyal, the case poses a serious threat to its future prospects.
Microsoft has already had to postpone the announcement of its
vaunted Next-Generation Windows Services. This project is designed
to create new versions of Windows software that work seamlessly
with the Internet and hand-held computers. It's a classic example
of Microsoft's favorite tactic _ the blending of more and more
functions into its operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the breakup order, the court set limits on the
company's ability to integrate new features into its products.
Microsoft's future may depend on Neukom's success in overturning
the entire judgment against Microsoft _ not just the breakup order.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cell phones and autos
 &HT;    For release June 11, 2000.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One of those sport utility vehicles the size of Montana
was lugging in on me from the center lane. As I looked up, way up,
I noted that the driver, cigarette dangling from her lips, was
otherwise occupied talking on her cellular phone. I sounded my horn
to gain her attention, thus saving me from extensive auto repairs
and, likely, a visit to the emergency room _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   I now know what I fear most: not the giant urban chariots
themselves but people in them (and other vehicles) who talk on cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a high school honors student who was skating on a
bicycle path near my home was struck and killed by a car that
veered off the road and came onto the parallel path. Reports say
the driver either was talking on her cell phone or had dropped it
and was leaning to pick it up. Either way, she was distracted from
her driving, lost control and someone died.
</P>
<P>
   The case against using cell phones while operating a vehicle has
been building for some time. Already, laws have been passed in
several states to deal with it. Now, such a movement is under way
in Florida; a direct result of the death of the young lady.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who maintain that hands-free cell phones will
remedy the problem, and there are those who insist that it will
not, that the real problem is the distraction of talking; of being
attentive to something other than your driving.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, I came upon an old newspaper clipping the other
day that would tend to agree with those who say it is the act of
talking on the phone, more than holding it, that poses the greatest
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1956, there was a story in the Miami Herald that a local
auto insurance agent would not write policies for people who had
radios in their cars. He referred to accidents with which he was
familiar that ``were the direct result of drivers' attention being
distracted because they were listening to ball games instead of
concentrating on driving safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Was the agent overreacting? Probably. An All-State sales
manager, interviewed in the same article, said there was ``no
evidence that the driver of a car which carries a radio is either
worse or better than the driver of an automobile not so equipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, I can recall quite a few times when I was listening to the
auto radio _ ball game, talk show, news _ and lost my concentration
on the road. In fact, even today, when one of those heavy South
Florida cloudbursts strike while I'm driving, I turn off my radio
because I feel it is interfering with my ability to concentrate on
that sheet of water running down my windshield, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Does this relate to cell phones? Yes it does. I have had an
automobile with a hands-free phone and ones that require
hand-helds. In either situation, I sometimes found myself
concentrating too much on what was being said, either by me or the
other party, and needed to take quick action to correct my driving.
</P>
<P>
   Distraction is a major danger to auto safety. It is not limited
to cell phones or radios and that's why selective bans may not be
the cure-all. There are also many out there who believe roadside
billboards can distract a driver from his or her attention to the
highway. Others, like me, believe they are a welcome break during
an otherwise monotonous, sleep-inducing long haul on a turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, cellular telephones have been under attack.
There's the brain tumor thing, and the driving safety factor, both
persistent arguments _ whether documented or not.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many cellular calls made from or to automobiles are
necessary and how many are just social, passing the time of day
while driving along; the latter to which I often would plead
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   A cellular phone is a valuable instrument to have if your car
breaks down, if you are in an accident or if you become lost.
However, all three stated necessities can be handled by the
roadside, while the vehicle is not in motion.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the cell phone antagonists are contending, and the
death of that lovely girl on the bike path is just the sort of
tragedy that could lead to more legislative bodies passing
prohibitive laws about in-motion calls.

&HT;     ACTRESS LENDS DEPTH, INTELLIGENCE TO `GROOVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAIG MARINE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Writer and director Greg Harrison makes an
ambitious stab at exploring San Francisco's rave subculture in his
new film, ``Groove.'' Yet most moviegoers will walk away from the
film remembering actress Lola Glaudini.
</P>
<P>
   Either Harrison saved all of his best lines for Glaudini's
character, ``Leyla'' (a transplanted New Yorker whose dreams of
continuing her education seem to have once again dissolved into the
nightlife) or Glaudini is the one actor in the film capable of
lending her character any real depth.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that most of Harrison's script barely takes his
characters below surface level, let's go with the second option:
Glaudini is easily the most skilled performer in the movie,
although naturally, she wouldn't dare say so herself.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a vacant bar in the lobby of the Nikko Hotel, it's
fairly easy to tell that while Glaudini has been earning a living
for years as an actress, this is clearly her first starring role.
For one thing, she listens to questions. For another, she answers
with refreshing honesty. What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable thing about Glaudini in ``Groove'' is that
she is not only strikingly beautiful, but there is an intelligence
in her eyes that makes her character seem brighter and wiser than
the other denizens of the night. In fact, this trait has actually
cost the 28-year-old actress some work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call yourself intelligent without sounding totally
pompous,'' Glaudini says with an easy chuckle, her New York
background evident in her voice. ``But I have tried out for roles
and had people say `That girl is just too smart.' Most of the time,
it turns out they just wanted nothing more than a breathing prop,
some girl to stand there and hold the arm of a guy. I like to try
to bring a little bit more to my roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini made such an impression during two smaller parts on
``NYPD Blue'' that producer Steven Bochco created the role of
administrative assistant Dolores Mayo just for her. She just
finished making another movie, ``Blow,'' with Johnny Depp. So far,
she has been able to hang onto a certain amount of creative control
over the types of women she portrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough people out there who can play the vapid and
ditzy parts,'' she says. ``I've been lucky enough with the people
I've worked with that they allow me to have some kind of real input
into how my character might move, or the things she would or
wouldn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Glaudini mentions a scene in ``Groove'' where
Leyla is being complimented by David (Hamish Linklater), her
overeducated alter ego who is at his first rave and on his first
Ecstasy trip to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scene in the bathroom, he calls Leyla beautiful, and
she looks at him and tells him `You're high.' That way, she can be
a bit dismissive of him, but still accept his compliment,''
Glaudini explains. ``It wouldn't be realistic if she tried to deny
it somehow. Her beauty is one of the few things she can be
confident about without being arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may be self-conscious about her lack of formal education,
but she knows she's attractive,'' she concludes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini grew up around the stage, the daughter of playwright
Robert Glaudini. She began her acting career as a child in the
Padua Hills Playwrights Festival, with Ed Harris and Sam Shepard
among its members. It's a craft she takes seriously, to the point
of creating her own private histories for the people she portrays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the `I was born in the hills of Mississippi'
type of thing,'' she laughs. ``But I try to imagine them as
three-dimensional, with a past that has shaped them, something that
will explain why they may do what they do. I find it helps me bring
the characters alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her formal training as a ballerina has also helped Glaudini, who
says that one of the things she thinks about most in a character is
``physicality, the way they would move, or hold a glass, even.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps her explain how she is able to convey some of the
complexities of her ``Groove'' character, appearing both powerful
and vulnerable alternately.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would walk through a room as Leyla, I would make myself
larger, kind of `peacock' myself,'' she explains. ``But in the
moments when she is with David, and she is more embarrassed by her
incomplete education, I would turn my shoulders in, make myself
more concave. It's something I think about a lot, actually. It's
amazing how much you can say without saying a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaudini says she will continue to choose her roles carefully
for as long as she can, though working in independent films like
``Groove'' does have certain drawbacks. ``I figured out that when
it was all said and done, I made about four dollars a day,'' she
says, laughing and shaking her head. ``I'm going to have to do a
little better than that.''

&HT;     THE BEST WORKERS WILL ACT LIKE OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All it takes sometimes is a trip to the airport
to remind you that one employee can make a huge difference, and
that a smart company knows how to make that employee look good.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with a little everyday horror, the kind that would
make Stephen King yawn. It's not an absolute terror, but one of
nature's gentle reminders that even vacations are never flawless.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Cathy, and I had called the previous night to arrange
for a taxi to pick us up at 9:30 a.m. for the trip to San Francisco
International Airport. When it was 9:35 and no cab had shown up, we
called the taxi company to make sure the morning crew had gotten
the message. Just a few minutes, the dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, still no cab. I called the dispatcher
again. The driver's already made the pickup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   When I gently pointed out that the ones being picked up had not
been, uh, picked up, he checked further. It turns out the driver
had picked up someone else from a different address on my street;
he hadn't bothered to make sure he had the right people.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher promised another cab right away. Five minutes
later, with nothing in sight, we asked a friend to bail us out. As
she was about to do it, the cab finally appeared.
</P>
<P>
   We still had enough time to make the flight, as long as our
airline behaved reasonably, which sometimes can be an unreasonable
expectation. In this case, though, the airline didn't behave
reasonably; it behaved spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   We checked our luggage at the curb, where there was virtually no
line. But, of course, there still might be a line when we checked
ourselves in at the gate, as we've always had to do with other
airlines. The threat of more stress awaited us.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing: This airline, unlike others we've flown,
allows a complete curb-side check-in. The skycap took care of the
luggage, asked us the usual questions and gave us boarding passes.
The whole thing took two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, we were early.
</P>
<P>
   Pop quiz: Which of the two companies will get our repeat
business, and which one has lost us as customers for life? Do you
think we'll tell our friends about both companies?
</P>
<P>
   The best employees think like owners, the best owners think like
employees, and the best companies think like customers. The airline
understood that; the taxi company didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi company is in a competitive business, one that makes it
easy for customers to switch to a competitor if there are problems.
The errant taxi driver made a dumb mistake by going to the wrong
address, but we all make dumb mistakes from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   If the dispatcher had thought like an owner, though, he would
have tried to make things right. Being half an hour late for a
time-sensitive appointment is a lousy way to do business. He could
have told the second driver not to charge us for the ride, or sent
a gift certificate or letter of apology, but he did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Smart restaurant workers know how to make saves, such as giving
customers a free glass of wine when a reserved table isn't ready at
the time promised. That glass of wine is a small gesture, but it
can make the difference between appearing sensitive or appearing
callous, and between keeping or losing customers.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider yourself a good employee and you see that your
company is about to lose a customer, do whatever you can to fix it,
even if it's not technically your job. If your corporate culture
frowns upon that, think seriously about whether you're working for
the right company.
</P>
<P>
   Also look at whether the company does whatever it can to make
things easier for everyone involved. By allowing people to check in
completely at the curb, the airline cut down on the redundancy for
both employees and customers. It's a simple, stress-reducing step,
but a lot of airlines don't take it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what industry you are in, if your company doesn't seem
to be in the hurdle-removing business, your career may be in for a
bumpy ride.

DIPLOMACY AND POLITICS AT MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR FORMER PRIME
MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was
remembered Thursday in a solemn state service marked by effusive
eulogies, cannonades, a parading honor guard in crisp white
uniforms and thousands of mourners in dark suits, including
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The service for Obuchi, who died on May 14, six weeks after
suffering a massive stroke, began under a hot and brilliant sky
with a long, slow procession into a large hall. The service was
held by Obuchi's widow, Chizuko, and his 28-year-old son, Takeshi,
who bore a white box containing his father's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the solemnity of the occasion, what took place
offstage, before and after the ceremony, was a burst of political
activity and diplomacy of great significance for Japan's immediate
future and for the future of East Asia, which often seemed to
eclipse the memorial event.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Japan's imperial family and dignitaries from 170
countries gathered for the occasion in the hall, where a huge
portrait of the late prime minister hung against an illuminated,
powder blue background. Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori,
remembered his friend and political ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am anguished to think how deeply disappointed Mr. Obuchi
must have been to have had to retire from the arena of action,
felled by an unforeseen illness,'' Mori told the other mourners.
``In this moment of bereavement, I can do no more than express my
heartfelt gratitude to former Prime Minister Obuchi for dedicating
his all to this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mori also had a setting in which he could finally enjoy the
statesman's attributes of his office.
</P>
<P>
   And with critical national elections scheduled for June 25, his
power huddles with Clinton, the South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and other senior leaders from China and Russia provided a welcome
relief from the cycle of provocative blunders and tortured, partial
retractions that have cut deeply into Mori's popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for a boost from the events surrounding the memorial
service, Mori's aides have made much of the bilateral meetings with
Clinton; Kim; the leaders of Australia, Indonesia and Thailand; and
high-ranking officials from many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Japanese leader and his foreign minister, Yohei
Kono, held bilateral talks with 33 countries over the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following meetings with Mori and Kim, aides to Clinton praised
the South Korean government for taking the initiative in engaging
its northern neighbor, and hinted strongly at a relaxation of U.S.
economic sanctions against North Korea, many of which have been in
place since the Korean War, which ended in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a process in place to work through issues related to
that, and I would expect we would have an announcement on that very
soon,'' said a White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean leader is due to travel to the North Korean
capital, Pyongyang, on Monday, for the first-ever summit meeting
between leaders of those two countries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kim told Mori that he would urge his North Korean counterpart to
improve relations with Japan. North Korea fired a ballistic missile
over Japan without warning in 1998, shocking the Japanese and
causing a break in relations with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had often expressed frustration with
Obuchi and his government over the slow pace of reform to lift
Japan out of its decade-long economic slump. In death, however, the
soft-spoken, consensus-minded Obuchi was praised by Clinton, who
said that history would regard him as someone who ``rose to the
challenge with courage and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Clinton's decision to attend
Thursday's service, flying 26 hours for an eight-hour-stay, and his
strong praise for Obuchi should be seen in the context of the
``unusually strong alliance'' that links the two countries, and
Japan's steady support for the priorities of U.S. foreign policy
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Coming little more than three weeks after Obuchi's cremation,
the date of Thursday's memorial service was itself mired in
politics. The Japanese media widely reported that the service was
held as close as decently possible to the upcoming elections in
order to guarantee a large ``sympathy vote'' and give maximal lift
at the polls to the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the date was announced, a string of unusually blunt
nationalist statements by Mori, whose recent description of Japan
as a ``divine country with an emperor at its center'' was strongly
evocative of this country's imperialist prewar propaganda, has
caused support for the government to evaporate in the polls. The
election now stands to become a referendum on Mori rather than a
commemoration of Obuchi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political analysts in Tokyo have described the stakes in the
election as extremely high. If the Liberal Democratic Party loses a
significant number of parliamentary seats, Mori would likely be
forced to resign. An even worse debacle for his party, as a 12
percent popularity rating in one recent newspaper poll suggests,
could force the Liberal Democratic Party from power for only the
second time since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's tenure in office has been unusually troubled from the
start. Opposition political leaders and editorial writers have
poked holes into the sometimes contradictory official explanations
of how power was secretively passed from Obuchi following his
sudden hospitalization on April 2 to a brief caretaker prime
minister and finally to Mori.
</P>
<P>
   An account by Obuchi's widow of her husband's last hours of
consciousness was published Thursday in a popular magazine.
Obuchi's claim that her husband spoke to her long after his stroke
_ contrary to doctors' reports _ bolstered the position of Mikio
Aoki, who had been the caretaker leader and said that he had been
asked to exercise power by the dying leader.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Tokyo Thursday, the kind words often
spoken about Obuchi rarely reflected on Mori, whom voters seemed to
regard with all the suspicion suggested by his historically low
ratings in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about Obuchi's political abilities, but he seemed
to have a nice personality,'' said Hiroshi Ogawa, a 60-year-old man
who was in the Toronomon section of central Tokyo. ``Mori, though,
is just out of the question. I've never heard of a prime minister
who has made such a bad impression.''

&HT;     END MAY BE NEAR FOR NINERS QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Steve Young's fateful Friday deadline to
bring to a close his protracted career decision may slop over to
Monday with the expected announcement that he plans to retire from
football.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the San Francisco 49ers say the 38-year-old
quarterback and expectant father wants time to gather ``his
people'' together for his retirement announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci on Wednesday offered what might have been a
clue as to what Young, the 49ers quarterback and a 14-year veteran
of the team, is thinking as he comes to the most important decision
of his athletic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to start talking about Steve all over, but yesterday after
the press conference what I found interesting was he stayed around
for a long time,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach said the quarterback visited him, general manager Bill
Walsh and other coaches. ``He didn't want to leave. You know he
loves it here,'' Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a man trying to say goodbye without actually saying
the words.
</P>
<P>
   What seems certain in the continuing drama that is Young is the
player's desire to be captain of his own ship and make his own
decision instead of having it made for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve will let you know,'' Mariucci said. ``There's
speculation, a gut feeling. I don't really know anything for sure.
We owe it to Steve to let him make the call when he feels good and
ready. He's going to handle it beautifully and with class. He'll do
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci also put Young's Monday breakfast meeting in Denver
with Broncos coach Mike Shanahan in proper perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, players don't get involved in negotiating with
coaches,'' the coach said. ``Those are two people who don't get
involved in negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Greg Clark, one of Young's friends on the team, said
the recently married quarterback faces ``a big life change. People
say do this, do that, but it's more difficult than that. It takes a
lot of thought. You want to make sure you're thorough. It's a lot
more difficult decision to do than people think.''
</P>
<P>
   While Young may be departing, Clark is not going anywhere for
the next three years, unless, of course, he becomes a salary cap
victim for his 2001 base salary of $1,475,000 or his 2002 figure of
$1,950,000. Clark's deal is worth $6.7 million over three years,
including a signing bonus of $2.147 million to go with a 2000 base
salary of $385,000.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clark can earn $500,000 in each of the next three
seasons if he plays in 75 percent of the team's offensive plays or
80 percent of the tight end plays. He can also earn $400,000 a year
in other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we did the play-time incentives because I have
missed some time,'' said Clark, who was not able to play in four
games last year because of injuries. ``That bridges the gap. . . .
It's really an awesome thing when you get to this point of your
career, after the restrictive years and into the free agent years.
That's where most of the money is.''

&HT;     FIVE FRESH FACES IN LINE FOR BLEMONT STAKES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELMONT, N.Y. _ For the first time in 30 years there will be no
Kentucky Derby or Preakness winner, but Wednesday's draw brought a
competitive field of 11 3-year-olds to the fore for the 132nd
Belmont Stakes, five of them newcomers to this Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division is wide open,'' said trainer Todd Pletcher, whose
Impeachment is the only horse who will have raced in all three
legs. ``There are some fresh horses running, and we've had two hard
races in a row. But the way he runs from way out of it doesn't take
as much out of him as some of the others who are close to the
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment ran third in both the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness, and could match Mane Minister's 1991 record of finishing
third in all three races unless he can overcome 8-5 favorite
Aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pan winner Postponed figures to be the strongest of the
five newcomers for Saturday's $1-million Belmont. He is trained by
Scotty Schulhofer, the defending Belmont champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postponed has really gotten better,'' Schulhofer said. He
acknowledged that the colt isn't as physically imposing as last
year's long-shot winner Lemon Drop Kid or his 1991 Belmont champ
Colonial Affair, ``but he's more versatile, and he's got the
pedigree for a mile-and-a-half.''
</P>
<P>
   Postponed was a distant sixth behind Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Wood Memorial, but Schulhofer changed riders from Jose Santos to
Edgar Prado, and the colt has put in two strong races back-to-back
coming into the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners thought we needed to make a change,'' Schulhofer
said. ``We tried to find a good rider here who we thought would fit
the horse. So far, Edgar's done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded, who closed well for second in the Peter Pan, was made
the 5-1 co-third choice in the field for his Triple Crown debut.
His owner, James Tafelhad, forked over a $100,000 supplemental
entry fee because Unshaded was not nominated to the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us was the work the other day (at Churchill
Downs),'' trainer Carl Nafzger said. ``We believe he can get the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahkodha Hills, another newcomer, was dismissed at odds of 30-1
by veteran linemaker Don LaPlace after finishing fourth behind
Postponed in the Peter Pan. He previously won the Lone Star Derby
and is eligible for a $1 million bonus if he wins the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Globalize was primed to run in the Kentucky Derby before a minor
injury changed the plans of trainer Jerry Hollendorfer. The
Lexington Stakes runner-up finished third in the Peter Pan.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Now is the surprising newcomer to this Triple Crown,
having won three races against New York-breds before a fifth-place
finish in the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, trained by a confident Bobby Frankel, drew post 5. He
was 1 1/2 lengths behind Pegasus in the Derby, but has won only
once in six career starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Belmont has always been the main goal with his pedigree,''
said Frankel, still looking for his first Triple Crown victory.
``That's why we skipped the Preakness. It doesn't make sense just
to try to get one more victory. This horse has tactical speed, and
he can run all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheelaway also bypassed the Preakness after an eventful fifth in
the Kentucky Derby, and trainer John Kimmel is hoping the strategy
will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having a fresh horse is a positive in this race,''
Kimmel said.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner, one of the pace-makers in the Preakness before
fading to sixth, is expected to keep the pace honest in the
Belmont, as well. He is listed as a 50-1 long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Curule, who ran a creditable seventh in the Derby, also bypassed
the Preakness. He has been training at Belmont since the Derby and
worked an eye-popping :58 1/5 for five furlongs last week.

FUTURE IN DOUBT FOR TOURIST ATTRACTION OPERA HOUSE IN TEXAS TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 26 seasons, busloads of tourists have flocked to the
Granbury Opera House to see its Broadway-style musicals and spend a
few bucks on the historic courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   But the Granbury landmark, which helped transform the town into
a tourist attraction, is now in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The opera house is about $60,000 in debt, and, unless grants or
corporate contributors are found, its future is tenuous, said Marty
Van Kleeck, the managing director of the opera house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that if we don't do something now, that in six
months we could be in deep trouble,'' Van Kleeck said. ``If one of
these shows doesn't do as well as we expect, then we could be right
on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Since a public appeal was made last week, some Granbury
businesses have offered support. But the Hood County seat, 45 miles
southwest of Fort Worth, doesn't have a base of major corporations
like larger cities. And the cost of operating the 1886 structure
keep mounting.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, stage lighting and wiring had to be replaced.
The theater still owes $28,000 on those bills and is also in the
midst of a campaign to replace its seats.
</P>
<P>
   The opera house changed course in 1995. That's when the board
pushed aside Jo Ann Miller, 71, a former Broadway performer who,
almost single-handedly, had brought the theater company to life.
Her longtime protege, Donna Norton, briefly held the reins before
Van Kleeck took over. There was an attempt to reach a younger
audience and do more than traditional summer-stock fare like
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Mame.''
</P>
<P>
   Current and former board members say financial problems existed
long before Van Kleeck was hired.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller disputes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marty Van Kleeck has blown it and I think Donna Norton
has blown it,'' said Miller, who remains bitter five years after
being removed. ``The way it was, was a great raving success and now
it's down the tube.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater has a budget of roughly $750,000 _ $650,000 of that
from anticipated ticket sales. The opera house has only about 100
season ticket holders, making it difficult to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after all these years it's been 15 years of slowly
going downhill,'' Van Kleeck said. ``I think some people locally
have taken the opera house for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The playhouse faces more competition for patrons and for grant
money than it did 20 years ago. Granbury Live stages musical revues
on another side of the square and many locals travel to Fort Worth
for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go from here to the Bass Hall (in Fort Worth) and pay
$50 when they could come here for $12,'' said Granbury Mayor David
Southern, an opera house season-ticket holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thought of by locals as being for tourists,'' Southern
said. ``I think people here go once a year and take their
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Granbury provides a portion of its 1-cent-bed tax to
the theater, which accounts for about $35,000 of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said the city should buy and maintain the four
buildings the Opera House owns, then lease them back to the
nonprofit theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will have to explore the possibility of taking over
ownership of the building and incorporating into out tourist
operation much like Grapevine has done,'' Southern said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Johnson, the newly installed board president and
herself a city council member, said that ``would be a last resort''
because of the cost of maintenance. And she questioned if it was in
the theater's best interest.

 &HT;    Amis charts own route in memoir
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The many surprises in Martin Amis' ``Experience'' include his
discovery that he fathered a daughter during a long-ago affair, and
the eventual revelation of what befell a cousin who disappeared in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   But one of Amis' biggest jaw-droppers is his casual confession
that he's saved none of the letters from his novelist dad, Kingsley
Amis, nor those of his other intelligentsia friends and family. And
yet, this memoir by the author of ``London Fields'' and ``The
Information'' is crammed with his own college-age missives, even
though Amis himself derides their ``tally-ho facetiousness.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Experience'' is a very subjective
autobiography, one that combines self-mockery with considerable
self-absorption. If you're an Amis fan (father or son), you
probably won't mind. If you're not familiar with either of them,
you'll be lost in the book's vacillations between precise detail
and elusiveness. Even longtime readers will occasionally tire of
Amis' parodic use of footnotes; they litter and even swallow nearly
every page of the book _ academic arguments, amusing asides or
flat-out digressions about the writer's life.
</P>
<P>
   Near the start, Amis warns the reader he may indulge in
``certain bad habits,'' including name-dropping. But since he has
met so many interesting people _ including surrogate father figure
Saul Bellow and family friend and poet Philip Larkin _ that's a
prime selling point of the book. He was also a college-era
boyfriend of Tina Brown, former editor of Vanity Fair and The New
Yorker, and now of Talk, the magazine whose book branch is
publishing this memoir. Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   In his novel ``Time's Arrow,'' Amis wrote his hero's life story
in reverse order, from deathbed to birth. So it's no surprise that
he mucks about with chronology when writing about his own life.
``Experience'' drifts from one topic to the next, an artful method
that looks like stream-of-consciousness, but isn't. Interweaving
memories of his bohemian youth, his jovially prickly relationship
with Kingsley, and his own role as a father, Amis creates what
appears to be a comprehensive tapestry. But actually he avoids some
areas you'd like to hear more about.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he devotes whole chapters to excruciating, $30,000
reconstructive dental surgery (trigger for frenzied mockery by the
London media, which accused him of selling out after he brokered an
immense advance for ``The Information''). But Amis sidesteps
writing much at all about his first, failed marriage, or his
relationship with Isabel Fonseca, the woman he left his wife for,
and the dedicatee of his memoir.
</P>
<P>
   While Amis' trademark wit and elegant writing are always
compelling, it comes as a relief when he focuses, in the book's
final third, on his relationship with Kingsley as the older
writer's health starts to fail. It's here that the witty but often
chilly writer finds emotional grounding, as he observes his
hard-drinking, adulterous dad in decline, losing the very mind that
made him one of England's notable literary voices.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional resonance also comes from the figure who haunts the
book even more than Kingsley does: Martin's cousin Lucy Partington,
who failed to come home one late-December night in 1973, and seemed
to have vanished from the planet. She hadn't. But more than 20
years passed before her family learned she was among the many
victims of serial killer Frederick West.
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed memorial service for Partington and the senior
Amis' funeral color the book's last pages. They're two examples of
what lends the book its title _ the kind of experience that Amis
calls ``that miserable enemy.'' Though his memoir avoids certain
areas of his life, by its end Amis has at least revealed some of
the real losses that fuel the smart/funny fury of his fiction.

 &HT;    Poetic in its power, `Jubilo' eloquently captures emotional
Confederate homecoming
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people would tell you that the unlikely story of Howard
Bahr begins in 1996 with the mail clerk at the Nautical and
Aviation Publishing Co. in Baltimore and a man named Jan
Snouck-Hurgronje, the son of a Dutch naval officer. But Bahr
himself would tell you it goes back further, back to one Frank
Smith, whom Bahr calls ``one of the best railroad men I ever knew
and a genuine intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on a night in 1971 that Smith, a brakeman for the
Illinois Central Railroad, put in Bahr's hands a copy of William
Faulkner's ``The Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahr was also working for the Illinois Central at the time and
living in Gulfport, Miss., a young man in his 20s who had gone to
the Navy straight from high school as an escape from a home life he
calls ``not a happy time.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Hamlet'' Bahr went to Faulkner's ``The Town,'' and
from that to another and another. In time he had read all of
Faulkner there was to read, and had decided he, too, would be a
writer. At age 27 he enrolled at the University of Mississippi,
where he would earn a bachelor's degree in English, then a master's
and then a Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be years later _ nearly two decades _ before the
manuscript submitted by Howard Bahr, a professor of English at
Motlow State Community College in Tennessee, caught the eye of a
woman who opens the mail at Nautical and Aviation Press. So taken
was Rebecca Irish by Bahr's prose that she insisted that
Snouck-Hurgronje read it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of book you see once in a lifetime,''
Snouck-Hurgronje would soon be telling interviewers. His was a
company whose entire full-time staff was four people, with no
budget for marketing and no track record in publishing fiction. But
he promised Bahr he would nominate the novel for all the important
awards the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bahr was gratified just to be published.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no agent,'' he says today, ``so I couldn't get anybody
to read my manuscript. It's one of those things _ if you don't have
an agent, you can't get published; and if you've never been
published, you can't get an agent.'' But he had seen in a magazine
an ad pitched at writers like himself, without an agent, without an
entree to the New York publishing world.
</P>
<P>
   The book that the Nautical and Aviation Publishing Co. brought
out in 1997 was ``The Black Flower,'' a Civil War novel that
happened to see the light of day at the very time Charles Frazier's
``Cold Mountain,'' itself a Civil War novel, was becoming the
publishing story of the year as well as a National Book Award
winner.
</P>
<P>
   And so ``The Black Flower'' was little noticed. But it was
noticed just enough _ a starred review in Publishers Weekly, an
award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters citing its
``distinguished and exceptional prose'' _ that the snowflakes
slowly became a ball. By word of mouth, ``The Black Flower'' was
quietly becoming a book many had heard about but few had actually
seen. (First editions already have become collectibles, with prices
as high as $300.)
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that Dawn Nicholson, a sales
representative for Henry Holt and Co., called her bosses in New
York. Nicholson had been traveling throughout the South, Holt
publicist Ida Veltri says, and everywhere she went, people were
talking about a book written by someone she'd never heard of,
published by a company she'd never heard of. Holt, she said, should
look into ``The Black Flower'' with an eye toward buying paperback
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Holt buy paperback rights _ reprinting it under the
company's Owl imprint _ but it also bought Bahr's second novel,
``The Year of Jubilo,'' released this month. After an initial run
of 50,000 copies, it already has gone into a second printing.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Black Flower,'' ``The Year of Jubilo'' is a Civil War
novel, set in 1865 as bedraggled Confederate soldiers go home to
towns in ruin, to fields wasted, to families they left behind. The
bare elements are those of a garden-variety historical romance, but
Bahr infuses this story with the pathos and tragedy of the war
itself. In the poetry of its prose, ``The Year of Jubilo'' rises to
the majesty of Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address. Its narrative
has the strength and sinew of Shelby Foote's three-volume history
of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a story of generals riding off into the eternal smoky
mists of battle, but a story of the bereavement of ordinary people
and of the confusion and chaos at war's end. Not least, it is a
story of the violence that honors no armistice, and of unspeakable
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people lived in a dreadfully violent time, much more
violent than our own,'' Bahr said. For a time, he was a Civil War
re-enactor, but the masquerades of a re-enactment do not even hint
at the savagery lost to memory.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene, in which a blind boy hears the sound of
horses' hooves, the voices of strange men and the sudden, panicked
protests of his mother and father, is as heartbreaking as anything
you will ever read. It is a prelude to a masterfully controlled
drama of remorse and vengeance, love and irreparable loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bahr's main character is a Mississippian named Gawain Harper,
who had enlisted only because the father of the woman he wanted to
marry laid down the conditions for marriage: duty to the
Confederate States of America first. With a man he meets along the
way, a strange man without a past named Harry Stribling, Harper
returns three years later to the town of Cumberland, now occupied
by Federal troops but under siege by renegades led by the monstrous
King Solomon Gault. In its own way, Harper and Stribling's journey
is a hell worse than war, a cavalcade of Southern grotesquerie
whose apparent point is moral anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   At journey's end, both Cumberland and the lives Harper returns
to are in wreckage and bewilderment, and his own defeat in battle
is only a preliminary to the struggle that now confronts him. He
learns, if he did not know before, what honor entails and how
grievous sacrifice can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year of Jubilo'' _ the title comes from an abolitionists'
song _ celebrated the emancipation of the slaves. It celebrated
freedom. But it also unleashed forces that can only be called evil.
As it did, it set the terms for our expiation _ not just as blacks
or whites, Southerners or Northerners, but as human beings who kill
one another out of rabid passion while sharing a common mortal
destiny. In its gravity and ambition, ``The Year of Jubilo'' is a
novel that William Faulkner might have written, but Faulkner never
wrote as beautifully as Howard Bahr.

   Willy stood rigid in the yard, clutching the smooth, cool
doorknob painted with flowers. He heard the horses stop outside the
place where the fence was, a jangling and thudding and muttering so
confused he could not begin to fashion a picture of it. He heard
the door of the house open, heard his father's shoes on the porch;
meanwhile the dogs were barking and howling, the horses blowing,
and somewhere among it all the reedy piping of the bird his mother
called a redwing. Then Mother was there, her hands rough and
smelling of soap. GET IN THE HOUSE she said, her voice urgent,
harsh. But Willy couldn't move. His mother stood behind him, her
hands on his shoulders. Then Father was there, too. Willy had not
heard him come, but knew he had by the smell of tobacco and shaving
soap.
</P>
<P>
   His father stood between them and the commotion in the road. YOU
ALL GET IN THE HOUSE his father said in the same voice, but Willy's
mother only gripped him tighter. NO she said. ``No,'' said Willy.

 &HT;    Easy being green at Costa Rican INBioparque
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO DE HEREDIA, Costa Rica _ The guide's voice was
curiously lacking in urgency as she turned suddenly, pointed to my
feet and said: ``Watch out for the coral snake.''
</P>
<P>
   Her warning had all the concern of someone telling me I was
about to step on a wayward house cat or an errant ball instead of a
highly venomous tropical serpent. I stopped in midstride and looked
at my feet, fully expecting to see the gaudy black, yellow and
red-striped bands of the coral snake slithering around them. But
there was nothing except my scuffed brown walking shoes and a
concrete walkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a coral snake there,'' our guide, Anna Navarro,
insisted with a smile as she continued to point at the ground by my
feet. ``They are not supposed to be out here, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Anna shrugged her shoulders and walked on, as if to say even the
wildlife here is still learning the ropes. That's to be expected in
this patch of tropical jungle plopped down in the middle of a quiet
suburban neighborhood. This unique environmental theme park, the
National Institute of Biodiversity Park, opened in February just a
few miles from downtown San Jose, Costa Rica's bustling capital.
Thankfully, all the wildlife, especially the coral snakes, minded
their manners during my recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   When I first heard about the park from my hosts, businessman
Jorge Rodriguez and his wife, Virginia, I was not enthralled with
the idea of visiting a theme park that told me about the natural
wonders of a naturally wonderful country. I wanted to see the real
thing. But they had visited the park before it opened to the public
and were effusive about its merits and what it taught not only
tourists, but lifelong residents of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly known as INBioparque, for its acronym in Spanish,
the park is a combination tourist attraction, teaching center and
research facility that stresses enjoying and preserving the
country's bountiful natural resources. Officials with the private,
nonprofit National Institute of Biodiversity, which developed and
operates the 13-acre park, are hoping it will become a gateway for
tourists to Costa Rica, which has become something of an ecological
mecca.
</P>
<P>
   The institute was formed in 1989 to put the brakes on rampant
deforestation that was threatening to denude large areas of the
country. Before the park, INBio spent years collecting and
cataloging plant and animal specimens in Costa Rica, which serves
as a land bridge between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and
between North and South America. The collecting and cataloging
still goes on through dozens of researchers in the field known as
parataxonomists, but they are virtually invisible to the casual
park visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through INBio we are learning the language of nature,'' said
Rocio Lopez, the park's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   INBio officials believe they can teach visitors and residents
the difference between squandering natural resources and using them
wisely. They refer to this as ``sustainable use.'' That means using
natural resources without using them up. Built on an abandoned
coffee plantation at a cost of about $7.5 million, the park
provides a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most
popular destinations for ecotourists and adventure travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica has 30 national parks and preserves and more than 100
protected areas, although it is only about the size of New
Hampshire. The amount of flora and fauna packed into this country
is almost beyond comprehension. As INBio guides point out
repeatedly, Costa Rica has only 0.03 percent of the world's surface
but more than 500,000 species of plants and animals, nearly 5
percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
   Reproducing even just a portion of that in 13 acres would seem
to be a bit of a challenge, but the park's designers pulled it off.
They have re-created three of the country's seven distinct
ecosystems within its boundaries: a dry forest, a central valley
forest and a tropical forest. Portions of several maritime
ecosystems are in a saltwater lagoon exhibit that opened in April.
The lagoon is stocked with fish, mollusks and underwater plants
found in Costa Rica, all of which can be seen through an underwater
viewing station.
</P>
<P>
   Re-creating the central valley forest was no problem, since San
Jose is in the central valley. To re-create the dry forest,
developers simply brought in plants indigenous to that ecosystem
and then dried out that portion of the park by pumping water out of
it. For the humid, tropical forest, they took the water from the
dry forest, recycled it, and pumped it into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   The forests are contiguous, so it is difficult to know when
you're passing from one to another. But Anna, who said she and her
fellow guides went through six months of intense training before
being entrusted to lead the public, was well-attuned to those
changes and reminded us of how the plants differed as we moved
along the trails.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing boxes are scattered throughout the forests where certain
species of insects, butterflies and amphibians can be more easily
spotted. Anna stopped us in the tropical forest at one such exhibit
and pointed out three poison dart frogs, each barely larger than a
thumbnail. Two were bright orange, the other two-tone green. The
dart frogs were so named because Indians of Central and South
America put the poisonous mucus excreted from their skin on hunting
darts.
</P>
<P>
   Even Anna was excited about seeing three on the same day. ``You
were lucky you got to see three,'' she told my companion and me.
``Usually we may see only one because they are so small.''
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon is expected to become one of the more popular areas
in the park. It has an open-air amphitheater and two open-air
classrooms where schoolchildren will be instructed in the
importance of saving natural resources. It also has a man-made hill
with a lookout point that provides spectacular views of nearby
Barva and Poaz volcanoes, as well as downtown San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   An eco-tourism office housed in the park is a good place to pick
up brochures about traveling into the countryside to see the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The park has almost a Disneylike feel to it, with its bright
yellow and blue buildings and its fresh-scrubbed guides in khaki
pants and white polo shirts. It can also have a Disneylike effect
on your wallet. A private tour and lecture are $21 per person.
Group tours are $18 each for adults, $15 for students and $9 for
children under 12. English-speaking guides are available, and the
introductory video is presented in English hourly.
</P>
<P>
   After the video, visitors are shown through two large exhibit
halls with interactive displays that focus on the uniqueness of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the park is now being heavily promoted through tourist
agencies and even local cab drivers, the place is so new that even
cabbies who have lived here all their lives have problems finding
it. And finding the park by yourself with the directions in its
brochure _ 400 meters north and 250 meters west of the Shell gas
station in Santo Domingo _ can be more than just a small adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth the effort, even if portions of the park appear a
bit underdeveloped. That's because many of the trees were planted
only two years ago, according to Anna.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trees are tiny now, but come back in 10 years,'' she
invited as she stood next to a plant known locally as ``the Poor
Man's Umbrella'' because of its large leaves. ``Maybe then we'll be
fully grown.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: San Jose is $498 round trip on Delta (one daily
nonstop) and American (connecting service through Miami) airlines.
The park is in the suburb of Santo Domingo de Heredia, just a few
miles northwest of downtown San Jose. Well-marked buses run from
the center of San Jose to downtown Heredia every few minutes for
120 colones (about 40 cents) each way. From downtown Heredia it's
easy to catch a red cab to the park (about $2). Just tell the
cabbie ``INBioparque'' and he'll deliver you, maybe to the back
gate, but you'll be near enough.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Park particulars: The park is open 7:30 a.m.-4 p.m. daily.
Admission is $18 for adults ($21 for a guided tour), $15 for
students ($17 for a guided tour), $15 for children under 12 (no
guide fee charged). Guided tours are available in English and
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The National Institute of Biodiversity's Web
site, www.inbio.ac.cr/inbioparque, is in English and Spanish.

 &HT;    Bistros: A flavor of France in Napa Valley
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNTVILLE, Calif. _ Bistro Jeanty and Bouchon _ two of the
nation's best French bistros _ are oddly enough a few doors from
each other on picturesque Washington Street in this Napa Valley
town.
</P>
<P>
   Odd, because the valley was largely settled by Italians and
because the prevalent culinary idiom is ``California cuisine.'' Is
there room for dueling bistros?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' says Sarah Scott, a native Atlantan who is one
of the executive chefs at Robert Mondavi Winery. ``French bistro
food is legitimate and very pure. (These restaurants) signal a
return and seeking out of true and authentic flavors. They're
neighborhoody, and they fit what Yountville is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bistro Jeanty is chef Philippe Jeanty's return to his French
country roots after the many years he spent practicing fashionable
wine-country cuisine at Domaine Chandon. The restaurant is small,
crowded and noisy, with a moderately priced menu of the kind of
homey, provincial French food Jeanty grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no concessions to American palates. Instead, he wins
converts. His jelled squares of pigs' feet over French green beans
in a mustardy vinaigrette is among his most popular dishes. You may
grimace at your first bite, but it will be like your first bite of
sushi _ a revelation. Now you're ready for the fine-grained and
butter-soft cubes of lamb's tongue with potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   A hand-chopped steak tartare sports a raw egg yolk perched in
its shell on top and a cornet of exceptional french fries on the
side. And the cassoulet comes in a crock deep enough to suspend the
duck confit leg, sausage and bacon in creamy white beans. But it
also tapers to a small base, so you're not overwhelmed by beans.
Even as he pays homage to the classics, Jeanty shows a finessed
hand as a chef.
</P>
<P>
   While Bistro Jeanty evokes a corner cafe in the French
countryside, Bouchon _ with its tile floors and mohair banquettes _
seems more Parisian. Thomas Keller conceived it as a low-key
alternative to catch the overflow from his French Laundry and to
provide Valley food professionals a place to congregate late. Both
the original chef and the original manager (Keller's brother,
Joseph) have left since a somewhat shaky opening two years ago, and
by all accounts the place has improved _ both in terms of food and
'tude.
</P>
<P>
   Diners still pack this boisterous and extremely noisy place for
platters of shellfish _ chilled lobster, oysters, shrimp, clams and
mussels _ served from a station next to the custom-designed zinc
bar. But it's the newer dishes that shine. There's a juicy boudin
blanc (white veal sausage) served with potato mousseline and dense,
sweet figs. And the skate wing served over meltingly soft savoy
cabbage with a whole-grain mustard sauce is a stellar example of
innovative cooking with a grounding in classic French flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go through this whole (culinary) revolution to
return to this,'' Scott says, ``something you can eat every day.''
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION
</P>

 &HT;    In the Bay Area _ where food isn't an afterthought, sometimes
it's the reason for the trip _ there's no shortage of culinary
delights available from both classic restaurants and innovative
newcomers
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNTVILLE, Calif. _ With a Mother of Pearl spoon _ hardly
bigger than a tasting spoon in an ice cream parlor _ I scoop up the
``oysters and pearls'' in tiny bites, not wanting to see it end.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is a trim portion of weird, enthralling mush: custardy
sabayon studded with tapioca, then set with plump Malpeque oysters
and an outsized dollop of osetra caviar. Every spoonful startles
the palate with its contrast of eggy richness and brine, and the
beads-on-beads texture rolls on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that good?'' asks the waiter, clearing my dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the best thing I've ever eaten,'' I say, almost
asking (begging, pleading) for another.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't ask for seconds at the French Laundry, the Napa
Valley restaurant where any meal may consist of 15 or 20
mini-courses. Each is a two-bite inspiration, an arresting
sensation of the here and now slipping down your throat.
</P>
<P>
   That is the reason that people book their plane tickets around a
reservation at Thomas Keller's 62-seat sensation that has become
the non plus ultra of America's dining destinations. To reserve,
you must call two months to the exact calendar date ahead of time,
and be prepared for stinging rejection if others beat you to the
punch.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can't book at the French Laundry, you won't be
hurting for great eats. From the Wine Country to the hot South of
Market district of San Francisco, the Bay Area is awash in
astonishing restaurants. In some you'll enjoy the simple, true
flavors of locally grown products. In others, you'll witness the
chef consciously shifting the paradigm, pushing California cuisine
to the next stage of its evolution. But throughout the region,
you'll see that restaurants here benefit from a unique synergy of
natural resources, commitment to gastronomy and the kind of red-hot
economy (bless those dot-com millionaires) that can make this all
possible.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you make the most of Bay Area dining in a few days?
You plan meal by meal.
</P>
<P>
   That means first considering the classics. For some, San
Francisco wouldn't be San Francisco without a dozen oysters and a
gorgonzola cheeseburger on focaccia at Zuni Cafe, a contemporary
French degustation under the tented ceiling of Fleur de Lys or a
roasted fish at Rose Pistola. California wouldn't be California
without Chez Panisse. And the Wine Country offers everything from a
glorious patio amid the vines at Domaine Chandon to killer pigs'
feet at Bistro Jeanty.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also save time (and room in your stomach) for the
important newcomers. Gary Danko, named America's best new
restaurant by the James Beard Foundation, puts fusty Fisherman's
Wharf back on the culinary map. The Fifth Floor, in the hep Palomar
Hotel, showcases the swing-beat showmanship of chef George Morrone.
Throughout the Bay Area wonderful food seems to roll in with the
fog, seep forth from the San Andreas Fault. It is everywhere, and
yours to choose.

 &HT;    Cool prints add instant jazz to dad's look
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hawaiian clothier Ellery J. Chun died recently, just as the
tropical print shirts he's credited with inventing are reaching a
new zenith in popularity, with sales heating up in anticipation of
Father's Day. Chun, who was 91, designed his first set of shirts in
1931 and registered them under the ``Aloha'' trade name five years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical print shirts weren't always considered the height of
sporty stylishness they are today: they had their heyday in the
1940s and '50 when entertainers like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra
wore them; but for much of their history they were deemed rather
tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Dillard's menswear manager Hugh McDonald, ``The look
is very popular with the young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiian shirts come in a variety of patterns, ranging from
subtle prints with ocean or beach scenes, to bold,
tropical-inspired designs that make you want to go surfing. Color
schemes run the gamut, from soft pastels and muted shades to
bright, vivid tones.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts can be worn open, buttoned or layered on top of a
matching T-shirt. Pair them with drawstring or cargo pants, khakis,
linen slacks or shorts for the ultimate in weekend wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every man, at some point, wants a few more interesting pieces
in his wardrobe,'' says Jerry Lemmo, manager at Sebastian's Closet
in Atlanta. ``He's going to do a print for a nice change of pace.''

&HT;     REGENTS FEAR EFFECT OF MANDATORY EXAM ON VOCATIONAL STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICK KARLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY. N.Y. _ Facing fears that some high school students won't
pass the Regents exams to be required for graduation, some New York
Board of Regents members are entertaining the idea of exams
tailored to vocational students.
</P>
<P>
   The central idea behind refining the new state standards is to
improve the educational program _ and job prospects _ for the
roughly 295,000 high school students in vocational or career
preparation courses, ranging from auto mechanics to building trades
and computer networking. Already, education officials have proposed
a certificate proving that these students have mastered a job
skill.
</P>
<P>
   But educators fear the Regents exams may prove onerous to those
who study trades and who previously were not required to take the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone agrees that the new state standards will be tough
to meet, the Regents insist that by refining their requirements
they are not backing down from their high goals, and so far top
officials oppose tailoring or altering the actual exams to
vocational courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not (support) any effort that creates a second tier,''
Regents Chancellor Carl Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a special advisory panel rejected the idea of alternate
exams, in part because such a move would look like a ``second-class
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes may be considered next week when the board, which
sets New York's education policy, considers a proposal for a
vocational Regents diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Educators have been wondering how to integrate the vocational
programs into the larger goal of raising academic achievement for
all of the state's students.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the focus so far has been on a phase-in of the mandatory
Regents exams, which have historically been viewed as college prep
but which all high school graduates will have to pass by 2003. This
is the first year all high school seniors will have to pass the
English Regents exam in order to get a diploma. Mandatory exams in
math, history and science will be phased in over the next several
years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this academic bar-raising, the vocational certificate
plan emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Regents diploma with a career and technical
endorsement,'' said Education Commissioner Richard Mills.
</P>
<P>
   To earn these endorsements, students may be able to take courses
that are geared to their career studies, such as the science behind
an automobile engine, or the math that goes into building a home.
</P>
<P>
   That's already happening to some extent. Many courses, including
vocational offerings, emphasize reading and writing to prepare
students for the English Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, passing the exams, along with earning a technical
certificate, will be a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of questions about it,'' said Regent Eleanor
Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of students out there who say the only reason
they are here (in school) is because of the career and technical
piece,'' said Bartlett, a retired Albany city school administrator.
``To say to those students, `take five Regents exams,' would be a
stretch. I'm afraid that for some of our students it will be
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say there's no alternative, I'm afraid the kids won't
have the time. Does it make sense to penalize the kid because he
wants a technical diploma?'' said Gary Jones, director of
occupational education at the Albany-area vocational education
center in Colonie.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has suggested adapting the Regents exams to vocational
courses _ writing essays about engines rather than ``Moby Dick,''
for example. Some officials may want to alter other exams.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Saul Cohen believes all high school students should take
the same English and math exams, but those in vocational programs
might take other tests tailored to their studies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, vocational students might prepare for a Regents
exam on the history of technology instead of the traditional world
history, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mills, who is cool to the idea of alternate Regents exams,
said the final result may include some changes and compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a policy matter that the Regents are going to decide.
You're going to see a very intense debate involving thousands of
people over the next few months,'' Mills said. ``I've never seen a
policy issue emerge from the Regents exactly the way that it went
in.''

&HT;     SCIENTISTS LINK MOLECULAR FORCES TO GECKO'S STICKING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Tokay gecko can scamper across ceilings and
walls because their feet are covered with millions of microscopic
hairs that have astounding bonding power, researchers reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, if verified, could lead to super-sticky adhesives
for use in outer space and on the ocean bottom, said Robert J.
Full, a biologist at the University of California at Berkeley and
one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's issue of Nature, Full and his colleagues report
the first measurements of the strength of gecko hairs, technically
known as setae (pronounced ``see tee''').
</P>
<P>
   ``The hairs themselves are so sticky that if we were able to fit
a million or two of them onto the surface of a dime, it would be
enough to lift a small child,'' Kellar Autumn, a biologist at Lewis
and Clark College in Portland, Ore., said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least the 1960s, some scientists have suggested that
setae tips are so tiny that they can exploit molecular-size forces
that are normally unavailable to living creatures.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is van der Waals forces, which are negligible on
the scale of everyday life, but are fairly strong in the short
distances between molecules. (The forces are named for Johannes
Diderik van der Waals, a Dutch scientist who won the 1910 Nobel
Prize in physics.)
</P>
<P>
   These forces between a single gecko hair tip and molecules in a
wall would be extremely weak _ too weak to support a foot-long
gecko as it scampers around a ceiling. But add up the combined van
der Waals forces of millions of hairs on a gecko foot, and there is
powerful sticking power.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists caution that the van der Waals explanation
remains unproven. But it once might have seemed crazy, and now it
has gained credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis is feasible because the measured strength ``falls
right in the middle of the range of van der Waals'' forces that one
would expect for millions of gecko hairs, Full said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that a different type of inter-molecular
force is involved: electrical attraction between oppositely charged
particles in the hair tips.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its cause, the gecko's stickiness is a dramatic example
of Mother Nature's creativity and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists have long marveled at how nature
continually finds ecological niches for animals to exploit, then
gives them amazing tools with which to exploit them. Consider
bacteria, which orient themselves in liquids by detecting Earth's
magnetic field.
</P>
<P>
   So when humans invented buildings with ceilings, geckos quickly
recognized the ceilings as an unexploited ecological niche
blissfully free of predators and deliciously crowded with edibles,
such as bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin argued that life forms
evolved when nature eliminated those that were less fit. The
stickiest geckos were presumably more likely to survive than those
that kept slipping off trees (perhaps into some predator's jaws).
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true in tropical lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of geckos live in areas prone to hurricanes,'' Autumn
said. ``Perhaps their (stickiness) prevents them from being blown
away.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 850 types of gecko, ranging in size from a few
inches to a few feet.

FORMER DEMOCRATIC STAR STILL WIELDS CLOUT IN TEXAS PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He had the golden touch, the kind of talent,
many said, that might just land him in the White House one day.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, it all ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 34, he toppled from the throne to the political
graveyard,'' said a 1972 Dallas Times Herald editorial. ``Richard
Nixon once came back from sound defeat, but no one, at this point,
can figure the future of the fallen young white knight, Ben
Barnes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades later, both Nixon and the Times Herald are
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes, Texas' youngest lieutenant governor at age 30, whose
career in elective politics was grounded by the 1971 Sharpstown
scandal and his life rocked by a 1987 personal bankruptcy, is again
making his presence felt at 62.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest incarnation, as elder statesman among Lone Star
Democrats, Barnes is calling on state leaders to quit doling out
what he says are meaningless tax cuts while Texas falls farther and
farther behind other states in spending on education, health and
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas today is drifting toward mediocrity just when it should
be striving for greatness,'' Barnes said in a recent speech that
has sent a few ripples through the capitol. ``Our politicians are
letting it happen and the rest of us don't seem to understand or
care.''
</P>
<P>
   He then ticked off a litany of state rankings: last in state
spending per capita, 22nd in the percentage of residents over 25
with college degrees, 47th in per capita highway spending, huge
high school dropout rates, nearly last in children with health
insurance ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit idly by and let us fiddle while Rome
burns,'' Barnes said in an interview. ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If he sounds angry, he is.
</P>
<P>
   If he sounds like a candidate for office, Barnes says
emphatically that he is not.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he returned a $500 contribution to a donor who heard
the speech and thought he was running again.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that he has no ambitions for elected office,
Barnes said, ``I do want to help set the agenda for the campaigns
in the fall. I want to help the public set the agenda for the next
session of the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   His agenda includes an eye-popping $20,000 teacher pay raise
over the next four years, and hundreds of millions of dollars more
a year for transportation improvements and higher education
spending.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the increases, Barnes says the state should not only
use every dime of any surplus money but also should raise gasoline
taxes by 10 cents a gallon over the next four years. That would
generate $315 million a year for teacher salaries and smaller
classes, and pump $911 million into road modernization, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Black, a spokesman for the Texas Republican Party, said
the GOP can only benefit if Democrats like Barnes talk about
raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a Democrat would say that raising taxes is the key to
greatness,'' Black said. ``And only a Democrat would think that
Texas is heading toward mediocrity when in fact Texas is
skyrocketing toward greatness thanks to Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a powerful Republican, State Sen. Bill Ratliff of Mount
Pleasant, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has
called for a gasoline tax increase to pay for sorely needed
transportation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a lifelong Democrat who still contributes much to
Democratic candidates, is quick to point out that he is not
singling out Republicans in his criticism _ including Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an attack on Republicans, or an attack on George
Bush,'' Barnes said. ``Gov. Richards was governor of Texas and we
didn't move Texas ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a millionaire lobbyist, Barnes has spent most of his life at
or near the center of Texas power _ and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Gorman, about 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Barnes
was elected in 1960 to the Texas House of Representatives. At 26,
he became the youngest House speaker in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But he fell almost as quickly as he rose. In 1971, state
government was roiled by the Sharpstown bribery scandal. Though
never charged with criminal wrongdoing, Barnes was swept out of
office by a reform-minded electorate, and he finished third in the
1972 Democratic primary for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-rolling 1980s Barnes and former Gov. John Connally
were involved in a series of ill-fated real estate developments,
forcing both into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Parlaying experience and connections, Barnes quickly rebounded
financially as a lobbyist. In 1997, he made headlines when Gtech,
the company that runs the Texas Lottery, paid his firm $23 million
to ``drop'' a lobbying contract.
</P>
<P>
   It had become the focus of considerable controversy and,
incongruously, ended up as fodder for the 2000 presidential
campaign. Compelled to testify in a lawsuit brought against Gtech,
Barnes was asked if he had helped Gov. Bush get a slot in the Air
National Guard in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Through a lawyer, Barnes said that a Houston oilman named Sidney
Adger, a Bush family friend, called him when he was House speaker
to ask that he recommend the young Bush for a pilot slot. Barnes
said he would. Bush has said that neither he nor his father, then a
U.S. representative from Houston, asked for special favors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the twice-divorced father of four grown children is again
making headlines, but this time there is a touch of the old Barnes
on display.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats are encouraging Barnes' tax increase ideas,
others, like former Comptroller John Sharp, call the move unwise.
Texas' problems need to be addressed, Sharp said. But try winning
an election by ``standing up and saying the first thing I'm going
to do is raise taxes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some politicians tell me, `All this, it will not sell,''' said
Barnes, who plans to make a series of speeches around the state on
the subject and says, ``That's not the reaction I'm getting.''

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ The British foreign secretary, Robin
Cook, tried to reassure anxious Sierra Leoneans Thursday of
Britain's long-term commitment to its former West African colony,
even as British troops prepared to withdraw next week and leave the
country's security in the hands of a U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Making a one-day trip through Sierra Leone's rain-soaked capital
here, Cook met with President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and leaders of a
fragile pro-government coalition, including the heads of two
militias that had fought each other for years. He then met with the
civilian and military heads of the U.N. force that had teetered on
the edge of collapse in early May before the British arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have assured President Kabbah that Britain wants to be
long-term partner in ensuring a stable, successful, enterprising
Sierra Leone,'' Cook said at a news conference after meeting the
president. ``And I can assure President Kabbah that Britain is
ready to go the distance until we have achieved our joint objective
of a lasting security.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government is proceeding with its plans to pull out
its 800 marines, saying it has achieved its stated aim of
stabilizing the situation here in the last month as the United
Nations built up its force by more than 3,000 to the current level
of about 11,900. Already, British soldiers who had been guarding
the international airport and western Freetown have been replaced
by U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The planned withdrawal comes as many Sierra Leoneans, clearly
lacking confidence in a U.N. force that appeared helpless against
Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, have pleaded with the
British to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't leave, don't leave,'' said Muctar Jalloh, the unofficial
mayor of a camp for people whose hands, arms or legs were chopped
off as part of the atrocities that came to define Sierra Leone's
war.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, like most foreign dignitaries before him, paid a visit to
the camp, run by Doctors Without Borders. He met several amputees,
including Abu, an 18-month-old boy whose right leg was hacked off
above the knee when he was 2 months old.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, Cook argued that Britain was not leaving
Sierra Leone. A team of 180 military officials will arrive soon to
train 1,000 soldiers for a new Sierra Leone army, followed later by
a smaller group that will be charged with recreating the rest of
the army over the next three years. Two warships, a frigate and a
supply boat, will remain anchored off the coast of Freetown, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something I totally agree with,'' Kabbah, sitting next
to Cook, said of Britain's plans. He added: ``The British people
have done a lot for us. We appreciate it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kabbah appeared less comfortable at a later news conference with
Cook and the leaders of the military coalition that is propping up
his government. Seated two seats to the president's left was Hinga
Norman, the deputy defense minister, who derives his power mainly
because he controls a militia of tribal hunters who wear charms and
recite verses from the Bible and Koran to steel themselves for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Two chairs to Kabbah's right sat Johnny Paul Koroma, a retired
Lt. Col. who toppled Kabbah in 1997 and briefly held power. The
followers of Koroma, still considered the real military powerbroker
in the country, participated with Sankoh's group in committing
atrocities against civilians, especially in the brutal invasion of
Freetown in January 1999. But Koroma, now a born-again Christian,
has allied himself with Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how long the alliance between Koroma and Norman,
fierce adversaries for years, will last. What is clear is that
their militias, which had begun disarming under a peace accord
signed last July, have taken up arms again and are unlikely to
disarm under the present situation.
</P>
<P>
   While the British succeeded in guaranteeing the capital's
security and helped repel rebels toward the east, Sierra Leone is
again divided. The Revolutionary United Front again controls the
north and east, including the country's diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that Britain will sponsor a proposal at the U.N.
Security Council in New York to ban the trade of all but
government-certified diamonds from Sierra Leone. But the measure
would mean little since diamonds are smuggled out of Sierra Leone
from neighboring countries, particularly Liberia, and diamond
buyers outside Africa, especially those in Antwerp, have been
unwilling to abide by similar bans.
</P>
<P>
   A number of critical issues remain unresolved. What happens to
Sankoh, who remains in government custody, has yet to be decided.
The U.N. force is expected to grow by another 3,000 soldiers. But
the United Nations has yet to put forth a plan to deal with the new
reality in Sierra Leone, a country where there is no longer any
peace to keep and where many of the other premises behind the
peacekeeping mission have also become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-member U.N. assessment team visited Sierra Leone this
week and is soon expected to present a report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

WITH MEGA-MALL, ARENA AND SPRUCED-UP ZOO, MUSIC CITY HAS REASON TO
SING

<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Let's imagine you've only been in Nashville for an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   You're driving around town, familiarizing yourself with the
place, gearing up for an evening at the Grand Ole Opry because, as
everyone knows, country music is all there is to Nashville. Before
crossing the Cumberland River and heading toward Music Row and the
Ernest Tubb Record Shop, you think it might be interesting to swing
by Vanderbilt University. And it is; Vanderbilt is a red-brick
wonder, beautiful and inspiring at the same time, reminiscent of
the Stanford campus in California. But you can only look at bricks
for so long; you leave Vanderbilt and start to head downtown when
you glance across this pretty green park _ and there is the
Parthenon, in all its massive Grecian glory. It's quite a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   And so is Nashville itself, a sparkling, pleasant city that
could use as its official motto the phrase ``We're Not Just Country
Music Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that musicians from Loretta Lynn to Shania Twain aren't
still a huge attraction. Anyone who comes to Nashville on vacation
obviously will have a more than passing interest in steel guitars
and twangy vocals. But it's also safe to say that Nashville has
more to offer, a lot more _ a completely refurbished zoo, some
intriguing museums, various sports attractions, a new mega-shopping
mall, Andrew Jackson's old homestead, and, of course, the Parthenon
replica _ all made even more attractive by amazingly clean city
streets and unclogged highways that make going from one place to
another easy for even the most traffic-shy Nashville visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Those who haven't experienced Nashville lately will find the
city very different. Around 1995, civic leaders decided to clean up
the streets and expand Nashville's tourist outreach. That, in turn,
led to the wooing and winning of the pro football Oilers from
Houston, who then needed a new stadium near downtown Nashville.
That resulted in a much-needed face-lift for the neighborhoods
surrounding downtown's famous nightspots and stores. Nashville 2000
has an almost ivory gleam to it; you'd be hard-pressed to find a
``cleaner'' American city.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything is new _ far from it. The Parthenon in
Nashville's Centennial Park, while not as ancient as the Greek
structure it copies, is still more than 100 years old; the
full-scale replica was built in 1897 as part of the statewide
celebration of Tennessee's 100th birthday. Now it houses various
art exhibits, though younger visitors will probably most enjoy the
gorgeous duck pond outside. (Don't be put off by some scaffolding
on the outside walls; the Parthenon is open for business as usual.)
</P>
<P>
   Though the Opryland Theme Park has closed, the venerable Grand
Ole Opry is going strong, and undoubtedly will until the last song
about straying spouses and dead dogs has been written and sung.
Evening shows featuring dozens of artists (Little Jimmy Dickens,
Porter Wagoner, and many, many more) are held every Friday and
Saturday night, with Tuesday matinees added during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Music Row is still exactly that, a couple of streets (mostly
Division Street and Music Square, which combines parts of 16th
Avenue South and 17th Avenue South) lined with record stores and
agents' offices and music publishing businesses. The Ernest Tubb
Record Shop is on nearby Lower Broadway, as is Tootsie's Orchid
Lounge and the Lawrence Brothers Record Shop, perhaps the best
place in the world to find some out-of-print LPs by obscure country
stars. These evergreen attractions are probably the best places to
buy T-shirts as souvenirs for friends, and Tootsie's still has the
nonstop live music that earned its original reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Wags have described The Hermitage as ``Monticello without the
inventions and Mount Vernon without the charm,'' but Andrew
Jackson's old digs are, in fact, fascinating, though The Hermitage
did have to be rebuilt after an 1834 fire, meaning much of what you
see is faithful imitation rather than original, but at least it's
Jackson-designed imitation. Most of the furnishings were once
Jackson property. A well-preserved smokehouse and the tombs of
Jackson and wife Rachel offer Kodak moments. The Hermitage is open
daily except for Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Opryland Theme Park is the most obvious of the vanished tourist
attractions, but also gone are the Hank Williams Jr. Museum, Twitty
City and the Country Music Wax Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional Nashville attractions remain: The Ryman
Auditorium, original home of the Grand Ole Opry; the Country Music
Hall of Fame, where Elvis' gold Cadillac is a featured exhibit; and
the Grand Ole Opry Museum. All are worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   But so are the new places, many of which don't have country
music tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildhorse Saloon on Second Avenue North opened in 1994, and
it provides a modern counterpoint to Tootsie's and the Opry _ think
Billy Bob's Texas, but smaller and with a third more neon. This is
the Nashville venue you're likely to see on CMT cable, with women
singers more likely to wear tank tops and cutoffs than crinoline
and ruffles. Trick Pony and Mary Sue England are a couple of the
more recent acts, and so-called dinosaur rock has its place _
America and Blood, Sweat &AMP; Tears have played there recently.
Nearby, there's a Hard Rock Cafe, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Zoo doesn't rival Fort Worth's, but would
certainly hold its own against most other metropolitan animal
exhibits. Apparently, the old zoo was dingy and depressing for man
and beast, but the updated version, which includes great natural
habitatlike areas for cougars, gray wolves and black bears, will
delight most patrons. There's also a huge playground, so kids can
work off some excess energy before getting back in the car.
</P>
<P>
   OpryMills, which opened just a few weeks ago, is a massive $200
mega-mall built where the old Opryland Theme Park used to stand
outside town. Imagine the biggest mall you've ever seen, but on
steroids. OpryMills is most similar in size to Minneapolis'
now-legendary Mall of America, a chain-store mecca of gigantic
proportions. If you can't find an item to buy at OpryMills, that's
probably because it hasn't been invented yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Cumberland Science Museum may be best-known for its
planetarium, but kids will race for Curiosity Corner, which
features the same kind of user-friendly exhibits as San Francisco's
better-known Exploratorium.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new downtown sports arena that provides a home for an
equally new National Hockey League team, the Nashville Predators,
and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, certainly of interest to
ESPN buffs.
</P>
<P>
   More is coming. In May 2001, the Country Music Hall of Fame
takes up new downtown digs that will offer better display space and
room for future expansion. In that same month, Nashville will open
the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, the city's first major fine
arts center (think what the Amon Carter, Modern and Kimbell museums
mean to Fort Worth).
</P>
<P>
   But Nashville's charms aren't limited to the places you read
about in guide books. The whole atmosphere of the city is friendly
and family-oriented. Its public parks sparkle. Common-sense signage
helps visitors find their way around with ease. Though all the
major attractions involve admission fees, there are free programs,
too, like the teen-friendly, free summer concerts on Thursday
nights at Riverfront Park.
</P>
<P>
   Even driving in and around Nashville is fun. Located about in
the center of Tennessee, the city is surrounded by pretty lakes and
sits amid gently rolling, tree-lined hills. The Cumberland River
loops around downtown, which has enough tall buildings to provide
afternoon shade and includes sufficiently varied restaurants to
provide gustatory pleasure no matter which kind of food you feel
like eating.
</P>
<P>
   Geography probably dictates what you'll want to do and when,
though Nashville's freeway system makes it possible to get from one
end of town to the other in minimal time. But the Grand Ole Opry,
OpryMills and The Hermitage are on the northeast fringes of town.
The Capitol, Vanderbilt and the Parthenon occupy acres to the west,
and Music Row stretches mostly south. Two full days and nights, or
certainly a three-day weekend, will probably enable you to do and
see almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   All of Nashville's elements _ the new attractions, the old
tourist favorites, the much cleaner downtown streets and the lovely
surrounding countryside _ combine to offer a special sort of
hospitality. Like a few other places _ Santa Fe, Durango, Portland,
Oklahoma City despite the tornadoes _ Nashville has a unique
atmosphere that's exciting without too much attendant big-city
effluvia. When you're there, you feel as though you're somewhere
special _ and that's what vacations ought to offer.

`LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST': WHAT SAY YOU, MY LORDS? YOU'D RATHER
CHARLESTON? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For every man with his affects is born,
</P>
<P>
   Not by might mast'red, but by special grace.
</P>
<P>
   These lines are spoken by Berowne, a witty courtier played by
Kenneth Branagh, who also directed ``Love's Labour's Lost,'' a
whimsical, affected adaptation of Shakespeare's most forgettable
early comedy. There is a great deal of dancing in the movie, which
invokes the name of Stanley Donen and boasts a score packed with
Broadway standards from Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin and the Gershwin
brothers, but not much special grace.
</P>
<P>
   Branagh has assembled a troupe of game, eager young stars,
including Matthew Lillard, the gangly creep show heartthrob from
the ``Scream'' pictures, and Alicia Silverstone, the Bel Air Jane
Austen heroine of ``Clueless,'' and sent them wobblingly forth to
belt out show tunes, declaim pentameter and assay the leaps and
twirls of Stuart Hopps' mercifully simplified choreography. He's
even seen fit to include an Esther Williams-style water ballet
sequence, complete with gold maillots and cabbage-leaf bathing
caps.
</P>
<P>
   If the cast were a sixth-grade class, and you were one of their
parents, you'd burst out of your seat applauding madly, and rush
backstage after the show, exclaiming: ``But you were wonderful!
Really, really great!'' And then you'd congratulate the drama
teacher (that would be the energetic English fellow with the blond
hair and theatrical demeanor), who's so creative, the school is
lucky to have him.
</P>
<P>
   As a paying customer, your reaction may be more subdued, but the
gee-whiz amateurism of this production is indubitably part of its
charm. Watching Adrian Lester, as Dumaine, trying a half-successful
split on a high wooden library table, you can only admire his
effort, and be glad that Branagh did not demand another take. When
Silverstone's voice skids and squeaks over the syllables of words
like ``perplexity'' and ``lamentation,'' you can't help but root
for her in her struggle with the the tongue-tying perplexities of
Elizabethan verse.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting Branagh's sincere enthusiasm for the
material, which is not only Shakespeare but also old newsreels,
``Casablanca'' and classic MGM musicals. He throws them together
with the gusto of a man playing a tuba with a bass drum strapped to
his back while his pet monkey leaps around with a squeeze box. It's
not art exactly, or even music, but it's entertaining, albeit in an
intermittently annoying kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   For no particular reason, Branagh sets the play in a dreamy
Technicolor Europe on the eve of World War II. The King of Navarre
(Alessandro Nivola) has persuaded his three best pals to join him
in a vow of chastity, which is quickly tested by the arrival of the
French princess (Silverstone) and her three luscious
ladies-in-waiting. The mooning and swooning of the nobility is
mirrored by the bawdier amours of Don Armado (Timothy Spall) and
Jaquenetta (Stefania Rocca), whose cleavage inspires some of
Branagh's most inventive camera work.
</P>
<P>
   Spall, who looks like Peter Sellers inflated with a bicycle
pump, delivers his lines with hilarious pixilation. Nathan Lane, as
the clown Costard, provides another installment in his ongoing
salute to vaudeville. (I'm sure that the rubber chicken came from
his personal collection.) He also sings a slowed-down, wistful
rendition of ``There's No Business Like Show Business'' in top hat
and tails.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? Even though ``Love's Labour's Lost'' is, in
showbiz terms, a turkey stuffed with chestnuts, you wouldn't trade
it for a pot of gold. The film ends with a long, sweetly
melancholic sequence set to ``They Can't Take That Away From Me.''
Even after the song is ended, the melody lingers on, and you leave
the theater tipsy on Shakespeare's raillery and Ira Gershwin's wit,
as though you'd had a glass or two of cheap champagne. There are
worse ways to feel.
</P>

<P>
   CALAIS, France _ Wandering a cavernous French mall, David
Botsford stops to study the polo shirts stacked on a table at the
entrance to a casual clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred francs _ how much is that?'' asks Botsford, the
president of an Atlanta marketing firm. He reads the sign saying
that he can buy two Celio sports shirts for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``About $30,'' answers his wife, Anita Sharpe, the co-founder of
an Internet media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' says Botsford, who steps into the shop to add to his
growing burden of bargains.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the same shirts would have cost him as much as $40
because the exchange rate then was less friendly to Americans
bearing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Botsford is shopping at the massive new ``hypermarket'' built in
Calais to attract shoppers from Britain, who bring their cars on
the train through the Eurotunnel to load up on bargains on the
generally cheaper continent.
</P>
<P>
   The discounts are made even more appealing these days because of
the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the cheaper prices is the fall of the euro, the
currency of 11 European Union nations. It was launched in January
1999 at a value of $1.16, but since has lost about a quarter of its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, the euro has hit a low of about 89
cents before recovering to about 96 cents this week. When the euro
falls, fewer U.S. dollars are needed to buy goods and services in
the euro zone, which
</P>
<P>
   includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Holland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   National currencies such as the franc, mark and lira are still
in circulation, but the exchange rates are tied to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Euro bank notes and coins are expected to enter circulation in
2002, gradually replacing national currencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of a weak euro is evident today. A hotel room in
the lovely Belgian tourist town of Brugge cost Botsford and Sharpe
the equivalent of $83 a night, compared to nearly $100 a year ago.
Dinner _ including two bottles of nice Pomerol wine _ for four
adults and two children cost about $20 less this year than it would
have cost last year.
</P>
<P>
   Botsford and his family travel to Europe only occasionally, so
they discovered their buying advantage only after arriving for
their vacation. However, the favorable rate was the main attraction
to many more frequent
</P>
<P>
   international travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Winston, an Oklahoma attorney, and his wife decided on a
trip to Paris in May after concluding France was a bargain they
couldn't miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about going to South America or Hawaii but we had
been looking at the rates and decided that, what the heck, when are
we going to get a better deal in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe never. The travel industry says that this is the best time
in more than a decade to get value for dollars in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one would ever accuse the French capital of being
a haven for budget travelers, the new rates have at least taken
some of the sting out of asking for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Winston's room at the Hotel Cayre St. Germain was $192 a night
this year, compared to about $220 last year. Dinner at Jacques
Cagna's restaurant in the Latin quarter cost $135 for two this year
compared to
</P>
<P>
   about $160 last year. For their 10-day visit in Paris, Winston
expects to save as much as $1,200. ``That's money we're going to
spend on wine and clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Because few Americans follow currency rates very closely, it is
unlikely they'll suddenly stampede Europe, said Neil Martin of the
European Travel Commission. ``But it may encourage them to stay
longer or to shop more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 12 million Americans will invade Europe this summer
_ a record for the eighth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Britain, which is rarely a bargain, is a better deal. The
pound is about 8 cents cheaper at $1.52 than it was a year ago.
Britain is a member of the European Union, but has elected not to
participate in the unified
</P>
<P>
   currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good deals, Botsford wondered briefly if the
exchange rate wasn't maybe a bit too good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange rate was so good, I made the European shopkeepers
richer than I had planned to,'' Botsford said as he surveyed the
pile of shoes, shirts, wine, antique books, Belgian chocolates and
other goodies he
</P>
<P>
   and his wife bought in their shopping. ``Now I have to figure
out a way to get back to Atlanta with twice as much stuff as I
brought over here.''

 &HT;    AMERICAN TOURISTS FLOCK TO EUROPE AS VALUE OF THE EURO SLIPS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international, (l) lifestyles
and (f) financial categories.

   CALAIS, France _ Wandering a cavernous French mall, David
Botsford stops to study the polo shirts stacked on a table at the
entrance to a casual clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred francs _ how much is that?'' asks Botsford, the
president of an Atlanta marketing firm. He reads the sign saying
that he can buy two Celio sports shirts for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``About $30,'' answers his wife, Anita Sharpe, the co-founder of
an Internet media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' says Botsford, who steps into the shop to add to his
growing burden of bargains.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the same shirts would have cost him as much as $40
because the exchange rate then was less friendly to Americans
bearing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Botsford is shopping at the massive new ``hypermarket'' built in
Calais to attract shoppers from Britain, who bring their cars on
the train through the Eurotunnel to load up on bargains on the
generally cheaper continent.
</P>
<P>
   The discounts are made even more appealing these days because of
the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the cheaper prices is the fall of the euro, the
currency of 11 European Union nations. It was launched in January
1999 at a value of $1.16, but since has lost about a quarter of its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, the euro has hit a low of about 89
cents before recovering to about 96 cents this week. When the euro
falls, fewer U.S. dollars are needed to buy goods and services in
the euro zone, which
</P>
<P>
   includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Holland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   National currencies such as the franc, mark and lira are still
in circulation, but the exchange rates are tied to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Euro bank notes and coins are expected to enter circulation in
2002, gradually replacing national currencies.

   OPERA HOUSE-TEXAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For 26 seasons, busloads of tourists have
flocked to the Granbury Opera House to see its Broadway-style
musicals and spend a few bucks on the historic courthouse square.
But the Granbury landmark, which helped transform the town into a
tourist attraction, is now in trouble. The opera house is about
$60,000 in debt, and, unless grants or corporate contributors are
found, its future is tenuous, says Marty Van Kleeck, managing
director of the opera house. By BILL HANNA. Story has moved in

Then, suddenly, it all ended. ``At 34, he toppled from the throne
to the political graveyard,'' said a 1972 Dallas Times Herald
editorial. ``Richard Nixon once came back from sound defeat, but no
one, at this point, can figure the future of the fallen young white
knight, Ben Barnes.'' Nearly three decades later, both Nixon and
the Times Herald are long gone. But Barnes, Texas' youngest
lieutenant governor at age 30, whose career in elective politics
was grounded by the 1971 Sharpstown scandal and his life rocked by
a 1987 personal bankruptcy, is again making his presence felt at

IDIOTS AS CONTRIVED AS ANY COMMERCIAL CINEMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 OUR GRADE: C  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a bizarre commune/radical therapy workshop, middle class
rebel wannabes attempt to break through the soul deadening effects
of modern society by pretending to be retarded. They call this
regression ``spassing'' and supposedly it's a road toward something
primal, pure and authentic.
</P>
<P>
   They take this show on the road like guerrilla performance art,
using it to provoke their audience, to expose the phoniness of
society or simply to extort money from unsuspecting bystanders.
Into his happy band of idiots wanders Karen (Bodil Jorgensen), a
sad, shrinking woman who becomes their quiet but caring mother hen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Idiots'' is Lars von Trier's (``Breaking the Waves'')
Dogma 95 entry. Dogma 95, if you haven't heard, is the Danish
manifesto supposed to save cinema from the contrivances of
commercial filmmaking via a rigorous set of conditions imposed on
its signatories. Von Trier either misses the point or doesn't
really care, for in ``The Idiots'' he turns the supposedly
liberating aesthetics of handheld camerawork, improvisational
performance and ``live'' filmmaking into something just as
contrived as the films he defies.
</P>
<P>
   The public performances are played as slapstick pageants, mining
easy laughs from the disturbed and uneasy reactions of their
hapless targets as if this reveals some flaw in them, and then the
director points his finger at the perpetrators for their
fraudulence. At the center is Stoffer (Jens Albinus), less a guru
than an angry new age tyrant happily manipulating his audiences and
his own drooling followers.
</P>
<P>
   The creepy and increasingly insensitive ``therapy,'' the copious
amounts of gratuitous nudity, and the in-your-face orgy are less
transgressive statements than sour moments of bald exploitation. In
the censored version released in stateside by USA Films, it's
ultimately ineffective: dancing black bars obscure copulation and
male genitalia (while leaving most female nudity alone _ but that's
our own American double standard). This post-production addition
was made with von Trier's approval to give this film an R rating _
as if this might play beyond the art-house circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the film, the two youngest members of the community
unleash bottled up feelings and express themselves through
``spassing'' in ways they never could through words, and in the
climax Karen spits out a speechless response to the life that has
nearly extinguished her soul. For those few minutes, the film
connects with its characters in a pure and honest (if a tad
overwrought) immediacy, but it's too little too late.
</P>
<P>
   Von Trier is far more hypocritical than his straw figure
characters, and for all his attempts to shock and affront the
audience he's simply too cynical and insincere to be provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The Idiots. Directed and written by Lars von Trier. Cast: Jens
Albinus, Bodil Jorgensen, Louise Hassing, Troels Lyby. USA Films.
115 minutes. Rated R for nudity and sex (with much of both obscured
by black bars). In Danish with English subtitles.

`SUNSHINE': SERVING THE EMPIRE, ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ...  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About half an hour into ``Sunshine,'' the first of three
characters played by Ralph Fiennes raises a glass to toast the
passage of time. ``Long live the 20th century!'' he cries, which
is, when you think about it, a profoundly illogical thing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's entirely wrong: the century, or at least one
Hungarian Jewish family's experience of it, from the twilight of
empire to the fall of communism, is the subject of Istvan Szabo's
churning, sometimes clumsy, often thought-provoking _ and decidedly
long _ film. It follows in the footsteps of movies like Visconti's
``Leopard'' and Bertolucci's ``1900,'' epics that aspired to match
the sprawl and capaciousness of classic novels and to show, at once
panoramically and intimately, the process of historical change.
</P>
<P>
   This is never an easy thing to do, and Szabo, working from a
script he wrote with the American playwright Israel Horovitz,
attempts it with minimal subtlety, priming his enormous canvas with
big, cartoonish sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict this will be a century of love, justice and
tolerance,'' Fiennes' character, a rising star of the
Austro-Hungarian judicial system named Ignatz Sonnenschein,
declares after his toast. You don't need to know much about the
last hundred years _ just that they were characterized by an awful
lot of hatred, injustice and intolerance _ to grasp the irony. But
fortunately, and thanks largely to Fiennes, Jennifer Ehle and
Rosemary Harris, the film pulls away from such obviousness and
views the lethal unreason of the past hundred years with gravity,
humor and, most remarkably, with something like sanity.
</P>
<P>
   The first third of the film, which sprints from Ignatz's
19th-century childhood to his death in 1930, doesn't have much time
for nuance. Most of the action takes place at the Sonnenschein
dinner table, which stoically endures being pounded and stormed
away from during the passionate arguments that seem to erupt at
every meal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tsoris is caused by the smoldering passion between
Ignatz and his adopted sister Valerie (Ehle), who is really his
cousin and who will eventually be his wife (and then, since Fiennes
plays both their son and grandson, his mother and his grandmother).
When they aren't provoking family fights, Ignatz and Valerie steal
away for dreamy, heavy-breathing, soft-focus sex, followed by
earnest pillow talk. ``When I'm lying in your arms, I feel like
I've come home,'' Ignatz whispers. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonnenschein household, overseen by plump, good-hearted
parents who migrated to Budapest from the countryside and made a
fortune selling an herbal elixir called Sunshine, is dominated by a
quasi-incestuous love triangle involving Valerie, Ignatz and his
younger brother Gustave. Their relationship is further complicated
by political differences that erupt, all of a sudden, in a scene of
speechifying melodrama shortly before the assassination of Archduke
Ferdinand. Gustave is a socialist, his brother a steadfast believer
in the empire's brand of liberal multiculturalism, while their
sister turns out to be a budding Hungarian nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   This scene, and many others in the film, is both underdeveloped
and overdone, as though Szabo, in his rush to interpret the history
of Central Europe, couldn't be bothered to dramatize it. The sets
are there _ the complacent bourgeois opulence of the Sonnenschein
apartments, the haughty grandeur of Budapest's cafes and
governmental palaces _ but he never slows down enough to capture
the texture and rhythm of daily life. For all the shouting and
panting, the Sonnenschein family story feels more like a collage of
ideas, events and metaphors than something lived.
</P>
<P>
   But it must be said that the ideas are interesting, the
metaphors occasionally inspired and some of the events
unforgettably powerful. Just as history, properly understood, is
more than just one darn thing after another, so ``Sunshine''
manages, as a whole, to transcend the crude melodrama of its
individual scenes. The stagy political shouting match on the eve of
World War I turns out to be the key to Szabo's understanding of the
20th century. He imagines socialism, nationalism and imperial
liberalism as siblings, born out of an essentially decent,
meliorist 19th-century impulse, and all vulnerable to horrifying
moral corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Several of this Hungarian director's earlier films _ notably
``Mephisto'' (1981) and ``Colonel Redl'' (1985) _ dealt with the
exemplary modern agonies, especially acute in Central Europe in the
middle decades of the 20th century, of decent men driven to
compromise with evil. ``Sunshine'' is a triptych of such stories,
each one displaying Fiennes, with different facial hair and altered
ideological coloration, caught in the pincers of history.
</P>
<P>
   Small compromises lead to big disasters: Ignatz, anxious to
advance his career, changes the family name from Sonnenschein to
the more Hungarian-sounding Sors. His son Adam converts to
Christianity to gain admittance to Budapest's most exclusive
fencing club. He becomes the national fencing champion and leads
his team to the 1936 Olympics but succumbs to the temptations of
snobbery, anti-Semitism and acquiescence to dictatorship. As it
follows Adam's rise and fall, the film begins to breathe a little
more, and Fiennes comes out of himself, acting with the fierce
insouciance that is his best, and often neglected, attribute.
</P>
<P>
   In the next generation Fiennes' flair turns into rage, as he
portrays Adam's son Ivan, who becomes, after World War II, a member
of the Communist secret police out of blind, vengeful rage at the
fascists who destroyed his family. The contours of Hungarian
history from 1939 to 1956, when Soviet tanks crushed an incipient
revolution, is well known, but I'll refrain from revealing the
particulars of the Sors-Sonnenschein family saga.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ivan confronts his own crisis of conscience, the
movie has accumulated sufficient power and momentum to erase the
memory of its earlier awkwardness. It shows such sympathy for its
characters, and approaches its subject with such intelligence, that
it's easy to forgive the clumsy editing, the haphazard insertion of
black-and-white newsreels, and the hyperventilating sexual ardor
that seems to be a Sors family curse.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of it all, the film leaves you with a sense of quiet,
chastened grace, as embodied by the older Valerie, played by
Harris, who is Ehle's real-life mother (the two actresses might
share an Oscar, just as Fiennes might have to compete against
himself). ``She was the only one of us who had the gift of
breathing freely,'' her troubled grandson remarks, and
``Sunshine,'' at last, honors that gift.

   ``Big Momma's House''
</P>
<P>
   A cross between ``Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ``Kindergarten Cop,''
this enormously broad comedy casts Martin Lawrence as an FBI agent
who goes undercover as a cantankerous Southern granny. The
unoriginal romantic comedy also borrows from ``Tootsie'' and
``Jerry Maguire,'' though it lacks their humor and heart. Directed
by Raja Gosnell (''Never Been Kissed''), the nonsensical farce is
little more than a string of forced situations and crude gags.
Crude humor, sexual innuendo, profanity and some violence; 13 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hytner's Big-Apple ballet for teen-age girls,
highlighted by dancer Ethan Stiefel's presence, contains as much
soap-opera conflict as it does bruised feet. A tender romance
involving a premed student and earnest performances are
overshadowed by more cheese and ham than can be found in a New York
deli. Profanity, sexuality, mature themes; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's prehistoric adventure is the first film to combine
computer-animated characters with live-action backgrounds, putting
personified dinosaurs in photo-realistic settings. The visual
result is astonishing, but the story isn't anything you haven't
seen before. The simplistic tale of an iguanodon raised by lemurs
borrows elements from ``Bambi,'' ``Tarzan'' and ``The Lion King.''
Several intense scenes may be too frightening for small children.
Intense images; 6 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''
</P>
<P>
   This prequel to the critically panned 1994 live-action version
of the popular '60s cartoon is a lame chip off the ol' block. More
effort went into the colorful costumes and sets than into the
story, which finds young Fred vying for the affection of wealthy
heiress Wilma. Much of the humor is of the juvenile
pie-in-the-face, spit-take variety. Despite game performances,
especially Stephen Baldwin as Barney, ``Flintstones'' is hardly a
gay old time. Innuendo and brief profanity; 8 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency''
</P>
<P>
   This sci-fi thriller's premise about a young man who
communicates with his late father via ham radio is easy to buy
until the final 10 minutes. Then the gripping and emotional story
turns rote and sentimental, succumbing to fatal loopholes in its
time-shifting logic. Director Gregory Hoblit's tight cutting
between climactic events in different decades is hard to follow.
The crowd-pleasing finale is full of holes, once you stop to think
about it. Intense violence and disturbing images; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Scott's thrilling return to Hollywood historical epics is
a bloody, visceral adventure. As with ``Alien `` and ``Blade
Runner,'' Scott creates a convincing, richly detailed world. There
is much gory combat, depicted in hyper-realistic style. There is
also a star-making turn by Russell Crowe. Yet the deft tale of
heroism and intrigue is remarkably somber. The truly gripping
emotional drama doesn't arrive until the 154-minute film's second
half. Intense, graphic combat; 15 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gossip''
</P>
<P>
   This absurd suspense thriller about the havoc wreaked by a rumor
is the directorial debut of Davis Guggenheim (''ER''), yet the film
has all the hallmarks of executive producer Joel Schumacher, in
that it's overly stylized and heavily contrived. The far-fetched
melodrama piles one ludicrous plot twist upon another, stretching
the slight premise beyond all believability. The screenplay is
sketchy. The characters are spiteful, dumb or both. Sexual content
and language, brief violence; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping The Faith''
</P>
<P>
   Few would have expected intense young actor Edward Norton's
directorial debut to be a screwball romantic comedy. The
lighthearted tale involves a priest (Norton) and a rabbi (Ben
Stiller) who both fall in love with the same woman (Jenna Elfman).
Though it's too long at 129 minutes _ an eternity for a comedy _
``Keeping the Faith'' is a sweet, funny film that is heavy on
slapstick and sight gags. There are lots of chuckles and some solid
laughs. Some sexuality and profanity; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious follow-up to ``Boogie Nights''
is a riveting family drama that has the epic scope of a grand
opera, encompassing a dozen major characters and nine
interdependent plot lines. The visually dazzling film addresses the
role of chance in life, and it marks Anderson as the most audacious
director of his generation. However, some viewers may find it
difficult to endure. (1/7) Strong profanity, drug use, sexuality,
some violence; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2''
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to the befuddling 1996 blockbuster plays like a
James Bond film without the wit or charm. After a brisk start, the
story settles into a long period of sluggish exposition in which
bland hero Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) personal feelings complicate
his otherwise simple mission. The balletic action for which
director John Woo is known doesn't arrive until the final 40
minutes, and the far-fetched stunt sequences are impossible to
swallow. Intense sequences of violent action, some sensuality; 13
and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Morris' best-selling memoir about his childhood canine
gets a sugary coating from director Jay Russell, whose well-meaning
adaptation slathers on warm photography and a patriotic score. A
nostalgic, innocuous slice of 1940s Mississippi, made digestible by
young star Frankie Muniz. Mild profanity, fleeting violence; 8 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reindeer Games''
</P>
<P>
   Originally slated for release on Christmas, when its holiday
setting would have made a lot more sense, this preposterous
thriller stars Ben Affleck as a clueless ex-convict forced to
mastermind a casino robbery. The ridiculous story is as hard to
swallow as 2-month-old eggnog. It's all just buildup for the
explosive and extremely bloody heist sequence, in which the robbers
shoot it out wearing Santa Claus costumes. Strong violence,
profanity, sexuality; 17 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return To Me''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hunt's amusing directorial debut turns on a convenient
twist of fate. A widower (David Duchovny) falls in love with a
waitress (Minnie Driver), unaware that she has received his late
wife's transplanted heart. The contrived premise could only happen
in the movies. Hunt's sweet, simplistic romantic comedy is
predictable but entertaining. Its whimsical blend of humor and
drama is carried by snappy dialogue and an appealing cast.
Profanity, mature themes; 10 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian comic Tom Green ignites this ``American Pie''-style
tale involving a college student who, with three classmates,
ventures south to block the delivery of a videotape he
inadvertently sent to his Austin, Texas-based girlfriend. It's a
raunchy, sometimes funny, mostly ludicrous romp that you might
expect from the director of ``Frat House.'' Profanity, sexuality,
nudity, fleeting violence; 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo Must Die''
</P>
<P>
   Wherefore art thou, Romeo? Chained and suspended upside-down by
one leg from a rope in a Hong Kong prison cell, where he
impressively overpowers four armed guards to make a thrilling
escape. It's not Shakespeare, but the hip-hop action movie, which
marks Chinese martial-arts star Jet Li's first starring role in
English, is a major kick. Despite its title, the kinetic
crowd-pleaser is focused on supercharged action, not romance.
Violence, some profanity, brief nudity; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules Of Engagement''
</P>
<P>
   This military drama, about a Marine officer (Samuel L. Jackson)
who is court-martialed for allegedly breaking the rules of
engagement during a siege of a U.S. embassy in Yemen, is as full of
holes as the bullet-riddled embassy. Executive producer James Webb
reportedly removed his screenwriting credit from the film over
changes that were made to his script. The obvious, slow-moving and
illogical film is major hooey. War violence, profanity; 16 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screwed''
</P>
<P>
   This painfully unfunny farce stars Norm MacDonald as a
much-abused chauffeur who gets even with his cheap, nasty employer
by kidnapping her prized pooch and ransoming it for $1 million. The
slapstick comedy of errors is intended to be in the zany tradition
of the Marx Brothers' movies, but there's little connection. The
humor is crude and mean-spirited. The sight gags are disgusting and
bloody. Crude and sex-related humor, nudity, profanity and some
violence; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon''
</P>
<P>
   Asian action star Jackie Chan turns cowboy in this
cross-cultural action comedy, set in the Old West. The highly
entertaining, East-meets-West mix of martial arts and punch lines
is unabashedly silly, but it's also hilarious. The film draws big
laughs from cultural-barrier gags, as well as from skewering
Western movie cliches. Chan has terrific chemistry with comic
sidekick Owen Wilson, who delivers a breakthrough performance.
Action violence, some drug humor, profanity and sensuality; 12 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls''
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to be a bonehead not to have ``The Skulls'' figured
out in a matter of minutes. The teen thriller has an enticing
premise about secret societies at Ivy League colleges, where future
leaders are molded, but there's never any secret where its story is
heading. The paranoid conspiracy thriller plays like a bush-league
version of The Firm, becoming increasingly ridiculous. Violence,
brief sexuality; 13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks''
</P>
<P>
   This modestly amusing farce about bumbling would-be bank robbers
appears to be inspired by ``The Honeymooners,'' with diminutive
writer-director Woody Allen in the Ralph Kramden role. Touted as a
return to the slapstick style of his early films, the surprisingly
lowbrow effort offers a few chuckles but no big laughs. The
eccentric characters are tiresome, and the erratic rags-to-riches
story is as tedious as endless sitcom reruns. Profanity; 10 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571''
</P>
<P>
   This rousing World War II submarine adventure about a Navy
mission to capture a Nazi coding device delivers almost nonstop
action. However, you won't need the ``Enigma'' machine to decipher
the film's story. The characters and conflicts are established in
fast, broad strokes. Heavy foreshadowing lays the foundation for
the predictable but exciting climax. Though the course is simply
plotted, ``U-571'' is a fairly thrilling adventure. War violence;
13 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides''
</P>
<P>
   The impressive feature directorial debut of Sofia Coppola,
daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, is a darkly amusing and deeply
poignant look at five troubled teen sisters in 1970s Michigan. The
engrossing story of the beautiful but doomed Lisbon girls unfolds
in flashback, narrated by a now-adult neighborhood boy who was one
of several obsessed with the sisters. Coppola's approach is assured
and heartfelt, but her scripting is uneven. Strong thematic
elements involving teens; 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes''
</P>
<P>
   The title says it all, as this teen-targeting romantic comedy
attempts to modernize Cyrano de Bergerac with a parade of unlikely
circumstances, sexual innuendo and hackneyed byplay. David Raynr
directs with good-hearted intention, but he negates it with corny
cliches and a finale that's crazier than the dickens. Profanity,
sexuality; 14 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where The Heart Is''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams' Southern-fried soap opera, starring Natalie
Portman as a pregnant 17-year-old abandoned by her beau, alternates
between daffiness and overzealous heart-tugging. Among those
befriending the teen, we get compelling turns from Stockard
Channing and James Frain, but hot air from Ashley Judd's unwed
player, who, despite giving birth to four kids (and counting) looks
unblemished and fit as a fiddle. Profanity, sexuality, mature
themes; 14 and older.

 &HT;    `60 Seconds' a hot-wired thrill ride
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Stealing 50 premium automobiles in 72 hours.
It sounds like the latest television game-show stunt, but instead
it is the action-heavy high concept for a glossy summer caper
picture from producer Jerry Bruckheimer (''The Rock,''
``Armageddon''). Set the stopwatch, jimmy the locks, clip the alarm
cords, jump-start the engine, and away we go.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' a remake of a relatively unheralded
1974 flick, goosed up with an A-list cast and some terrific stunt
driving, as well as a completely superfluous explanation of why
former master car booster Memphis Raines (Nicolas Cage) would be
snapped back into a life of grand theft larceny. We don't really
care about Raines' conflicted emotions, just get on with the
thievery already.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is fully an hour into ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' with
48 hours elapsed in the plot, before Raines and his accomplices
swipe the first car on his hit list. Before that, he broods over
whether to risk his new, law-abiding way of life to save his
screw-up younger brother, Kip, from certain death. Yeah, right,
like Raines is going to weigh his options, decide not to steal the
cars and the movie will end with a message about not breaking the
law. How would that get teenage boys to shell out their lawn-mowing
money?
</P>
<P>
   We all know where the movie is going and that it has to lead to
a precision-slick crime spree, which we'll be rooting for all the
way. But first, director Dominic Sena (''Kalifornia'') and
screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (''Con Air'') want us to care about
Raines and his Jean Valjean/Javert rivalry with tenacious police
detective Roland Castelbeck (Delroy Lindo). And to bite our nails
wondering whethera team of retired car thieves, led by Sara
``Sway'' Wayland (big-lipped Angelina Jolie, with
pseudo-dreadlocked blonde hair), will be reeled back in for Kip's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that when the car pilfering begins, it is
captured with such style and verve that it negates all the
foot-dragging. Candy-colored Corvettes, sturdy Mercedes-Benzes,
sleek Porsches and one particularly macho Mustang GT 500 are among
the quarry, all stolen in one night in a true ``Mission:
Impossible,'' right down to the fake fingerprints applied to avoid
any incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there is a fair amount of humor, as when a mangy,
iron-deficient dog swallows some high-tech car keys, is fed a
laxative and then has to be walked about until they travel through
his system. And we learn valuable information, like a car's vanity
plate ``SNAKE'' may not describe its owner but its cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, obtaining the required 50 stolen cars comes down to
Cage racing the clock and the cops in the Mustang, maneuvering
through the streets of Los Angeles, across the L.A. River basin and
onto the docks of Long Beach in a dizzyingly entertaining
high-speed chase, climaxed by a good ol' ``Dukes of Hazzard'' jump
to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Cage, who may never escape the action-adventure beat and get
back to acting, plays Raines with a single sullen expression and
attitude. Lindo throws in a bit more nuance as the cop who
begrudgingly shows his admiration for his worthy adversary. Robert
Duvall is his usual welcome wily self as Cage's mentor. In the only
female role of any consequence, Jolie gets her fingernails dirty
and has a near sexual encounter with Cage in a parked car but is
otherwise underutilized. So often after winning an Oscar (as Jolie
did for ``Girl, Interrupted''), an actor's next released movie is a
throwaway performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' however, is a high-performance vehicle.
It merely wants to put us in the driver's seat of some action
thrills, and that it delivers. The first hour could stand to be
edited down, but as summer movies go, this is an entertaining joy
ride.

PROCTER &AMP; GAMBLE CEO STEPS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Prices in last two grafs do not reflect market close)  
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Durk Jager, the 56-year-old chairman, president and chief
executive of consumer products giant Procter &AMP; Gamble (PG:NYSE),
will step down, effective immediately, the company announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lafley, a 23-year P&AMP;G veteran and of late the president of
the company's global beauty care division, was named the new CEO.
Former P&AMP;G CEO John Pepper will return from retirement to become
chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeup comes at a time of disappointing earnings for P&AMP;G,
which has failed to meet analysts' expectations for six of the last
eight quarters, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Deutsche
Banc Alex Brown. While the company characterized Jager's departure
as voluntary retirement, Shore said the writing was on the wall.
``And like a good Japanese soldier, he probably fell on his
sword,'' Shore said. ``Someone had to take the fall.'' Shore has a
neutral rating on P&AMP;G, and his firm has not performed underwriting
on behalf of the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with the media and analysts, the company,
the maker of such ubiquitous consumer products as Crest toothpaste,
Pringles potato chips and Folgers coffee, announced the move at the
same time it warned Wall Street that its earnings will fall short
of forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had too much change, too fast,'' Lafley said. He said
P&AMP;G has ignored its core businesses -- such as fabrics and home
care -- while trying to expand into new areas. Lafley said P&AMP;G
scattered its spending across too many new products this year, and
plans to review the company's businesses over the next six weeks to
focus its resources on its core businesses and best new products.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it adopted more ambitious forecasting models,
Lafley said. ``We are going to have appropriate conservatism in our
plans to ensure we meet or beat our commitments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings-per-share growth will be flat for the current quarter,
he said. Previously, the company had forecast 15 percent to 17
percent earnings-per-share growth. This reflects lower volume
growth in fabric and home care, which will be in the low single
digits, according to Lafley. He said the company did a poor job of
marketing its products, and has developed a new ad program to
``target the consumer more sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session with analysts, P&AMP;G Chief
Financial Officer Clayton Daley said a divestiture of some of the
company's businesses is possible, but did not say specifically
which ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight quarter in which the Cincinnati,
Ohio-based company has been forced to announce that it would not
meet its volume targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not caught off guard,'' said William Steele, an
analyst who covers P&AMP;G for BofA Montgomery in San Francisco. He
said he never expected P&AMP;G to hit its 15 percent EPS prediction.
Steele has a market performer rating for P&AMP;G -- his firm has done
no underwriting -- and he doesn't expect to alter his
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   To assuage investors' fears that other consumer products
companies could similarly disappoint investors, Kimberly-Clark
(KMB:NYSE), maker of Kleenex, Pull-Ups and Huggies, announced that
it was on track with its earnings projections, according to Mike
Masseth, head of investor relations at the Dallas,based company.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble shares were down 5 3/8, or 9 percent, to 56 1/2
in afternoon trading Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly-Clark shares were trading down 7/16, or 1 percent, at
58 1/4.

REMAKE AIMED AT ROWDY MALE TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 OUR GRADE: C-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest over-produced, under-written summer action
extravaganza from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, ``Gone in 60
Seconds,'' is a movie that tries _ and mostly fails _ to make a
motley ring of Long Beach car thieves look exciting and glamorous
and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Plotwise, it's a fairly accurate remake of a 1974 drive-in
exploitation movie that has retained a minor cult following among
action fans for its nicely executed 40-minute car chase _ still an
industry record _ and the fact that its director-star, H.B.
Halicki, was killed in the process of making it.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the Bruckheimer tradition of ``Con Air,'' ``The Rock''
and ``Armageddon,'' this retread has been bloated far beyond its
B-movie origins, beefed up with more characters and an all-star
cast, stripped of any real suspense and loaded down with music cuts
and one-liners aimed at pleasing a crowd of rowdy male teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Its hero is ``Memphis'' Raines (Nicolas Cage), the now-retired
and gone-straight king of the California car thieves who, to save
the life of his younger brother (Giovanni Ribisi), is pressed into
the service of a loathsome gangster for a near-impossible task:
stealing 50 luxury cars in one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Without too much hesitation or soul-searching, he gathers up his
former team of thieves, now all retired and honest citizens _
including his aging mentor (Robert Duvall), ex-girlfriend (Angelina
Jolie) and sidekick comic relief (Chi McBribe) _ and gets down to
business.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's all screeching tires, revving engines and
crunching metal as he struggles to meet his deadline (with an
annoying on-screen clock occasionally appearing to count down the
time for us) while a dedicated and endlessly frustrated Long Beach
police detective (Delroy Lindo) remains hot on his trail.
</P>
<P>
   The carefully selected teenage audience at the Seattle preview
earlier this week seemed to eat the movie up, howling at every gag
and cheering wildly at every bent fender. Car buffs will also enjoy
the film's numerous references to car culture and an ongoing
classic-car trivia game played by the thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else is likely to find this movie surprisingly
unexciting. The characterizations are broad and clumsy, the
character motivations are so slight the film has zero narrative
interest, and the car chases staged by novice feature director (but
rock video veteran) Dominic Sena display no particular originality
or imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer has obviously paid some big salaries, but his cast
is lackluster and the film serves as an even worse star vehicle.
Cage's sanctimonious character is absurd and dull, Duvall walks
through his role on automatic pilot and Jolie just stands around
with a matted hairdo that makes her look amazingly like John
Travolta in ``Battlefield Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone in 60 Seconds. Directed by Dominic Sena. Screenplay by
Scott Rosenberg. Cast: Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina
Jolie, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, Christopher Eccelston.
Touchstone. 119 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

 &HT;    MIGRAINES BETTER UNDERSTOOD BUT STILL GO UNTREATED
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Researchers are rapidly learning to understand the
causes of migraines, but millions of victims fail to receive new
drugs that can reduce the frequency and severity of these painful
headaches, experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 28 million Americans who suffer from migraines,
between 5 and 6 million experience an average of three days of
disability per month, said Dr. Richard B. Lipton, a professor of
neurology at Albert Einstein Medical School in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those people could benefit from a new class of drugs that can
prevent most migraine attacks, said Dr. Lipton. Yet only about 1
million actually take the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A second class of prescription drugs provides relief from pain
and other effects of the headaches, but most migraine sufferers do
not take these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lipton is among a small group of neurologists from medical
schools around the country attending a government-sponsored
conference here this week to develop ``educational materials'' to
help primary care physicians better deal with migraines.
</P>
<P>
   He said a recent survey by the World Health Organization
concluded that an active migraine headache is one of the four most
disabling conditions known, along with severe psychosis, dementia
and quadriplegia, being paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite very striking advances in migraine treatment in recent
years, the majority of migraine suffers in the United States
continue to treat their headaches with over-the-counter medications
to the exclusion of prescription drugs,'' Lipton said. ``A large
segment of migraine sufferers who experience high levels of pain
would benefit from these treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, sponsored by the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke and several professional
societies, was being attended by around 25 researchers, said an
institute spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was to create brochures, CD-ROMs and other
``educational materials'' for doctors, she said. The cost of the
conference was underwritten by a drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lipton was among conferees who spoke with reporters about
new understanding and treatment of migraine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Welch of the University of Kansas Medical Center in
Kansas City said the development of noninvasive imaging equipment
has allowed scientists to observe the brains of migraine sufferers
during an attack and led to a revolution in understanding of the
condition in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Bright light might be a migraine trigger, he said, and a
migraine sufferer may have a variable ``threshold'' of
susceptibility to the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threshold gets too low and along comes a trigger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most migraines begin with a ``wave'' of neuro-electrical
activity that starts at the base of the brain and moves over the
top, he said. During this process, researchers have observed the
upper part of the brain sending ``messages'' to pain centers deep
inside, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, blood flow goes up, then drops rapidly in the
wake of the brain electrical ``wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he said, neurology researchers have realized that the
brains of persons who suffer from frequent migraines are being
changed, perhaps damaged, by the headaches themselves. Many develop
constant headache, he said.

MICROSOFT REQUESTS STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day after a federal judge ordered Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq)
split in two and restrictions placed on its business practices, the
software company requested a stay of the ruling Thursday and
prosecutors vowed to hurry the coming appeal along to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a Washington, D.C. news conference, Joel Klein, the
Justice Department's antitrust chief, predicted that the case could
end by early 2001 if the nation's highest court grants a review in
its next term. Otherwise, the court would remand the case to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A panel of
judges on that ideologically mixed appellate court overturned a
prior ruling adverse to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they prepared to move their war along to the next
battlefield, prosecutors and corporate officials made a pointed
effort to find common ground and leave the light on above the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, reaction to the historic but long-anticipated
judgment was muted. Microsoft's shares were trading down 1 1/8, or
2 percent, at 69 3/8 in Thursday afternoon trading, actually
marking an unusually stable day for the Redmond, Wash.-based
company's stock price as an unremarkable 36 million shares traded
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides expressed hope that the Supreme Court would expedite
the appeals process and said that they would prefer a settlement.
But neither showed signs of willingness to bend on the contentious
issue of breaking up the company. And the parties clashed over
staying the so-called conduct remedies, which consist mostly of
restrictions on Microsoft's interactions with computer and software
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final judgment, which Microsoft intends to appeal
promptly, will inflict grievous and irreparable harm on Microsoft,
its 35,000 employees, its millions of shareholders, its thousands
of business partners, and the tens of millions of consumers around
the world who rely on Microsoft's products,'' the company wrote in
documents requesting a stay, which it filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing portions of the ruling by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
Klein said a stay on the restrictions to Microsoft's business
practices should be denied. He said the company's practices could
cause additional and irreparable harm, citing the dynamic nature of
the software business and calling the proposed remedies
``straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should put those remedies in place, but it's very important
to get a final ruling before the United States Supreme Court,''
Klein said. Referring to William H. Gates, the company's chairman,
he continued: ``And I was quite pleased last night listening to Mr.
Gates, that he would like an expedited ruling as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jackson's recent attempts to pick up the pace of the
trial, which he has said are partially motivated by a desire to
allow appeals to begin, the time required for appeals is not known.
Provisions specific to antitrust law give the solicitor general,
and not the Justice Department's antitrust division, 15 days to
request that the Supreme Court immediately review the company's
appeal. (U.S. Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, an agent of the
Justice Department, is charged with arguing the government's cases
before the Supreme Court.) That would allow the government to
leapfrog the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said that after Microsoft's appeal is filed, ``we'' will
file a motion in federal district court requesting direct review by
the Supreme Court. Jackson must certify that motion, Klein said.
Though the company said in a court filing that it will appeal
``promptly,'' the judge has set no deadline for either party's next
logical filing.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he was unsure but thought the act allowing the
solicitor general to ask for direct high court review of antitrust
cases has only been used twice, both times in the government's
antitrust case against AT&AMP;T (T:NYSE), which resulted in a breakup.
Since the creation of the act, only the Microsoft and AT&AMP;T cases
have ended in structural remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In response to reporters' queries, Klein also expressed
confidence that the government will pursue Microsoft after the
change of executive administrations. He noted that the AT&AMP;T case
was filed during the Republican Nixon administration, prosecuted
during the Democratic Carter administration and settled during the
Republican Reagan administration despite vocal opposition to a
breakup being expressed by President Reagan's secretaries of
Commerce and Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Klein also said a settlement is the ``preferred course.''
Settlement negotiations in the case fell through April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the interest of the industry, it's in the interest of
the company and it's in the national interest to have Microsoft
address, in a meaningful way, the competitive issues that animated
the case and that the court found, and for people to go about their
business, rather than to have a protracted legal proceeding,'' he
said. He declined to elaborate on whether the Justice Department
would accept any sort of settlement that does not include a
breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The company was far more clear about its position on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is willing to consider any proposal that would
protect two core principles -- our freedom to innovate and the
integrity of our products,'' said Jim Cullinan, a company
spokesman. ``We will not consider breaking up the company because
it would not protect these principles and would cause significant
harm to Microsoft, our employees, the high-tech industry and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general and head of the group of
state attorneys general that joined the Justice Department in
requesting a breakup, said, ``The states are always willing to
enter into serious negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klein seemed to play down the stature of his litigation
partners, who held up a previous settlement by failing to reach a
consensus on whether to demand a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Gates ``seemed concerned that, because of the states' case, that
that would somehow prevent (the appeal) from going to the Supreme
Court,'' Klein said. ``But I can assure you that that would be no
prohibition whatsoever; the state case is consolidated with ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in any event, of course, if the Supreme Court were to rule
on our case, it would be the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled Wednesday that Microsoft should be split into two
separate companies to remedy antitrust violations and foster
competition in the markets for computer operating systems and
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   In harsh, scolding and distrustful language, Jackson conceded
that his judgment would anger the company's supporters, called his
own ruling worthy of appeal and said the company's arrogance left
him no choice but to throw a roadblock at Microsoft in the form of
a rushed judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, the linchpin of the ruling, would place the
ubiquitous Windows operating system in one company and create a
second business for everything else, including software
applications, the Internet Explorer Web browser and the Microsoft
Network Internet service provider and network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The behavioral remedies take effect within 90 days of a ruling.
These remedies include publishing the so-called source code used by
programmers to design software applications for Windows and placing
guidelines on Microsoft's relations with both computer makers and
other software companies.

   GREECE-TERROR (Athens, Greece) _ Britain's defense attache to
Greece was shot dead in the middle of Athens on Thursday in an
attack police said bore all the hallmarks of the shadowy Marxist
guerrilla organization, November 17. The killing, which British
Prime Minister Tony Blair described as ``a contemptible act of

<P>
   National Semiconductor (NSM:NYSE), developer of the next
generation system-on-a-chip microchip, surpassed expectations by 6
cents, aided by strong analog and wireless sales.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter ended May 28, the company reported net
earnings, excluding gains, of $134.2 million, or 68 cents a diluted
share, compared to a loss of $40 million, or 24 cents a share, a
year earlier. The consensus estimate of analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial was 62 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Including gains, National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara,
Calif., reported net earnings of $153.9 million, or 78 cents a
diluted share, compared to a loss of $783.5 million, or $4.65 a
share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The gains amounted to $19.7 million related to an overestimation
of restructuring costs for the disposal of Fairchild Semiconductor
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales rose to $595.3 million from $486 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A ``focus on execution drove our gross margins to 51 percent, up
from 48 percent in the previous quarter,'' said Brian Halla,
chairman, president and chief executive of National Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor makes analog, digital and mixed-signal (a
combination of analog and digital) integrated circuits that are
used in communications devices, networking equipment and
automobiles. The next generation microchip, system-on-a-chip,
combines a microprocessor and logic and memory components in one
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company were down 1/2, or 1 percent, at 63 5/8 in
Thursday afternoon trading.

GO.COM TO SELL CORPORATE NETWORKING UNIT TO INKTOMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (Prices at end do not reflect market close)  
 By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go.com (GO:NYSE), Walt Disney's (DIS:NYSE) Web tracking stock,
said Thursday that it has agreed to sell its corporate networking
subsidiary to Inktomi (INKT:Nasdaq) in a cash and stock deal valued
at $344.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move to unload the Ultraseek enterprise business, which
provides customizable search and navigation software to businesses
for their corporate intranet and extranet sites, is part of
Go.com's efforts to focus its business on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great little business, but it's not core to our
consumer Internet business,'' said Steve Wadsworth, Go.com's
president, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Go.com is in the midst of refashioning itself from a
general interest portal into an entertainment and leisure site to
take advantage of the strong vertical properties within the Disney
empire such as ABCNews.com and ESPN.com, Wadsworth said the company
would have divested Ultraseek either way. ``We would have reached
the same conclusion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood, Calif.-based company acquired Ultraseek as
part of its deal to buy Infoseek last year. Talks with Inktomi have
been ongoing for ``a couple of months,'' Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster City, Calif.-based Inktomi will acquire 100 percent of
the outstanding stock and assume all stock options of Ultraseek in
exchange for $3.5 million in cash and shares of Inktomi common
stock valued at $341.2 million. Of the total consideration, $317.5
million will be provided to Go.com, the companies said. Disney has
the option to liquidate its Inktomi shares fairly quickly, people
close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our move into the enterprise market sets the agenda for the
delivery of search and navigation software for intranet and
extranet sites,'' David Peterschmidt, president and CEO of Inktomi,
said in a statement. ``Ultraseek's proven technology and extensive
customer base makes it an excellent fit for our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi shares inched up 2 3/16, or 2 percent, to 131, in late
morning trading. Go.com rose 3/16, or 2 percent, to 12 1/2.

`AMERICAN PIMP': FROM BLAXPLOITATION STEREOTYPE TO MAN ON THE
STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any movie brash enough to put the word ``American'' in its title
is announcing its intention to make a sweeping statement about some
aspect of the national psyche. Putting together the words
``American'' and ``pimp'' sets off instant buzzers and creates huge
expectations for a provocative cinematic dialogue between
flag-waving righteousness and urban sleaze.
</P>
<P>
   But ``American Pimp,'' a terse, skillfully edited documentary by
the Hughes Brothers (Allen and Albert), doesn't live up to its
title. The movie, which the filmmakers researched for several
years, purports to uncover the realities behind the myths
surrounding those flamboyantly attired street hustlers who were
mainstays of 1970s blaxploitation films. But instead of shattering
or even seriously challenging those stereotypes, this breezy
montage of interviews with pimps of varying ages in several
American cities only reinforces them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pimps interviewed (all male and all black) are
obviously nicer to the women whose flesh they peddle than others
are. The movie bends over backwards to be nonjudgmental. But there
is simply no getting around the reality that urban, street-level
prostitution is a nasty game that exploits and degrades the women
who get caught up in it. The only scene in which the panderers and
prostitutes don't appear desperate beneath a surface bravado is a
brief visit to a whorehouse in Nevada, where prostitution is legal.
Here, the women have some choice about their sexual partners as
well as an economic stake in the business.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said a pimp's life is easy. As one man after another
tells his story, we hear complaints that pimps get no corporate
benefits or no health insurance or retirement plan. If they're
lucky enough to stay out of prison and have long careers on the
street, they might be able to retire in middle-class comfort. We
meet one man who married his last prostitute and retired from the
business to become a churchgoing family man. He seems to feel no
regrets about his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pimp'' proposes one fascinating theory about the
origins of the pimp stereotype. He arose, it is suggested, during
the days of slavery when enterprising black men on plantations
appointed themselves protective intermediaries between their wives,
daughters and sisters and the white slave owners who preyed on
them. But having been mentioned, the idea is never developed. A
more substantial movie would have dug up historical photographs,
drawings and texts and made at least a token effort to trace and
analyze this lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the movie prefers to examine the fashion choices of
pimps, like the fetish for alligator shoes. But here, too, its
attention span flags. The movie might have been much more revealing
had it been content to be a history of changing tastes in pimp
fashions. Exploring such a theme, it might have been possible to
find a sociological connection between style and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie illustrates, the iconography of pimp fashion is
nothing if not provocative in its fusion of designer-label chic,
cowboy machismo and the same sort of parody of European royalty
affected by Liberace (of all people!) and adopted and carried to
extremes of stage caricature by musicians like George Clinton. What
it amounts to, of course, is a grotesque, intentionally funny form
of ostentatious consumption, a parody of a capitalist excess. But
such flamboyance also has its uses. The pimps interviewed remind us
that all that flashy garb augmented with gold and jewelry is also a
professional ploy to attract women, because it is an announcement
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a man, the pimps interviewed cite money (some also
mention the freedom) as the motive for becoming a procurer. It's
certainly not the women whose flesh they peddle and to whom they
refer in crude anatomical slang. Although a couple of the women
interviewed say they feel loved and protected by their pimps,
during the one scene in which a pimp is interviewed with a woman
sitting on either side, both seem intimidated and speak haltingly,
with fear in their voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pimp'' would have been a much stronger movie had it
chosen only one or two pimps and seriously delved into their lives
and followed their financial and sexual transactions. But the movie
doesn't include a single scene of a pimp or a prostitute
interacting with a client. What we are left with is a mildly
entertaining ``man-on-the-street'' gloss, seasoned with fragments
from blaxploitation movies and music by Isaac Hayes, Marvin Gaye
and others. The mood built up by the film might almost be called
nostalgic.

 &HT;    KOSOVO PEACE IS FRAGILE ONE YEAR AFTER THE WAR
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REBELS
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, June 11
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia Shuttling drinks through his cafe full of
rollicking students, Veton Firzi, a dark-eyed 29-year-old Albanian
Kosovar, shouts his good news above the noontime din.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago my cafe was looted (by Serbs), and I raced out of
town with nothing before they could find me and kill me. Then
America came and won the war for us,'' Firzi declares, gesturing
toward the bustling cafes stretching down the cobblestone street in
this medieval town. ``Now look. People are home. We're free.''
</P>
<P>
   But the exuberance ends just around the corner from Fizri's
cafe. There, armored personnel carriers and NATO peacekeepers
nestled in sandbag bunkers guard a handful of Serb families
huddling in fear for their lives in Prizren's 500-year-old Orthodox
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like prison,'' says 27-year-old Tanja Filipovic, sitting
in the monastery's 50-square-foot courtyard, the music from Firzi's
cafe filtering over the stone walls. The distance between her and
the elated Firzi may be only 100 feet, but they are separated by an
giant chasm of fear and anger. ``If we leave, they (Albanians) will
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Kosovo, one year after the 50,000-strong NATO-led
peacekeeping force rolled into the province and ended a campaign by
Serb and Yugoslav authorities to wipe out its Albanian majority and
ethnically cleanse a whole people.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months into the peacekeeping mission, the basic rhythms
of life have returned here. But few people are naive enough to say
NATO's chief aim _ establishing a multi-ethnic society _ has been
achieved. At the same time, few officials are brave enough to say
this failure threatens the peacekeepers' mission or the region's
future stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foolish to say we've achieved peace already,'' says
Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations' highest-ranking civilian in
Kosovo. ``Reality is more complex in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   When NATO soldiers and armor first rumbled into Kosovo June 12,
1999, they passed a desolate landscape of empty towns, shops with
broken windows and burned and destroyed houses. Now the roads are
clogged with with shoppers, 18-wheelers transporting food and
construction materials and sleek Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 800,000 Albanians chased from their towns by Serb
forces have returned home. Most of the 100,000 homes destroyed by
looting paramilitaries have been rebuilt. Farmers are returning to
fields cleared of land mines. Water and electricity have been
restored thanks to the United Nations and other aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, is paying teachers,
doctors and other civil administrators with funds donated mostly by
European nations. America's NATO allies agreed to foot most of the
bill for Kosovo's reconstruction after the United States paid the
lion's share of the military costs to end the Serb onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   For 8-year-old Ibrahim, Firzi's blue jean-wearing cousin, the
telltale sign that life has not only returned to normal but
improved is that he has a chance to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My (older) brother never got to go to college. The Serbs
wouldn't let him,'' Ibrahim said, showing off his new
Albanian-language textbook purchased with a grant from the Danish
government. ``Now, my teachers say I can be a doctor if I want
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's newfound hopes are a tribute to both the remarkable
outpouring of international aid and an extraordinary level of
cooperation between governments and international humanitarian
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no small achievement, that hundreds of organizations
are working together and that except for a bit of politics at the
top, we have revived whole portions of the society,'' said Dominic
Larismont, a European Union spokeswoman in Kosovo. ``We're
committed to making this work, no matter how long it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this largely exemplary record has not erased bitter
memories, or the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Shootings and other revenge attacks by Albanians against Serbs _
such as a drive-by shooting in late May that killed a 4-year-old
Serb child _ compound the already strained relations between the
two communities.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians make up more than 90 percent of the region's
population and Serbs an estimated 5 percent, but no official
statistics have been compiled since the war.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations believes some 150,000 Kosovar Serbs have left
their homes in the last year to move to Serbia, with many saying
they are afraid to remain in Kosovo. For those who remain, like
Nebojsa Ivanovic and his family, life is a series of well-guarded
moments.
</P>
<P>
   From the family apartment in Pristina, Ivanovic's children are
bused with a NATO military escort to a village outside the capital,
where Serb children from throughout the region gather for school
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, a 53-year-old athletic-looking former professor, must
take two soldiers with him to the one market in his neighborhood
that will serve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live like in a ghetto,'' he said. ``Our entire life is in
this apartment and around this building.''
</P>
<P>
   Many officials say anger toward Serbs simmers because no court
has yet tried a case linked to alleged atrocities committed by
Serbs during the war.
</P>
<P>
   There is no final count of the dead from the war. Scholars at
the University of Bordeaux in France have estimated that some 9,000
people died in the 18 months from February 1998, when fighting
erupted between the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and Serbian
security forces, and June of 1999, when a 78-day bombing campaign
by NATO led to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague has reports
of more than 11,000 bodies buried in 500 mass graves. But in
exhuming some of the graves, investigators have often found fewer
bodies than alleged.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't ease Bajram Redzepi's rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of our men were killed, women (were) raped (and )
children watched their brothers and sisters tortured at the hands
of the Serb police. These people must be found guilty. If they
aren't, then Albanian frustration will grow and extremists will
target all Serbs as evil,'' said Redzepi, a former KLA rebel. He
now leads the Albanian population in Mitrovica, a town in northern
Kosovo divided, like Cold War-era Berlin, between Serb and Albanian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs like Tanja Milenkovic say a priority for her community is
a working justice system for the whole province, one that reduces
Serb distrust of the international community and corrects their
perception that Western countries favor Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will happen to the killer of this child?'' she asked
tearfully, referring to the drive-by shooter. ``He is a monster if
he thinks a baby was responsible for the war.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials admit they have delayed potentially explosive war
crimes trials in Mitrovica because they fear mass protests. They
worry they cannot guarantee security for either the international
judges who will be hearing cases or the witnesses called to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to give both Albanians and Serbs a stake in running
Kosovo, the United Nations set up two administrative councils last
year. The start-up has been rough. The Serbs walked out of the
project in September to protest Albanian violence and only agreed
to return in April.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build on that momentum, U.N. officials have eagerly
pressed for local elections to help patch up relations and
consolidate their progress so far. In the past month, posters have
appeared on walls around the province urging people to register for
the vote in elections tentatively set for this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first step toward democracy-building,'' Lord
Robertson, the NATO general secretary, told reporters on a May 31
visit to Kosovo. ``People have to take part.''
</P>
<P>
   But a fresh round of violence has again aroused suspicions. Serb
leaders, angry over an upsurge in attacks against their communities
ahead of the one-year anniversary of the peacekeeping mission,
announced on June 5 another boycott of all local administrative
organizations and intimated they might stay away from the
elections, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who doubt that elections will do anything even
if they are held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elections are a flag for the U.N. to raise to the world and
say the mission is not a complete failure,'' said Oliver Ivanovic,
the Serb leader in Mitrovica. ``Elections will just be window
dressing covering the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the suggestions that Kosovo is returning to some
semblance of normalcy, it is the seething indignation of Serbs like
Ivanovic and Albanians like Redzepi that are reminders of how
quickly NATO's accomplishments of the past year could come
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   William Nash, a retired U.S. Army general who led American
peacekeepers in Bosnia in 1995, acknowledges that the persistence
of animosity could unsettle all the efforts for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of war doesn't mean the existence of peace,'' said
Nash, who now runs the U.N. mission in Kosovo's divided city of
Mitrovica. ``We've got to realize it will take years to erase the
hatred they've built up.''

A CANDLE OF HEROISM IN FRANCE'S DARK NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France, Germany, Israel)   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tiny village of Chabannes, in the Creuse region of central
France, is a quiet, obscure place, one of those corners of rural
Europe that seem strangely untouched by the modern world. But 60
years ago Chabannes confronted 20th-century European brutality at
its worst, and responded with unusual courage and humanity. The
village served as a haven for nearly 400 Jewish children _ most of
them refugees from Germany and Austria _ whom its citizens
protected from the Nazis and from the betrayal of their own
collaborationist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Children of Chabannes,'' a documentary opening Friday in
New York (it will also be shown on Sunday evening on the HBO
Signature channel), was made by Lisa Gossels and Dean Wetherell;
Gossels' father and uncle were among the rescued children. Inspired
by her father's stories, and by a 1996 reunion of the children and
their protectors, Gossels has constructed a moving record of the
unassuming, uncompromising heroism of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   The children were brought to Chabannes by a Jewish
social-service organization, Ouvre de Secours aux Enfants, and
housed at the local chateau. Their sanctuary was administered by
Felix Chevrier, whose stubbornness and charisma make him a powerful
presence in the film, even though he died in 1962. Chevrier, a
Freemason, was also a staunch embodiment of the French republican
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   His adherence to the enlightenment tenets of universalism and
human rights was shared by many of the villagers, for whom the
embrace of endangered foreigners was an essentially patriotic act.
His eloquent, sarcastic letters to the local authorities, read
aloud by one of his old friends, are nearly as powerful as the
singing of ``La Marseillaise'' in ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevrier, who recorded the children's activities in journals and
photographs, managed to ensure the survival of his charges even
when the Vichy government began rounding up Jews for deportation to
the Nazi camps. He was aided by Reine and Renee Paillassou, local
schoolteachers now in their 80s, whose pluck is still evident, and
by the tough, pragmatic members of the Jewish organization.
</P>
<P>
   At enormous personal risk they managed to create something like
a normal life, with daily calisthenics, mushroom-hunting trips into
the forest (where they would later hide from the police) and
lessons taught with proper Gallic rigor. The surviving children,
most of whom live in the United States and France, look back on
their time in Chabannes with fondness and amazement. The Chabannais
preserved not only their lives but, more remarkably, their
childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The survival of a few hundred children hardly mitigates the
horror of the Holocaust, and this comparatively happy tale can only
be understood with reference to the horrors of its context. These
have been documented in epochal, large-scale films like ``Shoah''
and ``The Sorrow and the Pity.'' But the cinematic fulfillment of
the imperative to remember has more recently been taken up in
smaller, more individuated acts of commemoration. ``Children of
Chabannes,'' an honest, careful film, is a fine example of this
tendency.

FILMMAKER RETURNS TO HIS COMEDIAN ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 OUR GRADE: B-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Takeshi Kitano has been the one true phenomenon of Japanese
filmmaking in the '90s _ an ex-stand-up comedian and minor actor
(``Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence'') who transformed himself into a
tough-guy icon in a series of critically acclaimed, art house
Yakuza movies (``Violent Cop,'' ``Sonatine''). In his new offering,
``Kikujiro'' _ which, like the others, he wrote, directed and
(under the name ``Beat'' Takeshi) stars in _ he returns to his
comedy roots. He plays his standard deadpan, ultra-violent and
abusive character primarily for laughs in a sappy and enjoyable, if
often uncomfortably edgy, coming-of-age road comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is a henpecked, mostly retired Yakuza thug
whose wife coerces him into baby-sitting a neighborhood child: a
gloomy, fatherless little boy whose mother long ago abandoned him
to the care of his grandmother, and who has no friends and little
to do in his summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kikujiro has no use for the kid, but gradually he
warms to him and they become a mismatched team as he takes the boy
on a journey across the island of Honshu to reunite him with his
mother: an eventful trip in which they run into a variety of
colorful characters and have a series of bonding adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the film does not completely work and it has one rather
shockingly unnecessary scene in which the child is molested in the
park by an elderly gay monster. Indeed, this one scene seems to
have cost Takeshi his status as the darling of the critics: The
film's recent New York opening got uniformly scathing reviews and
Entertainment Weekly gave it a rare ``F'' grade.
</P>
<P>
   But this seems a massive over-reaction. Much of this movie is
very funny, it has some genuinely endearing moments, Takeshi comes
up with some imaginative little stylistic flourishes and his star
power carries the narrative along nicely. New York critics or no,
the upscale audience at its Seattle International Film Festival
appearance earlier this week seemed to enjoy it immensely.
</P>
<P>
   Kikujiro. Directed and written by Takeshi Kitano. Cast: ``Beat''
Takeshi, Ysuke Sekiguchi, Kayoko Kishimoto. Sony Pictures Classics.
Guild 45th. 116 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. Rated
PG-13 for violence and one child molesting scene.

`CINEMA VERITE': DOCUMENTARIANS BECOME TALKING HEADS FOR A CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The typewriter,'' goes a dated piece of verse by D.J. Enright,
``is creating a revolution in poetry.'' The digital video camera,
we have been hearing lately, is having the same effect on
filmmaking. Cheap, portable, easy to use, the new technology puts
cinematic expression in reach of the masses. At a recent
documentary festival, everyone I spoke to seemed to come up with
the same analogy: the camera has become less like a printing press
and more like a pencil, something you can grab hold of when the
mood strikes, and use to transform your impressions into art.
</P>
<P>
   The camera as pencil is a new twist on an old idea, the
``camera-stylo,'' a phrase coined by the French ethnologist and
filmmaker Jean Rouch, who also invented the term cinema verite, now
the title of an informative documentary by Peter Wintonick. Is
cinema verite a style or a movement? A technique or a philosophy?
Or is it, as Frederick Wiseman, one of its great avatars, suggests,
a piece of ``pretentious and pompous'' French jargon?
</P>
<P>
   Cinema verite is the preferred English term for what the French
like to call direct cinema, and is itself a translation of Kino
Pravda, a movement dreamed up in 1919 by the early Soviet director
Dziga Vertov. One of the peculiarities of film history is that what
might seem to be the movie camera's most obvious power _ the
capacity to record reality as it unfolds _ should require theories,
manifestoes and a specialized, multilingual vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   It has also demanded, and inspired, technological innovations.
Decades before the coming of High 8 and digital video,
shoulder-mounted cameras and synchronized sound gave filmmakers the
opportunity to wade into the jostle and unpredictability of daily
life, which they recreated in the tranquillity of the editing room.
</P>
<P>
   Wintonick's film, which opens Friday in New York, gamely
revisits the epistemological quandaries that have always troubled
documentarians. He also talks to younger filmmakers who have
adapted the hand-held, in-the-moment aesthetic to make music
videos, fictional television shows and of course ``The Blair Witch
Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way some old, still urgent philosophical questions are
broached: Does the camera see the world or imagine it? Does the
story belong to the people behind the camera or the ones in front
of it? Is there any truth in cinema verite?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: There is very little cinema verite in
``Cinema Verite,'' which is a sprightly collage of talking-head
interviews and borrowed clips. The first of these is from an old
Canadian instructional film called ``The Extension Ladder,'' a
fish-in-the-barrel example of the old, boring documentary style
that was swept away by a loosely affiliated band of rebels
including Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles, D.A. Pennebaker, Karel
Reisz and Robert Drew, all of whom turn up to reminisce and
philosophize for Wintonick's friendly, patient cameras.

   Not that the film is an exercise in nostalgia. Yes, Wintonick
feasts on the black-and-white glories of old movies both famous and
obscure: Reisz's ``We Are the Lambeth Boys,'' Pennebaker's ``Don't
Look Back,'' Michel Brault's ``Raquetteurs'' and episodes of the
Canadian series ``Candid Eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also makes room for Barbara Kopple (who made ``Harlan
County, USA'' and ``Wild Man Blues'') in her fearless prime, and
for Jennifer Fox, a skeptical inheritor of the verite tradition who
made ``An American Love Story,'' shown on PBS last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the old-timers are still active, still following the
first rule of cinematic truth telling: shoot and shoot and then
shoot some more. Toward the end we find Leacock, the movement's
guru and provocateur at 80, looking into a digital viewfinder and
proclaiming that there has never been a more exciting time to be
making movies. Who could disagree?

   DOBROSIN, Yugoslavia _ The sun glared down on the clay-baked
courtyard as a mother and father in their Sunday best, fidgeting
and nervously chatting with two armed guards, waited for the
Albanian rebel leader to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were searching for their 17-year-old son who had run
away from home. They heard that he and two friends had come here to
Dobrosin, a village located in the demilitarized zone between
Kosovo and Serbia, to sign up with an illegal branch of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. military intelligence, the one-story adobe
compound where they waited anxiously is home for as many as 150
battle-ready Albanian fighters.

 &HT;    FORMER TOP AIR FORCE DESIGNER CALLS F-22 OVERPRICED AND OBSOLETE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A veteran Air Force test pilot and senior military
aircraft designer Thursday bombarded the Air Force's ``dream'' F-22
fighter as an ``obscene'' expense that will deliver few of its
high-performance promises.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest skirmish over the new generation of fighters,
retired Air Force Col. Everest E. Riccioni said that the F-22 ``is
really not a very spectacular increase in capability'' over the
F-15 now in use. He said the new plane will be too big to evade
detection and that it will be ``totally irrelevant'' to future
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Riccioni said the F-22 program would actually weaken U.S. air
power because the high cost for each new plane, now estimated at
$178 million, will mean that as few as 100 new planes will be
purchased as current fighters are retired.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Air Force ``has always had and has always depended upon
superior numbers to win,'' the former fighter pilot said as part of
what he called a ``fact versus fiction'' analysis of the F-22
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers guarantee victory. Numbers develop intensity and allow
multiple attacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riccioni, who helped foster the Air Force's lightweight F-16s,
launched his criticism at a briefing sponsored by the Project on
Government Oversight, a private watchdog group on federal spending
and corporate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor for the F-22, rejected the
critique, although company spokesman Sam Grizzle acknowledged that
Riccioni is a ``well-known concept developer for aviation
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By all government accounts, the F-22's test performance thus
far has been outstanding, meeting every design criteria with
favorable margin,'' Grizzle said from Marietta, Ga., where the
planes would be assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is confident the F-22 represents a huge increase in
capability over the F-15, and that the Air Force Operational Test
and Evaluation Center will validate the F-22's performance during
initial operational effectiveness testing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is scheduled to begin in August 2002, after
production has already begun on the plane. That timing is among the
concerns Riccioni raised.
</P>
<P>
   Among his complaints about the aircraft, all of which he said
were based on publicly available data:
</P>
<P>
   _ It's much bigger than other fighters, so that it could be
easily seen unless flown at night.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The plane is stealthy against air radar,'' but the data
offer no information on whether it can be spotted by radar systems
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ Infrared sensors would detect its heat, and its shock waves
could be picked up by sound monitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Its publicly advertised thrust power is roughly the same as
F-15s. ``It will look very impressive,'' Riccioni said, but he
predicted that the F-22 would maneuver much as the existing
fighters do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite promises that the new plane could cruise efficiently
at supersonic speeds for hundreds of miles, he said its large
wings, needed for maneuverability, make it difficult to fly
efficiently above the speed of sound. He said the range for such
supersonic flights would be about 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Testing for the plane has been sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
   And in a critique made by other foes of the new aircraft, the
retired pilot argued that it would be ``irrelevant'' now that there
is no Soviet air force or any other serious competitor to counter.
The F-22 would be of no use in 21st century conflicts against
guerrilla forces, terrorists and drug lords, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the F-22 has suffered setbacks on Capitol Hill, the
plane has won backing from President Clinton this year in a budget
that includes funding to buy the first 10 planes next year and 16
in 2002. The plan was backed Wednesday in the fiscal 2001 defense
spending bill approved by the House.

`WATER IN BETWEEN': THE YOUNG MAN AND THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada)   (EDS: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of Kevin Patterson's smart and exciting narrative
of maritime adventure, he admits something that travel writers
rarely do: the issues that drove him to brave the dangers of
faraway places were not resolved by virtue of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   This is an age in which travel writing is seen romantically, as
a kind of religious redemption, with the road and its hardships as
elements in a ritual of purification or, at least, self-discovery.
Patterson, a 29-year-old doctor who goes to sea after experiencing
the chagrin of a failed love affair, did learn things _ among them
that home is where he wanted to be. But the author's admission that
he did not find any ``obvious resolution'' to his problems during
his months in a sailboat on the Pacific illustrates the
clear-headedness that elevates this journey above the level of mere
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 a heartbroken Patterson bought a 37-foot ferro-concrete
sailboat from a broker on Vancouver Island with a plan to sail it
to Tahiti and back. It is important to note here that at the time
he became a boat owner, Patterson had never sailed. Surprisingly,
and also refreshingly, he treats this fact with self-deprecating
humor, never considering it much more than an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the books I'd bought made it clear to me that I had
immersed myself in a pursuit where there was a great deal to
know,'' Patterson writes of this early stage of his trip. ``I knew
none of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, however, he had found a companion for the
journey to Tahiti, a quiet man named Don Lang who rivaled Patterson
in broken-heartedness and, unlike Patterson, had done a good deal
of sailing. They outfitted Patterson's clunky but seaworthy ketch
with food and spare parts and a wind vane to keep the boat on
course when the two men were sleeping. Before too long, Patterson
was heaving to and dousing sails and running storm jibs with the
best of them.
</P>
<P>
   But while he has not written a book about learning how to sail,
Patterson writes a great deal about loneliness and the voyage,
sadness and civilization. ``You could argue that the road selects
for malcontents and wobbly psyches and you will find nothing to
refute that argument in the bus terminal snack bars of my
experience,'' he writes. He recognizes in that passage that he
belongs to a history that has produced a considerable body of
knowledge and thought.
</P>
<P>
   During his long and event-filled journey to Tahiti and back, he
reflects on the literary tradition that grew out of the arduous
escape from the tedium of home, measuring his own experience
against the words and passages of writers who came before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Water in Between,'' in this sense, is good travel writing
and also good literary criticism. As he sailed the seas, Patterson
developed as good an eye for authorial success and failure as he
did for the distant darkening of the sky that foretells a squall.
</P>
<P>
   His main companions in this regard were the men whom sadness
propelled to the planet's farther reaches, men like Richard
Henderson, author of ``Singlehanded Sailing,'' Joshua Slocum, the
grand progenitor of solo global circumnavigation, and several
others. From these writer-traveler forebears, Patterson gets ideas
about the land and home as places of restriction and false comfort
as well as about solitude, the vastness of the sky, the immensity
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   There is a moment in his own experience when his boat is
becalmed in the middle of the ocean near the equator, and he and
Lang swim away from it, trusting that it will go nowhere. ``For
long seconds I had the illusion of being entirely alone,'' he
writes. ``A thousand miles from anyone. It should have been more
satisfying. I started to lose my breath.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not say so, but it is hard to imagine that as well-read
a sailor as Patterson did not think at that moment of Melville's
Pip, the cabin boy of ``Moby-Dick'' who loses his mind when he has
a similar experience.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has a number of mishaps, like losing his anchor and
letting his battery go dead. As he sails, he recounts a few
adventures and misadventures in his past life, including his
experiences as a young doctor in the Canadian army, his encounters
with the Inuit of northern Canada and his long-distance love affair
with a delicately difficult woman escaping her French husband.
</P>
<P>
   He gets to Tahiti. He encounters other lonely sailors, including
some with a striking literary bent. Generally, he is impressed more
by their psychological disarray than their bravery in the face of
the elements. He sails from Hawaii to Vancouver alone, at one point
running into a two-day storm like nothing he had ever imagined.
``But my God, alone on a small boat, listening to wind like that,
there is nothing so full of what sounds like unstoppered human
rage, loneliness and malignancy,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The figure he comes back to again and again, his chief foil and
inspiration, is Bruce Chatwin, author of ``Songlines'' and ``In
Patagonia'' and other travel books that for Patterson, gave
expression to an especially romantic and ascetic philosophy of
travel as redemption. Chatwin in Patterson's sharp and critical
reading, saw sedentariness as spiritual death and self-sufficient,
untrammeled nomadism as happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's long days alone on the sea lead him to see the
Chatwinian philosophy as a pose, a literary device, a kind of
cynicism. Ever since the modern world created the ideal of
individualism, he writes, people have lived out the fantasy of
isolation as a response to alienation, but that is what it is, a
fantasy. Whatever our troubles may be, ``being awake at night,
alone and cold, severed from others, does not have a patch on
home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad lesson, and it is all the more persuasive
because of Patterson's absence of self-dramatization.
</P>
<P>
   This is a writer more interested in the truth than in heroics.
He has written an old-fashioned story of personal adventure that
probes its own themes with subversive intelligence and ends in a
lucidity that distilled into hard, honed prose is a pleasure to
read.

   In a visit to Al Gore's home state today, George W. Bush
proposed two-year budgeting, a commission to study wasteful
spending, and faster votes on appointees as ways to restore order
and civility to government after seven years of the Clinton
presidency. ``Americans look upon the spectacle in Washington and
they do not like what they see,'' he said. Not letting the
Republicans who control Congress off the hook, Bush said in
Knoxville: ``There's enough blame to go around for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   GET ONE OF THOSE NIFTY TOUR T-SHIRTS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is making a ``prosperity tour'' through battleground
states to spotlight his plans to keep America's booming economy
going as voters appear split on whether he would do any better than
George W. Bush. The planned two-week tour, which Gore begins next
week, is meant to fuel his aggressive drive to define his image _
and his message _ in positive and upbeat terms. Some financial and
political analysts suggest the high-tech economy and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan should get the credit.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING SECURITY IN SOCIAL SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   At a local law enforcement training academy in former President
Richard Nixon's hometown of Whittier, Calif., today, Al Gore
proposed the ``Social Security Protection Act,'' which would make
it a federal crime to sell Social Security numbers. Gore was joined
by Helen and Tim Remsburg of New Hampshire, the parents of Amy
Boyer. Boyer was killed last year by a man who bought her Social
Security number from an Internet web site and tracked her down.
Gore also called for stronger measures to protect medical records
and personal financial information.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOMBERG POLL POSITION
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush holds a slim lead over Al Gore, according to a
Bloomberg News poll released today: Bush 44 percent, Al Gore 40
percent, Ralph Nader 4 and Pat Buchanan 3 percent. The remaining 11
percent are undecided. Other results of the poll: Gore leads among
women 44-40 percent; 58 percent approve of the job President
Clinton is doing, Democrats have a 41-36 edge in congressional
races; cutting taxes is not a priority with voters. The poll has a
3 percentage point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN STILL PUSHING PET ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, who sought the White House on the issue of campaign
finance reform, pressed the Senate again to require a secretive new
generation of political groups to disclose their donors. Under
McCain's unrelated amendment to a military bill, nonprofit groups
that engage in campaign-style activity would be required to
disclose both their donors and expenditures. Currently, there is no
disclosure requirement on these groups, nor are there limits on the
donations they can accept.
</P>
<P>
   JUST CAN'T BEAT THE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   The money advantage that won him the Democratic nomination makes
Jon Corzine the early favorite among professional political
observers to capture the open Senate seat in New Jersey. ``I'll be
moving this race from toss-up to a narrow advantage for
(Corzine),'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg
Report, a nonpartisan political report. He listed four reasons:
``short-term election trends in the state favor Democrats and
money, money, money.'' Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report,
which tracks campaigns, gives Corzine ``a slight edge _ just for
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   A DINER, NOT THE FOUR SEASONS
</P>
<P>
   If a moment can have a message, Rep. Bob Franks was sending one
by beginning his race as the Republican nominee for the Senate at
the Lido Diner in Springfield, N.J. ``The Lido Diner, that's as
middle-class New Jersey as you can get,'' Raymond Bateman, an
experienced GOP leader in the state, said with a laugh. ``That's
Bob Franks.'' The image Franks presented at the Lido is one he
evidently expects Jerseyans to be comfortable with, and one he
hopes to contrast with Corzine's self-financed $34 million
scorched-earth campaign against ex-Gov Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE HE STAYS ON THE CANVAS THIS TIME
</P>
<P>
   As a former boxer who once fought with a broken cheekbone, Jim
Florio, the politician, has endured countless analogies to his
middleweight days. He lost the race for governor three times, once
by 1,797 votes out of the 2.3 million cast, only to win the State
House by an impressive margin in 1989. But after the knockout
suffered at the hands of Jon Corzine, Florio may never again be
described as a ``Comeback Kid.'' His friends and close associates,
according to the New York Times, said they thought there was little
chance Florio, 62, would run again for elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ALL THOSE ZEROS AT THE END
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has set another
record: its first $1 million check. The money came from
1199/Service Employees International Union, which represents
200,000 health care workers, most of them in the New York metro
area. The check was delivered at a fund-raiser celebrating the 70th
birthday of Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) that raised $4 million.
The Republican National Committee has received two seven-figure
checks: Amway Corp. gave $2.5 million in 1994, and the company's
founder, Richard DeVos, and his wife contributed $1 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   AND WITHOUT POLITICAL LIABILITY, HE MIGHT ADD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says he's narrowing his list of prospective vice
presidential running mates, with an eye on candidates who would be
loyal and capable of serving as president. Bush told Hearst
Newspapers editors and executives that he expects to reach a
decision in coming weeks, but will most likely delay his
announcement until closer to the convention in Philadelphia
beginning July 31.
</P>
<P>
   FREE _ AT AN INFORMATION PRICE
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are offering free Internet service for
cybervoters, but people who accept have to answer some fairly
personal questions. Those who sign up for www.freeDEM.com must
answer some 20 questions, ranging from political views to income to
health insurance coverage. Ethnicity is optional. National
Democratic chairman Joe Andrew says no individual's personal
information will be sold, but rather will be used in aggregate for
marketing and to improve the service. The Republicans already have
launched www.GOPnet.com _ Internet access and e-mail for $19.95 a
month
</P>
<P>
   A KINDER, GENTLER CONVENTION . . .
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is planning to break with tradition and lower the
decibel level on partisan attacks at the Republican convention by
focusing on positive proposals for the future. Spokeswoman Karen
Hughes and other advisers say Bush hopes to strike a more
high-minded tone than in conventions past. Though some criticism of
Al Gore and the Democrats is expected, the aides said there will be
at least one concrete departure from the past: No single night will
be set aside for attacks on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND A SHORTER, SWEETER PLATFORM SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to compress the platform-drafting schedule in
order to limit battles over abortion and other divisive issues. The
only two public platform hearings being planned will focus on
issues such as education, health care and Social Security and avoid
more contentious subjects such as abortion, campaign finance and
tax cuts. GOP spokeswoman Ginny Wolfe said that instead of
beginning platform deliberations the Monday before the convention,
planners are considering distributing the draft Thursday and acting
on it Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   CUTTING THROUGH SHAME AND STIGMA
</P>
<P>
   A year after a White House conference on mental health that drew
wide attention to her own experience, Tipper Gore helped launch an
advertising campaign aimed at teenagers and young adults. She said
the ``shame and stigma'' she felt before seeking treatment for
depression a decade ago too often stops young people from getting
help. She didn't elaborate on her own treatment and whether it
continues.
</P>
<P>
   TO EACH, HER OWN
</P>
<P>
   The way that Molly Beth Malcolm, leader of the Texas Democratic
Party, sees it, George W. Bush is the kind of person who women want
to date and have at their parties, but do not want to marry. The
leader of the Texas Republican Party, Susan Weddington, found that
a ``real offensive'' observation and countered in Bush's defense:
``We're choosing the leader of the free world, not a prom date.''

   SOUCOM-DC _ Southern Co. will become the primary supplier of
electricity to Washington, D.C., under an agreement signed Friday
to acquire a network of power plants from Pepco for $2.6 billion.
It's the largest single acquisition yet for Southern and believed
to be the largest U.S. utility asset purchasen by any company. With
the addition, Southern's Southern Energy Inc. subsidiary _ soon to
be spun off into a separate company _ will have as much electric
generating power outside the Southeast as Southern's Georgia Power

RESURRECTING THE MINER'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: 3rd take contains hotel and restaurant and site
information.) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCRANTON, Pa. _ ``The miners had a saying: `If the timbers start
talking, we start walking,''' Joe Burke said, turning his head so
that the thin beam from the lamp on his miner's helmet poked into
the gloom, barely illuminating the stout wood columns that seemed
to hold up the roof.
</P>
<P>
   These timbers don't really support the mine roof, explained
Burke. It is held up by pillars of stone that miners leave standing
as they dig out adjoining chambers of coal. ``You could actually
remove all of these timber props, and the roof would stay the way
it is,'' he said. ``Their real job was to let miners know if there
was what they called a squeeze _ pressure or movement in the rock
above. That would make these timbers creak and even crack, which
was basically an early warning system to get out fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiding visitors along a damp and chilly tunnel in the old
Lackawanna Coal Mine, 300 feet under the ground, Burke does not
give the company line on the history of King Coal. Coal mining was
brutish, backbreaking and sometimes fatal for those who went down
into the mines. In Pennsylvania's anthracite mines, 600 to 700 men
died annually in each of the 15 years of heaviest production until
the end of World War I. In all, more than 30,000 workers died in
accidents in the anthracite mines from 1870 to 1949, after which
production fell off sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of visitors who take the guided tours of the mine
every day are meant to come back into the sunshine with a greater
appreciation of a way of life that left deep veins of loss, misery
and cultural trauma through generations of families in the
anthracite fields of northeast Pennsylvania, where thick fingers of
hard-coal deposits are splayed for 450 miles between the folds of
rolling mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Only fairly recently have memories of mining history become
cultural imprints to celebrate rather than bitterly suppress.
``Mining left a mark on many families around here,'' said Tom Supey
Jr., the foreman of the restored coal mine, which is operated by
Lackawanna County. ``A lot of people were killed or watched their
loved ones die of black lung disease, so coal mining was kind of
something they wanted to forget about.''
</P>
<P>
   The American labor movement was born here, starting with the
first miners' strikes in the 1840s. Coal companies and the
railroads that hauled coal often deployed armed thugs to respond to
labor agitation. Like early SWAT teams, squads of brutal Pinkerton
private detectives, as well as the hated Coal and Iron Police, were
rushed by railroad cars to sites of labor unrest. On the miners'
side, the night-riding Molly Maguires, a secret society whose
members had fled the Irish famine in the late 1840s, rallied miners
and exacted violent retribution against many abusive mine bosses in
a struggle of class warfare that was forged into American labor
legend.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, worried that the turbulent history of the coal
fields might be forgotten as its culture faded, Supey and his
brother, Andy, joined with their father, Tom Sr., to lead
fund-raising efforts for restoration of the mine, whose 1,300-foot
main shaft had deteriorated over the years since it was shut down
in 1966. The goal was to reopen the Lackawanna mine as a way to
commemorate a critical American industrial experience whose
narrative, they feared, would otherwise die on the lips of the last
generation of men who had gone down daily into the mines.
</P>
<P>
   The mine, which remains structurally sound, was reopened in
1985, when the idea of luring tourists to a drab, played-out
upstate Pennsylvania city like Scranton was considered eccentric at
best. The regional tourist business increased substantially after
the opening in 1995 of Steamtown National Historic Site, where one
of the country's largest collections of steam locomotives and
steam-era rolling stock are gathered in a 52-acre former rail yard
only a few miles from the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Like Steamtown, whose train-buff visitors often spill over to
the Lackawanna site and the adjacent state-run Anthracite Heritage
Museum, the mine tour emphasizes the real thing. ``You get the
dampness, you get the cold, you get a first-hand look at what
mining was like,'' Supey said.
</P>
<P>
   You also get guides like Joe Burke _ affable, knowledgeable and
deeply cognizant of his family roots in the coal fields. Though
Burke wasn't a miner, his father hauled those roof timbers down
into the mines. A great-grandfather started out as a ``breaker
boy,'' one of many child laborers, whose job was to pick out slate
rocks and sort chunks of coal that rumbled in an endless stream
along troughs in a breaker shed where giant machines crunched the
newly mined coal. The miserable plight of breaker boys inspired
Gilded Age journalists to loud denunciations of coal-mine
exploitation and led to passage of stronger child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Lackawanna site was one of about 200 mines that once
operated in the northeastern Pennsylvania coal fields. Their
product, anthracite, is a hard, clean-burning coal that first
fueled the small factories, steam engines and iron furnaces of the
19th-century Industrial Revolution; the ruins of four such
structures from this era can be seen at the Scranton Iron Furnaces.
Later, soft bituminous coal from West Virginia and Kentucky fed the
blast furnaces that turned Pittsburgh, 300 miles to the west, into
the steel-making capital of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the demand for anthracite continued to grow in the 20th
century, when it was the primary home-heating fuel for the
burgeoning cities of the Northeast. The anthracite market declined
and the mines began closing only when oil and gas heat displaced
hard coal as the dominant home-heating fuel starting in the late
1950s.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The tour takes about an hour and starts at a loading platform
that faces the old tipple, the area where coal cars were unloaded
and their cargo dumped into the troughs to be crushed and sorted in
the breaker shed. Tour visitors climb onto bench seats in a
steel-gated mine car that slowly descends deep into the earth on a
25-degree slope.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom they exit beside a wooden shack in the dimly lit,
cool subterranean gangway, a central transportation tunnel that
stretches into the darkness. The tunnel is intersected regularly by
dim chambers that probe at upward angles through layers of rock and
sandstone into thick veins of anthracite, natural seams of coal
that radiate for 30 miles into the hills on either side of the
mine.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the constant 58-degree chill and the gloom, the ghostly
echo of water drops splashing on unseen rocks was a constant
companion on the walking tour into the depths of the mine. At the
start, Burke encouraged taller visitors to put on one of the hard
hats on a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that there appears to be any actual danger. In the spring,
when the mine reopens for the season, hundreds of schoolchildren
are escorted on daily tour groups, their voices echoing off distant
rock walls. The lighting is adequate to see the pathway in the
various chambers, where thick veins of anthracite appear as shiny
black wainscoting.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.0
</P>
<P>
   In one dim, echoing chamber, Burke showed how miners extracted
the coal from veins that curl through layers of rock pushed up by
the primordial forces that made mountains where an inland sea once
lay. Unlike the more plentiful soft bituminous coal that is
produced to the west and south into the Appalachians, anthracite
does not yield readily to a pick. Explosives are required.
</P>
<P>
   A miner needed to drill a hole into the coal face to insert a
dynamite packing. Burke demonstrated a hand-cranked drill that
required the brute force of three men to do the job. Then,
grunting, he hoisted up a big, clumsy electric drill that was in
use through the 1930s. Drill bits could be as long as 8 feet, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no Black and Decker; it's about 50 pounds,'' Burke
said as he leaned into the tool. ``It's got an electric cord, which
can be pretty dangerous if you were ankle deep in water. Also, if
you're drilling into the coal and you should hit shale, what the
miners called bone, that drill bit could seize up and the handle
could turn into a propeller and rip into your shoulder or your
jaw.'' The tool, which was replaced in the late '30s by a safer
compressed-air drill, also threw off sparks, with potentially
lethal results in a mine chamber where methane gas might have built
up.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dynamite was tamped in, miners retreated far down the
chamber. Burke had his tour group join him in a thundering
recitation of the miner's bellowed warning of an imminent blast:
``Fire! Fire! Fire in the hole!'' Then he flicked a switch
activating a loudspeaker that sent a deep, ominous rumble echoing
through the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   There are other small theatrical touches on the tour. Children
who gather to look into a narrow, dark tunnel shriek when a rubber
mechanical hand meant to represent a buried miner begins clawing at
the rubble. Here and there in the darkened caverns, lifelike
mannequins of miners, including children, can be seen bent to the
grueling work.
</P>
<P>
   One of them shows a ``mule boy,'' perhaps 12 years old, working
beside one of the tens of thousands of mules that used to live in
the mines, hoisting the heavy coal trucks up to the surface, before
they were replaced by small locomotive cars. A mule boy's job,
performed in near darkness, was to tend the beasts and stop runaway
coal carts on a track by using a wood pole called a sprag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that coal cart started rolling, the mule boy, well he'd
just have to get down under the cart and force that sprag between
the spokes,'' said Burke, who scrambled under the cart to show how
it was done.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous work for a child? ``Well, a good mule was considered
to be a lot harder to replace than a boy,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Around another rocky bend, visitors come upon a wooden ``peg
shanty,'' a ramshackle underground office run by the so-called fire
boss, whose main jobs were to ensure against gas-explosion hazards
and to account for all miners at the end of a shift. On a board
hanging beside the shack, miners would insert wood pegs with their
names on them. The pegs are still hanging there.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther on, we pass into a windy 30-foot-long air
ventilation chamber shut off at either end by big steel doors that
enabled miners to direct the flow of fresh air from giant steam
fans on the surface down into various chambers. A figure of another
child crouches on a crude stool beside one of these doors. ``That
boy was called the nipper,'' said Burke. In the era before child
labor laws, this boy's job was to open and close the doors to
prevent fresh air from going where it wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   The tour ends at the foot of a long cavern, where a hulking,
dusty coal locomotive stands on the tracks. Nearby, a long steel
trough descends from the last dig that was made into ``belly
veins'' where miners had to crawl through small tunnels to claw
away boulders of coal, usually mixed with other rocks, which then
thundered down the chute to be loaded into the coal car for
transportation to the tipple at the surface. There, in the roaring
din of the breaker house, the coal would be broken into smaller
chunks and sorted by hand. ``There's our vein,'' said Burke. ``What
we're looking at is millions of years of the earth's history right
here. We're also looking at the place where work stopped when the
mine closed in 1966. The last day of work was right here.''
</P>
<P>
   He flicked a switch that suddenly plunged the chamber into
impenetrable darkness. Then he gradually adjusted his light, first
to show the pathetically weak illumination of a coal-oil lamp that
would have been used in the early days of the mines, and then to
show the only marginally more intense beam of a later-day
coal-miner's helmet lamp. Finally, the lights came back up, and we
made our way along the gangway to the work shack at the base of the
shaft to wait for the cable car that would haul us to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The group on Burke's tour had been unusually small _ only three
of us, all adult men. At the end of the tour, the guides usually
hand out souvenir ``miner's certificates,'' replicas of the actual
state certificates that licensed miners to use explosives and were
a coal miner's most coveted possession. But none of us wanted to
take a replica miner's certificate. Thanks to Burke's efforts, we
had gotten some small idea of what a real one used to cost.

pursuing Pennsylvania coal-mine culture can visit the Old Jail
Museum and other historic sites in Jim Thorpe, 57 miles south of
Scranton. The town, rich in mining and railroading history, changed
its name from Mauch Chunk in the mid-1950s to play down its history
in coal and instead honor Jim Thorpe, an American Indian from
Oklahoma who was a 1912 Olympic champion. (In his lifetime, Thorpe
had no connection to Mauch Chunk but was buried there after his
widow persuaded the town to adopt his name as a promotional ploy.)
In 1877 and 1878, the last seven members of 22 alleged Molly
Maguires who were condemned to death after a spate of labor
violence were hanged at the former Carbon County Jail. The gallows
has been restored, and the museum features historical displays on
the Molly Maguires. The museum and jail are open daily except

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `FULL MONTY,' BUFFALO STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Let the punning begin: ``The Full Monty'' is coming to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week after opening in San Diego, the producers of ``The
Full Monty,'' the musical adaptation of the 1997 hit film about a
group of British lads who take to stripping to make the rent, have
announced they will open at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Oct. 26.
Previews begin on Sept. 26. Expect the bad wordplay to start almost
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The show, with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and a book by
Terrence McNally, opened on June 1 at the Old Globe Theater and
promptly broke box-office records for that 612-seat theater. Jack
O'Brien, the artistic director of the Old Globe, will also direct
the Broadway staging.
</P>
<P>
   West Coast critics hailed the musical as a fun, if still flawed,
production; The Los Angeles Times said the show was a ``raucous,
uneven, highly entertaining musical comedy'' that had the potential
to be a big hit with a little work.
</P>
<P>
   That tinkering has already begun, said McNally, with rewrites
under way and due to be worked in next week. The musical had only a
week's worth of previews before opening in San Diego, meaning there
was little time to work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to have the show frozen by the time we leave
there,'' McNally said.
</P>
<P>
   To create a musical for an American audience, McNally, who won a
Tony for his book for ``Ragtime,'' transposed the action from
Sheffield, the city in northern England where the film was set, to
Buffalo, N.Y. He also discarded all of the movie's dialogue in
favor of new American lines. ``The characters in the movie had
really strong accents,'' he said. ``I got tired of hitting the
rewind on the video player.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the show's nudity, McNally said he wouldn't disclose how
it was handled. Will the audience get to see the actors' whole kit
and caboodle?
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it different than the movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But how different?
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie cuts to the back and freezes if I remember
correctly,'' he said. ``You can't cut to the back in a play.''
</P>
<P>
   CHANGE AT `ENCORES!'
</P>
<P>
   It is, to an extent, the price of success: Kathleen Marshall,
the artistic director of the ``Encores!'' concert series at City
Center, is stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who has held the job since 1996, said Thursday that
while she will stay on at ``Encores!'' as director in residence,
other commitments were making it difficult to balance her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been so wonderful about allowing me to do other
projects,'' Marshall said. ``I didn't want to stretch the bond so
thin that I couldn't do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   This season alone, Marshall directed the New York premiere of
Stephen Sondheim's ``Saturday Night'' and choreographed ``Kiss Me,
Kate,'' for which she received a Tony nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Those jobs, of course, are in part a result of Marshall's strong
work on Encores! shows like ``Babes in Arms,'' ``Li'l Abner'' and
``The Boys From Syracuse.'' In recognition, Encores!, which is
devoted to staging lost or rarely seen musicals, was awarded with a
special Tony for excellence last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's successor will be Jack Viertel, the creative director
of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses. Viertel, 51,
has had an eclectic career, ranging from time spent as Bonnie
Raitt's guitarist to a stint as a drama critic to his more recent
role as an aesthetic shepherd for such shows as ``Guys and Dolls''
and ``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   He says his love for the American musical began early.
</P>
<P>
   ``My professional career started out at age 5 conducting the
overture from `Tenderloin' in front of the record player,'' he
said. ``Not many guys can say that.''
</P>
<P>
   `MERCHANT' LOGISTICS
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the Royal National Theater's highly praised
production of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' with Henry Goodman,
coming to New York is looking less and less likely. The play,
directed in London by Trevor Nunn, was expected to arrive on
Broadway in the fall. But Nunn's current commitment to stage
``Oklahoma!'' on Broadway by the end of the year seems to have made
transferring ``Merchant'' during that same period tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Morrison, the National's press representative, said
Thursday that no formal decision had been made but conceded that
``there are a lot of logistic difficulties in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   O'NEILL'S COLLEGE PAPER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Playwrights Theater, which has committed itself to producing
the entire canon of Eugene O'Neill, will produce another
little-known work by the playwright this summer: ``The Personal
Equation.''
</P>
<P>
   The full-length play, written by O'Neill in 1915 for a play
writing class while he was a student at Harvard, concentrates on a
seamen's strike led by an Emma Goldman-like character, according to
``O'Neill,'' a biography by Arthur and Barbara Gelb.
</P>
<P>
   The Playwrights Theater production will star Ralph Waite and his
son Liam and runs from Aug. 4-19 at the Provincetown Playhouse in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the plays O'Neill worte during his Harvard days,
``The Personal Equation'' was not among his favorites. (According
to ``O'Neill,'' he often called his Harvard plays ``rotten.'') But
Stephen Kennedy Murphy, the Playwrights' artistic director, said he
saw promise in O'Neill's juvenilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't really jump off the page as great works,'' he said.
``But staged, you can see the vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   ALONG THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Jitney,'' the revival of August Wilson's 1979 play about a
group of livery cab drivers in 1970s Pittsburgh, has extended its
run at Second Stage for a second time, to Sept. 3. The production
was named the best play of the year by the New York Drama Critics
association.
</P>
<P>
   _ The gig is up for ``The Bomb-Itty of Errors,'' the downtown
hip-hop adaptation of ``The Comedy of Errors.'' The show, running
since December at the Salon at 45 Bleecker Street, will close on
June 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eric Idle, a Monty Python founder and co-conceiver of the
upcoming Broadway musical ``Seussical,'' will try things solo for
two nights, June 27-28, at Carnegie Hall.

mph will build over the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will be tempered over the western Gulf Coast states by
clouds, showers and thunderstorms that develop as moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico circulates inland on the western flank of the warm
ridge. Moisture from a tropical depression over the gulf may inject
a spurt of moisture Friday night, raising the risk of heavy rain in
East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A morning cluster of thunderstorms over the upper Great Lakes
will drop southeastward over New York state. Farther west, a
cluster of potent thunderstorms will erupt over North Dakota and
northern Minnesota near a front linked to low pressure.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRST DEPRESSION
</P>
<P>
   The first tropical depression of the young hurricane season
formed on Wednesday over the Gulf of Mexico. A depression, which
marks the second stage of tropical development, has maximum
sustained winds of 23 mph to 39 mph. Though activity tends to be
limited in June, tropical systems occasionally spin up on the
southern end of weak fronts stalled over the gulf or the eastern
Atlantic. North of such a front, surface winds blow from the
northeast, while, to the south, winds blow from southwest. This
results in a low-level cyclonic spin that can jump start early
tropical storms.

SOTHEBY'S ADDS TO ART ON WEB; AUCTION HOUSES FORM NEW ALLIANCES; AT
THE FRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sotheby's has decided not to hold its annual February
auction of contemporary art in its York Avenue headquarters next
year but instead to put it on Sothebys.com, its Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   This move allows the house to capitalize on its recent success
in selling lower-priced contemporary art online. It is also a way
of bolstering Sotheby's online business, as the company has had
trouble obtaining enough art and objects to fill its dot-com sales,
people close to the Internet business have said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get our customers to regularly check the
Web,'' said Wendy Cromwell, a specialist in Sotheby's contemporary
art department in New York. ``While they may begin looking at the
site during sale times, they should be hunting for art there all
year around.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell said that since 30 percent of Sotheby's Internet buyers
were new to the house, holding its February sale online would help
tap a new and broader market.
</P>
<P>
   That sale has traditionally featured lower-priced works _ valued
at $20,000 and below _ which happens to be the price range online
buyers feel comfortable with, Cromwell said. But rather than
offering art that can be seen only online, Sotheby's will put
highlights from the February sale on view in its Manhattan
galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Buying art online without the opportunity to view it troubles
many people in the art world. Jason Murison and Wendy Olsoff,
owners of PPOW, a 17-year-old SoHo gallery, for example, say
bidders should have an opportunity to view art before they buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking at all the e-commerce sites, and they're
more like stores with stuff than organized, curated shows,'' Olsoff
said. ``I approached Sotheby's to see if we could collaborate on a
project, since they have the brand-name recognition on the Web and
we'd like to try to sell art online.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsoff proposed something Sothebys.com had never done: sell work
by a group of emerging artists straight from their studios. ``(at)
the Artist's Studio'' _ works on paper by 20 young artists _ will
be on view at PPOW, 476 Broome Street, through July 7. The
exhibition and sale is also online through June 29 at Sothebys.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all young artists coming out of places like Yale and
Columbia,'' Olsoff said. ``While we don't represent any of them, we
always show young artists in the gallery since everyone loves to
discover new talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling only works on paper was a way to keep prices down,
Olsoff added. Prices range from about $300 to $4,500. The Web site
will include shots of each artist's studio along with comprehensive
images of the work offered and artists' biographies.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't Sotheby's, with its newly expanded galleries,
showing the art there instead of at PPOW, especially since it has
little to exhibit during the summer? Cromwell said, ``This is a
curated show and it should be in a gallery setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Art that isn't sold in Sothebys.com's sale on June 29 will be
for sale at PPOW until the gallery show closes on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ALLIANCES WITH FRENCH
</P>
<P>
   The art world anticipates that the French government will
eventually change its laws to allow non-French auction houses to
conduct sales in France. Meanwhile American and English houses are
forming alliances with Paris-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   William Doyle Galleries, based in Manhattan, and its London
partner, Bonhams, announced this week that they have entered into
an arrangement with Boisgirard, the Paris house.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and Bonhams have worked together for several years,
conducting joint sales, helping to market each other's auctions and
pooling resources to attract business. With Boisgirard in the
group, they will offer property from the French company both here
and in London, and will exhibit works of art from Paris at Doyle
and Bonhams.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies plan to link their Web sites. ``It's what
every company has to do these days to broaden its base of both
buyers and sellers,'' said Kathleen M. Doyle, chairwoman of William
Doyle Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle and Bonhams aren't the first to make inroads into Paris.
Francois Pinault, the French investor who bought Christie's,
acquired the Paris-based Piasa in February. That month, Bernard
Arnault, the new owner of Phillips, acquired Tajan, France's
largest auction house.
</P>
<P>
   COMBINING STRENGTHS
</P>
<P>
   Two powerful companies started by former Sotheby's experts _
Simon de Pury &AMP; Daniella Luxembourg in Geneva and Lucy
Mitchell-Innes &AMP; David Nash in New York _ are joining forces. While
the two aren't formally merging, they will work together to buy and
sell Impressionist, modern and contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the two firms handle art purchases and sales for
some of the world's biggest collectors, including Ronald Lauder,
the cosmetic's heir; David Geffen, the entertainment industry
billionaire; the publisher S.I. Newhouse Jr. and Paul Allen, the
co-founder of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our combined strengths have great advantages,'' de Pury said.
``When we started de Pury &AMP; Luxembourg, I said I hoped one plus one
would make more than two; now I hope two plus two will be more than
four.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Luxembourg have worked with Mitchell-Innes and Nash for a
long time, he said, adding: ``We have great mutual trust and it
goes back for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   APPOINTMENTS AT FRICK
</P>
<P>
   News of appointments at the Frick Collection are rare: its staff
is small and few people leave. But this week it announced that
Colin B. Bailey, deputy director and chief curator of the National
Gallery of Canada, will become the Frick's chief curator. He
replaces Edgar Munhall, who has retired. Barbara O. Roberts, an
independent conservator will become the Frick's conservator,
replacing Sveteslao Hlopoff, who also retired.

ANCIENT GREEK POTS TELL STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Greece, Canada, Israel, Pa., Conn.)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just as medieval Christians learned their Bible by
looking at stained glass windows and church sculptures, ancient
Greeks had their mythology illustrated on painted pots.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late Bronze Age (circa 2900 to 2000 B.C.),
Greeks decorated all kinds of pots: kraters, amphorae, kylixes and
vases. The pots (or the stories they told) must have been
appreciated, because they have been passed down, even when broken
and repaired, for more than 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Christie's New York is auctioning 157 ancient Greek
vases that were formerly in the collection of Dr. Elie Borowski, a
connoisseur of ancient Greek and Near Eastern art. ``This may be
the best vase sale since 1980,'' said G. Max Bernheimer, the head
of antiquities at Christie's. ``It is encyclopedic in scale and
comes from one of the best private collections ever assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   Borowski, who was a curator of antiquities at the Royal Ontario
Museum in Toronto, resigned in the 1950s to become a full-time
collector of ancient Greek and Near Eastern art. About 10 years ago
he sold his collection of Greek vases to finance the construction
of the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem, which he built to display
his second collection: ancient art that chronicles the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The vases in the sale date from the Minoan era (circa 16th
century B.C.) to the Hellenistc period (323 to 31 B.C.) and include
examples of the Geometric, Archaic and Classical ceramic styles,
some of whose painters have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Some pots tell old tales. Lot 32, for example, is an Attic
krater from around 560 B.C. that illustrates the battle between the
Lapiths and Centaurs. Two Lapith warriors are seen in the heat of
combat with three centaurs. The fierce Lapiths hurl spears at the
centaurs, who are half man and half beast. The centaurs pick up
rocks and throw them at the Lapiths.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, the kind and generous Lapith king
Peirithous invited the centaurs to his wedding. The centaurs got
very drunk and repaid their host by trying to rape the Lapith
women, so the Lapiths attacked the centaurs and sent them packing.
</P>
<P>
   The story is illustrated on a 17-inch-tall column krater
designed to hold wine. ``Can you imagine how much wine it must
hold?'' Bernheimer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Attributed to the painter Lydos, the krater is an example of the
ancient Greek black-figure technique, in which figures appear in
black silhouette against the natural red clay ground of the vase,
with details incised.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, perfected in the seventh century B.C. in Corinth,
was adopted in Athens in the sixth century B.C. and became the
predominant style of the day. ``This one is quite early, when
painters show a lot of influence of the Corinthian vase painting
tradition,'' Bernheimer said, discussing the high quality of the
draftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 38, an Attic black-figure amphora from about 550 B.C.,
depicts Zeus fighting the giants. Dressed in a short white tunic,
Zeus drives a four-horse chariot and wields his thunderbolt as his
sons Ares and Herakles come to his aid. Ares, wearing a crested
helmet and cuirass, crouches, sword in hand while Herakles, with
his signature Nemean lion skin, launches an arrow from his bow. One
helmeted giant has fallen at the feet of Zeus' horses, while
another hides behind a shield decorated with a palmette.
</P>
<P>
   The black is gone from some of the figures. ``The pot is
finished but misfired,'' Bernheimer said. ``In the kiln the glaze
didn't reduce to black the way it is supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost an enormous amount to fire up a kiln, and several pots
were done together,'' he said. ``This pot shows the imprint where
the foot of another vessel sat on its side.''
</P>
<P>
   The obverse side offers one of the earliest Attic renderings of
a rare myth: the capture of the wise old centaur Silenos. The god
Hermes brings the prisoner Silenos to the Phrygian king Midas, who
is seated on his throne. Hermes has bound Silenos' hands and tied a
rope to one foot, which he holds like a leash. His right hand is
raised in greeting to a winged goddess, perhaps Iris, who stands
behind the king. Here the exuberance of triumph and dejection of
defeat are captured in one graphic moment.
</P>
<P>
   The pot does not give the punch line: according to some
accounts, Silenos, in his wisdom, was able to talk himself out of
trouble. The estimate is $50,000 to $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   After Athenian vase painters had mastered the black-figure
technique, they developed the red-figure technique around 530 B.C.
The vase was painted black except for the figures, which were left
natural red. Fine details were applied by brush. A vase that
combines black and red-figured techniques is called bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 81 is a finely painted red-figure vase from the Classical
period, fifth century B.C. It is a kylix, a shallow cup that has a
frieze on the underside. The painting has been attributed to
Douris, and the pot to Python. The underside shows the women of
Thebes dismembering King Pentheus, who had forbidden them to
worship Dionysus. The women persisted, and when they discovered the
king spying on them, literally tore him to bits. The drama is as
striking as the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's antiquities sale on Wednesday in New York features an
exceptional bronze Roman head from about the first century.
Consigned by the heirs of an Englishman, Hans Calmann, it is
thought to be a copy of a lost Greek original by the sculptor
Lysippos, the court portraitist of Alexander the Great, or by one
of his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Keresy, the head of antiquities at Sotheby's, praised the
piece as ``the most important classical bronze to come on the
market in decades.'' It may have been cleaned in the 16th century
and lacquered later, he said, but the original patina remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so lifelike it may be a portrait of a famous athlete in
the fourth-century B.C,'' he said. The bronze has been known to
collectors since it was acquired in the 18th century by the
Venetian senator Bernardo Nani and is expected to fetch more than
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The summer antique fairs in the region outside New York City

Connecticut. It opens Friday night with a $75 benefit cocktail and
buffet from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the Goshen Fair Grounds on Route
63 and continues through Sunday.
</P>
<P>

the Philadelphia textiles dealer M. Finkle &AMP; Daughter and the
furniture dealers Wayne Pratt, Thomas Schwenke, Anthony S. Werneke,
Nathan Liverant &AMP; Son, and Jeffrey Tillou. Tickets are $8.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SEEKS IMMEDIATE STAY OF ANTITRUST REMEDIES
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as they sought to avoid a court-ordered
breakup, beleaguered Microsoft officials moved Thursday to shelve a
series of tight curbs on the company's business practices that are
set to go into effect in September.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lawyers called on U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to stay a long list of conduct-based remedies
drafted by the government and imposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson's order, Microsoft could not:
</P>
<P>
   _ Threaten or do anything to harm competing products, such as
withholding licensing terms, sales or technical support.
</P>
<P>
   _ Force computer makers to promote, distribute or use Microsoft
products as a condition of licensing its flagship Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the restrictions were needed because the software
giant continues to flout the nation's antitrust laws, and that they
should stay in place for three years after the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's lawyers argued that a stay was necessary to
avoid ``grievous and irreparable harm on Microsoft, its 35,000
employees, its millions of shareholders, its thousands of business
partners, and the tens of millions of consumers around the world
who rely on Microsoft's products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such radical changes affecting a major American corporation in
an industry as important to the economy as computer software should
not be implemented before Microsoft has had an opportunity to
secure appellate review,'' the defense motion maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials held out little hope that Jackson would
reverse himself and put his judgment on hold while the appellate
courts review the landmark case. But they noted that Jackson needed
to deny their motion to get the appeals' clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectation is that the appellate courts will stay the
entire final judgment,'' said Bill Neukom, Microsoft's veteran
general counsel, who had sat at the head of the defendant's table
throughout the 78-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect,'' Neukom added, ``that a stay would also stay
our obligation to begin developing a breakup plan.'' Jackson
ordered Microsoft to submit a plan to create one company to develop
and sell the Windows operating systems, and another to handle
applications software and Internet products.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Joel Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust
chief, urged the U.S. Supreme Court to hear Microsoft's appeal
directly, bypassing the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Klein cast doubt on the possibility of a settlement at this
stage, although Jackson, in separate interviews with two reporters
published Thursday, had held out the hope that the key issues in
the dispute could still be resolved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative ``that a settlement meaningfully address the
harm that's occurred to this market,'' Klein said as he joined
Attorney General Janet Reno at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most troubling aspects of Jackson's order for
Microsoft is that Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive,
would be bound to hire a ``compliance officer'' for the antitrust
package who would report directly to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson further provided for spot ``compliance inspections'' by
government antitrust attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   That section of his order obligates Microsoft to hand over
``copies of all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence,
memoranda, source code, and other records and documents'' that
relate to any aspect of the sweeping antitrust remedy.

<P>
   BECKETT-FILM (Dublin) _ An Irish theater director, Michael
Colgan, has set out to have all 19 of Samuel Beckett's stage plays
filmed. One of the first, ``Not I,'' was screened last month in
Cannes with Julienne Moore performing the 13-minute ``speaking
mouth.'' Among the other completed films is ``Catastrophe,'' in
which David Mamet directs Harold Pinter, Rebecca Pidgeon and John
Gielgud in his last performance before his death last month. With
actors accepting nominal fees, the Beckett Film Project will be
completed for about $6 million. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PROUST (Paris) _ Directors making a film of Marcel Proust's
3,000-page ``Remembrance of Things Past'' have to contend with the
long sentences, the long time spans and the long periods of
contemplation. Leslie Cahli interviews Raul Ruiz, the Chilean
director, to find out how he made ``Time Regained,'' one of the
volumes, into a marketable two-hour film. It opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   MACLEAN-JESUSSON-FILM (New York) _ ``Jesus' Son'' has proven to
be a god-send to director Alison Maclean. The film about alienation
and heroin use in the American heartland in the '70s has her behind
the camera for the first time in eight years. It has transcended
its $2.5 million budget and won excellent reviews. Lions Gate will
open the film on Friday. By Howard Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MONTY-MUSICAL (San Diego) _ The setting of the new musical ``The
Full Monty'' is no longer Sheffield, England, but Buffalo, N.Y. Yet
with the exception of a few new characters, songs and dances, the
theater version of the 1997 film adheres to the funny path of those
desperate men who find friendship and strength by taking off their
clothes to earn money. ``The Full Monty'' is one of several
musicals percolating in California in theaters from Los Angeles to
San Diego. Bernard Weinraub visits several of the new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ANTAEUS-MILLER-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Formed in 1991 as a
research and study group for classically trained actors who had
strayed from the stage into film and television, Antaeus falls
somewhere in between the prosperous regional theaters and the
struggling theatrical groups. Though Antaeus has mounted only a few
plays, it has a loyal following, which explains why its production
of Arthur Miller's ``The Man Who Had no Luck at All,'' has been
extended twice. The nearly forgotten play flopped on Broadway in
1944, but here it earned the kind of reviews most Los Angeles
theaters only dream about. By David Mermelstein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ECKERT-WHALES-THEATER (New York) _ ``And God Created Great
Whales,'' which makes its premiere Sunday night at Dance Theater
Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater, is loosely based on ``Moby
Dick.'' How loosely? It stars Rinde Eckert as Nathan, a piano tuner
suffering from a degenerative disease and struggling to complete an
opera based on ``Moby-Dick'' before his memory fails. For Nathan,
the white whale is represented at various times by the piano, by
the blank page and by memory itself. In the 80-minute music-theater
piece, Eckert sings, speaks and plays the piano and ukulele before
his mind goes down and he disappears into his opera never to be
seen again. By Don Shewey.

   CUBA-RUMBA (Havana) _ Jon Pareles attended Cubadisco, the Cuban
equivalent of the Grammy awards, and found it devoted to the rumba.
Not the south-of-the-border pop ``rhumba'' of Fred Astaire, or the
brassy big-band rumba of Tito Puente. It was the Cuban rumba that
has been traced back to Africa. &QL;

   MUSIC-ROREM (New York) _ For two decades Ned Rorem, the
composer, grimly asserted that the art song was languishing,
especially the American art song. But last month, Rorem admitted
that he had been wrong. While he was predicting the art song's
demise, he said, a generation of song composers emerged right under
his nose. Anthony Tommasini interviews some of the best practioners
of this form.

   POLYNESIAN-ART (New York) _ Curators, collectors and dealers of
tribal art converged last month on Sotheby's in New York to view,
gossip about and bid small fortunes for two 19th-century Polynesian
rarities: a feather cape and a curious Austral Islands necklace of
whalebone, ivory and human hair. Their obscure histories, traced
last to the little known Niagara Falls Museum, and freshly restored
condition made them hot topics. The objects brought record prices
for Polynesian art: $335,750 for the cape and $313,750 for the
necklace. By Rita Reif.  &QL;

   CUBA-ARTISTS-FUND (Havana) _ On Tuesday, the Cuban Artists Fund
will hold its second benefit, ``New York for Cuban Artists,'' in
New York. The fund supports Cuban artists in all mediums, but this
article concentrates on a dance triumph. This October, at the
International Havana Festival of Ballet, the hottest ticket will
most likely be ``Ballo Della Regina,'' which George Balanchine made
for the ballerina Merrill Ashley. In March, Ashley traveled to Cuba
to teach ``Ballo'' to the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, in the fund's
first major collaboration with a Cuban arts organization.
</P>
<P>
   HALPERIN-DANCE (San Francisco) _ For an artist so influential,
Anna Halprin &UR; 10 &LR;  is barely known outside her worlds, of dance and
ritual healing. Yet those who do know her are drawn to her, as
proven by the large audience at her ``80th Year Retrospective''
last weekend. By John Rockwell.

<P>
   TV-MOVIES (Paris) _ European television networks are the major
players in financing feature films for theatrical release.
According to a study by the European Audiovisual Observatory in
France, television investment accounts for between 30 and 74
percent of the financing for the production of feature films in
Europe, depending upon the country. Much of that revenue is
generated by public funds derived from taxes on television
companies and by pre-sale agreements. By Kristin Hohenadel.

   TRAVEL-ASTURIAS-SPAIN (Undated) _ Suddenly the major highway
ended and that was the signal that the pace changed in Asturias, a
green and damp area where there were no great resorts, no
architectural works by Gaudi, no wineries or great restaurants or
well-known museums, writes Amanda Hesser. A 10-minute drive north
and the land dropped off into the ocean. A 10-minute drive south
and the Picos de Europa, a mountain range, explodes from the earth
like an iceberg on a calm sea. We could swim or go hiking or just
take long drives down the narrow passages carved through the
mountains. We did all three.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CUBA (Undated) _ In Cuba, Kirk Kraeutler observes
firsthand ``artful adaption'' to ``tourist apartheid,'' a term that
describes places for foreign tourists with dollars, and places for
Cubans and pesos. Off the beaten path, where he often found more
potholes than pavement, he observes the myriad ways Cubans survive
in their hybrid economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (New York) _ Betsy Wade offers a guide to
some bus and boat tours of Manhattan. These include: Harlem
Spirituals, which visits the gospel music scene in Harlem; the
Semicircle Tour, a shorter version of the around-Manhattan tour on
the Circle Line; the Queens Jazz Trail; the Hasidic Discovery Tour
in Brooklyn; and a literary tour of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PETS-AIRLINES (Undated) _ Several major airlines
announced rules last month restricting pets traveling as
passengers' checked luggage in the baggage compartments of planes,
at least during the summer. Industry sources say that airlines will
soon require that pets going by air be handled by commercial
shippers, a move that could increase the cost substantially. Betsy
Wade reports on this trend and the services that ship animals in
climate-controlled comfort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-HOTEL-SHOPPING (Undated) _ For years, hotels have sold
small items like bathrobes and towels to guests who wanted to take
home more than memories. Such sales were largely defensive to
discourage theft, but increasingly it's a matter of marketing.
Bedside price list's include robes, towels, alarm clocks,
wastebaskets and even the bed. By Terry Trucco.

like Cancer Lifeline and the American Cancer Society. According to

to admit that he likes the finer things in life. ``My ideal hangout

customers. I come from a wealthy family.'' Indeed, Haji-Ioannou is
filthy rich. But he also happens to be the founder of the

   BIZ-MUSIC-CONTRACTS (Undated) _ Rock star and actress, Courtney
Love, knows how to grab the spotlight. At a new media conference in

major label recording contracts, not Napster.'' By Alec Foege.

   FIVE-QUESTIONS-BACHELDER (Undated) _ As shareholders gather for

looking for some dot-com-founder types, they wouldn't send these
people over: an industrial quality maven, a college professor who
founded a nonprofit group, the head of a government regulatory
agency, all past 40 and well established on traditional paths. Yet
each of them has taken a sharp midcareer turn into territory that

 &HT;    ONLINE SEXUAL CONTENT, APPROACHES COMMON FOR KIDS, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    With INTERNET-DATA.
 &HT;    By MIRIAM GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One-fourth of young people surfing the Internet
last year were exposed to pornography and one-fifth were sexually
approached, a national survey reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Children aged 10 to 17 are primary targets for sexual harassment
in cyberspace,
</P>
<P>
   said the report by the Crime Against Children Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights the need to make the Internet a safer place
for young people,'' said David Finkelhor, director of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, funded by a federal grant through the National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children, surveyed 1,501 young people
across the nation who use the Internet regularly.
</P>
<P>
   It found that 19 percent had received unwanted sexual
solicitations, 25 percent had at least one unwanted exposure to
images of naked people or people involved in a sex act, and 6
percent were threatened or harassed in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Young Internet users encountered unwanted sexual content through
e-mails, by misspelling Web addresses, or by using far-reaching
search engines. For example, Finkelhor said pornographic content
can appear when children search for a favorite topic such as
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   None of the cases resulted in physical harm, the study said, but
experts say cases should still be reported.
</P>
<P>
   In more than half of the cases, the children had not reported
the incident to an adult, the study found. Many children are afraid
their Internet privileges will be taken away, or they are
embarrassed or feel at fault, said Finkelhor. But parents should
teach children to report such cases instead reprimanding them,
Finkelhor suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``More should be done to get kids to talk about these episodes.
We need parents, school counselors and people their own age to help
them report them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If parents notify their Internet service providers or the FBI of
incidents, legal action can be taken against offenders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that not all offenders are adult males trolling
for sex. Some children said they had been subjected to sexual
advances from other teenagers and women in their 20s, Finkelhor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study said parents should be wary of friendships their
children develop on line, but it said they should not necessarily
prohibit such relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches are molesters, but that doesn't mean parents should
avoid signing their children up for Little League, the study said.
``It will be a similarly complicated challenge to protect kids from
dangerous Internet relationships without squelching the positive
ones,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The study was sponsored by the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on Justice and related agencies, chaired by Sen. Judd
Gregg, R-N.H. Congress wanted to obtain data showing the number of
children victimized in cyberspace before taking legislative action,
Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to preserve the positive uses of the Internet is
to ensure that it is not a sanctuary for pedophiles, child
pornographers and others who prey upon children,'' Gregg said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as they sought to avoid a court-ordered
breakup, beleaguered Microsoft officials moved Thursday to shelve a
series of tight curbs on the company's business practices that are
set to go into effect in September.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lawyers called on U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson to stay a long list of conduct-based remedies
drafted by the government and imposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson's order, Microsoft could not:

withholding licensing terms, sales or technical support.
</P>
<P>
   _ Force computer makers to promote, distribute or use Microsoft
products as a condition of licensing its flagship Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the restrictions were needed because the software
giant continues to flout the nation's antitrust laws, and that they
should stay in place for three years after the breakup.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's lawyers argued that a stay was necessary to
avoid ``grievous and irreparable harm on Microsoft, its 35,000
employees, its millions of shareholders, its thousands of business
partners, and the tens of millions of consumers around the world
who rely on Microsoft's products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Such radical changes affecting a major American corporation in
an industry as important to the economy as computer software should
not be implemented before Microsoft has had an opportunity to
secure appellate review,'' the defense motion maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials held out little hope that Jackson would
reverse himself and put his judgment on hold while the appellate
courts review the landmark case. But they noted that Jackson needed
to deny their motion to get the appeals' clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectation is that the appellate courts will stay the
entire final judgment,'' said Bill Neukom, Microsoft's veteran
general counsel, who had sat at the head of the defendant's table
throughout the 78-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect,'' Neukom added, ``that a stay would also stay
our obligation to begin developing a breakup plan.'' Jackson
ordered Microsoft to submit a plan to create one company to develop
and sell the Windows operating systems, and another to handle
applications software and Internet products.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Joel Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust
chief, urged the U.S. Supreme Court to hear Microsoft's appeal
directly, bypassing the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Klein cast doubt on the possibility of a settlement at this
stage, although Jackson, in separate interviews with two reporters
published Thursday, had held out the hope that the key issues in
the dispute could still be resolved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative ``that a settlement meaningfully address the
harm that's occurred to this market,'' Klein said as he joined
Attorney General Janet Reno at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most troubling aspects of Jackson's order for
Microsoft is that Steve Ballmer, the company's chief executive,
would be bound to hire a ``compliance officer'' for the antitrust
package who would report directly to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson further provided for spot ``compliance inspections'' by
government antitrust attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   That section of his order obligates Microsoft to hand over
``copies of all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence,
memoranda, source code, and other records and documents'' that
relate to any aspect of the sweeping antitrust remedy.

FUTURE OF COLLECTOR CARS: ON THE AUCTION BLOCK, OR ONLINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Editors: see also MONACO-CARS) 
 By KEITH MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ Three recent auctions here demonstrated
that the collector-car market continues to gain strength. Yet the
beneficiaries, the old-line auction companies that exhilarate
crowds by sending multimillion-dollar Bugattis over the block,
where they are subject to feverish bidding by celebrity collectors,
are looking warily over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Internet is changing the ways that multinational
conglomerates and neighborhood pizzerias do business, it looms as a
potential threat to the auction houses that could lose millions of
dollars in commissions if buyers and sellers move online.
</P>
<P>
   The online auction formula is simple: Put a desirable car before
millions of potential bidders and charge a minimal commission to
reflect the site's low overhead. Ebay has proved that the process
works well for old books, Beanie Babies and tens of thousands of
other low-cost, easy-to-describe items.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, eBay established a category specifically for cars
and auto-related products. Now, with the formal introduction next
Monday of eBayMotors.com, the online auctioneer is moving to set up
a one-stop resource center for car shoppers, from commuters seeking
rusty ``station cars'' to connoisseurs of custom-body Duesenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   Even an old-guard competitor credits eBay with increasing the
public's awareness of the auction process. ``Now, someone who has a
dusty old Pez dispenser knows they have an alternative to selling
it at a garage sale,''said David Gooding, managing director of
Christie's International Motor Cars in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its sales listings, eBaymotors.com will provide
an array of services to aid in online sales, including presale
inspections by authorized personnel, with results posted on the Web
site; financing options; access to collector-car insurance; instant
estimates of the costs of transporting a vehicle; and an escrow
service that will hold money until a car's condition is verified.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these services are required. While any car entered
at a Christie's or Brooks auction is researched and evaluated by
specialists, eBay leaves the due diligence to the buyer and the
seller.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for eBayMotors say that cars receiving presale
inspections are more likely to sell, and for a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   For prospective buyers, eBayMotors promises to put a dizzying
variety of cars within mouse-click range. Only 153 cars were
offered, in total, at the three Monaco auctions. In contrast, eBay
had 3,649 cars listed for sale this week, said Simon Rothman, vice
president and general manager of eBay's automotive division; most
were in a range of $10,000 to $50,000. Rothman projected that car
listings on eBayMotors could total as much as $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The eBay bidder can also buy without paying a commission,
although sellers pay $25 to list a car and just $25 more if the car
sells. In contrast, most auto-auction houses charge up to 10
percent for consignors and 5 to 17.5 percent for buyers _ for total
premiums of $60,000 or more on a $300,000 car.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it takes a leap of faith to spend a substantial sum to
buy a car without actually seeing it. Does its condition match the
representation made by the seller? Is it authentic? Did it really
once belong to Joan Crawford? Are competing bids being made by
legitimate buyers, or is the price being driven artificially
higher?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions apply to any big-ticket item offered online, as
made obvious recently when a painting nearly sold on eBay for
$135,805 on speculation that it was by a noted artist. It was
discovered that the seller and some acquaintances had driven up the
price by bidding on it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Misrepresentation is possible at live auctions, as well, but
bidders are less likely to be fooled if they examine a car and
question the auction company's representatives. Further, the big
auction houses work to resolve disputes between buyers and
sellers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``EbayMotors won't attempt to authenticate items being listed,
but we provide services for those who wish to do so,'' Rothman
said. He depicted eBayMotors as ``a marketplace where automotive
transactions take place.'' By playing the role of a feisty,
no-frills newcomer challenging a full-service institution, eBay is
to Christie's as eTrade has been to Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   While live auctions are far more expensive for both buyer and
seller, they offer more presale services. ``Christie's, along with
other specialist auction houses, really add value to an item,
especially for the ultra-exotic, whether painting, jewelry or
automobiles,'' Gooding said. ``We research the cars being offered,
inspect and drive them where possible and provide educated opinions
for our clients.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Questions have also been raised about the technological
reliability of online auctions. Robert Brooks, chairman of Brooks
Specialist Auctioneers and Valuers, asked: ``If a customer is
bidding online on a million-dollar Duesenberg and the computers go
down, what's the bidder to do? Does he lose the car? Do we miss a
chance to get the seller the highest price? At a live auction,
there is always a way to keep the sale going.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, at the Meadow Brook collector-car sale in Michigan,
a windstorm cut the power. The audience urged the auctioneer to
continue, which he did, selling cars in a hall lighted by a backup
generator.
</P>
<P>
   EBay can point to its own success as an indicator of future
growth. ``We have had strong double-digit growth in our automotive
sector every month since we began informally in August of 1999,''
Rothman said. ``We also have 10,000 listings for automotive
memorabilia and over 46,900 parts listings. And we have tens of
thousands of new listings each week, as auctions end and new ones
begin.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To compete with online auctions, the live auction companies will
stress quality over quantity, professional services over low
commissions and the thrill of a live event. ``Especially at the
high end, buyers and sellers want to enjoy the drama and spectacle
of a live auction,'' Gooding said. ``After all, it's surely more
fun to be in Monte Carlo watching someone bid on a million-dollar
Maserati Grand Prix car than it is to sit in front of a computer
terminal clicking away with your mouse.'' &QL;

RARE FERRARIS LEAD CAR AUCTIONS IN MONTE CARLO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Britain)  (With COLLECTOR-CARS) 
 By KEITH MARTIN  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monte Carlo is accustomed to rich and beautiful people. In late
May, it was a backdrop for rich and beautiful cars, too, as three
auction companies held events on the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1990, when the collector-car market was at a frenzied
peak, have there been three consecutive auctions in Monaco. Brooks
Europe, which was conducting its 10th annual Monaco auction, was
joined by Barrett-Jackson, an American auction company, and Poulain
Le Fur, a French auction house.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barrett-Jackson's first event outside its home base in
Scottsdale, Ariz.; it teamed up with Coys of Kensington, based in
London, to take advantage of the dollar's strength against European
currencies (and American collectors' appetite for high-end European
cars).
</P>
<P>
   The lavish Barrett/Coys event brought in $5.6 million, including
buyers' premiums, with 30 cars sold of the 50 offered. Craig
Jackson, owner of Barrett-Jackson, said, ``We brought the American
bidders, and Coys brought the European merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Europe, with the most variety, sold 46 of the 72 cars
offered for a total of $6.2 million. By presenting cars new to the
market, Brooks got top-end prices. Poulain Le Fur, in partnership
with Sotheby's, put on a smaller sale, bringing in $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   At all three auctions, rare Ferraris, especially those with
racing histories, brought the highest bids. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was
remembered Thursday in a solemn state service marked by effusive
eulogies, cannonades, a parading honor guard in crisp white
uniforms and thousands of mourners in dark suits, including
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The service for Obuchi, who died on May 14, six weeks after
suffering a massive stroke, began under a hot and brilliant sky
with a long, slow procession into a large hall. The service was
held by Obuchi's widow, Chizuko, and his 28-year-old son, Takeshi,
who bore a white box containing his father's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   With members of Japan's imperial family and dignitaries from 170
countries in the hall, where a huge portrait of the late prime
minister hung against an illuminated, powder blue background, his
successor, Yoshiro Mori, remembered his friend and ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am anguished to think how deeply disappointed Mr. Obuchi
must have been to have had to retire from the arena of action,
felled by an unforeseen illness,'' Mori told the other mourners.
``In this moment of bereavement, I can do no more than express my
heartfelt gratitude to former Prime Minister Obuchi for dedicating
his all to this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the sobriety of the occasion, what was occurring
offstage both before and after the ceremony was a burst of
political activity and diplomacy of great significance for Japan's
immediate future, and for the future of this region.
</P>
<P>
   But Mori, for one, finally had a setting in which he could
finally enjoy the statesman's attributes of his office.
</P>
<P>
   And with critical national elections scheduled for June 25,
Mori's huddles with Clinton, the South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung and senior Chinese and Russian officials provided welcome
relief from the cycle of provocative blunders and tortured
semiretractions that have cut deeply into the prime minister's
popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for a political lift, Mori's aides have made much of the
bilateral meetings with Clinton; Kim; the leaders of Australia,
Indonesia and Thailand; and high-ranking officials from many other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Japanese leader and his foreign minister, Yohei
Kono, held bilateral talks with 33 countries over the last two
days.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following meetings with Mori and Kim, aides to Clinton praised
the South Korean government for taking the initiative in engaging
its northern neighbor, and hinted strongly at a relaxation of U.S.
economic sanctions against North Korea, many of which have been in
place since the Korean War, which ended in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a process in place to work through issues related to
that, and I would expect we would have an announcement on that very
soon,'' said a White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean leader is due to travel to the North Korean
capital, Pyongyang, on Monday, for the first-ever summit meeting
between leaders of those two countries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kim told Mori that he would urge his North Korean counterpart to
improve relations with Japan. North Korea fired a ballistic missile
over Japan without warning in 1998, shocking the Japanese and
causing a break in relations with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had often expressed frustration with
Obuchi and his government over the slow pace of reform to lift
Japan out of its decade-long economic slump. In death, however, the
soft-spoken, consensus-minded Obuchi was praised by Clinton, who
said that history would regard him as someone who ``rose to the
challenge with courage and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did hint at new frustrations in relations with Japan.
Foreign Ministry officials acknowledged that the president had
raised, among other issues, the question of high international
telephone-connection fees imposed by the national carrier, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which Washington sees as an unfair barrier
to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Clinton's decision to attend
Thursday's service, flying 26 hours for an eight-hour-stay, and his
strong praise for Obuchi should be seen in the context of the
``unusually strong alliance'' that links the two countries, and
Japan's steady support for the priorities of U.S. foreign policy
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Coming little more than three weeks after Obuchi's cremation,
the date of Thursday's memorial service was itself mired in
politics. The Japanese media widely reported that the service was
held as close as decently possible to the upcoming elections in
order to guarantee a large ``sympathy vote'' and give maximal lift
at the polls to the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Since the date was announced, a string of unusually blunt
nationalist statements by Mori, whose recent description of Japan
as a ``divine country with an emperor at its center'' was strongly
evocative of this country's imperialist prewar propaganda, has
caused support for the government to evaporate in the polls. The
election now stands to become a referendum on Mori rather than a
commemoration of Obuchi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Political analysts in Tokyo have described the stakes in the
election as extremely high. If the Liberal Democratic Party loses a
significant number of parliamentary seats, Mori would likely be
forced to resign. An even worse debacle for his party, as a 12
percent popularity rating in one recent newspaper poll suggests,
could force the Liberal Democratic Party from power for only the
second time since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's tenure in office has been unusually troubled from the
start. Opposition political leaders and editorial writers have
poked holes into the sometimes contradictory official explanations
of how power was secretively passed from Obuchi following his
sudden hospitalization on April 2 to a brief caretaker prime
minister and finally to Mori.
</P>
<P>
   An account by Obuchi's widow of her husband's last hours of
consciousness was published Thursday in a popular magazine.
Obuchi's claim that her husband spoke to her long after his stroke
_ contrary to doctors' reports _ bolstered the position of Mikio
Aoki, who had been the caretaker leader and said that he had been
asked to exercise power by the dying leader.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Tokyo Thursday, the kind words often
spoken about Obuchi rarely reflected on Mori, whom voters seemed to
regard with all the suspicion suggested by his historically low
ratings in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about Obuchi's political abilities, but he seemed
to have a nice personality,'' said Hiroshi Ogawa, a 60-year-old man
who was in the Toronomon section of central Tokyo. ``Mori, though,
is just out of the question. I've never heard of a prime minister
who has made such a bad impression.''

&HT;     ANYONE FOR THE CABINET? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Insiders report that Texas Gov. George W. Bush may
announce during the Republican convention, or at least before
Election Day, some if not all of his choices for the Cabinet if he
becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that surfacing in advance an impressive roster of
experienced dignitaries destined to be at Bush's side would bolster
his own shaky credentials as a leader of substance. The message?
Electing Bush is picking a team and not just a man of suspected
intellectual limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that such an announcement would be helpful is pure
bunkum. Not only would it be premature; it would be politically and
psychologically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Voters expect presidential candidates to stand on their own two
feet without relying on others as political props. Even Bush's
appearance during the early primary season with his parents, the
former president and first lady, was not a plus. When his father
called him ``my boy,'' the younger Bush looked especially immature.
</P>
<P>
   And voters do not like to be taken for granted. They may take
umbrage at a candidate who arrogantly assumes _ no matter how
favorable his polls may be _ that he has the election in the bag.
Bush is supposed to concentrate on wooing the public right up to
the last minute, not on selecting the elite folks who get to ride
to power on his anticipated coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Has Bush forgotten what happened to President Thomas Dewey when
he similarly jumped the gun with his Cabinet names?
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1948. The press and the pollsters all agreed that
President Harry S Truman was political toast and that Dewey, the
Republican nominee, would win in a landslide. Dewey was so
confident of victory that he leaked to a widely syndicated
columnist, Drew Pearson, a list of his Cabinet choices, led by John
Foster Dulles for secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson wrote a column about the choices on the day of the
election before the returns were in. It was published the morning
after Truman's stunning victory and immediately became a classic in
the annals of political unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, seems unfazed by, or perhaps unaware of, that
embarrassing incident. He has already been trying to bolster his
image with selected appearances by Republican heavyweights. When he
disclosed his proposal to reduce the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal
while deploying a baby Star Wars anti-missile shield, he surrounded
himself with venerable Republican foreign policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   The men represented the conservative old guard of his father's
generation, stable and experienced but not exactly the wave of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In the cartoon strip ``Doonesbury,'' Garry Trudeau quipped, ``It
looked like Madame Tussaud's (London wax museum) up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder statesmen did lend a certain gravitas to Bush's
venture into new military policy territory. The group's centerpiece
was former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, who
has been flirting openly with Bush over the stewardship of the
State Department. Bush hasn't exactly announced that Powell would
be the next secretary of state, but the prospect has met with loud
applause and seems to be practically a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Any other Cabinet announcements, however, would come as a
surprise. An early selection would please the lucky few but
irritate hordes of other hopefuls who are angling for one of the
spots. Shut out of the charmed inner circle, their enthusiasm for
the Bush candidacy might even wane just when he needed it most.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency has always been a lure dangled by
presidential candidates to keep ambitious governors and other
statewide officials on their team. The Cabinet is a less obvious
treasure, but lobbying for a seat can also be intense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that game too can backfire, just as the veep game sometimes
does. In 1964 Sen. Eugene McCarthy got miffed because President
Lyndon Johnson had hinted about giving him the vice presidency and
then picked his Minnesota Senate colleague Hubert Humphrey instead.
McCarthy turned against Johnson and never forgave him.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the selection can be important. Bush may be
thinking of ways to pump up interest for what otherwise promises to
be a dull convention. But premature commitments can arouse
opposition as well as support. If he makes a mistake about, say,
the secretary of the treasury, everybody will have plenty of time
to create an uproar before the poor would-be appointee has to go
before the Senate for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   When a president notifies his friends about his plans, he also
notifies his foes. Ronald Reagan learned this lesson in 1976 when
he was trying to take the GOP presidential nomination away from
President Gerald Ford. Trailing in the delegate count, Reagan
announced nearly a month before the convention that if he got the
nomination, Pennsylvania Sen. Richard Schweiker would be his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to bring the fat Pennsylvania delegation to
Reagan. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan and Schweiker, a moderate, were poles apart on many
issues from production of the B-l bomber to a full-employment bill.
Schweiker turned off more potential Reagan backers, particularly in
the South, than he inspired new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for holding preferences for the Cabinet in reserve
until the election is over are as compelling today as in the past.
Bush would be wise to look elsewhere for an attention-getting
gimmick.

 &HT;    DELL SEES BRIGHT FUTURE FOR BOTH WEB AND PCs
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michael Dell, who founded the world's most
successful personal computer maker, Thursday hailed the rise of
Internet commerce as a ``revolution'' that has only just began.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, the 35-year-old chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.,
told a National Press Club luncheon audience that ``the pace of
change is only going to accelerate from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dell maintained that personal computers are also
here to stay, despite widespread reports that they will be
supplanted in time by hand-held devices, Web-enabled telephones and
``smart'' TV sets or other dedicated Web-based appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC has a very bright future,'' he said. ``And I actually
enjoy, to some extent, seeing all the news reports about the demise
of the PC ... from our competitors or industry pundits, because
we'd be happy to gain additional market share from those companies
that believe that it's going away.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Dell said, the company, based in Round Rock, Tex.,
shipped nearly 12 million computers to some 150 countries, more
than any other domestic or foreign manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's revenues have grown in 16 years from $6 million a year to
$27 billion in the last four quarters. Its sales on the World Wide
Web exceed $40 million a day. It is the only company whose revenues
and earnings have grown more than 40 percent annually for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   That record earned Dell a coveted invitation to speak to the
press club, but the journalists in the audience did not manage to
elicit any news from him on the hottest high-tech topic of the day:
the fate of Microsoft Corp., which a federal judge on Wednesday
ordered to be split in two.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Microsoft have close business links. Moreover.
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and Michael Dell, who is 10 years
younger, have long been personal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the legal battle will effect Dell's dealings with
Microsoft and with other operating system companies, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``The core issue for us here is what do our customers think,
because our company is essentially a company that delivers what our
customers want to buy and the solutions and service that they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers ... essentially like those products, and we
believe will continue to buy them whether it is one company or two
companies or five companies. And that is really the kind of
operative issue for us. And that's the core issue as we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed further, Dell added: ``I'm not going to comment on
the merits of the case or whether one group did one thing to
another. I'd leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Dell did want to talk about is the Internet and,
particularly, how much help it has been in supporting the needs of
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he said, ``has become not only a competitive
weapon, but an essential tool for dealing with the volumes and the
complexity of our business in an efficient manner.''

elicit any news from him on the hottest high-tech topic of the day:
the fate of Microsoft Corp., which a federal judge on Wednesday
ordered to be split in two.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Microsoft have close business links. Moreover.
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and Michael Dell, who is 10 years
younger, have long been personal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the legal battle will effect Dell's dealings with
Microsoft and with other operating system companies, he replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``The core issue for us here is what do our customers think,
because our company is essentially a company that delivers what our
customers want to buy and the solutions and service that they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers ... essentially like those products, and we
believe will continue to buy them whether it is one company or two
companies or five companies. And that is really the kind of
operative issue for us. And that's the core issue as we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed further, Dell added: ``I'm not going to comment on
the merits of the case or whether one group did one thing to
another. I'd leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Dell did want to talk about is the Internet and,
particularly, how much help it has been in supporting the needs of
computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he said, ``has become not only a competitive
weapon, but an essential tool for dealing with the volumes and the
complexity of our business in an efficient manner.''

`THE TRIAL OF OLD DRUM': A BOY-AND-HIS-DOG STORY IN A MORE INNOCENT
ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<TEXT>
<P>
   Only the most hard-hearted can resist the sight of a boy crying
when his dog faces death. Why else is ``Old Yeller,'' an iconic
American movie, recalled when filmmakers want a hard character to
reveal a heart?
</P>
<P>
   Fair warning: I'm a dog owner myself, and the harder parts of my
heart turned to mush during moments in ``The Trial of Old Drum,''
an original movie having its premiere Friday night on Animal
Planet. When the golden retriever Old Drum whimpers after a gunshot
wound, when he howls as he is separated from his young master, when
he offers a peacemaking paw to the town villain _ OK, everyone, a
collective ``aaw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trial of Old Drum'' is manipulative and awkward, and it
features spotty acting, washed-out landscapes, wince-inducing
dialogue, leaps of reason and a load of bathos. Its fans won't
care. At its best, ``Old Drum'' relates a classic story of a boy
and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trial of Old Drum'' is based on a true story from the
western Missouri of 1870, when a rhetorically gifted lawyer, George
Vest, delivered a closing statement that popularized the line, ``A
man's best friend is his dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Trial of Old Drum'' streamlines the facts and plants a
happy ending on the tale, in a movie clearly geared toward
children.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, Ralph Gaby Wilson, has moved the story to an
invented Eisenhower-era village that retains the innocence of a far
earlier time. ``This is God's country,'' says the adult Charlie
(the singer Randy Travis), whose narration describes the town as a
place where your word is your good name and you don't need to lock
your doors. (That's not the last of the cliches.)
</P>
<P>
   Young Charlie (Bobby Edner) is an only child whose mother has
died, leaving him lovingly attached to Old Drum, a sweet, devoted
and heroic dog. Old Drum is accused by gruff Uncle Lon (John
Schuck) of killing sheep, a high crime in this livestock-centered
economy. Lon wants the dog destroyed. Despite Charlie's attempts to
defend his pet, Old Drum is jailed until the truth can come out in
a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's father is played by big Ron Perlman, whose muted
performance is quietly charming. It's touching to watch Perlman
wrap his large frame around the small boy in an attempt to comfort
him, but the threat to Drum calls for further help: a well-known
city lawyer, played by Scott Bakula, a fine actor best-known for
his Emmy-nominated performances in ``Quantum Leap.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial pits Bakula's George Vest against the prosecutor
Thomas Crittenden (well-played by Tom Duggan). Not surprisingly,
this is the most involving part of the movie, so it's a shame that
the case zips along so quickly and Vest's climactic tribute to dogs
is so disappointing. Bakula's big moment, Vest's history-making
summation, fails to fulfill its potential.
</P>
<P>
   Most children will feel suspense during the trial and sympathy
for all the movie's characters (aside from Uncle Lon, who remains
an unredeemed villain). But even children will puzzle over some of
the script's odder choices, in particular Charlie's alternating
references to Drum as ``good girl'' and ``good boy.'' Is this a
strange attempt at gender equity? If so, it is misguided; just
after Drum is proven capable of fatherhood, Charlie again refers to
his dog as ``girl.'' Huh?
</P>
<P>
   But there's no point quibbling over the movie's flaws. ``The
Trial of Old Drum'' proclaims the worthy soul of a pet, a sentiment
that Animal Planet is wise to embrace _ and that no pet owner would
dispute.

   BC-BENNINGTON-DISPUTE-NYT (moved on Saturday, May 27)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, May 27,
about turmoil at Bennington College over the dismissal of some
faculty members in a reorganization referred to events surrounding
the firing of a philosophy professor, Carlin Romano. It said that
before Romano's dismissal he was quoted in The Chronicle of Higher
Education as calling the college president, Dr. Elizabeth Coleman,
``a serial violator of academic freedom'' and predicting that he
would be fired. The Times article also said Dr. Coleman and others
attributed Romano's departure to his chronic lateness with
evaluations and his having threatened a dean.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness the article should have included a response from
Romano. He denies having made threats. His prediction about
dismissal came from an April 28 article in The Chronicle, which
truncated a quotation from the journal's March 31 issue, in which
Romano said he expected ``to be fired or in some way discriminated
against or punished like everyone who has spoken out before.''

&HT;     CLARK DEFENDS NATO FORCES AGAINST WAR CRIME CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the former NATO commander
who led last year's successful military campaign to expel Serbian
forces from Kosovo, defended himself Thursday against an Amnesty
International report charging his forces with a war crime in the
bombing of a state-run television station.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets attacked the main Serbian television station on April
23, 1999, in a pre-dawn raid that killed 16 civilian technicians
and security guards and wounded at least 16 others, according to
Pentagon figures. The attack knocked the television signal off the
air for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Amnesty International, a human rights group,
released a study concluding that forces under Clark's command had
violated international law by purposely attacking the civilian
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one instance, the attack on the headquarters of Serbian
state radio and television, NATO launched a direct attack on a
civilian object and (this action) therefore constitutes a war
crime,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a legitimate military target,'' Clark said in an
interview. ``From the very outset of the war, I had ambassadors and
heads of state coming to me, saying, `You've got to get that off
the air. It's poison. (The propaganda machine of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic) is poisoning our people, his own people. He's
manipulating that conflict by the use of that media.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clark added, ``You are always making tradeoffs in these
decisions. But in this case, it was a huge step to be able to take
out (Milosevic's) major instrument of provocation and command and
control.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the attack, NATO officials maintained that the TV
station, in addition to broadcasting propaganda, also sent
instructions to troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Clark acknowledged Thursday that the attack by itself did not
achieve the stated military goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really get the effects until we took out the
electricity. When we took out the electricity, it just so happened
that it made it much more difficult to receive Serb radio and
television in large parts of Serbia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor for the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, cleared NATO forces
of any possible war crimes during the 78-day air war against
Serbia, which lasted from March 24 to June 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said that ``although some mistakes were made by NATO
... there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful
military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing that statement, Clark said the attack ``was assessed by
all of the lawyers as fully in accordance with international law.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Amnesty International doesn't make international
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was replaced as NATO's top military leader in May and
plans to retire from active duty this month.

CBS'S 'SURVIVOR' TROUNCES ABC'S 'MILLIONAIRE' IN SECOND WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN DINI   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second episode of ``Survivor,'' which was broadcast on CBS
on Wednesday, topped the previously invulnerable ``Who Wants to be
a Millionaire'' on ABC by 21 percent in ratings, according to
overnight ratings statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' a reality program that features a group of people
stranded on a tropical island with few resources, posted a 12.8
rating and a 21 share, or about 17.9 million viewers, according to
Nielsen Media Research's overnight measurement in 48 major markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire,'' in contrast, posted a 10.6 rating and a 17
share, or about 15.4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Each national rating point equals 1 percent of the total
households with television. Share is the percentage of TV sets
tuned to a specific program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' won the first showdown between the two shows
when ``Survivor'' made its debut last week, though ``Survivor'' did
pull ahead of ``Millionaire'' in key viewer demographics on its
first night. This week, however, ``Survivor'' scored a clean sweep.
Its ratings grew by 12 percent over its debut, while
``Millionaire's'' fell by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among viewers 18 to 49 years old, ``Survivor'' bested
``Millionaire'' with a 7.4 rating and a 25 share, compared with its
rival's 4.5 rating and 15 share. ``The 'Survivor' demos are huge,
especially for a traditionally older-skewing network like CBS,''
said Tom Bierbaum, who closely tracks TV ratings for media trade
publication Inside.com.
</P>
<P>
   The strong ratings signal continuing ratings success for the
remaining 11-week run of ``Survivor,'' said Marc Berman of
Mediaweek.com, who noted that a second installment of the program
is nearly certain.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, General Electric's(GE:NYSE) NBC unit won the ratings
race for the night, powered by Game One of the National Basketball
Association finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Indiana
Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Viacom(VIA:), which owns CBS, rose 1 7/16, or 2
percent, to 65 3/16 in early afternoon trading.(Viacom finished
regular trading up 15/16, or 1.5 percent, at 64 11/16.)Walt
Disney(DIS:NYSE), which owns ABC, inched up 9/16, or 1 percent, to
40 3/4. (Disney finished regular trading up 1/4, or 1 percent, at
40 7/16.)

   China and the United States have agreed to resume talks on arms

on arms and other topics were suspended after the bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO, but have gradually been

THOMSON TO SELL 38 DAILIES FOR $1.58 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Canadian publisher Thomson said Thursday that it would sell
two big pieces of its U.S. newspaper holdings, or 38 daily papers,
to Gannett (GCI:NYSE), the largest newspaper publisher in the U.S.,
and to privately held Community Newspaper Holdings for a total of
$1.58 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett, based in Arlington, Va., and the publisher of USA
Today, will pay $1.125 billion for 21 daily newspapers clustered in
Louisiana, Maryland's Chesapeake region, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah.
The newspapers have a combined daily circulation of 466,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other 17 newspapers, with a combined daily circulation of
260,000, will go to Community Newspaper Holdings, based in
Birmingham, Ala., for $455 million. Those papers are clustered in
Indiana, southern Georgia, West Virginia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, newspaper companies are seeking to ``cluster,'' or
own several newspapers in a region, in order to concentrate their
ability to attract advertising. Previously, they sought to have as
much nationwide coverage as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Toronto-based Thomson, a traditional print
publisher, announced it would sell 54 newspapers in the U.S. and
Canada, which comprise the entirety of its newspaper holdings
except for Toronto's The Globe and Mail. Thomson still has 11 U.S.
papers and 5 Canadian properties on the block.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomson, proceeds from the sale of the newspapers
will be used to reduce debt and provide additional borrowing
capacity as the company focuses more on providing information
online and through CD-roms and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with that strategy, Thomson said on Monday that it
would buy Primark (PMK:NYSE), a provider of financial, economic and
market research information, for about $842 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper industry is currently undergoing a wave of
consolidation. Earlier on Thursday, Central Newspapers (ECP:NYSE),
publisher of The Arizona Republic and The Indianapolis Star, said
it had hired the investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
look into a possible sale or ``other business combination.''
</P>
<P>
   And in March, Tribune Co. (TRB:NYSE), publisher of the Chicago
Tribune, announced that it would acquire Times Mirror (TMC:NYSE),
publisher of the Los Angeles Times, for about $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gannett closed Thursday trading at 61 3/8, up 1/4 or
0.41 percent. There was no activity in post-market trading,
according to Instinet.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Thomson closed at C$51 on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
up C$1.25, or 3 percent.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ John Powell sat before an electronic keyboard and a
bank of computer screens and sound consoles in his basement office
overlooking one of the palm-lined canals of Marina Del Rey. A soft
breeze ruffled the bougainvillea to the sound of rustling water.
``I know it looks like I'm on vacation,'' he said, ``but I'm
actually working.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell has composed music for action films (``Face/Off,'' 1997)
and he has composed music for comedies (``Forces of Nature,'' 1999)
and he has composed music for animated films (``Antz,'' 1998). But
now he is putting the finishing touches on the score for a film
that combines all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' is the debut feature film for Aardman Animation,
the Oscar-winning stop-motion animation company behind the popular
``Wallace and Gromit'' series of shorts. It opens on June 21 in New
York and Los Angeles and June 23 elsewhere. ``Basically,'' Powell
said, ``It's `The Great Escape,' but with chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell and his collaborator, Harry Gregson-Williams (who also
worked on ``Antz''), have been trying to walk a fine line with the
film's music. The movie is at one level a spoof of prisoner-of-war
escape films but at another it takes its fowl characters very, very
seriously _ tapping into the spit-in-their-eye cockiness of the
soldiers in those movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard to find the tone,'' Powell said. ``The fact
that it's chickens going over the fence instead of soldiers doesn't
make any difference. I'm taking it as seriously as I possibly
can.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate, Powell turned to his console and queued up the
film's opening credit sequence. The heroine, a plucky hen named
Ginger, has been caught making yet another escape attempt and
tossed into solitary confinement. The angry farmer turns to a trio
of hens watching fearfully from behind a wire fence. ``Nobody
escapes from Tweedy's Chicken Farm,'' he growls. The camera pulls
back from the hens' terrified faces to gradually take in the entire
compound, a network of chicken huts surrounded by barbed wire that
looks very much like a World War II prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have certain conventions for this sort of music,'' Powell
said. Beginning with the whistling POW's in ``Bridge on the River
Kwai'' and continuing with the Elmer Bernstein score for ``The
Great Escape,'' there is always a juxtaposition between a somber
military theme and a chirpy melody that is its counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, as the camera pulls back over the opening credits,
the music swells: a militarist fanfare that is gradually overtaken
with a cheery melody meant to symbolize the unvanquished spirit of
the imprisoned poultry.
</P>
<P>
   The composers began about three months ago, sitting at a
keyboard and picking out a series of main tunes. Then they broke
the movie into sections and divided the work. And finally, when
they were finished with their rough drafts, they flew to England
and did it with a live orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically how we do it,'' Powell said. ``We just sit
here for a really, really long time.''
</P>
<P>
   `SHAFT' REDUX
</P>
<P>
   John Singleton knew there were certain things he had to have to
make a new version of ``Shaft,'' the quintessential black action
movie of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew going in that there were some essential elements that I
needed,'' said Singleton, 32, the director of ``Boyz N the Hood''
(1991) and ``Rosewood'' (1997), among other films. ``I needed a
cool actor who could talk a lot of trash and people would love, and
I got that with Samuel L. Jackson. And I knew I had to have Isaac
Hayes' strong theme music. And I had to have the sly leather coat
and the clothes, and Giorgio Armani took care of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 28 years since Richard Roundtree (who has a small
role in this new film) first appeared as the black private eye who
knows how to outsmart both the crooks and the cops. This time
around, Jackson plays the original character's nephew, a New York
police officer, but he still finds himself between drug-dealing
uptown crooks and justice-corrupting downtown big shots. There are
differences between the urban world that Roundtree found in 1971
and the one Jackson finds today but there are also a lot of
similarities. ``Basically they are pretty much the same,''
Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' opens on June 16.
</P>
<P>
   For his next project, ``Baby Boy,'' an independent film that he
begins shooting this summer, Singleton said he planned to return to
South Central L.A. and the problems he chronicled in ``Boyz N the
Hood.'' It will be a followup to that film, he said, but not a
sequel. The characters, for instance, will all be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will all take place in the same neighborhood, where I
can show how things have changed and how they haven't,'' he said.
``My goal is to make the most ghetto movie ever made. I want it to
have so much soul that it just jumps off the screen and grabs
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ICING THE STAR
</P>
<P>
   David T. Friendly, producer of ``Big Momma's House,'' in which
Martin Lawrence plays an FBI agent who goes undercover as a
corpulent Southern granny, said the filmmakers were concerned about
how hard they would could push their star in the stifling heat.
Just as the film was in preproduction, Lawrence suffered a
debilitating case of heat stroke after jogging in a sweat suit near
his San Fernando Valley home. He had only barely recovered when
shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who suffered extreme heat stroke and had this
incredible recovery _ miraculous is not too strong a word _ and he
chose to take on this movie where he was going to be in a 50-pound
fat suit and go through three hours of makeup each morning,''
Friendly said. ``He could have chosen to make a movie where a
couple of people were talking in a room for most of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was quite warm on some of the movie's sets, he added.
``Big Momma's House'' opened on June 2 in a surprisingly strong
debut, earning more than $25 million in its first weekend and
almost toppling ``M:I-2'' from the top of the box-office charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up this cooling tent for him where he could go between
shots,'' he said. ``It had fresh air blown into it from four
different places. And on really hot days, he wore this apparatus
that had ice water running through plastic tubes inside the fat
suit. It was really brave of him to do this movie right after what
happened to him.''

 &HT;    AS ELECTION NEARS, FEARS THAT MEXICO'S FEDERAL PROGRAMS ARE
BEING EXPLOITED TO GAIN VOTES
 &HT;    EDS: For purposes of a locator map, San Pedro El Alto is about
100 miles northwest of Mexico City in the state of Mexico.
 &HT;    Advance for use Sunday, June 11
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO EL ALTO, Mexico Maria del Carmen Peralta usually has
little more than tortillas, beans and eggs to feed five children.
</P>
<P>
   Her family has no bathroom and sleeps in a tin-roof shed that
leaks torrents of rain and turns into a virtual icebox at night in
the cold mountain air here. More out of habit than hope, Peralta
and her kids walk almost two miles on weekends to tend a meager
cornfield while her husband, if lucky, gets a couple of dollars a
day as a brick mason's assistant in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Living on the brink, Peralta has grown dependent on Progresa, a
two-year-old federal welfare program for the poorest of Mexico's
poor. She gets $45 a month as long as she keeps her children in
school and attends regular meetings for mothers.
</P>
<P>
   But now Peralta is worried she could lose that aid.
</P>
<P>
   After years of consistently voting for Mexico's 71-year-old
ruling party, she had decided to vote for an opposition candidate
in Mexico's July 2 presidential election. Then she began to think
twice after hearing threats that if she did, she might well lose
Progresa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all talking about it. Should we dare vote against
them?'' said Peralta, 37, a Mazahua Indian who only studied up to
the fifth grade before she was put to work eking out a living in
these isolated high plains 100 north of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Federal poverty and subsidy programs like Progresa are a hot
political potato in Mexico now, just three weeks before the most
competitive presidential election in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Election watchdog groups and opposition candidates are accusing
loyalists of the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI,
of exploiting these programs. They say party officials and
bureaucrats _ especially in rural areas _ are trying to coerce
votes from recipients before an election that could be decided by
just a few percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Progresa, which President Ernesto Zedillo began in 1997,
benefits about 2.6 million Mexican families and as many as 14
million individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has 58.7 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the PRI, which has controlled the
presidency since 1929, deny political manipulation of Progresa or
other programs. And they accuse the opposition of making
unsubstantiated accusations as a pre-emptive strike to discredit
the election should the PRI win fair and square.
</P>
<P>
   A number of investigations of coercion are underway, however,
into allegations of threats and the use of government offices to
distribute election propaganda or sign-up forms pledging votes for
the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure they are using federal programs to coerce votes,''
said Rogelio Gomez, director of Civic Alliance, Mexico's main
citizens' election-watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many government workers are saying they are being pressured to
pass out sign-up sheets where people write down their name and
election-card number and pledge to vote for the PRI,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   After documenting complaints, Civic Alliance is sending them to
authorities at Mexico's Federal Elections Institute, as well as a
special congressional commission and a federal prosecutor's office
for election crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the group is in a race against time because the election is
so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unequal battle,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Almada, PRI secretary of elections, said, ``Coercion of
votes is a crime. But like all crimes it must be proved.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Pedro el Alto, where approximately 360 women are enrolled
in the Progresa program, Progresa worker Lucina Bernal told Cox
Newspapers a local PRI leader approached her on the street and told
her she would suffer ``consequences'' if she didn't make sure that
the recipients voted for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I could lose my job,'' Bernal said. ``But in this
program you are not supposed to mix politics with assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   She said other Progresa workers in town, however, have succumbed
to pressure to urge recipients to vote for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a lie,'' said Baltazar Lalaurel, a PRI leader in the
region of the state of Mexico where San Pedro El Alto is. ``This is
part of the campaign against us by the (rival) National Action
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Civic Alliance, Gomez said, began receiving similar complaints
about pressure tactics and the abuse of federal programs about
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints began coming in following a rally last month
where PRI leaders exhorted Mexico's 3 million government workers _
many organized in PRI unions _ to campaign for the party's
presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out gifts of food, T-shirts, building supplies and even
medicines is standard fare during political campaigns in Mexico and
is not necessarily illegal. Public employees are free to support
the candidates of their choice. But it is illegal to use
government-owned supplies, money, offices _ or one's position _ to
coerce voters' allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is passing out forms to public employees and asking them
to circulate them, hoping to use this network to attract at least
12 million pledges for votes for Labastida, according to published
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some bureaucrats have been discovered using their jobs or
offices to circulate the forms among recipients of programs they
administer. Others have been caught strategizing at work.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday bureaucrats at Mexico's national family-welfare
institute gathered in an auditorium during work hours to discuss
supporting the Labastida campaign. The national director later
admitted to a newspaper that the meeting was a ``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chiapas and Veracruz states, Gomez said, there are numerous
complaints about Progresa workers attempting to use their positions
to garner rural votes for the PRI. The countryside, where 30
percent of voters live, is a traditional stronghold for the ruling
party
</P>
<P>
   Civic Alliance has already documented one case, Gomez said,
where a Progresa worker in Chiapas circulated forms and unlawfully
obtained signatures or fingerprints of a number of welfare
recipients, along with the numbers of their voter credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be hard for Americans to understand this, but in our
culture this is like a magic act. If these people ask you for your
voter-credential number, you believe you are promising to vote for
them,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Civic Alliance is about to finish an investigation into similar
alleged coercion by federal workers in Oaxaca state who administer
Procampo, a subsidy program for farmers, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Mexico, Mazahua Indian Everardo Mendoza Vasquez
said he was given a PRI-related sign-up sheet to distribute to
neighbors who receive Procampo in the town of San Felipe de Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza is the Procampo coordinator in that town and he said the
form came from representatives in a local government office that
handles Procampo.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Human Network 2000,'' the form is part of the PRI
get-out-the-vote campaign in the state of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, who doesn't support the PRI, said he refused to
circulate the sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to fool people with this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said he doesn't think traditional PRI handouts of
T-shirts, buckets and building materials are as persuasive in
securing votes as they once were. But federal programs, he said,
``are serious. They help some people survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that every vote is going to count in this tight
race, in which Labastida appears to be neck-in-neck with Vicente
Fox, candidate of the National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   This week Fox began television commercials telling viewers not
to ``fear'' voting for him. ``No public servant will lose his job.
No one will lose Progresa,'' he says in the commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mexico will be critical in the election because it
contains the second largest number of votes in the whole country
after Mexico City. Vote-buying allegations have surfaced here
before. In last year's gubernatorial race, which the PRI won, a
survey found that nearly one-third of voters in the state had
received an inducement to vote _ including food and agricultural
subsidies, building materials and temporary government jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The same company that did that survey, MUND Opinion Services in
Mexico City, also did a survey recently that found that 65 percent
of Progresa recipients nationwide would vote for the PRI.

   WHITTIER, Calif. _ As he prepares to announce a series of
domestic initiatives building on the booming economy, Al Gore on
Thursday addressed the negative side of the technology revolution _
the increasing availability of personal information on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to law enforcement officers, Gore endorsed a series of
measures that would make it harder for people to obtain
confidential information, such as Social Security numbers,
financial data and medical information, now easily accessible on
the World Wide Web for a price.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president announced that the Justice Department is
asking Congress to pass a law making it a federal crime to sell
Social Security numbers, which often are the key to obtaining other
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your personal information should not be misused or abused,''
Gore said at a Los Angeles County sheriff's training facility.
``Today you can leave a trail of virtual footprints that are too
easy to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was introduced by Tim Remsburg, whose daughter, Amy Boyer,
was killed by man who found out where she worked by purchasing her
Social Security number from a Web site for $45.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that what happened to Amy was wrong and could have
and should have been avoided,'' said Remsburg, who met Gore at a
town hall meeting during the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, backed by Gore and sponsored by Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Ed. Markey, D-Mass., would make it a
civil and criminal offense to either sell or purchase Social
Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also has backed separate measures that would
protect private medical records, prosecute so-called cyberstalking,
and enforce financial privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore shared the stage Thursday with Los Angeles County Sheriff
Lee Baca, who endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain during the
presidential primaries. He has not backed Gore or his GOP rival,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore warned of the Internet's potential threats to
privacy, he also said the new technology had transformed the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the vice president will launch a new phase of his
campaign to stress advancements in the economy under the Clinton
administration and how Gore hopes to capitalize on that prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   On what Gore aides are calling his ``progress and prosperity
tour,'' the vice president will hit key battleground states to
announce domestic initiatives made possible by the healthy federal
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has said he will advocate shoring up Medicare
by ensuring that the payroll tax, now collected for the purpose of
financing the health insurance program for the elderly, is not
diverted for any other purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare hospitalization fund is expected to run out of
money in 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tentatively scheduled to roll out the Medicare
initiative in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days the vice president will likely visit
Wisconsin, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Ohio and talk about the
environment, health care, education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting next week I'm going to be talking about things we
must do to open up a new era of prosperity and progress, to build
upon a foundation of economic success we've had the last few years,
to keep that prosperity going and extend it to all who have not yet
shared in it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has been frustrated because the good economic
times have not translated into stronger voter support for the
candidate. A Bloomberg Poll released Thursday found that voters
believed Bush would do a better job on the economy than Gore by a
margin of 42 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane denied the campaign was troubled by
the lack of credit the public was giving the Democratic candidate.
He said the point of the ``progress and prosperity'' tour was ``to
remind people just how far we've come in the last 7{ years.''

   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost the Michelangelo of editorial cartooning,'' said
Dayton Daily News editorial cartoonist Mike Peters, a longtime
friend of Jeff MacNelly. ``He was truly one of the great
cartoonists of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters recalled that he met MacNelly in 1970, soon after Peters
had begun working for the Dayton Daily News and as MacNelly was
beginning his career at the Richmond News Leader. ``He depressed
me,'' Peters said. ``I just met this guy whose work was so good,
that I left the convention early to go work on my own cartoons.''
</P>
<P>
   From that day, Peters said the strength of MacNelly's work
continued to push Peters and other editorial cartoonists to be
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like light shining through a crystal, reflecting colors, he
had the ability to observe the same things you and I see, and to
know what is usable and what is not,'' Peters said.

`BOOKWARS': SELLING BOOKS ON THE STREET IN A QUALITY-OF-LIFE TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The documentary ``Bookwars,'' a minor film about the
book vendors who populate the streets of Manhattan, does not get
into the wars until the last 20 minutes of the picture. Before that
section, which deals with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's ``quality of
life'' mission _ which, among other things, sought to clear
Manhattan streets of vendors _ ``Bookwars'' is a slice of true
life.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Rosette, who directed, edited and narrated the movie (it
begins with the credit ``A Rosette flick'') uses the phrase
``adventures in the book trade,'' and though it's not as
high-concept as ``Bookwars,'' the statement is more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The film grazes the culture of the people who sell books al
fresco; Rosette spent time peddling literature and other volumes on
New York's streets himself and uses a mix of videotape and film to
capture fleeting moments and eccentric characters. There's Pete,
who's the elder, and Rick, who's in training to be a magician, and
Paul, who's referred to as ``the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosette also shows the kinds of reading material found in
different areas. The Avenue of the Americas ``had more comic books
and porno magazines,'' he says in his mellow voice-over. ``West
Fourth Street was heavy into literature and philosophy. `Naked
Lunch' is a best seller, and `On the Road.''' To the surprise of
absolutely no one watching the film, Rosette plied his trade on
West Fourth. Cool jazz by artists like the organist Jack McDuff can
be heard on the soundtrack, complementing the unruffled narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bookwars'' provides a glimpse into the way these guys find
materials, scouting yard sales and libraries that are getting rid
of unwanted books. When the police start harassing the street
vendors, pressing them to produce taxpayer identification numbers
or confiscating their wares, a little tension is introduced.
Rosette notes that the First Amendment offers protection for the
street vendors, a protection that a court ruling emphasizes. Yet
the assaults by the city and New York University on the vendors'
livelihood does take a toll, driving many off the streets, and into
a few happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, ``Bookwars'' _ which ambled through mini-profiles
of Rosette's fellow vendors, all men though not much is made of
this _ is nearly over. There are very few memorable moments: a
gray-haired man comes to one table looking for a paperback edition
of ``The Subterraneans,'' which featured the man modeling on its
cover. The movie is like spending an idle afternoon browsing, and
not buying.  &QL;

HARVARD ALUMNI HEAR SCHOLARLY DISCUSSION OF GLOBALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Harvard-Nigerian)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The punch line of Amartya Sen's opening joke,
a sort of erudite form of self-deprecation, sparked a chuckle among
many alumni in attendance Thursday as the renowned Indian economist
delivered Harvard's keynote commencement address.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Dryden, the English poet, has offered the sobering
thought that honor is `but an empty bubble,' '' the Nobel Laureate
said in opening a weighty speech on the pros and cons of globalism.
``But we honorary graduates refuse to be put off by old Dryden _
especially today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that Dryden was only trying to rhyme with
the previous line of his poem,'' Sen said. ``Having said, `War, he
sung, was toil and trouble,' it would have been difficult to resist
the temptation to rhyme it with, `Honor but an empty bubble...' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was a commencement speech, perhaps, only deliverable to an
audience of Harvard alumni and graduates. The dense address,
sprinkled with citations from Francis Bacon and John Kenneth
Galbraith, even included a bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the students in Harvard Yard Thursday afternoon,
however, were less concerned with the words than the fact the
keynote speech was delivered to the annual meeting of the Harvard
Alumni Association instead of to the graduating class. The
students' ceremony was held in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it reflects the priorities of the university,'' said
Isaac Hodes, 23, a social studies major. ``The university is a
corporation. And this shows how they're more interested in catering
to donors than students.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rebecca Symington, 31, who graduated Thursday from Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government, pointed out that the students are now
alumni. ``Tomorrow, we've been invited to an alumni brunch,'' she
said. ``I guess they're starting early on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning ceremony featured a fellow graduate, Arese Ukpoma
Carrington. A survivor of Nigeria's civil war who later became a
doctor and married a US ambassador, she urged students to uphold
social justice and promote public health throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon ceremony, men festooned in large black top hats
and others clad in kilts and playing Scottish marches on bagpipes
led hundreds of gray-haired alumni to seats set in rows across
Harvard Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial moment was flush with pride and nostalgia for
Loretta Cornell, who graduated Radcliffe in 1945. Led by the
university band, she and many others in attendance sang a song
about their alma mater with as much enthusiasm as some generate for
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very emotional experience,'' said Cornell, who has
returned for commencement almost every year since 1970. ``It just
brings back so many memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, before the official keynote speech, Harvard featured
another Nobel Laureate, Irish poet Seamus Heaney. He delivered
several brief poems. One evoked the joy and anguish of a student's
search for knowledge. Another focused on how Harvard must steer
clear of elitism and remain open to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Sen's speech was as much as globalization has
helped spread wealth throughout the world, it has also contributed
to increasing inequality. While the pros may outweigh the cons of
globalization, he said, the cons can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot, to use Francis Bacon's word's, let these broader
doubts (about globalization) pass `lightly without intervention,'
'' he said.

NICE GUY FINISHES FIRST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On perennial TV powerhouse ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' Bill Brochtrup
plays a sweet, sensitive guy who's always taking care of others.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Snakebit,'' the award-winning comic drama now at West
Hollywood's Coast Playhouse, Brochtrup plays another sweet,
sensitive guy who's always taking care of others.
</P>
<P>
   Now guess what kind of guy Bill Brochtrup seems in person?
(Hint: You probably wouldn't cast him as the lead in ``Richard
III.'')
</P>
<P>
   But don't be too sure. Although he has been installed on
``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' for seven seasons as the kind, openly gay and
preternaturally efficient police administrative aide John Irvin,
Brochtrup's acting career has been anything but uniform. He's
hoping to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that typecasting is kind of endemic to acting,'' says
Brochtrup while taking a between-rehearsals break from ``Snakebit''
at a West Hollywood bistro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Franz has played a lot of cops. He played like 37 cops
or something on TV shows. Those guys on `The Sopranos' played a lot
of mobsters and Italian guys. There's a certain sensibility that
people have that makes it easy to cast them in things. So when
there's a gay character on something, someone will usually call my
agent. But I think we're all in acting trying to show that we can
do more than people think we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a few months off from ministering to the emotional needs
of Franz's homophobic Andy Sipowicz, Brochtrup, 37, is proving with
``Snakebit'' that he can swing from big-budget TV and film to off-
Broadway theater without skipping a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Written by actor/playwright David Marshall Grant, a Tony nominee
for his performance as a closeted right-wing Mormon lawyer in
``Angels in America,'' ``Snakebit'' shares certain thematic
similarities with Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama about
love and morality in the age of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Brochtrup plays Michael, an innately decent and
compassionate gay L.A. social worker suffering through a series of
personal crises, including a recent breakup with his boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   His world gets further shaken by a visit from a volatile
straight couple: self-centered actor Jonathan (Christopher Gartin)
and former actress (and Michael's ex-lover) Jenifer (Andrea
Bendewald).
</P>
<P>
   The play enjoyed a long run last spring and summer at the Grove
Playhouse and Century Center in New York, and received both Drama
Desk and Outer Critics Circle award nominations for best play (it
lost out on both to ``Wit,'' starring Grant's ``Angels'' colleague
Kathleen Chalfant).
</P>
<P>
   New York Times theater critic Peter Marks described ``Snakebit''
as a ``deeply satisfying comedy-drama about days of waning love and
friendship in Los Angeles,'' and praised Brochtrup's ``knockout
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. engagement will be brief (through July 2), partly to
accommodate some of its participants' fall TV shooting schedules.
But Brochtrup says he was thrilled when the play's producers asked
him to reprise his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very Los Angeles kind of a play,'' says Brochtrup, who
was born in Southern California and raised in Tacoma, Wash. ``I've
lived here for quite a few years, and when I read this it struck me
as the truest thing that I had read in a long time. It was about
people I knew, in their 30s, living in Los Angeles, the way that
they speak, the things they were talking about, just struck me as
being very true, very real.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochtrup notes some parallels in the emotional makeup of
Michael and John Irvin _ up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a similarity in that I think this character (Michael)
takes in a great deal of what goes on around him and is extremely
sensitive to the needs of the other people at the expense of his
own needs at times. That's kind of what the play is about to me, is
Michael's learning to stand up for himself and to say, 'This is who
I am, these are my needs, this is what I have to do for me. I can't
be there for you and you and you and you and everyone else's
problems.' We haven't seen that happen to John Irvin.''
</P>
<P>
   Both on TV and in theater, Brochtrup, who is gay, has frequently
portrayed gay characters. Two seasons ago at the Pasadena
Playhouse, in the world premiere of Jonathan Tolin's ``If Memory
Serves,'' he portrayed a famous actress's gay personal assistant
who views life as one vast ``Mildred Pierce'' remake.
</P>
<P>
   In another career-building role, he played a saintly,
AIDS-stricken male model in the off-Broadway drama ``Raft of the
Medusa,'' which drew him to an ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' producer's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running ABC hit not only has made Brochtrup practically
a household name: His portrayal of John Irvin also has twice earned
awards from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for its
positive representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's limiting,'' he says of playing so many gay
characters, `'but I don't worry about that, for a couple reasons.
One, I think that I try only to play characters that I think are
well-written. I pass on a lot of things that I don't think are
well-written, gay characters and straight characters. So if I can
play gay characters my whole life who are as well-written as
'Snakebit' and 'N.Y.P.D. Blue,' it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochtrup plans to get out of town for a few weeks this summer
after ``Snakebit'' closes. He'll have to hurry back though:
``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' resumes shooting Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he was switching between ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' and
``Snakebit,'' his mind and body kept hop-scotching between coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go in on these bright, sunny days (in L.A.) and put on
these overcoats, and pretend it's New York. Then I went to New York
(to do 'Snakebit') and we put on shorts and sandals and walked
around like in a Beechwood Canyon house. It was a very strange
experience. And now it's finally getting it right, to be in the
right place doing the right thing.''

FAMILY OF SILENT FILM STAR NOT KEEPING QUIET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, the great physical comedy of silent film greats
such as Charlie Chaplin would seem wonderfully suited for transfer
to the Internet. The films don't even need sound to have an impact,
and the jerkiness of the old films is an odd echo of what happens
when Net congestion hits a Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see any of Chaplin's great features legally
available on the Internet any time soon, said his daughter,
Josephine, who is the liaison between the comedian's descendants
and Association Chaplin, the Paris-based organization devoted to
preserving his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything on the Net,'' said Josephine Chaplin.
``It's such a small screen. It becomes something banal. To put it
on the Net, it seems degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is a concern about loss of control over the
comedian's work, because his work could easily be chopped up
online, Josephine Chaplin said.
</P>
<P>
   Once it's on the Net, ``We don't know where it's going,'' she
said. ``People are cutting things up, there's a question of
quality. We just want to keep it in its entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans !ital!can look forward to seeing more of Chaplin's work on
DVD, however. At the end of next year, the family will begin
working with a new distributor, enhancing DVDs of 11 Chaplin
features with the massive archive of outtakes, photographs and
other archival material compiled through the Association Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest will be the shots Chaplin cut when he
reissued his films in 1971. The family won't, however, release the
films' original versions, even though they had been in the public
eye for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through and made the cuts, which were his final
cuts,'' Josephine Chaplin said. ``They were very good cuts. We'll
just put out the final versions. It was his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Chaplin's best-known, and loved, works will be on display
tonight in beautiful form at UCLA's Royce Hall, when the Los
Angeles Chamber Orchestra plays with a newly struck print of his
1936 satire of the Industrial Age, ``Modern Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which will tour 25 other cities around the world with
live orchestras over the next 18 months, still has some things to
say about technology and humanity three-quarters of a century and
one Information Revolution after it was created. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Beat it
</P>
<P>
   One of the more smirk-inducing announcements of last month's
Electronic Entertainment Expo was word that singer Michael Jackson
will be among the wild array of virtual boxers in the sequel to
Midway's fun, funny Ready 2 Rumble videogame.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who apparently is a big fan of the original R2R,
contacted Midway about being in the sequel, and subsequently had
his dance and boxing moves motion-captured, the company said. Ready
2 Rumble: Round 2, due in November on five gaming platforms, also
will include Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, other
secret celebrities and 11 of the original game's fighters.
</P>
<P>

Hobby horse
</P>
<P>
   America's gone to the birds, says Brent Cohen, the chief
operating officer of eHobbies.com (at www.ehobbies.com). Or more
properly, it's spending a lot of money on birding, as much as $34
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Santa Monica-based eHobbies has begun selling birding
supplies, like field guides, feeders, binoculars and the like,
including all the products of the biggest birding house, Kalmbach
Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has jumped into astronomy and comic books and
action figures. The site will offer about 7,000 comics and figures,
along with apparel, posters and related collectibles, and recently
acquired Next Planet Over, one of the better Web sites in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   And for amateur astronomers (who have made huge contributions to
the field, identifying all sorts of heavenly bodies), they'll offer
everything from inexpensive computer software and books to $5,000
telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   EHobbies already sold radio-controlled toys, diecast models,
rocketry and trains, and tools and supplies for all those areas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still smarting
</P>
<P>
   It billed itself as ``the first smart club,'' but the Hollywood
edition of New York's beloved Knitting Factory isn't feeling so
smart this week. It won't make its scheduled Wednesday debut party
because of construction and permit delays, spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   The entire club is to be wired to the Web, to pump programming
to and from KnitMedia's fine Internet site
(www.knittingfactory.com). A wad of interesting acts already booked
into the club were left scrambling for other venues because of the
delays.
</P>
<P>
   When it !ital!does open, the club will be located next to the
Hollywood Entertainment Museum in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard.
Best guess for a more realistic opening date is three to five
weeks. &QL;

Our rating: 2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans has always been considered a big sinkhole of lust
and corruption metaphorically in Hollywood entertainment, but in
``On Hostile Ground,'' the city is literally depicted as a seamy,
praetorian sinkhole. This disaster teleflick expends a lot of
energy convincing viewers of the science that posits the Big Easy
as a Big Queasy _ huge underground pockets are giving way, sucking
the populace down with them _ but of course it's really more
interested in the requisite splashy carnage than connecting the
rudimentary narrative dots.
</P>
<P>
   We're in the season of the big, dumb summer movie, and this is
TV's version: spectacle on a budget. It follows the tried-and-true
formula that ``Jaws'' made evergreen way back when: Something's
threatening the townsfolk, but addressing it, even admitting it,
would dry up those tasty tourist dollars, so everyone plays ostrich
and ignores the problems until all hell breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   John Corbett stars as Matt, an engineer haunted by a past
mistake (although since he's our hero, it's clear that the mistake
wasn't !ital!his mistake). He's one half of the city's power
couple; the other is his girlfriend, Allison Beauchamp (Jessica
Steen), a mayoral assistant whose perky niece (Brittany Daniel) is
in town to party down during Mardi Gras. Matt and Allison are the
quintessential cute couple, but his gun-shy nature is in need of a
good natural disaster to prod him into tying the knot.
</P>
<P>
   Duly noted. So when bodies start disappearing down sinkholes,
Matt urges caution _ pointing to a crack in a French Quarter
sidewalk, he barks, ``This wasn't here two days ago!'' But the
requisite weaselly mayoral media attache (Peter Stebbings) doctors
evidence so the mayor allows the revelry to continue unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have no story if a guy advises caution and
authorities heed his advice and then nothing of note happens, so of
course the mayor's is a disastrous decision from which only Matt
can save the city. Naturally, said perky niece will be endangered
while wearing a white Lycra catsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of semi-special effects create some modest disaster _
if your eyes don't pop, they won't shut tight, either. Corbett and
Steen lead an admirably committed cast (although no one in the
whole movie manages a Southern, let alone Cajun, accent). Its score
blends zydeco and generic action-thriller music incongruously yet
somewhat successfully _ and therefore, amusingly. It's likely no
dumber _ nor smarter _ than any of the other formulaic stuff you'll
see this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ----- &QL; 
The show: ``On Hostile Ground.'' &QL; 
What: Thriller about a sinkhole swallowing New Orleans during Mardi
Gras. &QL; 
The stars: John Corbett, Jessica Steen, Brittany Daniel. &QL; 
Where: TBS. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight; also Saturday and June 24.

RUSSIA TO KEEP CONTROL OF CHECHNYA, PUTIN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a sign that the Kremlin intends to rule Chechnya
with an iron hand for as long as it takes to suppress separatist
rebels, President Vladimir V. Putin took personal control Thursday
over the rebel province's day-to-day affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's declaration of presidential rule in Chechnya, analysts
here said, was a signal that the Kremlin does not intend to
negotiate with the separatists after waging war on them for eight
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian power has returned to Chechnya forever,'' said Sergei
Ivanov, secretary of Putin's Security Council, in televised
comments. ``The president has taken upon himself full powers over
Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Moscow said the step would make the breakaway
region easier to govern. But with the Chechen rebels stepping up
guerrilla raids on Russian forces, analysts said that Moscow was in
for a drawn-out conflict against angry and battle-hardened fighters
with nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how Chechnya's war-weary population will react.
The Kremlin said presidential rule could last up to three years. In
1997, Chechens elected Aslan Maskhadov president in a vote that
international observers called free and fair and Moscow recognized
as legitimate. Since then, however, the Kremlin has branded
Maskhadov a criminal and refused his repeated calls for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian authorities have ruled out any negotiations with
the resistance in Chechnya,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a
Moscow-based defense analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's decree said Chechnya would be run by a provisional
government headed by a Kremlin-appointed official answerable only
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is expected to name his choice in a matter of days. The
state-controlled RTR television station reported that the leading
candidate was Nikolai Koshman, who served as the Moscow
representative to the region until his post was abolished Thursday.
Putin is also considering appointing a Chechen who is loyal to
Moscow, RTR reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they appoint a pro-Moscow Chechen, who will of course be a
figurehead, this will be presented to the world as a move toward a
peaceful settlement. If they appoint Koshman, nothing will change
except Koshman's title,'' Felgenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other analysts said that Russia is so detested by
Chechens that no Kremlin-appointed government can wield enough
authority to halt guerrilla ambushes against Russian troops in a
conflict that has seen gruesome atrocities on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International said Thursday that
Russian forces in Chechnya routinely rape, torture, and beat
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are raped, beaten with hammers and clubs, tortured with
electric shocks and tear gas, their teeth are sawn and some are
beaten around both ears simultaneously to burst the ear drums,''
the organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have been killed by the Russians, had their
relatives killed, or had their property burned and looted,''
Felgenhauer said. ``There is so much hatred toward the Russians
now,''
</P>
<P>
   The military claims to have defeated all but a handful of the
rebels, but the highly mobile fighters have waged a fierce
guerrilla campaign, killing 15 to 20 Russian soldiers a week.
Attacks on Russian positions are an almost daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian soldier was killed Thursday when his armored truck
was blown up by a radio-controlled mine. A top Russian military
commander, Valery Konovalov, was wounded Wednesday when rebels
fired on his car southwest of the republic's capital Grozny. Also
Wednesday, two Russian police officers were killed in a suicide
attack by rebels who drove a car filled with explosives into a
police station in the town of Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win Chechen civilians over, Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov unveiled a $276 million plan to rebuild
the province's shattered economy and infrastructure and provide
social services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Measures to restore vital infrastructure and the health and
education systems must be a priority,'' Kasyanov said at a Cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin launched its military assault on Chechnya in late
September 1999 after a series of apartment bombings that killed
hundreds of people in Russian cities. Authorities blamed Chechen
rebels for the bombings, although the Chechens deny involvement.

VICTORY LOOMS LARGE FOR PIERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The ball looked as big as a melon to Mary Pierce, and
she lashed out at it boldly, hungrily, with both hands, like her
man, Roberto Alomar, about to devour a hanging curve.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis, billed as the best tennis player on this planet,
was on her sneakered heels. She was one point _ one swing _ from
defeat, and all France was poised to celebrate. It was in Mary's
hands: a place in the final of the French Open, which no
French-blooded woman has won for 33 years . . . and she blew it.
</P>
<P>
   She backhanded the ball well beyond the baseline, and the mass
groan of 15,166 patriots stuffed into tumultuous Stade Roland
Garros could be heard all the way to Montreal, Pierce's birthplace.
Match point had vanished, and Hingis clung to her serve to 5-5,
eventually winning the second set and pulling even.
</P>
<P>
   Would there be another sip for Mighty Mary, who is about as
French as Coca-Cola, but today is being toasted across the country
as a commodity as precious as a great Champagne? Could the
American-bred, French passport-clutching Pierce, frequently the
victim of nerves in the chaos of this claypit, firm up enough to
disregard the bungled opportunity and keep French hearts from
bleeding?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, saluted by none other than the president of the
Repblic, Jacques Chirac, was a resounding, ``Oui!'' Over the phone,
following Mary's momentous 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, triumph, he, a tennis
hacker, declared that she is Jacques's favorite jock.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else's, too. As far as Chirac and the citizenry are
concerned, she's as French as Joan of Arc, Edith Piaf, and Madame
Dafarge, even though she hasn't lived in the country longer than a
few months, some time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am American and I am French, and I'm proud of both,'' said
Pierce, offspring of a French mother and American father, after
breaking Hingis's strangehold on her: seven wins in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary is international,'' said Nathalie Tauziat, the leading
French player of the last decade, and at first resentful of Pierce
trying to fit into her country's Federation Cup team. ``And we are
glad to have part of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough. The United States had its chance for her sporting
allegiance, but the US Tennis Association declined giving financial
support she needed, wary of her overbearing father.
</P>
<P>
   That first match point appeared hopefully and disappeared
darkly. Throughout the stadium and the land, witnesses mourned,
fearing that the chance for a successor to 1967's victor, Francoise
Durr, was gone for another year. But the 33-year-old drought will
end Saturday _ if Mary can solve the cunning of Conchita Martinez.
Conchita won Spanish bragging rights in a 6-1, 6-2, self-liberating
defeat of three-time champ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, against whom
she had been 3-13.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce conceded, ``Yeah, I was nervous on that match point.
Trying for a little too much.'' She had just undergone 2 1/2 hours
of IV'ing and other treatment for a ``startling, first ever attack
of leg cramps. I was contemplating suicide at that moment,'' she
said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just really . . . tried not to get upset. I kept
thinking that was a chance I let slip, but I tried to stay calm in
the third. I still get nervous. I still get tight. But I've learned
from experience to stay relaxed and not worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like 1994,'' she said, recalling her debut as a
French finalist, a loss to Sanchez Vicario, 6-4, 6-4. ``I was 18.
I'd been playing great (crunching defending champion Steffi Graf,
6-2, 6-2, in the semis), but I started thinking about it too much.
I thought, `Oh, God, I'll have to give my victory speech in French'
_ and my French was poor then. I practiced the whole night and I
was a nervous wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous wreckage has been strewn throughout her emotional life,
but Pierce is clearly overcoming. And recovering from the mental
(sometimes physical) bruising by dear old dad, Jim Pierce, the man
who put her on a court and drove her toward the heights. She had to
get a restraining order against him. However, as she gains greater
self-belief, there has been something of a rapprochement. They talk
on the phone; she accepts tennis advice.
</P>
<P>
   Her romance with Alomar, another competitive type, and
``newfound religious faith'' have been stabilizing. Fingering the
rosary around her neck at difficult moments, this Mary hailed
another one, then gunned groundies that kept Hingis without a
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But 53 long minutes passed before Pierce got her second look at
a decisive point. Though her legs were pinched and buckling in the
jaws of cramps, she seized this one _ in both hands again, a
roaring backhand that Hingis couldn't handle. Court Central erupted
as though Vesuvius while she blew kisses to the throng, and planted
a real one on Hingis, her doubles partner and superior for so long.
Pierce last floored the kid four years ago, when Hingis was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time Mary was in the final,'' said Hingis. ``I was
13, playing the junior final against Sonia Jeyaseelan. I won but
she didn't. But today, Mary ran me too much with those drives from
corner to corner, more than two hours (2:10). I had come back from
that match point, but by the time I saw her stretching herself, in
trouble with cramps, I was too much tired. It was too late for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brilliant performance, Mary solidly controlled points from
the baseline, punctuating the backcourt assault with surprise
rushes for scoring volleys. She busted Hingis for 3-1 in the last
set, but Martina retaliated to 2-3 as the multitude seethed and
squirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Pierce's day in the sunshine and fair, if tricky,
winds. Roland Garros has been a haunted house for Hingis. Loser of
last year's uproarious final to Steffi Graf, upset in the final of
1997 by the fleeting Iva Majoli and the 1998 semi by Monica Seles,
she has felt the weight of crowds pulling against her, the cocky
prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it,'' said Hingis, a pro not alibi-ing. From 2-3
down, she melted as Pierce made her throttling move, permitting
only four more points.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce stroked to 5-2, and the crowd bobbed deliriously, doing
the wave for a couple of minutes, a prelude to their lady's washing
away Hingis's serve in the concluding game.
</P>
<P>
   Once more the match point ball looked big, as big as the moon,
and Pierce made a mighty moon shot.

   A Complex Film in a Plain Wrap
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted this movie to be wrapped in brown paper, like
pornography,'' David Fincher said. This week Fox released his film
``Fight Club'' on DVD in a slipcase illustrated to look like a
wrapper tied with twine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it with the VHS box,'' he said, ``but we gave that up
to get the DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, a desensitized
young insomniac (Edward Norton) calls on a primal aspect of
himself, personified by an anarchic '60s-style radical named Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), to help reclaim his masculinity by breaking
down and coming back together. Part of the process takes place in a
club, started by the two of them, where depressed, threatened young
men gather to work out their rage and feelings of inferiority by
beating one another bloody.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie was released last fall, preconceived notions of
violence turned off many filmgoers, as did negative reports of
Durden's strutting nihilism. Generally, though, reviews noted the
movie's wit and subtle complexity. ``This film twists and turns in
ways that only add up fully on the way out of the theater and might
just require another viewing,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Her thought makes a blurb on the back of the DVD box, but
Fincher said that while he appreciates viewers taking another look
on video, the film got its due in theaters. ``It's the kind of
movie that's going to divide people,'' he said. ``You don't read
the book and say here's a mainstream fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD, he added, is essentially for preservation. ``I don't know
if the film will have another life on DVD, but it will be the
record that lasts the longest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film comes on two discs in an elaborately designed package
that opens like a book. The first disc contains the film in the
wide-screen, letter-box format and four separate movie-length
commentaries by Fincher, the stars and various others involved,
including Palahnuik and the screenwriter, Jim Uhls.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Seven,'' another violent and controversial
film starring Pitt that underwent frequently favorable second
thoughts after its theater run in 1995, Fincher is also known for
lightning-fast visuals and computer-generated manipulations. The
technical aspects work best on disc. ``I'm much happier having a
wide-screen DVD out there than simply a panned-and-scanned DVD,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second disc has extended scenes of the film being made.
``They must have been thinking about DVD or some sort of
after-market,'' said David Pryor, a designer and producer of DVD's
who made these discs.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher said that there were no such thoughts at the time, but
he came to appreciate the wealth of material later.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was shot from multiple angles. ``I wanted to use as
much of that behind-the-scenes stuff as possible,'' Pryor said.
</P>
<P>
   Is all of this, not to mention the hours of commentary, too
much? ``Nobody is forced to look at it,'' he said. ``It's such a
dense movie, the more perspectives you can get the better.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   The Green Mile
</P>
<P>
   Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) recalls spiritual revelations when he
was chief guard on death row in a Southern prison during the 1930s.
A fastidious, compassionate man with a painful bladder infection,
Edgecomb runs an orderly operation until the arrival of John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), an enormous man convicted of rape and
murder. Coffey seems as gentle as his crimes are heinous, and he is
possessed with an inner power to cure maladies. Could he have
committed such crimes? Adapted from Stephen King's novel, Frank
Darabont's film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``boils
down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one
that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits.''
</P>
<P>
   -1999. Warner. $109.99; DVD, 188 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bicentennial Man
</P>
<P>
   When the owner (Sam Neill) of an industrial robot named Andrew
(Robin Williams) discovers that it has creative powers, he sets the
machine up as a clockmaker. But Andrew longs to be a human and
generations later, when robots possess the emotions to fall in
love, he envisions marriage to his former employer's great
granddaughter (Embeth Davidtz). Free to employ all of Williams'
moist, sad-clown expressions, Chris Columbus' film ``pours on the
sentimentality in lumpy mawkish speeches about freedom, the joys of
sex and the meaning of life'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   -1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 131 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG. Release date: June 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Miracle
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Shore (Ed Harris), a Chicago priest suffering a
crisis of faith, is assigned to look into the mystical phenomena
associated with Helen O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa), an immigrant woman
who is being considered for canonization. Delving into her life,
Father Shore develops a strong attraction for her daughter, Roxanna
(Anne Heche). Strong with this story element and avoiding the
flashy telekinetic mayhem typical of the religious genre, Agnieszka
Holland's film nevertheless ``becomes bogged down in fussy
theological arguments'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   -1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 119 minutes.
Closed captioned. R. Release date: June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Play It to the Bone
</P>
<P>
   Two burned-out middleweights, Vince (Woody Harrelson) and Cesar
(Antonio Banderas), sign to fight a 10-rounder in Las Vegas.
Needing transportation, they are driven across the desert by Grace
(Lolita Davidovich), who was Vince's lover and is about to break up
with Cesar. Both fighters have blown big chances and their case
histories are hashed over perhaps too thoroughly during the trip.
Their fight, a slugfest with flashbacks and hallucinations,
resolves little in a film that ``ends up stranded in serio-comic
limbo'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   -1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 124 minutes. Closed
captioned. R. Release date: June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in
earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   WITNESS PROTECTION. When the petty mobster Bobby Batton (Tom
Sizemore) gets caught cheating on his bosses and is ordered killed,
he decides to rat on them to the authorities. That lands lands him,
his wife (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and children (Shawn Hatosy
and Skye McCole Bartusiak) in a duplex apartment where they are
taught how live in the federal witness-protection program by a U.S.
marshall (Steve Beck). They have a lot to learn, especially the
arrogant Bobby, and, Ron Wertheimer wrote in the New York Times,
the ``process of forced metamorphosis is both fascinating and
frightening.'' 1999. HBO. $79.99; DVD, $19.98. 101 minutes. Closed
captioned. Release date: June 13.
</P>
<P>
   POETRY IN MOTION and IMAGINE THE SOUND. Two films by Ron Mann

Bukowski, Amiri Baraka William S. Burroughs, John Cage, Allen
Ginsberg and Robert Creely, among others, appear in ``Poetry in
Motion'' (1982, 90 minutes). Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, Bill Dixon
and Paul Bley are featured in ``Imagine the Sound'' (1981, 90
minutes). Home Vision. $19.95 each.

XCHANGE STRENGTHENS CUSTOMER-ANALYSIS ROLE WITH ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Xchange Inc., which helps the likes of Staples Inc. and
DaimlerChrysler take information from their customer databases and
fashion it into targeted marketing campaigns, has signed a
definitive agreement to buy CustomerAnalytics, a privately held
Dallas firm.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock transaction is completed later this month,
CustomerAnalytics would receive about 5.2 million shares of Xchange
stock. On Nasdaq, Xchange shares rose $2.1875 Thursday to close at
$23.125. Based on that price, the deal could have a value of around
$120 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the fast-growing arena of customer-relationship management,
Xchange aims to be a soup-to-nuts provider. By buying
CustomerAnalytics, its third acquisition in less than a year,
Xchange adds one more entree to its menu of services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This helps close the loop for them,'' said Tom Richards,
research director of Meridian Research, which follows the
customer-relationship industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, CustomerAnalytics had revenues of $17.7 million, much
of it coming from financial services clients such as FleetBoston
Financial and Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. In 1999, Xchange earned $1.1
million on revenues of $43.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Xchange, a Boston company that until recently was known as
Exchange Applications Inc., began life as a firm that composed
direct-mail letters and scripts for telemarketers on behalf of
financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, it has sought to broaden its range and pursue
clients outside the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Xchange bought a Seattle company that specializes in
marketing on the Web and with e-mails. In April, Xchange bought a
Boston database mining company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to help our clients optimize relationships with
their customers,'' said Dan Haley, Xchange's chief deal officer.
</P>
<P>
   With Xchange's help, clients analyze their databases to identify
their most profitable customers and to predict future behavior
based on a customer's past habits.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Xchange helps clients use that information to devise
marketing campaigns to very narrow segments of profitable
customers. Those campaigns can use e-mails, direct mail, or a
telemarketer's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Xchange seeks to measure the effectiveness of those
marketing campaigns to determine which ones might be used again.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a bank client, Xchange's software package might
be used at the bank's central office. CustomerAnalytics specializes
in a simpler package that can be deployed to all of the bank's
branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   When a customer comes into a branch, the system gives a branch
manager the customer's history and can offer suggestions for
pitching the customer additional bank products.

THE DRAMA OF DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance preceded drama in ancient days and the tension
between the two forms is felt today in choreography. Ballet, more
than modern dance, has seen the comeback of an old opera-house
genre, the full-evening narrative spectacle. But plotless ballets,
sometimes dramatic in an abstract way, continue to reign supreme
among American choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   To tell a story or not is far from a burning issue: dance-drama
is no longer a contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, the great
divide in aesthetics exists, is mirrored in public taste, and is
embodied this weekend at American Ballet Theater and New York City
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling dominates in ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' John
Cranko's boisterous treatment of Shakespeare's comedy, which has
its company premiere Friday night at Ballet Theater, with two
performances Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House. A high point
is Kate's rollicking romance with a drumstick as Petruchio tries to
starve her into submission. Cranko was a man of the theater and
``Shrew'' was a big hit in the Stuttgart Ballet's debut season in
New York in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if no one goes to ``Swan Lake'' just for the story, I am
not sure one attends ``Shrew'' for the dancing. I once timed the
ballet's opening moments to see how long it took before anyone
danced a conventional step: 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cranko had two wonderful virtuoso leads, Marcia Haydee and
Richard Cragun, for whom he created his typical Soviet-style duets.
But in 1969 ``Shrew'' masked the weak technique of a young
ensemble. ``Shrew'' is a brilliant exercise in blocked-out movement
rather than real choreography. It is dance poor in certain respects
but expressive physical theater in its storytelling. Compare
``Shrew'' to ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the musical based on the same
material, and you won't miss the words. Domenico Scarlatti, whose
music is used in the ballet, is no Cole Porter, but then Porter is
no Scarlatti.
</P>
<P>
   Across Lincoln Center plaza, New York City Ballet makes the case
in its Diamond Project (a series of new works) that pure form in
dance can be expressive in itself.
</P>
<P>
   This was an idea shared by the French poet Stephane Mallarme,
who saw ballet as an art that invoked an ideal through abstraction.
The female dancer, in his view, could be part of a narrative but
she operated on a level akin to poetry: like a poem, her dancing
required no ``scribe,'' as he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Plotless choreography, as promoted by City Ballet's co-founder,
George Balanchine, constantly reveals rich levels of formal
structures and combinations of steps in relation to music. But it
can also be too plain, with nothing behind a classroom display.
</P>
<P>
   Pure dance has nevertheless been the norm in the Diamond
Project, established in 1992 by Peter Martins, City Ballet's
artistic director, to encourage new choreographers. The latest
premiere, Christopher d'Amboise's ``Triptych,'' will be performed
Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater, and Kevin O'Day's
``Swerve Poems'' is to be repeated Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth and ninth premieres are by Martins on June 17 and
Miriam Mahdaviani on June 20. The Martins work will be seen along
with his ``Todos Buenos Aires'' and ``Slonimsky's Earbox.'' Both of
these were performed at the May 3 gala that included Christopher
Wheeldon's ``Mercurial Manoeuvres'' and Helgi Tomasson's ``Prism.''
</P>
<P>
   So successful were these four plotless ballets that one was
obliged to rethink some occasional dark thoughts, namely that City
Ballet should widen its range. It could even revert to the dramatic
works and eclectic repertory it had from 1948 through the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Martins smiles at news conferences when asked if any
choreographers would be drummed out of the New York State Theater
should they attempt a story ballet under his watch. There is no
rule, he replies, except that the classical vocabulary must be used
by every choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   City Ballet today is the company as it was redefined by
Balanchine from the 1970s until his death in 1983. Like many
artists in the twilight of their careers, he pared his work down to
essentials. Essentials in the Balanchine canon meant identifying
music with dancing. Virtually all new ballets were suddenly named
after their musical titles and older ones like Balanchine's
``Ballet Imperial'' were stripped down to plain costumes and
retitled after a score (``Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2'').
</P>
<P>
   The process was carried on with a vengeance in the festivals
that Balanchine organized in tribute to composers: Stravinsky (1972
and 1982), Ravel (1975) and Tchaikovsky (1981). Even a Balanchine
work that seems to hover around the edges of dance-drama like the
1980 ``Robert Schumann's `Davidsbundlertanze,''' given this season,
is really about its music. Here, Balanchine seemed to tell a story
about a Schumann-like figure descending into madness against Rouben
Ter-Arutunian's neo-Romantic decor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work's ruling image of the alienated artist was directly
related to the music's coded references to the composer's imaginary
brotherhood arrayed against the Philistines. Even at his most
theatrical, Balanchine offered a translation of the music as he
understood it.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine himself could turn out full-evening original
narrative works. Two of his most innovative ballets were ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1962), more musical than literary in its
inspiration, and ``Don Quixote'' (1965). With a
stream-of-consciousness structure, that work was very different
from 19th-century Russian ballet versions of Cervantes' novel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Balanchine dropped ``Don Quixote'' from the repertory, and
plot seemed to interest him less in his later years. One of the
things he admired about Martins as a novice choreographer, he once
said during a conversation, was that Martins did not tell stories.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of the Diamond Project's first four premieres in
May grandly justified City Ballet's emphasis on the plotless. The
question is whether City Ballet can remain true to itself only if
its new works tell no story.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the City Ballet was also defined by Jerome
Robbins' early choreography, which was strong on distilled dance
drama. (``The Cage,'' ``Afternoon of a Faun'' and ``Fancy Free''
from that early era are in the repertory.) It was also a company
that presented works by a range of choreographers, including Antony
Tudor and Frederick Ashton. Even Cranko created a Gothic ballet,
``The Witch,'' danced by the company on tour in London in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet of that era is no more. But this does not mean
that Ashton's ``Illuminations,'' an evocative 1950 ode to the poet
Arthur Rimbaud, cannot be revived by the company that created it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that City Ballet is identified with plotless works and
that Ballet Theater specializes in story ballets is a formula that
is only partly true. It is not surprising that the works of Tudor,
Ashton and Cranko have been danced by both Ballet Theater and City
Ballet. There was a time when lines were not as clearly drawn in
competing aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Tudor, Ashton and Cranko came out of
British ballet. The British are not immune to abstraction, but in
dance, at least, they like to tell stories.
</P>
<P>
   Distinct from the 19th-century classics, the 20th-century
narratives at Ballet Theater spring out of this tradition.
British-born choreographers have dominated that wing of the
repertory and include Kenneth MacMillan (``Romeo and Juliet,''
``Manon,'' ``Anastasia''), Ronald Hynd (``The Merry Widow'') and
Ben Stevenson, artistic director of the Houston Ballet
(``Cinderella,'' ``The Snow Maiden'').
</P>
<P>
   Tudor's exquisite one-act ``Jardin aux Lilas'' (repeated June 16
to 17), represents psychologically driven dance from another era
(1936). Its entangled tale of an arranged marriage is nothing but
dramatic. But this is drama, compressed and atmospheric, not spun
out in the measured linear fashion of the three-act ballets.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all those works, including the ``Othello'' that Lar
Lubovitch created for Ballet Theater a few seasons ago, have a
literary inspiration. Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic
director, makes no apologies for his preference for full-length
narrative works: they afford dancers an opportunity to shine as
individuals and have box-office appeal to a general public.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine took 40 years to educate his public to appreciate
dance for dance's sake. But in recent years, even companies
directed by his disciples throughout the country have staged
full-evening ballets with plot to satisfy public demand.
</P>
<P>
   Why that demand exists is open to debate. Possibly, the return
to figurative painting has its counterpart in dance, whose audience
now rejects the abstraction embraced after the 1960s. But perhaps
it is also that people like to see characters with whose emotions
they can identify. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Mallarme warned that his ideal ballet performance was impossible
as long as the spectator, because he paid for his seat, felt
entitled to see a mirror of himself onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, familiar signposts in a ballet translated from literature
can elevate the spirit, as Leonid Lavrovsky's ``Romeo and Juliet''
proves on the Bolshoi Ballet's current tour of the United States.
Certainly, the best introduction to ballet for children is a dance
work whose story they can follow.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century classics, however, are in a different category.
One goes to see how ``Swan Lake'' is danced, not how it ends.
</P>
<P>
   City Ballet now includes a sampling from the 19th century.
Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova staged ``Coppelia'' for City
Ballet. Martins has added his stagings of ``The Sleeping Beauty''
and ``Swan Lake.'' McKenzie's straightforward ``Swan Lake'' is new
at Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Quixote,'' ``La Bayadere'' and ``Le Corsaire,'' all in
Ballet Theater's season, have negligible or impossible plots: they
are machines for dancing and it is the quality of that dancing that
determines if they will endure.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, May 22,
about the Republican primary in New Jersey for the seat held by
Representative Marge S. Roukema misstated the criticism leveled at
her by the Club for Growth, a conservative group based in
Washington. (The error was repeated in an article in some copies on
Wednesday.) While the organization has objected to Roukema's
moderate stands on welfare reform and tax issues, it has not
criticized her for supporting abortion rights; it takes no position

TIES (AND BUNGEE CORDS) THAT BIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More male eyes tear up in ``Pop and Me,'' a likable
documentary about fathers and sons, than turn misty in
``Frequency,'' the macho tear-jerker about filial devotion that
word of mouth has turned into a surprise hit. Could it be that the
tough-but-tender ethos of Robert Bly's ``Iron John'' has trickled
down into the cultural mainstream despite the buckets of glib
derision heaped on the men's movement? The coincidence of these two
male weepies suggests perhaps yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop and Me,'' directed by Chris Roe, a generically clean-cut
young Californian who seems largely untouched by life, follows the
boyish filmmaker on a nine-month trip around the world with his
recently divorced and unemployed 55-year-old father, Richard. While
on the road, between bickering and making up, the Roes interview
pairs of fathers and sons in various cultures about their
relationships. Although the majority of these interviews turn out
to be question-and-answer sessions that reveal almost nothing, two
or three are quite touching.
</P>
<P>
   We visit the home of a bossy Egyptian general who, in the custom
of many Muslim families, unconditionally rules the roost in a
household where he is surrounded by several generations of his
family. According to Islamic teaching, he tells us, children must
unquestioningly obey their parents. Judging from the film's joint
interview with the general and a grown-up son who lives at home and
clearly idolizes his father, such strictures can help ensure a
familial social stability. But even in this tight-lipped
environment, as the general is questioned about whether he loves
his son and awkward hugs are exchanged, the mists begin to roll
into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It is in Australia, of all places, while visiting an old friend
of Richard's, that the Roes' kissy-huggy ethos is stonewalled by
the son of a rancher who smugly dismisses this freshly thawed style
of filial camaraderie as wimpy ``American stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviews and some pretty travel scenery are really only
the glue holding together the story of Chris and Richard's thorny
relationship while traveling. Their agreement before setting out is
that Chris will be in charge of the film and Richard, who is
footing the bill, in charge of travel, meals and accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris, the second of three sons, resents being bossed around
by his father, and their relationship becomes increasingly strained
until the end of the trip, when Chris coaxes his acrophobic dad
into a dual bungee jump while holding a camera and sound equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For a film devoted to celebrating intimacy and the breaking down
of emotional barriers, ``Pop and Me'' is oddly withholding of
information about the travelers. By the end of the movie Chris, who
has done a smooth job of directing, seems almost as blank as he did
at the beginning. When addressing the camera he is affable enough,
but we get no sense of any inner life beyond his continual
peevishness about not being in command.
</P>
<P>
   We learn a great more about Richard, who comes fairly close to
being an ideal father with his mixture of confidence, humor,
optimism and general openness. Born in the Bronx, he recalls being
the son of a hopeless alcoholic who spent the last decades of his
life in a mental institution. In the film's most touching story, he
recalls paying a rare visit to the hospital shortly before his
father's death and apologizing for being such a neglectful son. For
a moment his father emerged from his fog, Richard recalls, just
long enough to forgive his son.
</P>
<P>
   What we don't find out is anything about the career or the
marriage Richard is leaving behind or why he is stranded without
even (we learn at the end of the film) a home base to go back to.
Talk about midlife crises! Although Richard appears affluent enough
not to have to worry about making a living once he returns to the
United States, his future at the end of the movie is a complete
mystery. ``Pop and Me'' leaves you wishing more cards had been put
on the table.  &QL;

`GROOVE': INTO THE NIGHT, ENDLESSLY SEARCHING FOR THE PERFECT
RAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: `Dmitri' in 4th graf with no last name is cq.) 
(Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Who would want to go to a party that actually lets you know
where it is?'' vents a very frustrated Neil (Jeff Witzke) in
``Groove,'' the shambling but mostly knowing and funny comedy from
the director Greg Harrison. If you're nostalgic for the days of
chasing around the city to find a gig and arriving just in time to
see a pair of 16-year-olds earnestly discussing the merits of
drum-and-bass versus jungle music, then ``Groove'' is the movie for
you. If you're not so inclined, the film's seductive lack of
pretension will make a fan of you.
</P>
<P>
   The only showy sequence in the entire picture is at the
beginning, and its portent is used as a joke: a garage door
ominously cranks open and four figures stand dramatically
backlighted, with rain pouring behind them. This Impossible Mission
Force is Ernie (Steve Van Wormer) and his crew checking out an
abandoned warehouse as a rave site.
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes place in San Francisco over the course of a
single night, with the word of the supposedly hush-hush party
getting out via the Internet and pagers. Although Harrison uses two
elements so venerable that they have calcified into institutions _
the rave scene and the life-changing-night scenario, which was a
dried chestnut even when ``American Graffiti'' employed it _ the
director manages to make ``Groove'' about moments.
</P>
<P>
   There's a girl staring contentedly at a spinning dryer while her
Walkman pumps it up, and Guy (Dmitri), Ernie's second in command,
riding the BART with a huge mirrored disco ball on his lap. Like
``Graffiti,'' ``Groove'' does away with plot and instead uses its
wild-party setting to follow several people who are attending the
rave, or trying their best to find it.
</P>
<P>
   This film doesn't assume the pose that raves are anything new or
dangerous; rather, the view is that they're an entrenched circuit
with tribal complications.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the comedy is. The surly Todd (Angelo Spizziri),
who gets many of the best lines while waiting for his Ecstasy high
to kick in, observes that if the girls weren't all sporting Tickle
Me Elmo backpacks, they'd be hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When'd you go all Haight-Ashbury on me?'' he barks at his
psychotropic connoisseur friend Cliff (Ari Gold, who directs sharp
short films when he's not acting). ``You used to listen to Nitzer
Ebb.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before, Cliff _ a teaching assistant during the day _
was spotted by a couple of his students. When it's clicking,
``Groove'' connects like an Ecstasy-fueled screwball comedy:
everyone's synapses get scrambled by their desires and by the
juiced beats per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other films built around electronica song scores, which
employ every sleight of hand at the filmmakers' disposal,
``Groove'' settles assuredly into a spartan look at the world of
the rave. How sad; now that even Ronald McDonald was featured in a
commercial at an underground spot a few years back, movies about
raves are finally getting made.
</P>
<P>
   There have probably been more rave movies in the last 12 months
than there were in the previous decade. It's too bad that none were
produced in the early 1990s, when the scene had some currency and
Orbital's ``Halcyon'' _ which is part of the well-selected
soundtrack _ could raise the roof.
</P>
<P>
   At times here, there's a high corn quotient. Lola Glaudini is
the jaded Leyla, who is a little too old to still be hitting raves
and is looking for something worthy of commitment. David (Hamish
Linklater) is at his first rave and tries showing some game by
telling Leyla he's from back East _ East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's inside jokes is that he grew up a little more
than an hour from the home of techno music, Detroit, and was too
nervous to make that trip.
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't dwell on the many firsts that occur, like
David's inaugural rave experience and Ecstasy consumption.
``Groove'' often belongs to Ernie, who is a techno altruist; he'd
have to be, since he's charging only two bucks a head for a
till-dawn jam that includes food and bottled water. He's down with
the politics of dancing, so chilled that even a police bust cannot
stop him, evoking the Alan Freed of ``American Hot Wax.'' When he
finally gets a chance to hit the floor _ ``You have control of the
bridge,'' he tells his pal Guy _ the spark in his eyes is as potent
as any of the mood-altering substances being passed around.
</P>
<P>
   The film's real barometer is Maggie, played by the willowy
Elizabeth Sun. Whenever things are bumping, there she is, her
twists shaking like it's all good. ``Groove'' is just that.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better only if the last shot were from an
earlier scene: Todd's high, as it finally kicks in and he toys with
a globe like a stoned kitten.
</P>

<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Playing on Americans' fear of the unknown, a
Best Western Hotel television ad last winter showed business
executives bucking an unpopular travel request down the corporate
ladder. Finally, the request stopped at a hapless underling,
standing wide-eyed by a photocopier as a colleague asked, ``Have
you ever been to _ Calgary?''
</P>
<P>
   Calgarians complained, and the hotel chain pulled the
commercial. But many others here in the most prosperous city in
Canada's most prosperous province just shrugged it off, attributing
it to the provincialism of an American ad copy writer.
</P>
<P>
   With the highest household Internet connection rate in Canada,
the country's largest concentration of corporate headquarters
outside of Toronto and a brand new venture capital stock exchange
incubating hundreds of new companies, people in this steel and
glass city on the edge of the Canadian Rockies are too busy making
money to lose sleep over outdated stereotypes. In fact, a little
negative publicity might cool off a city that has seen its
population grow by two-thirds since 1975, to 860,000 today, pushing
up housing prices by one-third since 1995, the fastest rate of any
city in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic,'' groaned Alnisha Haji, a hairdresser who moved
here from Winnipeg a few years ago. ``Places that used to take half
an hour to get to, now take an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the lowest unemployment rate of a major Canadian city,
4.7 percent, migrants still flock here at the rate of 50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things I noticed here were the help wanted
ads,'' said Michelle Simick, 27, a newspaper reporter who moved
here this spring from her native Vancouver. ``They have signs
everywhere _ in front of the 7-Elevens, in front of the
restaurants, even a board up in the mall. I have never seen that in
Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People my age here seem to be a lot further along than people
in Vancouver,'' she said. ``People in Vancouver seem to be slogging
away at service jobs, waiting for jobs that never open up.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With Canada's tallest building west of Toronto, this modern city
of high-rises enjoys its image of a sunny, squeaky clean city, even
serving as ``Metropolis'' for the filming of all three modern
Superman movies. But on June 11, this showcase metropolis will be
thrust into the world spotlight when 3,000 delegates from 80
countries converge here for the World Petroleum Congress, a
five-day event that takes place every three years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest event to hit Calgary since the 1988 Winter Olympics,
the congress may not capture wide attention despite high gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But protesters, noting the expected attendance of 200
journalists, are gearing up for a series of photogenic protests,
promising a miniature version of the antitrade protests that shook
Seattle six months ago. In a genteel city where parking meter
attendants wear cowboy hats to charm the tourists, it is unclear
how Calgary will cope if violence breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Targets will be easy to find. Penthouse floors of downtown
skyscrapers proudly bear the names of oil companies: Gulf, Husky,
Mobil, Shell and Petrocanada. But while energy sector companies
occupy half of downtown's office space, appearances are deceiving
in a city long labeled Canada's ``energy capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipsawed by a series of oil price shocks, Alberta has
diversified, seeing the energy industry's part of the provincial
economy drop to 20 percent today from 35 percent 15 years ago. In
the near suburbs, before housing developments sprawl across
shortgrass prairie to the Rockies, about 1,200 new high technology
companies have sprung up in recent years, now employing 50,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   Professors at a University of Calgary high technology center
have licensed 300 technologies in the last decade. To lessen
economic dependence on oil, Alberta's government has set up two
$700 million funds, one for engineering research, the other for
medical research. Last year, of Alberta's 10 fastest-growing
companies, 6 were high-tech companies based in Calgary.

   ``People have learned,'' said Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier,
who was Calgary's mayor during the energy downturn of the 1980s.

</P>
<P>
   This year, Alberta expects to record the highest growth rate, 5
percent, of Canada's 10 provinces. The premier placed much of the
credit on low taxes. Alberta has no sales tax, Canada's lowest
gasoline tax and, starting Jan. 1, will have Canada's first flat
provincial tax.

   ``When people come out here, they are amazed,'' said William L.
Hess, a Montreal native who runs Calgary's new Canadian Venture
Exchange. ``The entrepreneurial drive, the quality of work
available to professionals are unparalleled.''

   Since opening six months ago as a fusion of two old exchanges in
Calgary and Vancouver, the national exchange here has seen its
daily trades quadruple, to an average of about 28,000. With 2,800
small capital companies listed, it is now moving east, opening
branches this summer in Winnipeg and Toronto. The new exchange
replaces the Vancouver Stock Exchange, which lost credibility over
stock manipulations of mining companies.

<P>
   The downside of Calgary's boom has been an affordable housing
squeeze. In the last year, the minimum income needed to buy the
average house here jumped by one-quarter, knocking 45,000 families
out of the market, according to mortgage analysts. ``Homelessness
has grown incredibly here,'' said David W. Lewry, who runs the Inn
From the Cold Society, a network of homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But in general Calgary's success has provoked mostly envy,
starting in neighboring British Columbia. Alberta, with only
three-quarters of British Columbia's population of 4 million,
expects to see its gross provincial product surpass its western
neighbor's this year, hitting $75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder the new Canadian Venture Exchange will headquarter
in Calgary and not Vancouver,'' Mark Milke, British Columbia
director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, complained in an
essay in The Calgary Herald. ``The stockbrokers are simply
following the moving vans of other enterprising British
Columbians.''

   In Edmonton, Alberta's capital, Don Ghermezian, manager of the
West Edmonton Mall, the world's largest shopping mall, sniffed in
an interview: ``Calgary has nothing. OK, it has a tower with a
revolving restaurant. Big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, newspapers like to paint Calgary and Alberta as
weird bastions of reactionary politics and lifestyles. In reality,
Calgary is middle of the road by U.S. standards. Last fall, a
Calgary judge established the right for local lesbian couples to
adopt children legally.
</P>
<P>
   A yuppie haven in reality, Calgary has a household Internet
connection rate of 60 percent and a population that, surveys
indicate, prefers skiing over hockey and bicycling over fishing.
With the local National Hockey League team, the Calgary Flames,
losing money, The Calgary Herald is campaigning to expand the sales
of season passes with scare headlines like ``No Bucks, No Pucks.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city of migrants, social mobility is often greater than
in blue-blooded eastern Canada. In May, Mayor Al Duerr bestowed
Calgary's Citizen of the Year Award on Mitzie Wasyliw for
preserving an old ranching homestead. A newspaper report noted that
Wasyliw got her start here in the 1970s when she blew into town and
became one of the city's first ``exotic dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure there is a bit of Toronto looking down their noses
at the West,'' Hess, the stock exchange president, said of
intercity rivalries. ``But, frankly, there is a bit of the West
looking down its nose at Toronto.''

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film
or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ``BATTLEFIELD EARTH,'' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper.
Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000,
beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes
and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates. The chief nasty,
Terl (Travolta), devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work in
the gold mines for him. He sees potential in one cave dweller
(Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of the
ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating a
human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction. Sitting
through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most
expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit
early to make such judgments, but ``Battlefield Earth'' may well
turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,'' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by
Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film,
starring the comic whirligig Lawrence, could best be described as
``Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ``Tootsie'' for flava _
er, flavor. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an FBI agent with a penchant
for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates
Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's
granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a
murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison and is after her.
Malcolm believes he can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much
of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may
have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``CENTER STAGE,'' starring Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky,
Amanda Schull, Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy. Directed by
Nicholas Hytner (PG-13, 113 minutes). Hytner's film tracks the
professional and romantic travails of a group of young dancers at
the fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York. The script is a
patchwork of show biz movie and romantic comedy cliches and the
acting rarely rises above daytime soap-opera obviousness, but who
ever went to a dance movie to see good writing or realistic acting?
The movie is loaded with lively dance sequences, and Hytner films
them beautifully, especially the show-stopping finale,
choreographed by Susan Stroman and spiritedly danced by Stiefel,
Radetsky and the lovely Schull, who carries the movie with her
energy and grace (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``DINOSAUR,'' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
together from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaur's
movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _
will impress skeptical grown-ups (the movie reportedly cost about
$200 million). More important, the film, in spite of some
potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem, will delight
children and whet their desire for the inevitable tie-in
merchandise (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``EAST-WEST,'' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov
and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115
minutes). After World War II the Soviet government undertook a
propaganda campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return
home. Aleksei Golovine (Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie
(Bonnaire), the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving
historical melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow
returnees, who are killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West''
chronicles Aleksei's ambivalence about their new life in a drab,
depressing communal apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to
escape it. The film may be faulted for dissolving the horrors of
history in Hollywood-style catharsis, but it also uses the
resources of old-fashioned emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed
light on forgotten history. ``East-West'' is a grand costume
pageant, full of grandeur and period detail, but it is also the
portrait of a marriage under extreme external and internal pressure
as well as a showcase for two great film actresses: Bonnaire and
Deneuve, playing an actress who becomes aware of Marie's plight
during a Soviet tour (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel.
Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the
Future'' meets ``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life''
meets ``The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly
sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is
a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic
firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the
accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From
here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and
on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to
soak Shea Stadium (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends
up fighting for his life. Crowe gives a performance with
ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He
holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``HAMLET,'' starring Ethan Hawke and Liev Schreiber.
Directed by Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has
rooted his voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's
play in today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and
squalor give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a
complex character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often
shaded in lush, soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an
intoxicating masochism in which half the cast is battling
despondency and the other half has the glint of imminent insanity.
Here the melancholy of Hamlet (Hawke) over the death of his father
is almost a state of grace: it gives him a sense of purpose that
the other characters lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a
boldness and vivacity that make this version exhilarating while
leaving Shakespeare's language and intent intact (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Cruise returns
as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's loud, flashy,
incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie
references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission: Impossible''
movie and to Woo's earlier, and superior, Hong Kong action films _
but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer
viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love
interest (Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's
ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more annoying
than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``ROAD TRIP,'' starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy
Smart, DJ Qualls and Tom Green. Directed by Todd Phillips (R, 91
minutes). ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' meets ``There's
Something About Mary'' in the gross-out farce of the late spring.
Four college boys led by Josh (Meyer) embark on a desperate
1,800-mile journey from upstate New York to Texas to intercept an
X-rated dorm room video mistakenly sent to Josh's loyal girlfriend
in Austin. The fun is all in the gags, among them the notorious
French toast sequence, the envelope-pushing sperm bank scene and
the hilarious car-jumped-over-the-bridge demolition derby. You'll
laugh despite yourself (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHANGHAI NOON,'' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson.
Directed by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Chan is one of the great
physical comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a
high-spirited, marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Chan
plays Chon Wang, an Imperial Guard dispatched from Beijing to the
Old West to rescue a princess played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of
the movie is the interplay between Chan and Wilson, who depicts his
inept outlaw sidekick with goofy, spacey charm. After the glum
bullying of ``Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ``M:I-2,'' it's
refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its
ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion, but pure
delight (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SMALL TIME CROOKS,'' starring Woody Allen and Tracey
Ullman. Directed and written by Allen (PG, 95 minutes). The sweet,
funny wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ``Big Deal on
Madonna Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' before returning to its original mode as a caper
comedy. Allen and Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept
thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife whose cookie business
takes off and allows her to indulge her dream of being a Park
Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention
deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild), the screwball
comic tone impeccably sustained and Ullman (putting on her Fern
Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin)
delightfully goofy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TIME CODE,'' starring Jeanne Tripplehorn and Stellan
Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93 minutes). Figgis'
astonishing new film, shot in a single day with hand-held digital
video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously, in real time.
``Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and
self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of
faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical
innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind,
the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its
enormous cast. Especially fine are Tripplehorn and Skarsgard, whose
strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether
``Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the
dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the
future to decide. At present, though, it is hard to think of a more
exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).

COMMENTARY: THE YOUNG AND THE CLUELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By   THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday's Microsoft ruling was about a lot of technical
matters _ Internet browsers, market share, the Sherman Antitrust
Act. But if you read carefully Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
ruling to split up Microsoft, you will see that this case is also
about attitude. In my view, it's an indictment of the attitude of
the high-tech community in general toward government, but it's
certainly an indictment of the particular attitude and arrogance of
Microsoft. Bless Jackson's heart for that.
</P>
<P>
   For many in Silicon Valley, government is irrelevant at best and
obstructionist at worst. For many in the high-tech community, the
world runs on electrons and stock options, and government is
basically an institution of tax-seeking bloodsuckers. The idea that
none of Silicon Valley's innovations would ever have flowered
without the rule of law maintained by Washington or without the
global stability maintained by the U.S. military _ funded by U.S.
taxpayer dollars _ is really a foreign notion to many in the
dot-com world. Tell techies that without America on duty there
would be no America Online and they will look at you as if you were
speaking Latin (or Fortran).
</P>
<P>
   No one epitomizes this attitude more than Bill Gates. As far as
I'm concerned, the government had grounds to break up Microsoft
simply for what Gates did last year _ which was to hire an army of
Washington lobbyists to try to get Congress to cut the budget of
the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department while Microsoft
had its case before that department. Think about the arrogance
behind that strategy. How would you feel if the biggest company in
your town tried to use its influence to slash the funding of your
police department, at a time when the police were bringing charges
against that company? That's what Microsoft did.
</P>
<P>
   And that to me is the real point of Jackson's ruling: Microsoft
isn't a threat just because it's big. GE is big. Intel is big.
Cisco is big. Microsoft is a threat because it is big and deaf to
some of the bedrock values of the American system.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Jackson is a conservative Republican appointed to the
bench by Ronald Reagan. He is not someone naturally hostile to big
corporations. Yet on virtually every count the judge ruled in favor
of the government and against Microsoft, pulling no punches when he
wrote: ``Microsoft as it is presently organized and led is
unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to
an order amending its conduct ... There is credible evidence to
suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do
business as it has in the past, and may yet do to other markets
what it has already done in the PC operating system and browser
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to predict what effect Microsoft's breakup
could have on the computer market, the software market or the stock
market. But it could not have come at a better time for the
rule-of-law market.
</P>
<P>
   We are entering a whole new era of cyberspace, which is going to
make governance of things we cherish, and the enforcement of even
some basic laws, much more difficult. Look around: Internet
companies are already violating people's privacy to troubling
degrees; new technologies are making it easy for anyone to copy a
book, movie or CD and send it to a friend without regard to
copyright or royalties; e-commerce is increasingly going to deprive
local and state governments of taxes; and the unregulated universe
of cyberspace is making it easy for two students in the Philippines
to send out a computer virus that melts down 10 million computers
worldwide overnight.
</P>
<P>
   That's why in the age of cyberspace, government is going to
matter more, not less. And you are going to want the rule of law
more, not less. The danger, though, is that young people _ raised
in the Internet age and bedazzled by technology companies and
billionaire geeks like Bill Gates _ will lose sight of this fact.
So too might all their parents with Microsoft stock in their
401(k)'s.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about Microsoft. There will always be another
Microsoft as long as there is another Jackson or another Joel Klein
ready to take on such behemoths when they become abusive. But there
won't always be another U.S. government, as we know it, if global
technology companies grow so big and powerful that they think they
can have their way with Washington, or if these emerging Internet
giants snooker us into keeping cyberspace unregulated, so they can
have their way with us.

&HT;     BAY AREA NURSING HOMES FAIL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than 40 percent of nursing homes in the San
Francisco Bay Area were found with violations that either caused
harm to residents or put them at risk of death or injury, according
to a federal report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The audit of the region's 288 nursing homes, commissioned by
nine members of Congress, also found that only 18 _ 6 percent _
were in full or substantial compliance with all federal standards
in recent inspections by government auditors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators, all Democrats, immediately responded to the
report with proposed legislation calling for more monitoring and
accountability in the nursing home industry nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the deficiencies discovered by surveyors between 1997
and January in the nine-county Bay Area involved failure to prevent
falls and accidents or to provide proper medical care or sufficient
staff, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and Oakland had an even higher rate of violations
than the Bay Area overall, with 44 percent being cited for such
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area facilities covered about 22,000 residents, most of
whom have their care paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Considering California is one of the two best states for
hospital and nursing home regulation, the report caused
consternation, said Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., who initiated the
audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow we've dropped some of these hospitals through the
cracks,'' Stark said. ``If this is as good as it gets, we could
have real trouble in the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But a representative of the state's nursing home industry said
that the information was anecdotal and that the report of the
nursing homes was subjective.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, California ranks 46th among all states for
per-resident spending in such facilities, said Betsy Hite,
spokeswoman for the California Association of Health Facilities,
which represents 1,500 long-term and assisted living care
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of California and the feds want us to provide the
services of the Ritz Carlton, but they want to pay a Best Western
price,'' she said, adding that the industry was 30,000 workers
short and could not keep up with the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Although her organization's figures show that only about 3
percent of nursing homes statewide are deficient, the report by the
House Government Reform Committee's Democratic staff painted a far
bleaker picture in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   It found that only 18 homes in the region were in full or
substantial compliance with all federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear that this report is not intended to
assign blame,'' the lawmakers said in a statement issued Thursday.
``It is intended to be a wake-up call that nursing home patients,
some of the most vulnerable members of our society, are in need of
better care than they are receiving today and that policy changes
are needed to help them receive better care.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was requested in anticipation of the proposed
``Nursing Home Staffing Accountability and Training Improvement
Act,'' introduced Thursday by Stark and the other representatives.
The others were Reps. Anna Eshoo, Nancy Pelosi, George Miller, Tom
Lantos, Ellen Tauscher, Barbara Lee, Zoe Lofgren and Lynn Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would hold skilled nursing care facilities more
accountable for providing adequate nurse and caregiver staffing,
which has so far been difficult to verify. It also would call for
periodic audits to assess the adequacy of staffing services
provided to nursing home residents under Medicaid, and would direct
the federal government to undertake a comprehensive assessment that
produces recommendations for improvement in training and skills of
certified nurses aides.

COMMENTARY: COW COUNTRY NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the state of
Rhode Island for making fun of its Mr. Potato Head campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the Rhode Island Tourism Division scattered
large, gaily decorated statues of Mr. Potato Head hither and yon in
an effort to publicize its new marketing program for ``Rhode Island
_ Birthplace of Fun.'' I was not as supportive of this venture as I
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   But little did I know that my very own city was preparing a
similar effort involving large, gaily decorated statues of cows. By
next week at this time, New York is going to have more than 500 of
them in the parks, on the traffic islands, wherever. We'll be
seeing even more of the cows than of Rick Lazio. (As Republican
Senate candidate, Lazio, in a spasm of overenthusiasm, promised to
one-up Hillary Rodham Clinton's sweep through all 62 counties by
visiting every single block in the state.)
</P>
<P>
   Animal statues are the new urban rage. Even as we speak,
Cincinnati is being decorated with pigs. ``There are lizards in
Orlando, moose in Toronto, horses in Lexington and fish in New
Orleans,'' said Owen Findsen, the visual arts critic for The
Cincinnati Enquirer. Cincinnati has recently begun to re-embrace
its 19th-century nickname of ``Porkopolis,'' and Findsen, in a
telephone interview, said he had just heard about a near-riot of
enthusiastic citizens pressing to see the new all-pig fountain
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful if you talk to Lexington,'' he warned. ``They're
very serious about the horses. They don't want anybody to poke
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Rapids, Mich., is reported to be encouraging civic pride
and tourism with huge painted rabbits. Miami has flamingoes.
Lynnwood, Wash., is laying claim to the decorative chicken
franchise. While New York is having its cow experience, West
Orange, N.J., and Stamford, Conn., will be staging similar events.
``West Orange has one cow done by the guy who plays Furio in `The
Sopranos'; wait till you see his work,'' gushed Jerome Elbaum, the
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   (We pause here to note that currently in the metropolitan New
York region, no public event is regarded as truly successful unless
at least one member of the ``Sopranos'' cast participates.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year Chicago set up 300 fiberglass cows painted by local
artists, and the results were remarkable. ``The officially named
Cows on Parade has been covered by everyone from The Jakarta Post
to The Wisconsin State Farmer, brought more publicity to Chicago
than the 1996 Democratic National Convention and generated up to
$200 million in tourist dollars,'' said the rather envious Kansas
City Star, in a report about plans to get Kansas City on the cow
bandwagon. (``It shows spunk and confidence. We could use both,''
exhorted a local museum director.)
</P>
<P>
   Elbaum is president of one of several enterprises now competing
for the business of filling up American cities with gaily decorated
bovines. Truly this is a remarkable era _ we now enjoy an economy
so expansive it can accommodate two Microsofts and four different
cow parade companies. ``It's a wonderful opportunity for people who
do not frequent art museums to see all these wonderful expressions
of pure art,'' he said. ``I mean, you will see cows that look like
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.''
</P>
<P>
   Several questions come to mind here, one of them being how many
additional tourists are going to come to New York City when they
hear it has cow statues. Another is why a city that could never
figure out how to privatize garbage collection has decided to put
its public art in the hands of a profit-making venture based in
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The New York cows, which were decorated by local artists and
schoolchildren, include several really imaginative numbers _
there's one cow with a desk coming out of its side that I would be
proud to call my own. But as a group, they're actually a little
off-putting. It may be the statues' expressions, which are
somewhere between blank and surly _ cow-like, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the whole thing has nothing whatsoever to do with
New York City. Say what you will about Mr. Potato Head _ and I will
personally never say another word again _ he was definitely born in
Rhode Island. If New York City had wanted animal art, we should
have painted pigeons.  &QL;

`DECALOG': DIVINING THE WAYS OF GOD AND MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Poland)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Krzysztof Kieslowski, the great Polish filmmaker who died
four years ago, the answers to our most troubling questions about
the meaning of life and death and the existence of God can be
intuited only from riddles, signs, portents, coincidences and
sudden, odd strokes of fate.
</P>
<P>
   On entering Kieslowski's somber but far from depressing
cinematic world, we find ourselves in a place where everything from
household objects to chance encounters with strangers is charged
with a mysterious gravity and enigmatic sense of connection. As
powerfully as his films portray human pain and longing, they also
convey the preciousness of life with a conviction that few other
filmmakers have succeeded in bringing to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Among Kieslowski's films, including his celebrated ``Red,''
``White'' and ``Blue'' trilogy, the work that towers over
everything is ``The Decalogue,'' his 10-part, nearly 10-hour
made-for-television series of reflections on the Ten Commandments.
Although ``The Decalogue'' has been shown in New York by the Film
Society of Lincoln Center and is available on home video, it is
only just now having its commercial release in the city, at the
Lincoln Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   If its 10 parts inevitably vary in quality, in its entirety, the
cycle _ which was first shown on Polish television in 1988-89 _
stands as a masterwork of modern cinema, essential viewing for
anyone who cares about the movies as a serious art form.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Plaza will present ``The Decalogue'' chronologically
in one-week programs, each consisting of two parts, for the next
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Far from illustrating Old Testament laws with a thunderous
drum-beating moralism, these 10 films, set mostly in the vicinity
of a large, rather bleak apartment complex in Warsaw, might be
described as metaphysical speculations. Without sermonizing or even
trying to prove the existence of a divine power operating in the
universe, these oblique dramatic parables imagine lives influenced
by unseen forces whose intentions can't be predicted or even begun
to be grasped.
</P>
<P>
   The profound pleasures they offer derive not only from their
deft metaphysical playfulness but also from their storytelling
genius. In portraying touching, often anguished human quandaries
(including adultery, murder, kidnapping and the death of a child)
``The Decalogue'' gives each tale the structure of a mathematical
equation that almost but doesn't quite balance.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle doesn't have a beginning, a center or a conclusive
ending. The closest it comes to expressing the director's personal
beliefs is probably in its brilliant eighth part, loosely inspired
by the command ``Thou shalt not bear false witness against they
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The central character Zofia (Maria Koscialkowska) a wise, kindly
professor of ethics at the University of Warsaw, is paid a surprise
visit by Elzbieta (Teresa Marczewska), a much younger, Polish-born
American scholar who after having translated several of Zofia's
books is returning to Poland to do research on the fate of Jewish
survivors of World War II. Invited to sit in on one of Zofia's
classes, in which the students debate and try to untangle knotty
ethical conundrums, Elzbieta volunteers the story of a 6-year-old
Jewish girl, hidden in Warsaw by resistance fighters in 1943, who
was brought for safekeeping to the home of a Roman Catholic couple
working against the Nazis. Instead of offering her refuge, the
couple suddenly changed their minds and without explanation turned
her away.
</P>
<P>
   As Zofia listens to the story, in which no names are mentioned,
her face crumples into a stricken mask, for she realizes that
Elzbieta's story is autobiographical and that Zofia and her husband
(now long dead) were the couple who rejected the girl. Later, when
Zofia explains to Elzbieta the reasons for that rejection (they had
just heard a false rumor that the people bringing the child to them
were actually secret agents of the Gestapo), the questions that
have haunted both women for more than four decades seem to have
been answered and Elzbieta's shaky faith in humanity restored.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has no pat happy ending. Zofia continues to
believe that she and her husband made a terrible mistake in being
willing (even when their lives seemed in imminent danger) to
sacrifice the little girl's life. ``Nothing is as important as the
life of a child,'' she declares.
</P>
<P>
   The words that the screenplay by Kieslowski and his collaborator
and scenarist Krzysztof Piesiewicz put into the mouth of this
wonderful character, who radiates such profound humanity, come as
close as any in ``The Decalogue'' to expressing Kieslowski's own
philosophy. All humans, she surmises, are born with goodness and
evil, qualities that are summoned by situations, and everyone grows
up knowing the difference. As for the existence of God (a word she
prefers not to use), he exists in all of us, although we can choose
to leave God behind. Those who make that choice, however, are
condemned to a state of loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Although each part of ``The Decalogue'' is self-contained and
may be viewed separately, the 10 have enough thematic connection so
that when seen consecutively they build into a much larger and
richer whole. Leitmotifs run throughout. One is the recurrent
appearance of a silent young man in several episodes who gazes
momentarily at the camera, an enigmatic, possibly angelic witness
to the events being portrayed. As in ``Red,'' ``White'' and
``Blue,'' the color scheme of ``The Decalogue'' is loaded with
symbolism that enhances the movie's many subtle, surreal touches.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth part, in addition to voicing Kieslowski's ethical
philosophy, recapitulates, in a student discussion, the story of
Episode 2 (``Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain''), one of the most gripping in the cycle. Here, a prickly,
embittered doctor who years ago lost his family in a tragic
explosion, is asked to predict the fate of a patient _ who seems to
be near death _ by the patient's wife, a professional musician, who
is carrying another man's child. If her husband's chances of
surviving are good, she explains, she will have an abortion. If
not, she will have the baby and probably go off with her lover.
</P>
<P>
   In this part, which includes the disturbing close-up image of a
bee struggling frantically to extricate itself from a container of
rusty water collected from a leaky pipe, Kieslowski contrives a
miracle. As grim as he could be at times, the supremely evenhanded
director could also conjure up a state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Echoing Zofia's statement about the importance of children,
several other episodes are also concerned with their fate at the
hands of adults. In Part 1 (``Thou shalt have no other gods before
me'') a university professor who believes that everything in life
can be measured, teaches his young son how to use a computer. When
the little boy decides to go skating, he calculates that the ice on
the lake should be thick enough to support him. The professor
learns tragically that nature isn't as orderly or predictable as
his equations suggest. This moving story, which pits the boy's
rationalist father against his religiously devout aunt as spiritual
influences, is a classic fable of hubris. In one of its surreal
twists, it also includes what appears to be a self-starting
computer.
</P>
<P>
   A more brutal struggle for a child is waged in Episode 7 (``Thou
shalt not steal'') in which a little girl brought up believing her
grandmother is really her mother and her biological mother her
sister is kidnapped by the younger woman, who was 16 when she gave
birth and is now of college age. The situation gives us one of
Kieslowski's more fiendishly clever equations by wondering which is
the real kidnapper: the embittered teen-age mother running off with
the child or the grandmother who for selfish reasons arranged to
make it look as though the baby were hers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Decalogue'' varies enough in tone to include some comedy
and suspense as well as high drama and tragedy. Part 6 (``Thou
shalt not commit adultery''), which was released in an expanded
form under the title ``A Short Film About Love,'' is the relatively
droll tale of a meek, virginal 19-year-old postal clerk who is a
Peeping Tom and the beautiful woman across the courtyard on whom he
obsessively spies.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance and voyeurism also haunt Part 9 (``Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's wife'') about a doctor diagnosed as incurably
impotent, who encourages his beautiful wife to take a lover. When
she does, he becomes jealous and suicidally depressed. It is one of
several tales in the cycle in which women emerge as the wiser,
nobler sex.
</P>
<P>
   The final episode (``Thou shalt not covet they neighbor's
goods'') suggests a Hitchcockian interpretation of a De Maupassant
tale, in its story of two brothers (one of whom is lead singer for
a rock band that performs blasphemous songs) who discover that
their just-deceased father amassed a priceless stamp collection.
Each becomes increasingly paranoid that the other intends to steal
it. Kieslowski makes no bones about it: greed is bad.
</P>
<P>
   The consistency of performances by a sprawling cast that
includes both well-known and obscure Polish actors is remarkable.
Directing the cast, Kieslowski avoids even a hint of melodrama, and
most of the performances are restrained and internalized to the
brink of introspection. What we remember most are faces with
complicated histories in which hardship and suffering are taken for
granted, inner conflicts are continually flickering and an
awareness of death shadows even the happiest smile.
</P>
<P>
   Superficially at least, this world feels so different from here
and now. In the United States, especially in this time of abundance
when the gospel of eternal youth proliferates, we lull ourselves
into believing that somehow life can be solved. More and more of us
seek to conceal or even erase the histories Kieslowski's camera
locates in his actors' faces. As long as we can erase them,
presumably we can live forever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Decalogue'' also conveys the feeling that many of
these people have lived more and know more about life than we do.
They understand that in the best of all possible worlds fleeting
glimpses of salvation are the most any of us can expect.

SAINT ETIENNE: `SOUND OF WATER' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON PARELES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT ETIENNE: ``Sound of Water'' (Sub Pop). ``Sail away, sail
away,'' Sarah Cracknell of Saint Etienne coos in ``How We Used to
Live,'' the nine-minute mini-suite that sums up ``Sound of Water''
as it drifts between distant, unhappy memories and persistent hope.
For a decade, Saint Etienne has been leavening pop songs with
dance-club rhythms, coolly observing how far astray passion and
ambition can lead. The band's fifth unified album, ``Sound of
Water,'' floats above the fray; its songs yearn for escape and
sanctuary. Saint Etienne collaborated with the minimalist German
electronic group To Rococo Rot and with Sean O'Hagan, the Beach
Boys idolator from the High Llamas. The few uptempo songs are
skeletal and abstracted, transparently displaying their underlying
patterns of clicks and blips and nonsense pop syllables, while the
ballads sway between two chords like Brian Wilson in a hammock.
Saint Etienne remains fascinated with pop construction, but has
moved past cleverness and easy ironies. Its songs are no longer
puzzles; they're atmospheric, self-contained worlds.

ANGELS CAN'T HIDE FROM RANDY JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- The Angels might have thought there were rid of Randy
Johnson when he left the Mariners, their counterpart in the A.L.
West. But Johnson, who considered signing with the Angels going
into the 1999 season, just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will come off the disabled list and pitch tonight
against the Angels at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has enjoyed pitching against the Angels throughout his
career -- he's 14-6 with a 2.70 ERA against them in 25 games. The
14 wins against the Angels are the most by Johnson against any
other team (he also has 14 wins vs. Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Angels faced Johnson was March 15 in Tucson,
Ariz. in a spring training game. The Angels roughed up Johnson for
11 runs and 12 hits in three-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tim Salmon after the game: ``Any time you evaluate our
performance or his performance, hey, it's spring training. It feels
good, but at the same time you try not to get overly confident.
Because when the gun sounds he's going to have his A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   Good advice. Johnson is 9-1 with a 1.41 ERA and 131 strikeouts
in 95 2/3 innings. Johnson also has hit well, for a pitcher. He's
hitting .222 with five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern that starter Kent Bottenfield might be the next
pitcher to go to the disabled list. Bottenfield has had some
shoulder soreness lately, limiting his ability to pitch deep into
games. In his past four starts, he's pitched at least six innings
only once.
</P>
<P>
   If Bottenfield has to go to the DL, it would save Seth Etherton
from a trip to the minors. Because the Angels don't need a fifth
starter again until June 17, the Angels could call up bullpen help
to replace Bottenfield on the roster and keep Etherton in the
rotation. Lou Pote, who has 10 saves for Triple-A Edmonton, would
likely get called up.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton has made three starts for the Angels, and the last one
was his best -- four runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings vs. the
Giants. Etherton's biggest problem has been the home run ball. Of
his 17 hits allowed, seven have been home runs (16 1/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad was the runner-up for A.L. player of the month for
April after he hit .449 to tie Rod Carew for highest batting
average (minimum 75 at-bats) by an Angels player in any month. But
his name in the record book has already been erased.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Bengie Molina, who has emerged as the leading candidate
for Rookie of the Year, hit .461 in May to set the new record for
highest average in a month.

   Matchup: Brian Cooper (2-1, 3.86 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Arizona's Randy Johnson (9-1, 1.41). Tim Salmon has two
career homers off Johnson, but overall is hitting .188 (9 for 48)
against him. Garret Anderson has never gotten a hit off Johnson (0
for 9). Mo Vaughn is hitting .333 (8 for 24) with two homers
against him.

YOUR ADVOCATE TALKS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I didn't have a column last week because I had the indescribable
honor of being ``Your Advocate'' at my paper.
</P>
<P>
   The duty of the Advocate, in case you are unclear on the
concept, is to answer any questions and address any problems that
you, the reader, may have.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the official definition of the job here at the
Herald-Tribune in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the Advocate's job is to handle complaints. The
people who call up the Advocate do not do so to praise the
reporters and editors for their well-researched stories and clever
headlines or congratulate the photographers for their fine pictures
or give thanks to the publisher for confining the lingerie-modeling
ads to the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   No, they call to complain that the movie-theater phone number we
run is incorrect; the Philadelphia Phillies are missing from the
National League standings; the same story ran twice in the same
section and nobody at the paper understands the difference between
``who'' and ``whom.''
</P>
<P>
   (This seems like a good time to announce that I am personally
organizing a campaign to banish the word ``whom'' from the English
language. The word ``whom'' does nothing that the word ``who''
cannot do equally well and in less space. All ``whom'' is good for
is confusing writers and encouraging former English teachers _
excuse me, teachers of English _ to hunt down obscure grammatical
mistakes in the paper when they should be outdoors getting fresh
air and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   (And regarding the charge that there is no one at the paper who,
or possibly whom, understands the difference between ``who'' and
``whom,'' that is simply not true. We have one old editor whom, or
maybe who, we keep propped up in the corner next to the vending
machine. He understands perfectly the difference between ``who''
and ``whom,'' as well as the difference between ``lay'' and
``lie,'' ``affect'' and ``effect'' and ``Republican'' and
``Democrat.'' The problem is that he is often asleep when these
nettlesome questions of grammar arise, and we, being the polite
sorts that we are, are reluctant to wake him. I am sure that you,
exhausted reader, agree that a few misused pronouns are a small
price to pay for an old man's rest.)
</P>
<P>
   Each Advocate has his or her own way of dealing with these
calls. You can get defensive and point out that a certain number of
mistakes are inevitable given the constraints of deadlines and the
number of words we publish and the fact that we are short-staffed
and overworked and we just got a new computer system that appears
to be possessed by demons and just what the heck do you expect for
a quarter anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think this is the wrong attitude, if for no other
reason than because it encourages the caller to stay on the line
and argue. My strategy was to agree with whatever the caller said,
up to and including the assertion that the paper is nothing more
than a propaganda tool for the Bolsheviks in New York. (I did not
point out that all the New York Bolsheviks have moved to Sarasota
because we have better weather.)
</P>
<P>
   Angry callers are thrown off balance if you agree with them.
It's rather cruel, in a way. The caller has gone to all the trouble
of getting geared up for a big fight and instead of fighting back,
you concede.
</P>
<P>
   So, basically, as Advocates go, I was a big, fat coward. I
offered no defense, no excuses. It's like the duck: If it looks
like a screw-up, walks like a screw-up and quacks like a screw-up,
chances are good it's a screw-up.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I have to save my energy for my crusade to rid the
language of the evil word, ``whom.''
</P>

TRADING IN EURO IS CHAOTIC AFTER CENTRAL BANK RAISES BASELINE
RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In an unexpectedly aggressive attempt to
help insulate Europe against inflation, the European Central Bank
tightened its grip on monetary policy Thursday by raising its core
interest rate half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The move, pushing the baseline rate from 3.75 to 4.25 percent,
surprised most economists and sent currency traders into a confused
frenzy over the euro, Europe's common currency.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, which has enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in the last
two weeks, initially climbed against the dollar, going from 96
cents to more than 97 cents. But then it slipped back to 95.7
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency. The euro's
rise and subsequent fall today, foreign-exchange traders said, may
have been caused by Wim Duisenberg, the central bank's president,
who implied that there would not be any more rate increases soon.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, most currency experts and economists had
predicted that the European Central Bank would increase rates by
only a quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's move came against the backdrop of the euro's travails
in world currency markets. Since its introduction in January 1999,
the euro has steadily plunged in value relative to the U.S. dollar,
from a high of $1.17 to a low of 88.5 cents last month.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the euro suddenly began its first sustained
recovery. Fueled largely by speculation that the central bank would
intervene directly in currency markets _ speculation encouraged by
veiled threats from central bankers _ the euro has climbed 10
percent to about 96 cents.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the bank's decision Thursday, Duisenberg insisted
that the bank was not trying to meddle with exchange rates. Rather,
he based the decision on Europe's accelerating growth and a
heightened threat of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for growth in the euro area has improved markedly
over the past few months,'' Duisenberg said at a news conference in
Frankfurt on Thursday. But, he said, the risks of inflation had
increased as a result of rising import prices _ for oil in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Duisenberg said he remained unsatisfied with what he called
the low value of the euro and acknowledged that this played an
important if indirect role in Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the euro's decline has inevitably led to an
increase in the prices of imports. The euro has slumped against the
yen and the British pound as well as against the dollar, so
Europe's imports from most of the world have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reversal which started about two weeks ago still leaves, I
believe, some potential for further appreciation,'' Duisenberg
said. ``I know that the exchange rate of the euro _ even after the
recent appreciation _ does not yet reflect fundamentals, whatever
they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duisenberg also dampened expectations about additional rate
increases later in the year. ``One of the motives to raise the rate
by a half-point is that such a move will clear the horizon for some
time to come,'' he told reporters. ``We think this move has cleared
the horizon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Norfield, global currency analyst at the Dutch bank ABN
Amro, said those remarks might explain why the euro declined after
having initially risen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Norfield predicted that the euro had already ``peaked''
and is likely to slip again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did look fairly aggressive at first,'' Norfield said. ``The
thing that probably took the steam out of the euro was when
Duisenberg suggested that was it and there wouldn't be any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg was deliberately ambiguous and left himself ample
maneuvering room for a shift in emphasis. But his implied message
contrasted sharply with that of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, who issued a clear warning about additional
rate increases after the Fed raised rates on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Though surprised by Thursday's move, most economists said it was
justified and came merely faster than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't do much to damage growth,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug,
an economist at Warburg Dillon Read in Frankfurt. ``I'd say the ECB
was a bit slow before and that this step compensates for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan Schneider, head of euro-zone economic research at
Deutsche Bank Research, said that Duisenberg was probably not
reacting to the euro's weakness but that Thursday's action could
nonetheless keep the currency moving upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ECB won't dislike the windfall effect of the euro,''
Schneider said. ``In that respect, the timing is better than as if
the hike had come a few weeks ago. The chances are always better if
you support a market trend that has already crystallized.'' &QL;

NEW TECHNNOLOGY MAY GIVE YOU THE EYE OF AN EAGLE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Superman, watch out: A University of Rochester
scientist is developing technology that could someday make ``super
vision'' a reality for almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams, professor of medical optics at the New York
state college, says his techniques if used in humans could push far
beyond merely correcting people's vision to the standard 20/20, and
actually produce a kind of enhanced vision that could equal the
legendary sharp eyesight of eagles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the research could lead to improved methods for
diagnosing some eye diseases and monitoring the progress of
treatment, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's techniques come from the same ones astronomers have
used over the last few years to improve the sharpness of telescope
images. Williams is developing the concepts in his newly
established Center for Vision Excellence at the university, and
described his research here Thursday at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ``has been way out in front, exploring how we could
enhance people's vision beyond what is normally thought of as
perfect vision,'' said Scott MacRae, a cornea specialist and
pioneer in refractive surgery who has joined Williams at the new
vision center. ``In the old days, we were just trying to correct
people's vision problems and treat disease. This new research takes
what we consider normal vision and enhances it. This is truly
revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   While the researchers stress that the work is still in an early
stage and any real applications to human vision are a few years
away, it already attracted the interest of the contact lens company
Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which has licensed the technology and is working
with the university to develop it.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the new method is the use of a device that shines
dozens of narrow light beams into the eye. The beams are reflected
back out and collected by a ``wavefront sensor'' so that computers
can then analyze in detail the tiny imperfections in the eye's
cornea and lens.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional vision correction deals with the overall average
shape of the cornea and lens, but the equipment used is unable to
detect or correct the smaller-scale variations picked up by the
adaptive optics method. The kind of subtle imperfections in the
lens and cornea that are detected by this system are so small that
physicians didn't even know they existed until Williams's lab
developed this technique.
</P>
<P>
   When you look through this laboratory system, Williams said,
``The world looks crisper. In some people, the ability to pick up
contrast, such as minute patterns of stripes, is increased by a
factor of six. It allows for a level of vision correction that's
just not available today. It's like needing glasses and getting
them for the first time. Everything suddenly looks sharper and
clearer, no matter how good your eyes are normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Williams said, the system should make it possible to
perform a detailed analysis of an individual's eyes and produce
customized glasses or contact lenses _ or perhaps even customized
laser surgery _ designed to correct all of these subtle
imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   He said that experiments show the system could lead to a
doubling, or better, of the amount of detail that humans could see,
thus nearly equaling the visual acuity of eagles and other
predatory birds.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements should be even more dramatic in the case of
night vision, Williams said. While his tests have shown that the
upper limit of human vision as measured by standard vision tests is
about 20/10, or about double the sharpness of ``normal'' vision,
the effects of these corrections are most pronounced in night
vision because the iris is wide open and more of the eye's lens is
used, exposing more of its imperfections. This effect is not
reflected in the usual vision tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have shown that the normal maximum detail the human eye
can see is a grid of 60 lines per degree. Cats have much poorer
vision, able to see only about 5 lines per degree, while predatory
birds can see as many as 150 lines per degree.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the sharp-eyed vision of eagles lies in
the superior lenses of their eyes, which can be matched by the new
correction methods. But eagles also have smaller, more closely
spaced light receptors on their retinas, which cannot be
duplicated, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   As a side benefit of his research, Williams has been able for
the first time to take pictures of the retinas of human subjects
that clearly show every individual cone _ the receptors that pick
up light and color. Normally, the distortions of the eye's lens
blur such images, making it impossible to distinguish the
individual cones. The only way such images could be obtained before
was by surgically removing the retina after the patient's death.
</P>
<P>
   The research has also made it possible for the first time to
detect the three different kinds of cones, sensitive to different
colors of light, which make color vision possible, and to see how
these different cones are distributed through the visual field.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement and relative numbers of the cones for different
colors is quite random, and varies greatly among individuals. This
is very different from the eyes of fish, for example, which show an
absolutely regular crystal-like pattern of color cones.
</P>
<P>
   This method of viewing the detailed structure of the retina,
Williams said, could someday be used to monitor the progression of
diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, which causes a slow
degeneration of the retina, and to observe directly the effects of
experimental treatments for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, this could be a very useful clinical tool,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his experimental results were recently published in the
Journal of the Optical Society of America, and a meeting last month
of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology devoted
a whole symposium to reports from Williams and other researchers on
the topic of ``enhanced vision.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers of that telescope technology, Jerry Nelson
of the University of California, who designed the innovative
optical systems for the Keck telescopes in Hawaii _ the world's
largest telescopes _ visited Williams's lab this week. He tried an
experimental version of the new system, and said he was impressed
with the improvement in vision that it produced. ``The potential is
very exciting,'' he said. ``It was amazing to see.''

TERRA HOLDERS VOTE FOR LYCOS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shareholders of Spain's Terra Networks SA have voted to
approve its plan to buy Internet portal Lycos Inc. for about $12.5
billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The step could help Lycos obtain consent from its own
shareholders for the deal, which would form an international
network of Web sites and services to be known as Terra Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Approval from Terra's shareholders was never in doubt, since its
Madrid-based parent Telefonica SA owns about 67 percent and had
arranged the merger, which was announced May 16. Spokesmen for the
companies wouldn't disclose the margin of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But a Lycos executive said shareholders ``overwhelmingly''
approved the deal and that it drew support from more than 90
percent of ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   That could represent an important vote of confidence for the
proposed merger, because Terra's shares have fallen below the
minimum level of $45.37, in American share equivalents, that would
be used to calculate the final number of Terra shares Lycos
shareholders will receive under the agreement. In Nasdaq trading
Thursday Terra fell $1.625 to $42.375.
</P>
<P>
   Terra's shares traded around $57 each before the deal was
announced, but investors bid down the agreement on concerns the
deal overvalued Lycos. For similar reasons Lycos shares also fell
by as much as 28 percent from their high of $72.625.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares have also recovered since, closing at $64 each
Thursday, down $1.875.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Terra chairman Juan Villalonga called the Lycos
deal a ``great leap'' that would help the company internationally.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said
he has shareholders' support. ``I've yet to encounter a shareholder
of scale who has been anything but extremely positive on the
deal,'' he said from the company's Waltham headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A Lycos shareholder vote is expected later this summer. Last
year investor opposition scuttled a previous merger agreement Davis
had struck with USA Networks Inc. A key critic was CMGI Inc. chief
executive David Wetherell, whose company then held about a 20
percent stake in Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell has praised the Terra deal's broad outlines but has
yet to say whether he would vote in favor of it. CMGI now holds
around 16 percent of Lycos, down from 22 percent at the start of
1999, according to an executive there.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is completed, the new company would combine Terra
sites popular throughout Latin America with Lycos' mixed bag of
content including search, finance, and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Terra is now based in Madrid; the new company's headquarters
will be moved to Barcelona, Terra said Thursday, but it would
retain a significant Waltham operation. Terra Lycos ``is and always
will be a Spanish company,'' Villalonga said.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would leave Terra Networks with plenty of
cash to compete against Yahoo Inc. and America Online Inc. German
publisher Bertelsmann has also committed to spend $1 billion over
five years on advertising and services.

AUTOMAKERS TO OFFER MEDICAL BENEFITS FOR SAME-SEX PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler
division announced Thursday that they would begin offering medical,
dental and prescription drug benefits for same-sex partners of
their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States,
the largest move yet by corporate America to provide such benefits
for gay and lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in the financial, media, entertainment and
airline industries and some state and local governments have
offered same-sex benefits in the last several years. But gay and
lesbian advocates said the automakers' decision dwarfed previous
corporate moves and was particularly welcome because Midwestern
companies have been slow to provide such benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Big Three come together as a group to announce
domestic benefits for same-sex couples, it's really a sea change,''
said Kim I. Mills, the education director of the Human Rights
Campaign, a group that represents gay, lesbian and transgender
Americans. ``We have not seen this kind of movement in the
manufacturing sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The two largest American companies offering same-sex benefits
until now have been IBM and Citigroup, she said. Both companies are
based in the New York area, where gays and lesbians are more
influential than in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit expressed dismay at the
automakers' decision. The Catholic Church favors open and equal
access to health care, but ``anything that compromises or erodes
the traditional shape of the family tears at the very fabric of
moral relationships that the church seeks to uphold,'' said Ned
McGrath, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government does not provide same-sex benefits for
its employees. In the private sector and state and and local
governments, such benefits are offered to 18 percent of workers,
according to a study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
nonpartisan group in Oakland, Calif. The companies and governments
offering the benefits are most likely to be in the Northeast, on
the West Coast or in Minnesota and Wisconsin, two states with a
liberal tradition, said Kenneth McDonnell, a research analyst at
the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   David L. Murphy, Ford's vice president for human resources, said
that the UAW had demanded same-sex benefits during contract
negotiations last autumn. Ford concluded that the benefits would
add less than $5 million a year to Ford's $2 billion in annual
health care costs. GM and DaimlerChrysler also calculated that the
costs would be small, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   When automakers provide a new benefit to their hourly workers,
they usually offer it to salaried employees, too, as they are doing
now. Companies in other industries have found that less than 1
percent of their employees register for same-sex benefits, and
Murphy predicted that this would hold for the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers will not offer the benefit to retirees, but
same-sex partners of current employees can retain their benefits
after these employees retire. Unmarried heterosexual partners of
employees will remain ineligible for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been under mounting pressure from its gay and
lesbian members to win better legal protections and benefits for
them. The Canadian Auto Workers union had made the issue a
priority, winning same-sex benefits from GM in Canada in 1993.
Chrysler resisted in Canada until it lost an arbitration case in
1997, and Ford held out in Canada until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became kind of a personal thing, that people had objections
to gays and lesbians and couldn't get past that to see them as
workers,'' said Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president.
</P>
<P>
   UAW leaders declined to comment on the same-sex benefits, which
will take effect on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler drew national attention in 1997 when it chose not to
advertise on the episode of ``Ellen,'' a television sitcom, in
which the lead character, Ellen DeGeneres, made clear that she was
a lesbian. Chrysler executives further antagonized gay and lesbian
groups when they compared the show with the murder trial of O.J.
Simpson, saying that they did not buy advertisements on socially
polarizing shows. Chrysler resumed advertising on subsequent
episodes of ``Ellen'' that included lesbian themes.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy caused some gay and lesbian employees at
Chrysler to organize as People of Diversity, an advocacy group that
now has about 100 members. Only a quarter of them are in the UAW,
but they tried hard to enlist the UAW's support, said Michelle
Walters, the group's co-chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of Chrysler's top leadership has turned over since
Daimler-Benz took over the company in November 1998. Kathleen
Oswald, Chrysler's senior vice president for human resources, said
that by stressing diversity, the company wanted to ``make sure we
would continue to get the best and brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on Chrysler's previous policies, other
than to say, ``The `Ellen' program certainly helped raise
awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's other divisions, Mercedes cars and
Freightliner heavy trucks, are not unionized except for one
Freightliner factory that has a separate labor contract. Both
divisions said Thursday that they had no plans to offer same-sex
benefits. Toyota, also nonunion in the United States, said that it
would not offer the benefits either.
</P>
<P>
   Walters said that two executives had played a large role in
changing industry attitudes: Thomas T. Stallkamp, who was
Chrysler's president in 1998 and 1999, and Jacques Nasser, who has
been Ford's chief executive since the beginning of last year.
Stallkamp was instrumental in persuading Chrysler to recognize
People of Diversity, and he oversaw the negotiation of Chrysler's
pattern-setting labor contract with the UAW before leaving in a
conflict with Daimler's German leaders, Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year labor contract signed last autumn, which GM and
Ford adopted after Chrysler, not only called for the union and the
companies to study same-sex benefits but also barred workplace
discrimination based on sexual orientation. Walters, an auto parts
procurement manager at Chrysler's headquarters in Auburn Hills,
Mich., said that this was mostly an issue in auto factories rather
than in offices.

BUSH, IN GORE'S BACKYARD, DETAILS REFORM PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's mission to ``reinvent
government'' has been reinvented by his opponent, Texas Governor
George W. Bush, who traveled to Gore's home state of Tennessee
Thursday to announce the details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't use Gore's terminology, calling it instead a
``structural reform'' package, but many of the elements are eerily
similar to ideas Gore proposed _ sometimes unsuccessfully _ as head
of the Clinton administration's commission to cut government waste
and bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a clean break from the recent past,'' Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told supporters in
Knoxville. Bush promised to ``set a new tone _ a tone of respect
and bipartisanship,'' while at the same time taking ``practical
steps'' to change the way Washington works.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced a similar strategy in 1993, when he headed a
National Performance Review of government agencies and practices,
and appealed for a cooperative effort between Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the National Performance Review have gotten mixed
reviews; bipartisanship, always shaky, disintentegrated after the
Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 and President Clinton
was impeached in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of familiar, stealing the other guy's playbook,''
said Stephen Hess, an anlayst with the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``It's sort of a nifty bit of two-party governing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign did not address the specifics of Bush's plan,
but attacked the Republican governor for what it termed his failure
to rein in state spending and cut waste in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the Bush plan is a proposal to pass budgets
only every other year. That would mean Congress would presumably
spend one year screaming at each other about funding levels,
missing deadlines, and passing 11th-hour continuing resolutions to
keep the government running while they finally approve a federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The second year would then be free, Bush aides said, to work on
oversight and other legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   That idea was, in fact, proposed by Gore when he issued the 1993
performance report, said Bob Stone, the former head of the Gore
commission. ``It's a good idea,'' said Stone, who now does
consulting at Public Strategies Group in St. Paul, Minn. But it
didn't go anywhere in Congress, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also recommended creating a bipartisan commission to
identify so-called ``pork barrel'' spending. The budget items would
then be lumped together in one big, porcine package, and Congress
would be forced to vote on it all at once, up or down.
</P>
<P>
   That idea may be constitutionally tricky, Hess said, since it
may be interpreted as the executive branch meddling in the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's National Performance Review, which is still in operation,
is already doing part of what Bush is proposing. The panel has been
identifying ``unnecessary'' programs and seeking to eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Stone said, the US Naval Academy used to have its
own dairy, a vestige from a contaminated milk crisis in the early
part of the century. The panel eliminated the dairy, saving
somewhere around $200,000, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also vowed to pass a constitutionally-sound line-item veto,
which would give the president the authority to squelch individual
budget items without having to veto an entire spending package.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backs the line-item veto, as does Presidnet Clinton and
former President George Bush, father of the Republican candidate.
But the measure, was found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the president had that power, it wouldn't amount to
much fiscally, said Donald Kettl, a political science professor at
the University of Wisconsin in Madison, since the offending items
are usually pretty small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often presented as a budget issue, when it's realy a
political issue,'' said Kettl, who has done extensive reviews of
Gore's ``reinventing government'' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the Bush plan include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Adoption of a joint budget resolution, passed by Congress and
signed by the president, that would set out spending and taxation
priorities. The Congress already does this. Bush's idea would
simply involve the president in the process.
</P>
<P>
   -- Preventing government shutdowns by stipulating that if a
budget is not passed in time, affected programs would continue at
the level proposed by the president or by the current funding
level, whichever is lower.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make the approval or rejection of presidential nominees a
``top priority'' and ``challenge Congress'' to vote on them within
60 days.

   Southern buys D.C. area plants
</P>
<P>
   By MATTHEW C. QUINN
</P>
<P>
   c 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Southern Co. will become the primary electricity
provider to Washington, D.C., with a $2.65 billion power plant deal
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's purchase of four power plants from Potomac Electric
Power Co. will be the largest acquisition yet for the Atlanta-based
utility holding company. It's also thought to be the largest asset
purchase by any U.S. utility in a rapidly consolidating industry.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy Inc., Southern's unregulated power subsidiary,
agreed to purchase four plants from the Washington-based utility,
known as Pepco. The plants have combined generating capacity of
5,154 megawatts and are fueled by coal, oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the plants are in Washington's Maryland suburbs. The
fourth is near downtown Alexandria, Va., just across the Potomac
River from the U.S. Capitol and not far from Ronald Reagan National
Airport. Southern also agreed to operate two small Pepco plants in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Southern agreed to sell Pepco all the electricity it needs for
four years at prices below the Washington utility's average cost of
production. Pepco serves 700,000 homes and businesses in Washington
and the Maryland suburbs, including the White House, Congress and
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   After that agreement expires, Southern will be free to sell
electricity from the plants at market rates to utilities and other
large users in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware,
Virginia and Washington. Southern agree to retain the majority of
the plants' 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close
by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Southern paid considerably more than the estimated $1.8 billion
book value for the Pepco plants. But such purchases are not
uncommon in the consolidating $200 billion-a-year electric utility
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levi, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, which
advised Southern on the transaction, said the acquisition is a
``piece of the puzzle'' in the company's drive to become a major
U.S. generator with a coast-to-coast network of power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will boost the value of an initial public offering
planned later this year for 20 percent of the shares in Southern
Energy, Levi said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern plans to split off SEI into a separate company that
will manage unregulated utility businesses outside the area served
by the parent company's five regulated Southeastern utilities. SEI
accounted for 26 percent of Southern's profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the Pepco acquisition, SEI will operate 15,000
megawatts of generating capacity, about the same as Georgia Power
Co., Southern's largest subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an aggressive expansion in the last five years, SEI
has made major power plant acquisitions across the United States
and abroad. Until now, the largest price tag was $2.3 billion for a
Hong Kong power company.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of San Francisco, the purchases have until
now not made Southern the primary supplier to a major U.S.
metropolitan area. A Pepco spokesman said Southern will supply
``virtually all'' of the power to the utility's service area.
</P>
<P>
   Pepco put its power plants on the block last year to exit the
power generation business and concentrate on selling electricity
produced by others as well as cable television, Internet access and
other services.
</P>
<P>
   Southern shares closed Thursday at $24.94, down 6 cents on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug in the form of BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles
are organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints
may choose to spread a single article over several days.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth article in the series. It will be filed on
Friday, June 9, for release on Sunday, June 11.

   RACE-TV-DRAMA (Baltimore) _ Who Gets to Tell a Black Story: When
David Simon proposed to HBO a television series based on his book,
``The Corner,'' about black inner-city drug addicts, he was not
thinking much about the fact that he was white. But as the project
began to take shape, the issues of race loomed ever larger. HBO was
not about to make a series about black drug addicts created by, as
one HBO executive put it later, ``a bunch of white guys.'' Charles
S. Dutton, who had grown up in the city, spent his early years on
its streets and had his own tale of redemption, was chosen to
direct all six episodes. But, as he said, there would not be one
moment when he would forget that ``it's a white writer and a white
producer and it's HBO and a black director.'' By Janny Scott.

   RACE-CHURCH (Decatur, Ga.) _ Nearly 50 years after the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. scolded Christians for making 11 a.m Sunday
the most segregated hour of the week, the Assembly of God
Tabernacle here is the rarest of religious institutions: a truly
integrated church in the heart of the South. And yet, the
Tabernacle is deeply conservative, socially and theologically. What
draws its members is the intensity of their Pentacostal faith,
which teaches that the Holy Spirit can move in the lives of all
believers, regardless of background. By Kevin Sack.

   RACE-IMMIGRANTS (Miami) _ Before they left Cuba for America in
1994 Joel Ruiz, who is black, and Achmed Valdes, who is white, were
the best of friends. Today, in Miami, the two men live only four
miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.
For the first time, they inhabit a place where the color of their
skin defines the outlines of their lives _ where they live, the
friends they make, how they speak, what they wear, even what they

two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

 &HT;    Lakers confident, not cocky
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now the really hard part for the Lakers: taking
the Indiana Pacers seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the NBA Finals, Lakers fans and officials had some
concern about that, no matter how much the team denied it. But
after their demolition of the Pacers in Game 1 Wednesday night at
the Staples Center, the task is more daunting.
</P>
<P>
   After the seven-game struggle with the Portland Trail Blazers in
the Western Conference finals, the Lakers seemed to be back on
track in their quest for the championship. They were in total
control of Game 1, even when the Pacers moved to within two points
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. just got serious again and backhanded Indiana. With
Shaquille O'Neal dominating, the Lakers easily bolted to a 1-0
series lead going into tonight's Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Lakers' posture was the same as it was before Game
1 and even more emphatic: Overconfidence is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it,'' guard Kobe Bryant said, ``we're three
games away from accomplishing our goal. By no means are we going to
let down. By no means are we going to let up.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of their 104-87 victory could provide proper
motivation for the Lakers. They figure the Pacers will make
adjustments in how they defend O'Neal, who hit 21 of 31 shots for
43 points and had 19 rebounds. The league's MVP controlled the game
and the Pacers' big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first frontal piece of our offensive machinery and
our primary weapon,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``And teams
are going to have to adjust if they're going to beat us in a
series. We anticipate they'll make adjustments at some level, and
we'll have to counter them.''
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, Indiana will try to be more physical with
O'Neal and double-team him aggressively to force him to pass out to
teammates. The Pacers will try to force other Lakers to beat them
instead of taking another beating from O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be prepared for them being all over Shaq,'' said
forward Rick Fox, who had 11 points off the bench. ``You don't
expect them to leave single coverage on him as much as they did.
When that happened, we all started to feel comfortable. We executed
our offense 10 times better than any game in these playoffs. When
Shaq's playing like that on both sides, patrolling the paint like
that, it's easy to have the games we all had. But now it'll be
about what we do when they double him hard, like I'm sure they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   The other area of concern that should keep the Lakers grounded
is that no one expects guard Reggie Miller to endure another
1-for-16 shooting effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means was that an indicator of what this series is going
to be like,'' Bryant said. ``They're going to be ready to play Game
2. They're going to be more physical. Reggie will take more shots.
We can't take Game 1 and run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could be especially scary that Miller talked of the
Lakers being ``in trouble'' if they play him the same way tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary, man; he was 1-for-16,'' Fox said. ``He may go 16
for 16 the next game. You don't count on him missing those kinds of
shots every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Laker forward Robert Horry said, ``You hate it when a guy of his
nature misses that many shots, because you know he is going to come
back strong the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the consensus and the domination of Game 1, the
Lakers have reasons not to get too confident about their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand if we'd been in this situation before,''
Horry said. ``But no one has been here. We aren't going to miss the
opportunity. A lot of teams, when they've been there before, get
big heads because they think: `We're good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we're not good,'' Horry said. ``We haven't won anything
yet. And to get what we want, we can't even afford to think the
Pacers are going to let us have it. We have to play hard and the
right way every game. Indiana got here by beating some good teams.
They earned their way. We know that. And still respect them. And
it'll show in our play.''

 PERSONALS: British Still Holding a Grudge?

In ``The Patriot,'' which opens in the United States late this
month,  &UR; Mel &LR;   &UR; Gibson &LR;  plays an American farmer,  &UR; Benjamin Martin &LR; ,
a historic figure who fought against England in the Revolutionary
War. British newspapers aren't taking this well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is far from an accurate account of (Martin's)
participation,'' says the Sunday Times of London, in a passage
quoted by MSNBC. ``Instead, in the hands of an Australian actor
working with a German director and funded by Hollywood money, his
story has been transformed into a 160-minute polemic against the
British.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail agreed. ``I don't know what Mel Gibson has
against the English, but he gives them absolute hell in `The
Patriot,' '' said that newspaper. As did the Belfast Telegraph:
``New York-born, Australia-raised Mel Gibson loves bashing the
Brits in his movies.''

a heart-shaped bed, a picture editor &UR; Lisa &LR; 
 &UR; Miya-Jervis &LR;  described as ``familiar faux-lesbian porno iconography
to make its sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the editors realized the photo could be taken as a
``gross usage of women's bods'' or ``an example of empowered women
manipulating their own image,'' when they realized that magazines
such as Maxim were running it, ``We knew our instincts were right.
Satire or not, an ad that uses the body language of porn to speak
to the Maxim reader is not getting its powerful, women-in-charge

PUTIN TO VISIT NORTH KOREA IN JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin plans to visit North Korea
next month, a move that underscores his active foreign policy and
that seems calculated to counter the Clinton administration's plan
for a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Thursday that it would be the first trip
by a Russian leader to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented event, a bold step, as no head of
state from our country has ever been in North Korea _ neither in
Soviet nor in Russian times,'' Georgi Toloraya, an official in the
Foreign Ministry, told the newspaper Vremya Novostei.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes on the heels of Putin's meeting with
President Clinton in Moscow, in which the two leaders found
themselves at odds over the administration's plans for a limited
antimissile system.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korea visit will provide Putin with an opportunity to
make his case that diplomacy, not missile defense, is the way to
cope with an emerging missile threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Putin can also use the visit to challenge the idea that North
Korea is an irrational ``rogue state,'' a description the United
States has used to justify its antimissile plans.
</P>
<P>
   Those Russian themes are likely to resonate in Western Europe,
where the Western allies remain very anxious that the
administration's plan will start an arms race and leave them
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Putin took his campaign to Italy, where he urged
Europeans to support a Russian alternative to the administration's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were caught by surprise by the Russian
announcement. They said they welcomed the visit as a way to end
North Korea's isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that dialogue among all countries in
the region contributes to peace and security on the Korean
peninsula and beyond,'' a State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Japanese media, Putin's visit is scheduled to
take place in mid-July, just before the summit meeting of the
leading industrial democracies in Okinawa, Japan, from July 21 to
23.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Moscow had become more interested in the
situation on the Korean peninsula as a result of the summit meeting
between North and South Korea scheduled for early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Toloraya, who is deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Asian
department, said that the Kremlin had proposed the visit and that
the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, had issued a formal
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Toloraya said Moscow wanted to assure the North Koreans that
Moscow did not favor a unified Korea dominated by Seoul. Such fears
have grown in Pyongyang, he said, as Russia has developed economic
and political ties with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not the case,'' Toloraya said in his newspaper
interview. ``We consider it necessary for the two Korean states to
coexist for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. antiballistic missile plan is very much on the agenda,
according to the Russians. Toloraya said the Russians and North
Koreans would have a general discussion on ``how we can act
together in the world situation, including in connection with U.S.
plans for ABM.''
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect swipe at Washington, he said Russia's new
assertive role on foreign policy had the potential to upset
``somebody else's cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia fears that the limited defense the United States is
planing is just the first phase in a larger system that will
eventually counter Russia's strategic forces. Washington's goal has
been to overcome Russian suspicions and persuade the Kremlin to
amend the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable the United States to develop a limited
defensive system, which could include the deployment of 100
interceptors and the construction of a radar in Alaska.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To make its case, U.S. officials sought to convince Moscow that
North Korea's evolving missile capabilities are a danger to Russia
as well as the West. While the United States has cited a variety of
emerging threats, the missile threats from North Korea have emerged
as the primary argument for moving ahead quickly with a missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit meeting between Clinton and Putin, Russia
acknowledged that a missile threat was emerging from nations like
North Korea. Still, the Russians insist that the threat is not as
worrisome as the United States says. And while the Americans have
insisted that an antimissile system is needed, the Russians have
urged diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has persuaded North Korea to accept a
moratorium on the test-firing of long-range ballistic missiles.
That has precluded Pyongyang from testing its Taepo Dong-2, a
two-stage missile that Washington fears might eventually be
developed as an intercontinental missile.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fears that North Korea might try to break out
of those constraints. But instead of assuming the worst, the
Russians have been urging more engagement with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several indications of growing ties between
Russia and North Korea. The Russian foreign minister, Igor S.
Ivanov, paid a recent visit to North Korea. And on Thursday a North
Korean delegation arrived at Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far
East to discuss joint construction projects, the Russian news
agency Itar-Tass reported Thursday.

MICROSOFT BREAKUP ORDER DRAWS MIXED BUT MUTED REACTION ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Windows and Word may be ubiquitous across
Europe and Asia, but news of the court order to break up Microsoft
generated a muted reaction outside of the United States on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of admiration _ mixed with disbelief _ among
many commentators that a government would take such a step. Neither
Europe nor Japan have ever seen a comparable effort to break up a
large company, though European regulators have become much more
aggressive about imposing big fines on companies for
anti-competitive activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakup of a company is impossible under German law,''
said Stefan Siebert, a spokesman for Germany's cartel office in
Bonn. ``All we can do is prohibit abuses and impose fines.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, La Republica captured the sense that the breakup was
something that could happen only in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Washington judge with the deceptively good-natured image of
a western actor has with almost hate-filled words ordered the
breakup of Microsoft into two separate parts,'' the newspaper said
in an editorial Thursday. ``The century of the New Economy begins
exactly where that of the old economy began: with an America that
breaks up the monopoly of the `new oil.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mario Monti, head of the European Commission's competition
ministry, said through a spokeswoman Thursday that he
``congratulates'' the U.S. government for its work but said it was
too early to know whether the court order would affect European
investigations into Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Monti has raised questions about the Windows 2000 operating
system, suggesting that it may hinder the abilities of computers
linked over networks and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His office is also scrutinizing Microsoft's plan to acquire 29.7
percent of Telewest Communications PLC, the British cable
television operator. Microsoft has teamed up with Liberty Media
Group to buy a controlling stake in Telewest from Media One Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that there will be an appeal,'' said Amelia
Torres, a spokeswoman for the competition ministry. ``We will have
to see what the final ruling is.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most European software companies said they would not be
affected by the Microsoft case, several welcomed the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the recognition that monopolies have never been
successful or sensible,'' said Reiner Jung, a spokesman for Brokat
Infosystems A.G. of Stuttgart, a fast-growing developer of
encryption programs and other software used in online banking
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we want a weaker Microsoft,'' Jung added.
``Quite the contrary, we want a strong Microsoft. But what we don't
want is a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Suse AG, in Nurenberg, which produces software that runs on the
Linux operating system, a competitor to Windows, argued that a
court-orderd breakup of Microsoft might do little to break the
Windows monopoly unless the company makes its code available to
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft will have the ability after the breakup of making
available applications for other platforms,'' said Carsten Fischer,
a spokesman for Suse. ``But Microsoft has to adhere to the rules of
open-source software, which includes opening up its
documentation.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest effect of the Microsoft case in Europe could prove
to be on its many alliances and partnerships. Microsoft has struck
technology deals with scores of European media and
telecommunications companies, and it sought to invest in both cable
television and wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials say their goal has been to gain a foothold
in new media, from interactive digital television to advanced
wireless data communications.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, companies involved with Microsoft are waiting to
see what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently made it clear that we welcome Microsoft
as a potential corporate shareholder, and that remains our
position,'' said Rachel Turner, a spokeswoman for Telewest. &QL;

GOP BLOCKS PATIENTS' RIGHTS MANEUVER IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a rancorous prelude to election-year debates
across the country, Senate Republicans Thursday narrowly thwarted a
Democratic effort to bypass stalled negotiations and pass the most
comprehensive overhaul of the managed care industry since the
advent of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   With medical care for tens of millions of Americans at stake,
the Senate voted, 51-48, to block consideration of a Patients Bill
of Rights that would widely expand federal protections for
consumers in private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who forced the showdown, and Senate
Republican leaders claimed victory after the vote, though afterward
the prospect of Congress passing sweeping new regulations of the
health insurance industry this year appeared more imperiled than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The White House backed Kennedy's move, which the Massachusetts
senator said he made out of frustration over the recalcitrance of
Republican leaders who control a committee of House and Senate
conferees assigned to iron out differences between their competing
plans to regulate HMOS.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly four months, the closed-door talks have produced only
meager progress, and fewer than 40 legislative days remain for the
106th Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few more days like this and the Republicans will stop
stonewalling on the Patients Bill of Rights,'' Kennedy told
reporters, arguing that he effectively came within one vote of a
50-50 tie that would have lead Vice President Al Gore to cast the
deciding vote to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Four Republicans _ Senators Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, John
McCain of Arizona, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, and Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois _ joined the unified Democrat minority in
supporting the measure, which was modeled on a landmark plan the
House passed a year ago. Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota
Democrat who was absent, would have made the final tally 51-49,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP's chief negotiator, Senator Don Nickles, said
Kennedy's provocative move to bypass the talks had all but doomed
the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the White House and the Democrats have done the
last couple of days has been very deterimental to the likelihood of
getting a bill enacted,'' said Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, flying home from Japan Thursday, sent
senators a letter before the vote urging them to ``put the
interests of patients before those of the special interests'' and
support Kennedy's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles suggested that Senate Republican leaders, in the face of
Democratic opposition, may abandon the negotiating process and work
with their House counterparts to craft a compromise measure that
could pass both chambers with GOP support.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Senate Republicans accused Kennedy and his
allies of brashly undermining the talks to seize the advantage in
the run-up to the 2000 congressional elections. With polls showing
overwhelming support for tougher federal regulation of HMOS, the
vote was potentially perilous for a number of Republican senators
who face strong challenges in November, particularly Spencer
Abraham of Michigan and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles argued that the talks have produced substantial
progress, and he expressed disdain that Kennedy and others had
described the conference as ``a charade'' and ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy forced the vote by attaching the health-care measure to
a bill authorizing $309.8 billion in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a lot of people are a lot more interested in
politics and political theater and seeing if they can scare people
and use it to their political advantage,'' said Nickles. ``I very
much resent that.''
</P>
<P>
   The House measure, which the Senate rejected last year and again
Thursday, would guarantee fundamental protections for all 161
million Americans in HMOs and permit patients to sue their health
plans for decisions on medical care that resulted in harm or death.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate alternative, favored by GOP leaders, would cover only
the 48 million Americans who are enrolled in health plans that are
exempt from state regulations and would generally shield insurers
from patient lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   And negotiators have reached full agreement on only two of the
22 major issues in the measures after nearly four months of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the talks have dragged on beyond any reasonable
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an endless road to nowhere,'' he said on the
Senate floor. ``It is long past time for this Congress to stop
protecting HMO profits and start protecting patients' health.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Chafee, the moderate Republicans from New England who
sometimes provide Senate Democrats the margin of victory refused to
break ranks with GOP leaders on the managed-care matter. They were
Senators James M. Jeffords of Vermont, and Olympia J. Snowe and
Susan M. Collins, both of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and Collins spoke on the Senate floor to defend GOP
leaders for their handling of the conference. ``I find it
incredible that we are not allowing them to complete the process
when they made such progress,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, went a step further,
accusing Kennedy of ruining a productive negotiating process solely
for partisan gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Senator Kennedy is proving today is the cynical political
fact that no good deed ever goes unpunished,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats described Gramm's depiction of the talks as fruitful
as ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between this conference and a glacier is
that a glacier at least moves an inch or two a year,'' said Senator
Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat and assistant minority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defeat, Kennedy and his allies in the House,
including many Republicans, described the vote as a way to refocus
the nation's attention on the issue. They expressed hope that the
renewed attention would increase pressure on Senate majority leader
Trent Lott to speed up the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a certain level and Senator Lott has to look at
losing control of the issue,'' said Representative Greg Ganske, an
Iowa Republican.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mika Salmi said that he is always a little
cautious when venturing into the wilds of Hollywood from his
Atomfilms home base in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fast in Hollywood,'' said Salmi, whose company
produces short films on the Internet and sells them to outlets like
airlines and shopping malls. ``People are always coming to us,
trying to buy us. We're not anti-Hollywood. The key is just not to
get caught by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, the once separate and distinct worlds
of old-line Hollywood and the Internet dot-com ventures of the new
economy have been intermingling with increasing urgency, taking
their first faltering steps toward the coming age of digital
entertainment, whatever that might turn out to be. While the major
studios, conservative as always, are largely maintaining a discreet
distance from the roiling waters of the Web, many entertainment
executives, filmmakers, celebrities and talent agencies have been
plunging head-first into the digital deep end.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a week passes without the announcement of a new actor or
director signing a deal with a dot-com to create exclusive digital
films, or of a Hollywood insider proclaiming the acquisition or
creation of a new online venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many people in Hollywood who know so much about
their business that they convince themselves that they know about
every business,'' said David Wertheimer, chairman of WireBreak.com,
which emphasizes interactive entertainment on its Web site. ``They
look at what's on the Web and they say, `Hey, I can make better
videos. I'll start my own dot-com,''' Wertheimer added. ``They see
so much attention and so much money going to these Internet guys
and they think, `Who's that pimply faced guy on the cover of Time
Magazine? That's supposed to be me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has had to dodge or absorb a steady stream of
challenges over the decades, from sound to color to television to
videocassettes to independent films. Each one was predicted, at the
time, to be the movie establishment's undoing. Yet each time,
Hollywood not only persevered but, eventually, overcame the threat.
Now, while that may well happen again, many are wondering whether
the hidebound studios have finally found an adversary they will be
unable to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   To Joe Roth _ a veteran movie executive who left the top job at
Walt Disney Studios last year to start up the just-unveiled
Revolution Studios, an independent production company, and who is
also involved in two Internet ventures _ the issue is just that
stark: ``When all of this resolves itself,'' he asks, ``who will be
occupying the top tier?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, will the entertainment conglomerates own the
dot-coms or _ as in the case of the America Online acquisition of
Time Warner _ will the dot-coms own the entertainment
conglomerates?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is definitely a time of confusion and
opportunity,'' said Larry Kasanoff, a longtime feature-film
producer whose Threshold Entertainment includes a dot-com operation
aimed at attracting young males with a combination of sophomoric
sitcoms, video-game sagas and models in bikinis. ``Is this period
going to be long enough that a bunch of dot-com start-ups will have
time to get established? I don't know. I think, five years from
now, we'll look back and a lot of these dot-coms will have been
absorbed by the big studios. Others will have been able to use this
confusion time to take their place in the landscape. We intend to
be one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   The new entertainment dot-coms fall into a number of categories.
Some offer so-called streaming video, usually live-action and
animated shorts on the Internet, with a smattering of games and
chat rooms and varying degrees of interactivity. Others are more
business-to-business sites, connecting filmmakers with agents, with
projects or with each other. Some are digital laboratories, aiming
for a niche audience and, through the success or failure of their
programming, providing an incubator for future movie and television
projects. And many are just flat-out marketing tools, dedicated to
the glories of a particular film or image-conscious celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected in a business where celebrity is the
hottest commodity, many of the Hollywood dot-coms have been trying
to outdo one another by signing up major actors and filmmakers.
Shockwave.com, which creates Web-based animation software as well
as maintaining its own destination site, has signed deals with
filmmakers like James Brooks and David Lynch. Z.com, among whose
backers is manager-turned-mogul Brad Grey of Basic Entertainment,
has signed deals with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the
director Oliver Stone. And there are dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of the dot-coms has been, as far as Hollywood is
concerned, a relatively recent phenomenon. ``If you look back to
early 1999, there were maybe six or seven Internet sites offering
streaming video in one form or another,'' said Rick Hess, president
of Propaganda Films, which makes theatrical features as well as
digital entertainment for the Web. ``Today, there are maybe 75, and
that number is going up. But everyone figures that, down the road,
when the dust settles, there will only be maybe a dozen of them
left.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Those in the Hollywood mainstream who have been counseling
caution feel somewhat vindicated by the failure of recent Internet
initial public offerings, and the precipitous drop in high-tech
stock prices. And few can contain their delight at the collapse,
last month, of one of the highest-profile of the entertainment
dot-coms, The Digital Entertainment Network, even though its
financial troubles were largely attributed to its profligate
spending rather than to a flaw in the overall strategy of streaming
video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one in Hollywood expects that The Den will be the last
entertainment dot-com to fail, and much of the discussion in recent
weeks has been about which will go next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've detected a real change,'' Wertheimer said, as people have
reacted to the one-two punch of the Nasdaq plummet in April and the
collapse of The Den. Many of the players who were poised to jump
into the dot-com waters have decided to pull back, or wait a little
longer, he said, and some of those who are already in up to their
eyeballs are getting a lot more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this may turn out to be Hollywood's Vietnam, with
a lot of people rushing into this without a clear idea of why
they're getting in,'' Wertheimer said. ``We're going to see a lot
of people retreating and declaring victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the field has been particularly difficult, in part
because there is no clear picture of where this is all headed and
because so many of these new entertainment dot-coms have shifted
their strategies in recent months in the face of rapidly changing
technologies, increased competition and growing investor
nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ifilm, initially based in San Francisco and one of the early
leaders, began as a site where filmmakers could post their digital
shorts and try to find an audience. Now, it is based in Los Angeles
and offering not only its own stable of shorts but also serving as
a portal with easy-click access to digital entertainment all over
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Pop.com, an Internet partnership between Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of
Imagine Entertainment, was announced with a lot of fanfare last
October as a site that would be up and running this spring,
offering original short ``pops'' of entertainment featuring some of
Hollywood's top performers and filmmakers. But Pop.com is still not
online and there are reports that its principals are retooling
their Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When this wave of dot-coms took off, much of the initial
momentum was toward building so-called destination sites, aimed at
grabbing and holding an audience, preferably the 12-to-24-year-old
males who drive so much of popular entertainment. Now, however,
with a lot of destinations but with a scarcity of things to watch
there, many of the new start-ups and some of the older ones have
turned their attention elsewhere. Several key companies have
announced, or intend soon to announce, that they will spend more
time and energy on creating content for others' sites than for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a real clue where all this will end. ``We are in the
middle, right now, of speeding toward some future unknown
environment,'' said Morgan Rector, president of the Imperial Bank
Entertainment Group, one of the financial institutions most active
in underwriting feature films.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood establishment is worried that, with the Internet
offering the promise of new ways to distribute movies while also
competing for eyeballs and entertainment dollars, the new order
might well upset long-standing financial arrangements. And, just as
significantly, there are worries that what has happened to the pop
music business _ with songs being swapped and pirated on the
Internet beyond the reach of record company accountants _ will
happen with movies, too, if firm protections are not put in place
fast.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-coms, meanwhile, worry about being transformed into just
another division of a profit-hungry global media conglomerate that
will prevent them from expanding and exploding outdated
entertainment concepts. ``They always said that Hollywood runs on
fear and greed, and it's definitely true,'' Salmi said. ``The greed
kicks in when they look at all the dot-com millions. The fear is,
oh my gosh, `we'd better act quickly or we'll miss something
big.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To some, there is a bit of a lemming-like quality to the way so
many independent producers and former studio bosses have announced
the formation of their own start-ups, as though having a dot-com in
your roster of in-house activities is now as essential as getting
the best table at Spago or The Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's like, if you don't have that as part of your
dialogue over lunch at The Grill, then you're not with it,'' Hess
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is meeting the dot-coms in a variety of ways. Each of
the major studios has its own in-house Web operation. Some, like
Warner Brothers Entertaindom.com or Sony's Station.com offer
original entertainment and games. Others, however, are simply
marketing devices for coming releases.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavy action has been in Internet start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, for instance, has hired John Hegeman, one of the people
responsible for the successful ``Blair Witch Project'' Internet
marketing campaign, to create Distantcorners.com, a site
specializing in horror and science-fiction. And he bought a
substantial interest in Mediatrip.com, which his Revolution Studios
intends to use as a marketing tool for his feature films and as an
incubator for new characters and offbeat stories.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cooper, former head of production at DreamWorks, recently
announced the creation of a new Internet start-up, which will be
aimed at creating digital content for a variety of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in interviews with more than a dozen top entertainment
executives, every single one either had started his own dot-com,
bought an interest in somebody else's, or claimed he was just
waiting for the perfect moment to announce a new dot-com strategy.
</P>
<P>
   There is more here, they all insisted, than smoke-and-mirrors.
``I believe it,'' Cooper said. ``I'm betting my money on it.''

 &UR; `THE INSIDER' WARS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After speaking last weekend at a national conference of
Investigative Reporters and Editors in New York, &UR; Don Hewitt &LR;  and
 &UR; Mike Wallace  &LR; of ``60 Minutes'' were in the center of a fracas that
erupted over their harsh criticism of  &UR; Lowell Bergman &LR; , who used to
work for them and served as a consultant for the movie ``The
Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who was portrayed in the movie as caving in to CBS fears
about airing a segment about the evils of tobacco companies, said
that Bergman, depicted in the movie as a hero fighting for the
story, was ``a wannabe hotshot reporter.'' Bergman is ``not a
journalist I would allow within 100 miles of a TV news show or
1,000 miles of a journalism school,'' said his former boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman is working as a producer for ``Frontline'' and at the UC
Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. After Hewitt's onstage
remarks, said the Hollywood Reporter, Hewitt and Wallace exchanged
heated remarks with friends and supporters of Bergman, including
``Frontline'' boss  &UR; David Fanning &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by 100 journalists, the three argued, said the
Reporter, ``with Wallace grabbing Fanning's shoulders at least once
to make a point.'' Hewitt charged, ``That son of a bitch turned on
me. He lied. He betrayed me.''
</P>

   Reached on Wednesday, June 7, Bergman told Personals that ``a

 &HT;    EarthLink experiences e-mail problems
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 1.2 million EarthLink customers experienced
problems sending and receiving e-mail Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the mail servers had been repaired, but a mail backlog
made the system unresponsive for many users.
</P>
<P>
   Only EarthLink customers with MindSpring addresses were
affected. EarthLink and MindSpring merged in February, and some
customers retained MindSpring addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Smoak, Atlanta site manager for systems operations for
EarthLink, said no mail was lost but that a problem with a file
server that stores customer e-mail caused the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers want to check their mail, their mail client _
whether its Outlook Express or Eudora or another mail program _ it
goes out and gets the mail,'' Smoak said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mail to get, since the file server wasn't
working. That's why users trying to send or receive mail received
error messages. At the same time, other Internet users trying to
send mail to MindSpring accounts received messages saying their
e-mail to MindSpring.com could not be delivered. ``All the mail
started to pile up, and that caused the network problems,'' Smoak
said. ``It's a domino effect.''

PATIENT `DOING WELL' AFTER 4-OUNCE DeBAKEY HEART PUMP IMPLANTED &HT;     
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Legendary heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey
announced the latest in a lifetime of innovations Thursday: the
implantation of a miniature heart pump in a 31-year-old woman with
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, performed by Dr. George P. Noon on Wednesday, was
the first implantation of the device in an American patient.
Developed by DeBakey, Noon and engineers at NASA over 12 years, and
manufactured in Houston, the pump has been implanted in 32 patients
in Europe since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient is doing well this morning,'' said DeBakey, 91,
chancellor emeritus of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ``It
was very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Noon, a Methodist Heart Center cardiovascular surgeon, said the
woman, who was confined to bed awaiting a transplant prior to the
operation, would be walking by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very pleased, '' Noon said. ``Her main complaint is pain
from the incision.''
</P>
<P>
   The pump, the MicroMed DeBakey VAD, is descended from a category
of pumps called left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs. The
MicroMed pump is one of the tiniest yet, weighing 4 ounces and
completely internal except for a single wire that extends outside
the body and connects to a battery pack.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Texas Heart Institute implanted another miniature
LVAD, the Jarvik 2000, in December under medical emergency
conditions. They implanted a second in April, the first patient
getting the device as part of a clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBakey pump and Jarvik 2000 are both approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for study as a ``bridge to
transplant,'' or a way to buy time until a donor heart becomes
available. FDA rules require the patients to live in the hospital
until they receive heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Both pumps are less bulky than earlier generations of LVADs _
the DeBakey pump is one-tenth the size of older pumps. They are
small enough to fit in women and some children. Doctors hope the
smaller pumps will someday serve as a permanent alternative to
heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Anderson, president and chief executive officer of
Houston-based MicroMed Technology Inc., said conservative estimates
are that the pump should last ``at least five years and probably
longer.'' The ultimate cost will be ``significantly lower'' than
the current price tag of $60,000 for some LVADs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the pump's performance in Europe compares
``favorably'' to that of other LVADs. He declined to say how many
of the 32 patients have been transplanted with human hearts, or if
some have died, but said six current patients have been on the
pumps ``well over 100 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The MicroMed team hopes to expand to a multicenter trial and
implant a total of 70 patients. Noon is co-principal investigator
of the clinical trial with DeBakey, who is chairman of MicroMed's
medical advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey discovered the potential of LVADs when he implanted the
first one 34 years ago. The pump allowed the patient's heart, which
was in severe failure, to ``rest'' and recover. The patient was
weaned off the device, and resumed a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   DeBakey calls the new device an ``auxiliary aorta.'' Unlike the
Jarvik 2000, which fits inside the left ventricle, the MicroMed
pump consists of a titanium inflow tube attached outside the left
ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   The tube bends beneath the heart, carrying oxygenated blood from
the left ventricle into the spinning blades of the tiny pump. The
pump pushes the blood through a flexible Dacron graft (invented
decades ago by DeBakey) sewn to the ascending aorta. From there,
the blood is sent into the rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The patient must carry two 12-volt batteries in a shoulder bag
that weighs 5 pounds, the size of a medium-sized women's purse.
When one battery reaches one-fourth of its power it beeps, alerting
the patient, and automatically switches over to the second battery.
The batteries can be recharged in 75 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL ADD END)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; DeBakey, who has long pursued the creation of an artificial
heart, said he narrowed his focus to the left ventricle device
because it was less complicated, less expensive and had the
potential to help so many patients. He said five million Americans
suffer from some degree of heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the pump's potential to restore health by giving
ailing hearts a chance to rest and recover. In addition, DeBakey
said, when a heart transplant is necessary, patients who have been
on the pump are healthier and stronger and more likely to have a
good outcome.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman smiles at the camera, one foot propped on the
running board of a car. A man with an uncanny resemblance to Marcel
Duchamp looks toward the camera, too, his head sticking out the car
window.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about a black-and-white snapshot, circa 1930s,
palm-size. Who are these people? They are nobody and everybody,
like the photographer. One of billions of amateur photographs,
source unknown, the picture is a talisman of evaporated memory that
over the years probably made its way from the corner drugstore to
the family album, where it was briefly cherished. Then, in the
extraordinary way these things happen, it traveled from attic to
Dumpster to flea market into the hands of some scavenging
dealer-collector, whereupon it became an item on the art market
until finally wending its way to its present location: the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't life amazing? You may now come upon the snapshot in a
deceptively modest, highly unusual (for this museum, anyway) and
sublimely endearing exhibition called ``Other Pictures: Vernacular
Photographs From the Thomas Walther Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair guess that the man, the woman and the photographer
(could they still be alive?) would be surprised to find their
memento in a museum. Whenever the picture was snapped, wherever
that was, the man and woman peering into the sun, the photographer
maybe fumbling with the shutter before saying ``Cheese!'' _ none of
them, presumably, had any inkling or even desire that this snapshot
would be art.
</P>
<P>
   But the art is there, plain as day. It is in the reflection of
the woman's body on the car door: by some act of divine comic
grace, the reflection happens to match up precisely with the head
of the man so that he looks like the woman's ghostly, dwarflike
double, a funny-surreal coincidence that, by adding a layer of
unanticipated meaning to the picture, suddenly elevates it from
nothing to something.
</P>
<P>
   Art works this way sometimes. It doesn't arrive through the
front door. It sneaks in the back, the more pleasing for being the
result of dumb luck. This picture would be less likable, I suspect,
if we learned that a professional had planned it. The amateur's
fluke reminds us of a basic good in life, and this is always
heartening; we are reminded that art is out there waiting to be
noticed, the only question being whether our eyes are open wide
enough to see it.
</P>
<P>
   We have had the impassivity of the camera to help us,
fortunately. During the days when box cameras had range-finders,
amateurs went around pointing more or less in the direction of what
they wanted to shoot and hoped for the best, resulting in all those
headless portraits and what Mia Fineman, the curator, in the
accompanying book calls ``successful failures, pictures that sail
past their intended targets and into the foggy ether of a different
kind of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. With luck, the amateur photographers captured what they
wanted, but they often got plenty of other stuff in the pictures,
too, cameras being indiscriminate machines. The amateur who pointed
at the building behind the wrought iron fence in one snapshot in
this exhibition found a giant apple blocking the view. Our
accidental Atget could thank serendipity and the camera's wide lens
for what turned out to be a far more intriguing photograph,
although he (or was it she?) deserves credit simply for preserving
the picture, an act of connoisseurship that has allowed it to come
down to us. It is among several dozen pictures in the exhibition, a
few in albums, all by anonymous amateurs, shot between the 1910s
and 1960s, the heyday of the black-and-white snapshot. They are a
catalog of aspiring masterpieces and glorious errors: blurs, lens
flares, double exposures, overexposures, intruding shadows,
touchingly awkward homespun pornography and amputated compositions.
(Another show to open next week at the excellent Ubu Gallery,
around the corner from the museum, will present several dozen more
gems, equally lovable.)
</P>
<P>
   You will recall that the early part of the century was when
Surrealism thrived, Surrealism having its roots in happenstance and
error. It was also the era of the New Vision photographers, whose
unconventional viewpoints, weird croppings, infatuation with
technology and tendency toward mysterious imagery are qualities
variously echoed in these vernacular pictures: a worm's-eye view of
a man tipping his hat brings to mind the work of Aleksandr
Rodchenko. A view straight down from atop the Eiffel Tower
duplicates almost exactly something Andre Kertesz once did. And a
photo-booth snapshot of a woman with her back turned to the camera
mimics the familiar 19th-century photograph of the woman seen from
the back by Onesipe Aguado, a modernist precursor.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Not really. Walther's taste for modernist
photography accounts partly for the heavy overlap of vernacular and
professional styles here. But there is also the fact that,
consciously or by osmosis, amateur photographers have always
absorbed the language of professionals, as professionals (Walker
Evans, Robert Frank, Harry Callahan, Lee Friedlander; the list goes
on) have tried to emulate the amateur's blithe innocence and
authentic, sometimes comedic charm. This has caused a two-way
traffic in the history of photography, which has only accelerated
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   You are free to ignore this fact at no particular cost to the
pleasure you receive, and also to ignore various links between
these amateur snapshots and current art. For the record, the links
include the rising tide of so-called outsider art, a catchall
phrase for whatever is dubbed art that happens not to be made by
people professionally trained, which includes children, animals,
the insane and by extension, one presumes, hobbyist photographers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the value placed by many young artists on found
objects, a modernist infatuation enjoying fresh respect. Finally,
private snapshots being diaristic, vernacular photographs dovetail
with a diaristic trend illustrated by the works of Nan Goldin,
Elizabeth Peyton and others.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this matters, ultimately. The pictures are actually
more appealing because of their distance from, not connection to,
professional art: blessedly unpretentious, the amateur photographer
expected little or nothing of the public, assuming at most an
audience of family and friends, thus leaving vast room for our
ignorant conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   And this, as the old saying goes, is the beauty part. Strangers
to the images, we are blissfully free to try to fill the space
between what we see and what we know, an anarchic, unbridgeable
gap. What is the meaning of the gesture of a woman in a
tight-fitting dress bent over a panting spaniel? One hand out,
index finger of the other hand pointed up, she is like a crooked
John the Baptist directing us heavenward, a divine puzzle,
decipherable only perhaps by dogs and the woman's descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Or what about the house being dragged on tethers through the
water? It floats as if in the middle of an ocean, an apparition,
inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the man dangling from a zeppelin. The
photograph is not a bad composition, formally speaking, two dark
bands sandwiching one white, with the figure of the man in the
center. He is a sailor; we know that much from the silhouette of
his pants and from the crowd of sailors below him. But is he on the
way up or down? And how did he get there in the first place?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the double exposure of a bedroom and a street,
simply amazing, a dreamlike miscue in which bed lamp becomes
streetlamp and streetlamps become bedposts and a streetcar chugs
past the foot of the bed, where a tiny woman stands alone in the
sunlight. Where did this incredible picture come from?
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope we don't find out. Much of the appeal of the best
amateur snapshot is that, alienated from its source, it stays a
riddle, thereby exemplifying the bigger truth that photographs by
their nature never tell us as much as we expect they will.
</P>
<P>
   Private pictures like these disclose especially little except,
maybe, about ourselves: what used to have the narrowest meaning to
the person who snapped it (that's Uncle Bob ironing his pants;
that's Sylvia with the sprinkler on the lawn) becomes a Rorschach
of our imagination. Trying to decipher these tiny mysteries, we
progress from being voyeurs to excavators, combing our memories for
what we may recognize from our own family albums, from our own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   We look for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how artful the photographer,'' the critic Walter
Benjamin once wrote, ``no matter how carefully posed his subject,
the beholder feels an irresistible urge to search such a picture
for the tiny spark of contingency, of the here and now, with which
reality has (so to speak) seared the subject, to find the
inconspicuous spot where in the immediacy of that long-forgotten
moment the future nests so eloquently that we, looking back, may
rediscover it.''
</P>
<P>
   The redolent snapshot is one in a million. Just look at the
albums in the show, which consist of pages and pages of forgettable
photographs. Bear this in mind before devoting the weekend to
fishing through old shoe boxes, in wallets, behind the sun visor of
the car, wherever you keep your keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who knows? The world, it turns out, is full of
amazing little surprises.

P&AMP;G CHIEF EXECUTIVE RESIGNS, AS COMPANY ANNOUNCES DISAPPOINTING
QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of Procter &AMP; Gamble, the consumer products
giant, resigned Thursday as the company announced it would suffer
another disappointing quarter and its stock price fell to less than
half of what it was worth just four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the move, P&AMP;G acknowledged that it had tried to remake
itself into a more aggressive company too rapidly and that its core
brands, which include Crest, Pringles and Tide, had suffered as it
focused on developing new products.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G's board immediately named Alan G. Lafley, a 23-year employee
of the company, to succeed Durk I. Jager, the hard-charging
executive who had vowed to shake up the company's staid culture and
force managers to act in a more entrepreneurial style. It also
called John E. Pepper, Jager's predecessor and longtime rival, out
of retirement to serve as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, it's clear we changed too much too fast,'' said
Lafley, 52, who was a president overseeing the company's
beauty-care products and its North American operations. The cost
has been steep: P&AMP;G has lost $75 billion in market value since
January.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many executives are saying they want their
corporations to act like small, entrepreneurial companies, largely
in response to the growth of Internet commerce, P&AMP;G's struggles
indicate just how difficult a successful transformation is.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jager, 57, the company tried to bolster a mediocre growth
rate by developing products more quickly, eschewing the
many-layered approval processes and market tests for which the
conservative company was famous. Jager also moved many managers to
new jobs to shake up a corporate culture in which employees are
called Proctoids because of their efficiency and obedience.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives have led to some successful new products _ like
Swiffer, a floor-cleaning cloth _ but the price has been too high,
the company said Thursday. Costs have risen almost as fast as
sales, and the money P&AMP;G spent on its new initiatives left less to
spend on the marketing of its largest businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share for the company's fourth quarter, which ends
June 30, will be about the same as they were a year ago, rather
than 15 to 17 percent higher, as the company had estimated. For the
fiscal year, P&AMP;G is now likely to earn $4.23 billion before
one-time charges, up only slightly from its $4.15 billion profit
last year, according to Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of P&AMP;G fell $6.125, to $56.75.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, investors and reporters,
Lafley said he would spend the next six weeks studying P&AMP;G's
spending to decide which efforts should continue to receive their
current levels of investment. ``We will make tougher choices,''
said Lafley, who is known as A.G.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither he nor Pepper criticized Jager by name, they
bluntly repudiated the pace with which he had tried to change the
$38 billion company. The company moved executives between divisions
too rapidly, they said, and it adopted new financial measures that
turned out to be too optimistic. Speed, Lafley said, ``is not a
substitute for good business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we thought would take about a year to complete is clearly
going to take at least a year longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of P&AMP;G's most important brands have
underperformed products made by rival manufacturers like
Kimberly-Clark and PepsiCo's Frito-Lay. Crest, for example, has
lost market share to Colgate and Aquafresh as P&AMP;G managers have
been slow to respond to consumers' growing appetite for toothpastes
that promise to do more than simply clean teeth. In the 52 weeks
that ended April 23, Crest's sales grew by 1.3 percent while
overall toothpaste sales increased by more than 3 percent,
according to Information Resources, a Chicago company that tracks
supermarkets, drugstores and larger retailers like Wal-Mart Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Tide is underperforming its rivals in the liquid-detergent
aisle. The growth rate of Charmin toilet paper is trailing those of
Quilted Northern and Kleenex Cottonelle. Zest, Ivory and Oil of
Olay soaps have all lost market share over the last year. And
Pringles has fallen further behind Frito Lay's best-selling potato
chips, according to Information Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus all went to speeding new products to market,'' said
Timothy M. Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It was the earnings shortfall _ a result of slower-than-expected
sales _ that led to the resignation of Jager, a native of the
Netherlands who took over the chief executive's post 17 months ago.
Pepper, 61, who is more popular among employees but also considered
less aggressive, originally beat out Jager for the chairman's job
in 1995 only to cede it to him last year after a disappointing and
abbreviated term.
</P>
<P>
   In January, newspapers reported that Jager was considering
buying the drugmakers American Home Products and Warner-Lambert in
an effort to vastly enlarge P&AMP;G's small pharmaceutical division.
Investors thought the idea too ambitious and P&AMP;G stock fell more
than 10 percent, causing Jager to abandon his plan reluctantly.
Jager also made overtures to buy Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   In March, P&AMP;G warned that its third-quarter profits would be
smaller than expected, and shares fell another 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news brought the shares down to their 1997 level, by
far the largest drop over the last two decades for the widely held
stock. The decline is likely to aggravate morale problems at the
company's Cincinnati headquarters because of the large portion of
employee retirement savings that the company puts into its own
stock.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also offers the latest evidence of the
struggles that consumer-product companies are experiencing despite
the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. Companies like
Coca-Cola and Gillette have been able to push through only moderate
price increases, if any. Consumers have refused to pay more for
staple goods, and retailers, led by Wal-Mart, have gained more
power through their growing size. At the same time, economic
troubles in Asia and Latin America hurt sales in recent years, and
the current weakness of the euro has dampened profits in Europe.
The rise in oil and paper costs have not helped, either.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jager said in a statement that the decision to resign
was his, analysts said it was yet another example of the small
margin of error that chief executives have at a time when the
volatile stock market punishes companies that surprise it with bad
news.

</P>
<P>
   During this year alone, the top executives at Coca-Cola, Mattel
and Xerox have left after presiding over disappointing results.
``The capital market is taking its vengeance on those who do not
get great numbers,'' said Michael Useem, a professor of management
at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ``And
directors are much more inclined just to pull the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafley graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and
Harvard Business School, and his only full time job outside of P&AMP;G
was in the Navy. He is personable and energetic, said Sally J.
Dessloch, a vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities, and has a
reputation for doing good job of motivating his employees. Other
analysts said his style was closer to Pepper's than Jager's.

FLORIDA HAS PROBLEMS WITH AN EXECUTION BY LETHAL INJECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida, which switched to lethal injections after a
series of botched executions in its electric chair, has had trouble
with another execution.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Demps, a three-time convicted killer sentenced to die by
lethal injection on Wednesday, was strapped to a gurney for 33
minutes while, he said in his final words, technicians at Florida
State Prison struggled to insert the lethal intravenous drip in his
veins.
</P>
<P>
   When the procedure to insert the intravenous drip, which
normally takes a few minutes, was completed and the curtain between
the execution chamber and witnesses was opened, Demps pleaded with
his lawyer to investigate the way the state's executioners had
handled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They butchered me back there,'' Demps said from the gurney.
``I was in a lot of pain. They cut me in the groin, they cut me in
the leg. I was bleeding profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   The state went ahead with the execution, its third since
shifting from the electric chair in February.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, said that Demps was
left strapped to the gurney for so long because the paperwork was
delayed, and because the state's technicians had trouble finding a
vein for an alternate intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
   But Demps said the state's technicians twice sliced painfully
into his body, and had stitched up one wound before taking him into
the execution chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said the delay was partly because the state was
awaiting word from the U.S. Supreme Court on a last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Demps' lawyer, George F. Schaefer, told The Miami Herald that
the court had notified the warden by 5:30 p.m. that it would not
act on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, his lawyer said in a written statement, was pronounced
dead at 6:53 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to State Attorney Rod Smith, Schaefer called for a
formal investigation into the execution, saying that ``those
complaints of abuse sounded sincere to me.''
</P>
<P>
   David Thomas, director of health services for the Florida
Department of Corrections, said the state did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol used in lethal injection is a flexible document
that gives us the professional discretion to locate a suitable vein
to inject the chemicals,'' Thomas said. ``As with other states that
use lethal injection, a minor surgical procedure may sometimes be
necessary to locate a vein. Such a procedure could take a
considerable amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Demps,'' Thomas said, ``the protocol was
complied with and the execution was carried out in a professional
manner. The inmate suffered no undue discomfort.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Demps had evaded the death penalty once.
</P>
<P>
   He was on death row for taking part in two murders in 1971 when
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was
unconstitutional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the court allowed capital punishment to resume, and
less than two months later, Demps was sent to death row again after
taking part in the killing of an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, who held down an inmate while another man stabbed him,
said he was not guilty and that the state had framed him because he
had been spared the death penalty in the earlier case.
</P>
<P>
   His execution comes after a series of botched electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   Blood spurted from Allen Lee Davis, a three-time murderer, when
he was electrocuted in July.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1990 and 1997, inmates caught fire in the chair as they
were put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporters in Florida were afraid the chair's
gruesome history would result in a backlash, in the courts and
among the public. Earlier this year the state switched to lethal
injection as a less troublesome means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   But death penalty opponents said the state just seemed to have
trouble executing its inmates, no matter how it was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has a remarkable history, in terms of its inability to
get its act together as far as killing people,'' said Stephen
Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in
Atlanta. ``It sounds like Florida has failed again in terms of
carrying out an execution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' Bright said, ``is there is no good or
right way of killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's history of problems in corrections is not confined
to the death chamber. Last year, Frank Valdez, a death row inmate,
was beaten to death by prison guards armed with stun guns. Valdez
had murdered a corrections officer 12 years ago.

NASA DESIGNS HUMAN-LIKE ROBOT FOR SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The prospect of robots with a distinctly human
appearance working side-by-side with astronauts in space is no
longer a figment of science fiction, experts at NASA's Johnson
Space Center said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of research, a group of space agency engineers
is weaving a collection of small electrical motors, television
cameras, sensors, computer chips, plastic, aluminum and cloth into
the head, right arm and hand of a mechanical man that could one day
lug a wrench on the international space station or examine a rock
on Mars for signs of fossilized life. The left arm and upper torso
should be assembled by mid-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of robotics, this is way ahead of anything that has
been flown in space,'' said Christopher Culbert, chief of the
robotic systems technology branch at JSC.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced feature of the mechanical creature, which NASA
has christened Robonaut, is a five-fingered hand that can activate
a power drill, scoop sand, hold a kitten or carry a jug of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the world's best robotic hand,'' beamed
Culbert. ``We are state of the art for this level of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 mechanical, electrical and computer software
engineers embraced the $3 million project to see if it could build
a machine capable of lifting some of the spacewalk burden from the
crew of the international space station. Once the outpost has been
assembled, its seven residents will be responsible for hundreds of
hours of external maintenance annually.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by NASA's Robert Ambrose, pursued a design that
resembled a large human so the robot could use the same tools and
equipment already developed for astronauts. The result is a machine
that resembles C3PO, the loquacious robot from the popular Star
Wars films, more than it does the chunky industrial robots that
populate terrestrial assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will take a descendant of Robonaut's to fulfill the
vision of the robot in modern science fiction cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Robonaut is more correctly categorized as a tele-robot, a
machine that moves and performs tasks in response to the commands
of a human operator.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's creation is operated by a human seated only a few feet
away and wearing a special helmet and gloves. The view from two
cameras mounted like eyes in Robonaut's head is transmitted to the
human operator's helmet. Each time the operator moves a finger or
flexes a hand, a command to do the same is sent to Robonaut.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are probably at least a decade away from developing a
robot that could actually turn a human directive like ``retrieve
the folder from the file cabinet'' into action, said NASA's Hal
Aldredge, who spearheaded software development for the robot.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the orbiting space station, Robonaut would be commanded
by an astronaut in the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   In order to lower the risk of a time-consuming spacewalk,
Robonaut would be sent out to remove cover plates and position work
tools before an astronaut dons a space suit and ventures out to
handle the more delicate tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy could cut by as much as 30 percent the length of
time an astronaut is exposed to the deadly vacuum and temperature
extremes of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous environment,'' Aldredge noted. ``We'd
like to keep the astronaut who knows how to do all the high-level
tasks inside in a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, NASA considers the work to develop Robonaut strictly
research.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency would have to find funding to develop a
prototype robust enough for test flights on the space shuttle
before it could assign Robonaut a permanent home on the space
station or a seat on a spacecraft destined for a Mars landing.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, terrestrial interest may grow. Machines based
on NASA's latest in robotics could be used to disarm land mines,
clean up chemical spills or help respond to a crisis at a nuclear
power plant. The design of the hands has also started to pique the
interest of medical experts in prosthetics.

EDDIE IZZARD CIRCLES AND LANDS
</HEADLINE>
  OK, he doesn't really 
circle, but he meant to 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients on or after June 11,
2000) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in the middle of your conversation with him, Eddie
Izzard interrupts to tell you that there was a direct flight
between Vietnam and Seattle during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's weird,'' the British comedian/actor ponders for a
second before he turns his attention back to you with, ``Sorry,
just a bit of information I thought I'd give you there.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if you don't know what to do with that tidbit, Izzard
just might. There seems to be no limit to what he's willing to put
in his act, and there seems to be no limit to what Izzard can make
funny.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, limits don't seem to exist much for Izzard, a
self-described universal citizen who has done his act in France _
in French; who once performed his act before 11,000 people
(including Prince Charles) _ a Guinness world record for standup
comedians; who has bared it all on the legitimate London stage; and
whoaspires to be a movie star. He starts a five-night, sold-out
stand at the Henry Fonda Theatre on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard, as you may remember, made quite a splash during his
``Dressed to Kill'' tour, which came to America in 1998. It's hard
to imagine riffing on Stonehenge, the American Revolution, Hitler,
European unity, the Anglican Church and Scooby Doo and getting
laughs on all of them, but Izzard did. Not since Robin Williams
burst onto the scene in the late '70s has a comic demonstrated such
an agile mind, which may explain why the American comedian _ who is
a fan _ lent a hand in bringing that tour to the states.
</P>
<P>
   The show then became a cable special. One of the people who
brought that about was Carolyn Strauss, HBO's senior vice president
for original programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, he's really funny,'' she says flatly, describing
why she wanted Izzard's show. ``He has a fantastic sense of
synthesizing the past and the present and his sense of history is
so unusual _ unlike most of today's comedians _ that it becomes an
incredibly fun, fresh point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comic originality was almost overshadowed by his attire,
which consisted of a Chinese jacket, black vinyl pants, frosted
hair and 4-inch heels.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard, as he says, is an ``executive transvestite,'' a bloke
who fancies girls but likes to have the same freedom they have in
dress. Back then he talked about how his role model growing up was
``The Avengers''' Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) in her sexy black outfit
and with her kung fu moves. But he doesn't want to go on about
that, ``otherwise you get the impression that this guy's just a
transvestite and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Izzard has returned to America in a new show called
``Circle.'' Asked what it's about, he offers this rather roundabout
description: ``Circles seem to rule the universe. Planets are
circular. Orbits are circular. Time, space is curved. Buddhist,
Native American religions are about going back to the Earth. The
big bang is exploding and coming back _ almost circular. I thought
I'd knit that into the fabric of the show so that it had circles
coming through as themes. And now I decided not to do that. So I
haven't actually put it in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   So the show's not about circles?
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is called `Circle,' '' he says, ``but it's more long
and stringy than a circle.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you talk about?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some stuff in there that's history but also science,
science fiction,'' he rattles off, ``some things about the monarchy
and the queen mother, Britain being terrible at the Olympics _ we
got no gold medals last time _ and stuff about Flipper.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphin? ``Yeah, along with whales, seals and swans and ...
Pinochet.'' Aquatic animals and a Chilean dictator _ in Izzard's
world everything ties together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be predictable, although I probably am,''
Izzard almost apologizes. But anyone who's seen Izzard's act knows
that isn't his worry. While most other comedians are navel gazing,
Izzard is exploring a world that's growing more connected every day
and finding the universal joke along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy is human, not national,'' he says, pointing out that
people laugh at the same places in his show whether he's in
Iceland, Sydney or Seattle. ``In Britain, they said that France had
a visual sense of humor. And I thought, `It can't be like that.
They made that up. It can't be that all 80 million people just sit
there going, (in a mock French accent) `Ah, look the birds, they
are funny how they fly,' '' he says, adding, ``Germans got a sense
of humor as well, which is good to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with Izzard, who is on the line from Seattle (now you
get the earlier reference), you can almost feel him working out the
rhythms of his act _ the Ping-Pong verbal volleys connecting him to
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show's all written in a workshoppy kind of way, depending
on what the audience seems to like,'' says Izzard, who likes to
interact with the crowd. ``If I like it and the audience likes it,
I just keep it in and keep riffing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that works, he says, because he assumes the intelligence of
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   So does he pore over history books to get his ideas?
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch telly,'' he says. ``The standup is sort of like
surfing through all the channels at once... it sort of bleeds from
the Discovery Channel to the film channels, to sitcoms and CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took the 38-year-old comedian a while to synthesize his
stream-of-consciousness absurdist humor, he says, citing Monty
Python, the Goon Squad, Steve Martin and Ernie Kovacs as
inspirations. When he started, his material was too strictly
surreal for audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use to say stuff like, `I served in Vietnam. I was a
waiter,' And then I'd go into whole loads of stuff about preparing
foods in war zones. It was quite obviously a lie, but sometimes
audiences wouldn't come with it. They thought, `No you didn't. You
weren't in Vietnam.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Izzard took another tack. ``I found that if you start in real
and then you flip to surreal as you're walking down real you take
everyone with you and they don't even know they've gone there with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, his act just opened up. ``I found that no one was in
the history area,'' he says. ``So I thought, `I'm fascinated by
that,' and then I just thought, `Let's just go anywhere that I'm
fascinated by.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Circle,'' which has been critically acclaimed on its East Cost
stops, will be filmed later this month in New York City. Strauss,
who hasn't seen it yet, says HBO will consider picking it up.
</P>
<P>
   But after this tour standup may take a backseat in Izzard's
career. Last year he performed the title role in a revival of
Julian Barry's ``Lenny'' on the London stage, garnering favorable
reviews like ``deeply convincing,'' ``captivating.'' The Guardian
noted he was ``frequently naked... he performs Bruce's dialogue
with a drum _ in which drum-beats echo the rhythm of a sex chant _
with an inquisitive excitement that suggests his words are being
conjured up on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   If details can be worked out the show may land on Broadway, says
Izzard, who calls playing the irrepressible, foul-mouth American
comedian ``grueling, because you have to burn up at the end of
every performance.''
</P>
<P>
   So far his movie career has been mostly unremarkable, with minor
roles in a few films like ``The Avengers,'' ``Velvet Goldmine'' and
``Mystery Men.'' To change that, Izzard thinks he needs to commit
to movie roles as totally as he's committed to doing standup.
</P>
<P>
   If Izzard does conquer film, it will standup's loss, and then
you wonder: What will he do with that Vietnam-to-Seattle
reference? &QL;

MAN HELD IN KILLING OF POLICE CHIEF'S RELATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA WHITAKER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chief Bernard Parks of the Los Angeles police
announced Thursday the arrest of an 18-year-old man in the fatal
shooting of his granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that I would be talking about my granddaughter
in this fashion,' Parks said at a morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged city residents and officials to continue working
with the police to bring an end to the violence plaguing some
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we unite together as a department, city and community, we
can fight this violence,'' he said. ``Enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Sharad Shabazz was arrested early Wednesday and charged
with killing Parks' 20-year-old granddaughter, Lori Gonzalez.
Shabazz had been picked up the day before in southwest Los Angeles
for drinking in public. Based on tips, a warrant had already been
issued for his arrest in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they believe that Gonzalez was the unintended
victim of gang-related violence. A 20-year-old passenger in her
car, identified as Ernest Thomas Gray, is said to have been the
target.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has been described as a gang member with a felony record.
He was apparently wounded about three weeks before the killing,
which took place about 10:15 p.m. on May 28 as he and Gonzalez were
leaving a Popeyes chicken restaurant. He ducked as a gunman
approached the car and shot. Gonzalez was struck several times.
</P>
<P>
   No weapon has been recovered, and police officials said they
were looking for additional suspects. But in announcing the arrest,
Detective Brian Carr said investigators were confident that they
had found the gunman based on evidence and witness identifications.
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz was charged with one count of street-gang murder, which
carries a possible death penalty or life without parole. A law
making gang-related killings a capital offense went into effect
earlier this year. The district attorney's office said it had not
yet decided how to proceed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Shabazz's public defender, arraignment was
pushed back to June 23. Asked in a court appearance whether he
supported the delay, Shabazz vehemently opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred in the Jefferson Park neighborhood of
South-Central Los Angeles, where gang-related violence and drug
dealing have been persistent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez lived with her father in Mission Viejo, about 50 miles
south of downtown Los Angeles, and was a student at Saddleback
College there. She was in Los Angeles visiting her mother when she
was shot. She was described as a vibrant young woman who worked two
jobs and volunteered in her church.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vice president just was not satisfied. A team
of graphic artists had labored to come up with a logo to emblazon
on Al Gore's campaign buttons, bumper stickers and placards, but he
felt they had failed to capture the right spirit. So he sketched an
alternative, a swoosh and a star _ a simple, futuristic look with
the words, ``Gore 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took several of the suggested designs and kind of recombined
them and added a different approach,'' Gore said. ``I sat down and
drew that on the table with the people who had made suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   It never occurred to Gov. George W. Bush to do that. When his
staff presented him with a proposal for a blocky, traditional logo
featuring an American flag and the words, ``George W. Bush For
President,'' his response was quick and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at it and said, `It looks good,''' Bush
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a small thing, but Gore's keen interest in the
signature of his campaign, and Bush's admitted lack of interest,
perfectly captures the stark differences in how they are running
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fingerprints are on every major move or pronouncement. He
prides himself on making decisions based on his judgment, built on
nearly 8 years in the White House and 16 years in Congress, and not
on the views of his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president immerses himself intimately in policy, and
often even in logistical matters. Recently, when he was in a rush
to travel from New York to Washington, Gore announced that he was
scuttling Air Force Two because he would make better time on the
U.S. Airways shuttle. His stunned military and Secret Service aides
knew not to try to talk him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, is far more removed from specifics. He
prefers to surround himself with people he trusts. Once he feels
comfortable that they understand his philosophy, he leaves them to
come up with proposals for him to sign off on. Notably, it was
Bush's aides, not the candidate, who plotted a course of action
when the campaign was in crisis after Bush lost the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The unmistakable contrasts in how Bush and Gore make decisions,
handle pressure and relate to their advisers offer revealing
insights into how they would run their presidencies. In extensive
interviews, officials from both campaigns sought to play up
anecdotes that showed that their candidate would operate most
effectively in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's supporters say his impressive knowledge base allows him
to comfortably make informed decisions. Bush's backers argue that
his lower level of engagement is a virtue because the governor is
not burdened by needless detail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is possible to move beyond the campaigns' spin to see
striking differences in the candidates' approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore bases his decisions on devouring information and reaching a
reasoned conclusion; Bush operates more on gut instinct. Gore often
lectures his advisers; Bush expects his to tell him what he needs
to know.
</P>
<P>
   Gore happily debates policy minutiae; Bush prefers to speed
through meetings to get to the heart of the matter. Gore is not
bashful about sitting at a laptop and rewriting speeches; Bush
prefers using a black Sharpie marker to delete sections or change a
word here or there.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's aides say he sometimes sees himself as the
smartest person in the room, and often he is right. Bush's aides
say he likes to joke to assembled advisers about holes in his
knowledge, which is a healthy sign, they say, of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore scours the newspapers and, often several times a day, will
cut out an obscure detail or paragraph and hand it to an aide with
instructions. He tries to read every word written about him. Bush's
aides said the governor read about himself from time to time, but
preferred to have his wife, Laura, or others sum up what was
written about him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bush are the stereotypical empty suit
manipulated by handlers. If anything, both candidates tend to be
stubborn, often not yielding to their advisers' suggestions. Not
surprisingly, both are sensitive to caricatures: Gore as a control
freak drowning in specifics who discounts others' opinions or Bush
as a naive puppet.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting in an interview that his artistry on the logo was
``the exception rather than the rule,'' Gore said he tried ``to
avoid getting bogged down in details.'' He made clear that his
style was not like that of President Jimmy Carter, who obsessed
over the schedule at the White House tennis courts, or President
Calvin Coolidge, who endlessly scrutinized guest lists at White
House parties.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore asserted that his grasp of policy would be
invaluable in the White House. ``I like the broad brush strokes,''
he said. ``But sometimes a significant detail is actually a broad
brush stroke in disguise. Sometimes, a significant detail can be a
fulcrum around which the test of the issue turns.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made no excuses for his lapses in knowledge. ``I don't
think anybody knows everything about every subject, and anyone who
pretends they do is someone I don't want to be the president,
because this is a complicated world,'' he said in an interview.
``The key to the presidency is to set divisions, to lay out the
parameters by which decisions will be made and to encourage really
good, competent people to serve the country for the right reasons
and to build a team.''
</P>
<P>
   A Force Behind Decisions
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a figurehead here!'' the vice president snapped, after
a cluster of aides had failed to adequately brief him about an
event in New Hampshire in the primaries. ``I've got to know what's
going on in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, that was an understatement. The reality is that
Gore is the driving force behind virtually every big decision of
his campaign, and many small ones. His propensity to run things
himself has not scared off talented aides. But Gore often turns to
them more as resources to press forward with his own decisions
rather than as principal decision makers.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in late May of his closest advisers at his
residence at the Naval Observatory here, Gore offhandedly told them
he had settled on a new campaign strategy. He would halt the
relentless attacks on Bush that some Democrats feared were doing
Gore more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That's what I'm going to do,''' recalled Carter
Eskew, one of Gore's top advisers. ``Then he laid out a series of
things, like family issues, that became the basis of the next two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers had felt it was important that Gore stay on the
offensive. But no one dared to challenge him. ``When you work with
somebody, you know when there's an opening _ and when there
isn't,'' Eskew said. ``He was emphatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides also winced when he told them he would propose a
sweeping reform of the campaign finance system. Many thought he
would be ridiculed because of the questions surrounding his own
fund-raising practices in 1996. Others worried that the issue was
not a big vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, they tried to distract Gore by saying other matters
needed attention first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd divert him into some other areas and he'd say, `What
about that speech?''' said Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Such delay tactics, Eskew conceded, were ``a way to try to kill
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore persisted. ``It did not give me pause,'' the vice
president said of the objections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is similarly never hesitant about upending speeches or
events. Early last month, when he was traveling on Air Force Two
from Washington to Chicago, he abruptly discarded a health care
speech after reading a clipping from a morning newspaper saying
that the National Rifle Association was thrilled at the prospect of
a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was traveling to a conference of health care
reporters, summoned aides to his cabin and announced that he would
talk about gun violence. The hook: that easy access to handguns is
a health care issue.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said they argued against it, but Gore did not budge.
After Air Force Two landed, Gore kept the motorcade waiting while
he worked the phones. He called one aide in Washington about
statistics he remembered that had been put out by the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her to quickly find out whether or not I was right in
remembering that the AMA had done a big statement or publication on
the handgun and the health care issue,'' Gore said, ``and find
relevant statistics on it. She found the statistics that I said I
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   He then instructed his staff to rewrite the speech.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly an exception. After Gore's advisers drafted a
statement for him last December that castigated his own
administration's policy on gays in the military, the vice president
thought it was too weak. So he wrote a harder-edged statement
himself, over the objections of several advisers. ``We thought it
would kill him in the South,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Bush announced his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion
over five years, Gore told his aides, ``We need to respond
quickly.'' Riding in a sport utility vehicle headed to Ida, Iowa,
from Sioux City, he began calling experts like Lawrence H. Summers,
the Treasury secretary, and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's
national economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked the tax plan at an open meeting and then again at
a news conference, saying it would squander the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Gore plays scheduler. On the morning after the Iowa
caucuses, Gore and his aides were operating on virtually no sleep.
Finally, his entourage made it to a hotel in Nashua, N.H., for a
few hours' nap before the one scheduled event of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But just as two aides, Mike Feldman and Chris Lehane, were
falling asleep in their shared hotel room, Gore came banging on the
door. ``Go away,'' Lehane shouted, not realizing it was the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they opened the door and Gore, clad in a bathrobe with
his schedule in hand, demanded, ``This is all we're doing today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' Feldman reminded him, ``there's six inches of snow on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no use. The aides, reluctantly, added an MTV event to the
schedule and a photo opportunity: they delivered coffee to the
local snow crews.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because of his deep involvement in decisions, Gore cannot blame
his advisers for ones that go awry, such as how distanced himself
from President Clinton on Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we dragged him kicking and screaming,'' said
one of his top advisers.
</P>
<P>
   A Corporate Executive's Touch
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not inclined to drastically alter a speech or a schedule
on the fly. He behaves more like a corporate executive. His aides
welcome the comparison to President Ronald Reagan, who did not
dither with details and set out broad goals, despite being
ridiculed as out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the most turbulent moment of Bush's campaign, after his
humiliating loss to Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire primary,
the governor stuck to his policy.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush made clear to his aides that he was distressed with
the state of the campaign, telling them that it had to be more
aggressive and not watch idly as McCain convinced voters that he
was the only reformer in the race. Then, rather than dictate
remedies, Bush dispatched his aides to come up with suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid out the principles of what he thought went right and
wrong in New Hampshire,'' said Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist.
``Then we came up with options that were presented to him formally
and informally over a couple days. He accepted them and rejected a
few.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from what Gore did last September, when former
Sen. Bill Bradley began surging in polls. Without consulting his
aides, Gore uprooted his listless operation in Washington and moved
it to Nashville. ``I announced we were going to do it,'' he
recalled, ``and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides could not cite a time when the governor, responding
to Gore or a news development, ripped up a speech and turned a
day's schedule on its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to control our own agenda,'' said Karen P. Hughes,
Bush's communications director and one of his closest aides. ``That
doesn't mean that he's inflexible. When Cardinal O'Connor passed
away, the governor wanted to attend the funeral. That's an example
of something that changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the decision to attend the funeral of Cardinal John
O'Connor of New York came at the suggestion of an aide, not Bush.
``I don't think it initially came from him,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair, though, to portray Bush as passive. He does
not hesitate to overrule his advisers, and when he does he is often
guided more by instinct than policy.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing a speech he was due to deliver on Social
Security before a group of newspaper publishers in May, Hughes
said, Bush was puzzled by the content because he was scheduled to
deliver a Social Security address the following week. She recalled:
``He turned around and looked at me: `Why are we talking about just
Social Security? Why aren't we talking about the importance of
reforming education and rebuilding the military?''' The speech was
retooled.
</P>
<P>
   Before the South Carolina primary, Bush's advertising team had
produced a 60-second commercial that opened with black-and-white
shots of lobbyists in cigars in a smoke-filled room. The intent was
to portray McCain as in the pocket of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush rejected the commercial as too harsh. Mark McKinnon,
Bush's media consultant, said: ``He was very affirmative about it:
`This isn't going out under my name.' It was not a debatable
point.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said he argued that because of time pressure it was not
advisable to change the spot. ``Listen, this was in the pressure
cooker of South Carolina and minutes mattered,'' he said. The
governor prevailed and the shots of the lobbyists were pulled.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the night Bush defeated McCain in the Virginia primary, his
aides had prepared a blistering victory speech. But in his heavy
black marker, Bush deleted several pages of the most negative
sections. For example, he kept the sentence, ``On the next step of
welfare reform, he has no plan.'' But he crossed out the next
sentence: ``His policy agenda is narrow and shallow, and it makes
no place for the poor and the forgotten and the frail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was we needed to keep the pressure on Senator
McCain,'' Hughes said. ``I told him there was a lot of frustration
at headquarters.'' She said Bush telephoned several aides to
explain that he did not want to undermine them, but felt the speech
was too strident.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Candidates of Divergent Styles
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore fume when staff members arrive late for meetings.
They have little tolerance for aides who are not prepared. Yet
their styles are quite different. Gore is more like a sometimes
overbearing teacher, while Bush often plays the impatient student.
</P>
<P>
   The governor prefers oral presentations to leafing through
briefing books. ``I've seen the governor say, `Why don't you close
the book and tell me what you think is most important?''' Hughes
said. ``He gets to the heart of the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Evans, the campaign chairman and Bush's best friend,
put it this way, ``His classic question is, `Have you told me
everything I need to know?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's biggest pet peeve at meetings is when aides leave
their cell phone or pagers on, he is also known for not abiding
long-winded presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sit there and let a briefing go on that isn't a
good use of his time,'' said Josh Bolten, his domestic policy
adviser. ``You get maybe 60 seconds in. If there's a really good
briefer who's doing a good job, you might get three or four minutes
before he's interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not bashful about pleading ignorance, and will even joke
about how he failed a reporter's pop quiz on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't know, he'll say, `Hold it,''' Bolten said. ``If
somebody uses an acronym he doesn't know, he'll stop them and say,
`What does that mean?' Sometimes he says, `Use plain English.' He's
not afraid to say when he doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Bush's aversion to too much detail about the
campaign's finances, Evans said: ``We talk about the budget a fair
amount. All he wants to know is, `Are we under or over?'''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has no use for flip charts, aides said, Gore often
draws charts on an easel. ``Some days I think he is a professor,''
said Donna Brazile, the campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore acknowledged that his grasp of issues, and his
certainty about how to proceed, can be intimidating. ``I think
sometimes a young staffer or a new staffer who hasn't gone through
the process before may feel sometimes a little hesitant to speak up
in disagreement,'' he said. ``But it doesn't last long because I
try to encourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some who know Gore worry that his vast knowledge can
sometimes lead him to foreclose other points of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore comes off to me as a guy who has absolute confidence in
what should be done and really isn't all that interested in what
you think substantively,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a
Delaware Democrat who supported Gore in the primaries. ``Al is
interested in getting briefed, forming an opinion and then it's
settled. That reflects a political certitude: a guy who will make
decisions a la Harry Truman and go home and go to sleep. Except
Truman operated on a gut assessment based on a historical context.
Al operates on an intellectual assessment that doesn't accommodate
much input.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also compared his style to Harry Truman's. But he said that
was a positive attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Harry Truman's philosophy,'' he said. ``The
essence of it was: `Go ahead and make good decisions and then move
on to the next decision.' Right. You live with the consequences and
you get better as you go along.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The operating approaches of Gore and Bush not only reflect their
experiences but also their personalities and interests. Gore had a
deep interest in his campaign's logo _ as well as in helping dream
up a logo for the Democratic National Convention _ because he has
dabbled himself in painting and thinks political branding is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that logos and other visual symbols that are
seen over and over and over again actually are pretty important,''
Gore said. ``And if you get one that really hangs together well,
it's much better than having one that's kind of mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush does not share that passion. In fact, asked about his
logo, he replied, ``You mean what's on the bumper sticker and
stuff?'' Saying that such artistic endeavors would waste his time,
he added, ``There are people smarter than me on designing logos.''

LIFE NOW IS A FAST-FORWARD BLUR TO AMERICA'S MOST FREQUENT FLIER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE _ The door to President Clinton's suite was
closed for much of the trip, meaning, ``Do Not Disturb.'' The
lights were out in the Secret Service cabin. In the back of the
plane, the journalists had their mouths open but only heavy
breathing was coming out.
</P>
<P>
   During occasional moments of consciousness, more than one
passenger aboard the presidential aircraft blamed Vice President Al
Gore for their out-of-whack body clocks.
</P>
<P>
   In other times, it might have been Air Force Two streaking back
and forth across the Pacific like a commuter shuttle for the
funeral of a fallen prime minister. Memorial services have long
been part of the unwritten portfolio of the vice president, and
this one, in the opinion of some White House aides, had Gore's name
written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Jet-Lagged Presidential Mourner
</P>
<P>
   Eleven thousand people crowded into a Tokyo sports arena
Thursday to pay respects to Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister of
Japan who died a month ago. Vietnam sent its deputy prime minister
to the memorial service honoring Obuchi, who had been in the job
two years before being replaced by Yoshiro Mori in April after
suffering a stroke. Macao flew its secretary for social affairs and
culture for the ceremony. Sri Lanka was represented by Dhamasiri
Senanayake, the minister for tourism and civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting among them, in a dark suit with a solemn expression on
his face, was a seriously jet-lagged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides had not been unanimous about making the trip.
There were suggestions to send Secretary of State Madeline
Albright. Gore was out of contention because of his campaign
schedule. But Clinton had overruled the naysayers. He had wanted to
remember Obuchi, who had visited the White House in May 1999, in a
personal way. Samuel Berger, the president's national security
advisor, had backed him.
</P>
<P>
   Berger made the case that the event was important to the
Japanese, and that they would remember a presidential snub long
into the next administration. And other world leaders were
attending: the prime ministers of Australia, Thailand and Malaysia,
for instance, and the presidents of South Korea, the Philippines
and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Clinton is planning a state visit to Japan next
month, and even though he just returned from a trip to Portugal,
Germany, Russia and Ukraine, and even though Japan is 13 hours away
by plane, he sandwiched a trip to Tokyo into his week.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. He returned from Kiev on Monday night. He met
with King Abdullah of Jordan at the White House Tuesday. President
Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico was arriving for lunch on Friday. Clinton
is off on Saturday for a commencement address in Minnesota. That
left an opening, with just barely enough time to get to Tokyo,
shake some hands, gulp down a spicy tuna roll and climb back aboard
Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton does not have to worry about enough leg room
when he travels. His plane, a modified Boeing 747-200, has the
space of a medium-sized home (about 4,000 square feet), and he has
free run of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, however, he roamed less than he usually does.
Except for an intense card-playing session with the Air Force
flight attendants in the galley, and another session with aides on
the return trip in the conference room, Clinton spent the bulk of
the trip retired to his room, where aides know not to roust him.
</P>
<P>
   Just a Sentimental Journey?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton broke no records Thursday with his attempt at jet-lag
diplomacy. Back in 1994, he had traveled to Budapest and back in 24
hours, spending just seven hours on the ground. Before him,
President Bush had jetted to and from Cartagena, Columbia, in the
same day. And President Carter had flown to and from Tokyo for a
meeting that was shorter than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton looked as fresh as can be aside the other dark-suited
leaders at the memorial service, thanks to a steward that keeps his
clothes unwrinkled and an on-board shower. But all the hours in the
air seemed to slow him.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, a tentative Clinton rose when his name was
called and placed a bouquet of white chrysanthemums at the base of
a large altar that held Obuchi's urn. Clinton bowed twice in the
direction of an large photograph of Obuchi, just as all the other
leaders did. But he and his other sleep-deprived aides awkwardly
traversed the stage, jumping out of each other's way and
momentarily blocking the arriving delegation from the Republic of
Palau.
</P>
<P>
   During his half-day in Japan, Clinton did sit down with Mori for
a short conversation in the morning. President Kim Dae Jung of
South Korea, who is preparing to meet with his North Korean
counterpart for a summit meeting next week, briefed Clinton in the
afternoon. But aides said again and again that this trip was not
about pressing foreign policy interests, and they offered the
brutal schedule as exhibit A of the affection Clinton had for
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole trip, door to door, is about 36 hours,'' said a
senior administration official, overestimating the length of the
trip by a couple of hours. ``That highlights what the president is
willing to do in order to personally be there for this
commemorative event.''

`SURVIVOR' TROUNCES `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Establishing its credentials as the runaway television hit of
the summer, the CBS show ``Survivor,'' which chronicles the
adventures of 16 real people co-existing on an island off Borneo,
scored extraordinary ratings for the second straight week, this
time even drubbing ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' in
every audience category.
</P>
<P>
   More than 18 million people watched the show Wednesday night,
about 2.5 million more than watched the show's first edition last
week. That time ``Millionaire,'' which ABC had scheduled in an
effort to try to keep ``Survivor'' from taking off, still had more
total viewers. But as ``Survivor'' added viewers this week,
``Millionaire'' lost them. It was down about 1.2 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Survivor'' is almost certain to stoke the
market for similar reality-based programs, most of which were
created by European broadcast companies and which have now been
offered for sale to American networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is set up as a competition in survival skills
between two groups on the island. The emotional core of the show,
and apparently the most important attraction for the audience,
comes in its final moments each week when one group must vote one
of its members either the least helpful or simply the least
well-liked, or least valuable, off the island.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid emergence of ``Survivor'' as a hit raises the
possibility that CBS might be able to duplicate ABC's feat last
summer when one big hit show totally turned around the network.
Before ``Millionaire'' became a weekly series, ABC was languishing
in third place; it ended the season in first place almost solely on
the strength of ``Millionaire.'' As a result, ABC was able to sell
advertising in its upcoming fall shows for more money than any
other network got.
</P>
<P>
   The extra advantage for CBS is the appeal of ``Survivor'' to
young viewers, who are always considered more valuable by
television advertisers. CBS has been handicapped for years by the
fact that its shows are mainly watched by viewers over 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has clearly begun to emerge as part of the wider
culture, with news and discussion about the show widespread on
television and radio talk shows and coverage increasing in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The show has provided prime comedy material for both David
Letterman and Jay Leno on their late night shows. Letterman did a
top 10 list on ``Top 10 Things That'll Get You Thrown Off the
Survivor Island,'' including ``No. 10 _ Shrieking, `This was a
mistake, we're all gonna die here!' an hour into Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, USA Today carried the results of the second
``Survivor'' episode as though it were a sports event, reporting
which participant was voted off the island by the other cast
members (it was B.B. Andersen, a 60-year-old retired contractor
from Kansas). The newspaper also conducted a poll of readers to
determine whom they would have picked to evict (26 percent chose
Susan Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin).
</P>
<P>
   Andersen became an instant interview subject for numerous media
outlets. Besides the CBS ``Early Show,'' which will have each
rejected cast member on the air every Thursday morning, Andersen
appeared Thursday on Fox News Channel, MSNBC, CNN, ``Entertainment
Tonight,'' ``Access Hollywood'' and the E Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising defeat of ``Millionaire,'' the show that
dominated the recently ended television season, may represent a
potential threat for ABC and its corporate owner, the Walt Disney
Co., whose financial picture greatly benefited from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of ABC Entertainment, said Thursday:
``None of us believe that `Millionaire' is at any risk, in the fall
or during the ratings sweep months when we'll have special events
built around `Millionaire.' We've certainly lost no faith at all in
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun said ABC was simply acknowledging that CBS will probably
be able to achieve this summer what ABC did last summer, a near
monopoly on media attention for their television show. But he said:
``We've had nights before where appointment shows have done well
against `Millionaire.' We certainly don't expect `Millionaire' to
beat everything every night it's on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, ``Survivor'' had a
7.5 rating. ``Millionaire'' had a 4.7. Among the younger group of
adults between the ages of 18 and 34, ``Survivor'' had a 7.6.
``Millionaire'' had a 3.6. (Each rating point represents just over
one million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Mergerson, 24, a music store clerk at a record store
in Emerald City, Wash., said: ``It is certainly not a first of its
kind, but it feels like another, much more realistic twist on the
idea of a reality adventure. It also plays to very basic human
instincts of self preservation, which in itself is alluring.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two years of war have caused the deaths of more
than 1.7 million people in eastern Congo, where people who manage
to flee the fighting often die of hunger and malaria while hiding
in impenetrable forests, a leading refugee agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The figure represents about triple the expected number of deaths
for the area from August 1998 through last month, according to the
study conducted for the International Rescue Committee in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although the normal death toll in the five-province area of 18
million people would be 600,000, the actual number who perished was
2.3 million. Of the 1.7 million additional deaths reported in the
survey, 200,000 were caused by acts of violence, whereas the rest
were attributed to the war-related collapse of health services and
food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men with guns come and wreak havoc on a very regular basis,''
said Les Roberts, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who
supervised the study. ``Those men cause more death by making people
flee their homes than actually by shooting or slitting throats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People flee into the forest when a village is attacked, often
at night. If they get a little sick and they are not eating, they
often die. One girl told us how she fled her village at night with
her family of eight. Five of the eight died as they hid in the
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in April and May, with random samplings
of houses in and around Moba, in Katanga Province; Kabare, Katana
and Kolonge in South Kivu; and Kisangani in Orientale Province.
Researchers asked residents questions like how many people were in
the family, whether anyone had died since last Christmas _ a major
holiday among the many Roman Catholics in the region _ and how many
died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, where Roberts formerly worked, provided baseline
statistics for sub-Sahara Africa. The results from the region, with
a population of 1.2 million, were extrapolated to the interior
regions and neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what scientists hate to do, extrapolate from 1.2
million people to 18 million people,'' Roberts said. ``But we have
very consistently made conservative assumptions. I think we have
protected ourselves from the criticisms that we are being
extremists or hyperbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finished his survey, Roberts asked the U.N. relief
assistance coordinator for the area and a representative of the U.
S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the region to look over
his conclusions. They thought he may have been conservative, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he and his team found abandoned health clinics, local
economies in tatters and families struggling without the
subsistence agriculture or barter systems that had sustained them
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Children under five, the survey found, account for more than
one-third of the excess deaths in eastern Congo, an area disrupted
since 1994 by waves of ethnic and civil wars, sometimes
indistinguishable from an armed scramble for gold and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into Congo, the former Zaire, in
August 1998 in support of rebels opposed to the government of
President Laurent Kabila. Last summer Rwandan and Ugandan troops
turned on each other, and they have been fighting each other this
week around the diamond center of Kisangani, adding at least 50
more civilian deaths to the toll.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke Thursday with President
Paul Kagame of Rwanda and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and
was assured that a cease-fire, not the first in recent weeks, went
into effect Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, Ugandan and Rwandan troops were fighting in
Kisangani, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United Nations
and this month's Security Council president, said Thursday that the
council's members ``deplore the loss of life and the damage
inflicted by the forces of Uganda and Rwanda on the Congolese
population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the International Rescue Committee report, Kisangani had been
found to be one of the brighter spots in a very bleak picture of
life in one of Africa's potentially richest countries. The United
Nations had hoped to make the city a neutral site where a large
contingent of peacekeeping troops could be based and political
negotiations begun to end the Congo war.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that eastern Congo has become ``an unchecked
incubation zone for disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that malaria and diarrheal diseases, including
cholera, appeared to be the leading causes of death, although
meningitis and suspected cases of polio were also found.
</P>
<P>
   Because blood transfusions are often needed for malaria victims,
he said, ``my strong gut feeling is that the prevalence of HIV has
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS and other deadly viruses are known to have flourished in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congo has something like the 14th-highest death rate on the
planet,'' he said. Most of the other 13 countries are in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no blood tested in this region since 1998,'' he
added.

BRAZIL OPENS FILES OF REGION'S ABUSES IN AGE OF DICTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Throughout the 1970s, the military
dictatorships of South America organized a secret program, known as
Operation Condor, to kidnap and kill one another's opponents. Now
the democratic governments that succeeded them are joining
together, albeit tentatively and somewhat reluctantly, in an effort
to untangle the true extent and toll of that sordid collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden burst of activity is the result of an Argentine
judge's request, made last year, for information about three
Argentine citizens who disappeared here when both countries were
under military rule. To the surprise of almost everyone, Brazil's
highest court recently ordered that all documents relating to the
case and to Operation Condor be supplied to Argentine authorities.
</P>
<P>
   According to historians and human rights groups, Operation
Condor was a cooperative effort that involved the military, the
police and intelligence forces of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Each nation's ``apparatus of
repression'' exchanged information with its counterparts in
neighboring countries and kidnapped, tortured and killed guerrillas
and other exiles from those countries on behalf of its colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, for example, at least 118 exiled Uruguayans, 51
Paraguayans, 49 Chileans and 9 Brazilians were ``disappeared,''
according to tallies compiled by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Condor, named for the large bird that flies above the
peaks of the Andes, appears to have been a Chilean initiative, and
interest in its activities has heightened as a result of the
judicial case against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, that country's former
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer exiles were killed here than in Chile or Argentina. But
Brazil's military dictatorship began much earlier, in 1964, and
recently unearthed documents indicate that Brazil's security
apparatus began training police and military intelligence from
neighboring countries as early as 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is one of particular interest to President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Cabinet. As Georges Lamaziere, the
president's press secretary, noted recently of the current
administration, ``a good number of its members were victims of
previous governments,'' including Cardoso himself, who spent
several years in exile in Chile and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, even though the memories are painful, we can
regard this as a page that has been turned but should not be
forgotten,'' Cardoso said last month in his first public comment on
the matter. His government has also said that Brazil would pay a
$72,500 indemnity to the families of the three missing Argentine
leftists, who are said to have been executed here.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups, however, have complained that the Cardoso
government has been slow to produce documents that would clarify
other incidents still being investigated. Brazil's armed forces,
backed by the minister of defense, Geraldo Quintao, have said
variously that requested documents never existed, that they appear
to have been destroyed, or that to make them public would violate a
law requiring that such records be kept secret for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why they should be opened,'' Quintao, a civilian,
said last week. ``No country opens its intelligence archives
immediately after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability of the armed forces to produce relevant records is
surprising in view of the spate of investigative reports that in
recent weeks have filled the pages of Brazilian newspapers and
magazines. All of the accounts are based on official documents that
have been leaked to reporters, and some include detailed interviews
with former military officers who remember specific episodes of
cooperation with Argentine, Paraguayan and Uruguayan authorities.
</P>
<P>
   None of the material that has come to light thus far indicates
the direct involvement of any American government agency in
Operation Condor. But the United States was clearly aware of the
effort: the first known mention of Operation Condor came in a 1976
cable from the American Embassy in Buenos Aires, and American
agents worked closely with security officials in the region, many
of whom had studied at the U.S.-run School of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and human rights groups, along with relatives of the
disappeared who want to make peace with the past, are eager to
examine the Brazilian records.
</P>
<P>
   Though Paraguay made public thousands of pages of police files
in 1992, no country involved in Operation Condor has yet opened its
military archives for inspection, and the originals of many
documents are believed to have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Pinochet case and using the Paraguayan records
and material recently uncovered here, Brazilian and Paraguayan
lawyers and human rights groups are seeking to bring Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, Paraguay's former dictator, to justice. Overthrown in
1989 after 35 years in power, General Stroessner now lives in exile
in Brazil, but an effort is under way here to have him expelled or
extradited to Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of investigations has also revived speculation about
the death of Joao Goulart, who was president when the military
seized power here in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Goulart died in exile in Argentina in December 1976 of what was
officially said to be a heart attack, but no autopsy was performed,
and his family had only limited access to his body when it was
returned to Brazil for burial.
</P>
<P>
   The Goulart family has always suspected that the former
president may have been poisoned or that someone tampered with his
medicine, fears that have been fed by the recent publication of a
September 1976 document that shows the military here was convinced
that he was about to return to Brazil. In an effort to clarify the
circumstances of Goulart's death, a congressional inquiry has just
begun, and family members this week authorized the exhumation of
his remains.

JOSEPH E. BACHELDER III, AN ENGINEER OF THE EXECUTIVE PAY EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 11)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As shareholders gather for annual meetings, many are finding in
their proxy statements further evidence that executive pay
continues to soar. Even severance packages for top executives can
mount into the millions, or tens of millions. As a leading
executive compensation negotiator, Joseph E. Bachelder III, head of
a Manhattan law firm that bears his name, may deserve a share of
the credit, or the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Bachelder has negotiated employment contracts for Louis V.
Gerstner Jr. at RJR Nabisco and IBM; Lawrence A. Bossidy, the
former chairman at AlliedSignal; and George M.C. Fisher, chairman
of Eastman Kodak. He has also negotiated the severance package for
David Coulter, who left as president of BankAmerica in 1998. For
James Dimon, he negotiated both his severance from Citigroup and
his pay as chief executive of Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   Bachelder agreed recently to discuss whether he was doing too
good a job. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   _STEWART KAMPEL
</P>
<P>
   Q. What justifies these enormous pay packages?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, they haven't gone up so dramatically. Over the last
50 years, the salary packages of CEO's have grown at a rate of
about 2 percent over the Consumer Price Index, and in the 1950s and
'60s the growth was actually lower than workers' pay rises.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses, however, are up dramatically. And so are stock options,
as part of pay packages. Over all, major U.S. corporations are
doing very well. Equity has gone up over 10 times since the '80s
and '90s, largely because of the dramatic growth in the markets.
And shareholders have benefited greatly. That's wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy has been growing, and the CEO's are the chief
custodians for extraordinarily growing basic assets. This has been
an extraordinary period, but it was just like at the turn of the
last century. Just look at all those big houses in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   What has also fueled the rise is momentum. There is a very
competitive market for top executives. Executive search firms
hardly existed years ago. Now they're so big that some have even
gone public. That created a dynamic that didn't exist. So the
corporation reflects the general prosperity of many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If the value of a company's stock drops, should executives
with large contracts give something back?
</P>
<P>
   A. What is compensation? It's pay for services over the long
term and the short term. If I worked for 10 years and the company
had 2 bad years, how should we look at it? The CEO was responsible
for the enormous wealth and growth of the company as well as the
opportunity everyone had to ride with its good fortune. Except for
a Michael Jordan, who never had one, CEO's can have a bad year.
They do get fired. Some may ``retire'' at a young age, but a
significant number are really being fired.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many chief executives are getting lavish perquisites like the
personal use of company planes, country club memberships, a car and
driver and services like secretarial help even after they leave or
retire. Are you doing your job too well?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would attribute these unusual perks to unusual
circumstances. First, extraordinary CEO's win special arrangements.
Second, precedent is very important. Then those precedents become
the standard. Say Charlie Snoggs wants the same perks as Jack
Welch. So he becomes a competitor. He's competing for profits. And
he wants a competitive salary, pension and bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your experience is mostly with old-economy companies. What
should an executive of one of these businesses focus on: wages,
perks or stock options? And what should an executive look for in a
new-economy firm?
</P>
<P>
   A. For an old-economy firm, pensions are very important. CEO's
move so frequently today that they don't build up pensions. So it's
important to have the company ensure your pension. And it's vital
to have it funded.
</P>
<P>
   At new-economy companies, one strategy is to purchase stock with
a promissory note, which qualifies for long-term capital gains, and
then have the note forgiven. Stock options will allow you to buy
when the company is private and to cash in when it goes public.
</P>
<P>
   Q. More generally, how can an executive get the best deal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't exaggerate or misrepresent your salary. You'll be found
out. If you're going to work for a new company, look at their proxy
statements, see what they are paying their top people. Examine the
form and nature of payment. Try to get credit for your service at
your present company.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if there is a change in control of the company? Be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   Check the proxy statement to see the range of bonuses that
senior executives can expect. And don't quit Co. A till you get
what you what you want at Co. B _ in writing.
</P>

MY MONEY, MY LIFE COLUMN: THE OTHER RETIREMENT PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 11) 
 By JUDITH L. STEININGER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one warned me about the actual day when I would retire. Sure,
I had read a surfeit of information about retirement, but it
focused only on financial planning and activity planning _ things
like travel, golf, volunteer work, and how not to get into your
spouse's space. None of it talked about how to get through that
final day at a job you had loved for decades.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a college professor for 30 years, the last 23 at an
engineering college. (Before teaching, I worked as a research
chemist and as a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when I decided to retire, I thought I had plenty
of time to prepare. I submitted my resignation letter in the fall
for the following spring. During that time, I continued to teach,
do research and grade papers; in fact, I never discussed my
retirement plans with my students. Of course, I started to feel a
little squeamish when candidates for my position, not to mention my
old office, started to appear. But I even grew accustomed to that.
</P>
<P>
   Then the calendar caught up.
</P>
<P>
   The night before my last day, I slept uneasily. As I drove to
work the next morning, the rest of the world seemed silent. The car
was on auto pilot, having made the trip so many times before. But
my mind started whispering things like ``this is the last time you
will drive into your parking space'' and ``this is the last time
you will walk up these stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived at school, I saw all the usual sights. Some
students were kibitzing in the hall; others were cramming for
quizzes. A kissing couple was scrunched into a corner. Because it
was 10 minutes before the hour, people were pouring into hallways
and onto staircases.
</P>
<P>
   On any other day, I would have enjoyed making my way through
such a crowd. But on this day I felt like a wide receiver in a
slow-motion football play, hunching my shoulders against the rush
of people, caroming off walls and, finally, banging into the frame
of my office door. I lunged through the opening as though it were
the goal post and my book bag the protected football.
</P>
<P>
   I had but one class to teach that day _ contemporary literature.
It was my favorite. I left my office early for the walk to the
classroom building, not wanting to run into another crowd.
Unfortunately, when I got to the room, I found myself among
students who were also early.
</P>
<P>
   On any other day, I would have relished these encounters: the
teasing about homework and papers, the questions you wish they
would ask in class, the hesitant comments about personal lives _
all the seemingly small talk that makes teaching a wonderful
vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as I started to teach, I found myself avoiding eye contact
with my students. How unusual that was: for so many years, I always
looked into their eyes, wishing to engage the bored, searching for
the lights I hoped would go on as I made a brilliant point _ or for
the wrinkled brow indicating my point was not so brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted that hour to last forever; it didn't. I could not tell
them that this was my last class. The final minute ticked; I bolted
for the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I left, I felt the travertine floors of the hallway turn into
something akin to sponge. My knees could find no steady place. The
institutional beige paint in the hallways seemed to slide off the
walls. The air was hard to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   One thought assaulted me: This must be what it is like to die;
my life here is ending, and the world is continuing as if nothing
has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there are people for whom the last day at work is one
big Mardi Gras. But I loved teaching, so for me it was the Last
Supper. I suspect that a lot of folks feel as I did.
</P>
<P>
   To the pages being written about retirement, I add this one: To
grieve about leaving something you love is permissible, even good.
And I offer this advice to the colleagues of the soon-to-be
retired: On their last day, thank them for their professional
contributions and tell them they will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   My life, by the way, did not remain in that miasma. I now teach
a couple of seminar courses at the college, and I love it. I also
write for a newspaper and a magazine. The freedom and flexibility
of my new schedule are invigorating. I travel, serve on boards and
play a lot of golf. Life is good, something I would not have
believed possible on that last day.

 &HT;    All the right calls
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Roy Kramer often is described as the most
hands-on commissioner in the history of the Southeastern
Conference. A year ago, the kitchen staff at the Sandestin Hilton
found out why.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC awards dinner, held annually at this beach resort, runs
strictly on Kramer Time. The appetizer is served at 7 p.m. and the
last speech, which is his, is over at 9. Two hours and out the
door. No excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's dinner fell behind schedule because the entrees were
slow getting to the tables. Rather than complain to the head
waiter, Kramer, a 70-year-old grandfather of six, put down his
napkin and marched into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say he got them fired up,'' said Mark Womack, the
SEC's executive associate commissioner and Kramer's right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly motivated, the kitchen staff picked up the pace, and
Kramer Time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Others also have experienced the joy of Kramer's highly defined
sense of order.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jo, Kramer's wife of 48 years, remembers a night that was
just supposed to be a quiet dinner for two. Kramer spent a good
part of the evening helping the restaurant manager better organize
his salad bar.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the first year the SEC Basketball Tournament was held
in the Georgia Dome, Kramer wondered about the sight lines from the
upper deck. Rather than send one of his younger staff members,
Kramer climbed to the highest point of the Georgia Dome and checked
it out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just never believed that you sit around when something's
wrong and ask somebody else to fix it,'' Kramer said. ``If there's
a problem, you jump in and solve it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it has been since Jan. 10, 1990, when Kramer left his job
as Vanderbilt's athletics director to become the SEC's sixth
commissioner. Kramer has overseen the most dynamic period, both
competitively and financially, since the conference was founded in
1933.
</P>
<P>
   In the 57 years before Kramer's arrival, SEC teams won 47
national championships, including 16 in football or men's
basketball. Since 1990, the SEC has won 73 national titles in 20
sports.
</P>
<P>
   In Kramer's first year as commissioner, the 10 SEC schools
shared $16.3 million in revenue from televised football and
basketball. Last week, when the checks were handed out, the 12
schools shared $73.2 million. In Kramer's 10 years as commissioner,
SEC schools have divvied up more than $470 million.
</P>
<P>
   Financial success _ and the willingness to share revenue _ is
what keeps the SEC so competitively balanced in all sports. Kramer
has been the driving force behind both, conference members say.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a campus in a smaller market like ours, it is essential,''
said Larry Templeton, the athletics director at Mississippi State.
``We don't fund as many sports (11 women's, 9 men's) as other
conferences, but those we do have are funded to be nationally
competitive. For that, you have to give a lot of credit to the
commissioner's leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say that he was the right commissioner at exactly the
right time for the SEC,'' said Vince Dooley, the Georgia athletics
director.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD SENSE OF TIMING
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's sense of timing has served him well throughout his
career. After winning three state championships as a high school
coach in Michigan, he coached 11 at Central Michigan (1967-77),
winning 71.8 percent of his games and the 1974 Division II national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   He still considers himself a football coach, but in 1978, at the
age of 48, Kramer walked away from the profession to become the
athletics director at Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain other than to say that it was just
time,'' Kramer said. ``But my friends will tell you that I still
miss those 2 1/2 hours a day on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   The native of Maryville, Tenn., would have been happy at
Vanderbilt for the rest of his career. But late in 1989, when
Harvey Schiller resigned as the SEC Commissioner, Kramer knew it
was time to make another move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him a long time and my sense was this was a job he
really wanted,'' Womack said. ``He knew he could really make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer wasted no time. Less than five months after he took the
job, the SEC's presidents authorized Kramer to explore expansion.
In August 1990, Arkansas agreed to leave the Southwest Conference
and join the SEC. A month later, South Carolina became the 12th
member.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the year, the SEC announced that it would split into
divisions and play the first conference championship game in 1992.
Other conferences scoffed at the idea; then they copied it. Last
year's SEC championship game, the eighth, generated more than $7
million for the conference members.
</P>
<P>
   `PUTS THE CONFERENCE FIRST'
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes him so effective is that with the commissioner,
there is never any doubt that he is putting the good of the
conference first,'' said Jeremy Foley, the Florida athletics
director. ``You may disagree with his decisions, but you can't
disagree with his intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In putting the welfare of the entire SEC first, Kramer has
ruffled some feathers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1994, the SEC angered the other major conferences
when it left the national College Football Association television
package and struck its own deal with CBS. The other conferences
soon followed suit. Today, the SEC's television deals with CBS,
ESPN, and Jefferson-Pilot are set through the 2008-2009 academic
year and are worth more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Just 14 days after that decision, Kramer infuriated the city
fathers of Birmingham, where the SEC headquarters are located. When
Birmingham came up short on its guaranteed payment for hosting the
second SEC championship football game, Kramer moved the game to
Atlanta. Angering the folks in Birmingham was not the politically
smart thing to do, given the fact that the SEC rents its office
space from the city for $1 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Roy took the heat because he knew it was best for the
conference,'' Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   The game has flourished since coming to the Georgia Dome, always
selling out regardless of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after becoming commissioner, Kramer clashed with the
organization that assigned football officials for SEC games.
Officials were assigned based on skill level and the importance of
the game, so the biggest game usually got the six best officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer thought that practice short-changed the other schools and
wanted ta crew system, where the same set of officials would work
together each week. He also wanted the conference office to have
greater control of the officials. Kramer angered the officials, who
said he was heavy-handed in the process, but he won the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the commissioner is convinced he's right on something, he
is going to fight for his position,'' Womack said. ``At the
beginning of the fight, a lot of people may not agree with him. By
the time it's over, he has convinced them.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING CARE OF DETAILS
</P>
<P>
   One reason Kramer is able to persuade friend and foe alike to
follow his lead is that he does his homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Roy brings an idea to the table, you know he has .
. . studied it from every conceivable angle,'' Foley said. ``You
won't come up with a contigency that he hasn't thought of or
doesn't have a plan for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer does not delegate those details to his staff. When the
Bowl Championship Series (BCS) created a computer formula to pick
its top two teams, Kramer sat up night after night playing with
hundreds of combinations. He would settle on one and then challenge
his staff to find the weaknesses in it.
</P>
<P>
   Once Kramer found the formula he wanted, he sold it to the
conferences, the bowls. a skeptical media and an equally skeptical
public.
</P>
<P>
   His work ethic is legendary. After a full day, either in
Birmingham or on the road, he will break for dinner. From 11 p.m.
to 2 a.m., he reads the early editions of newspapers on-line and
will fire off memos to the staff if something needs to be handled
first thing in the morning. He gets about five hours of sleep and
then starts over at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   During football season, it is not unusual for him to fly to
three games on one day. During the first and second rounds of the
NCAA basketball tournament, he will make four stops in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Womack, Kramer's junior by 25 years, says it is tough to keep
up. ``If I just have half the energy he's got when I'm 70,'' he
said, ``I'll consider myself very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   HE'LL QUIT `WHEN THE TIME COMES'
</P>
<P>
   Kramer turned 70 the day before Halloween, and friends are
starting to ask how much longer he will keep up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' Kramer said. He makes about $300,000 per
year but said that he is working without a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working at the pleasure of our 12 presidents,'' he said.
``When the time comes, they'll know it or I'll know it. Then, one
day I'll just call in and tell them I'm not coming into work. There
won't be any kind of emotional farewell tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Kramer said, he still enjoys being ``the commish.''
Kramer's three children are grown, so Sara Jo can travel with him.
They met in high school and on their first date, Kramer gave her an
18-karat gold locket. She still wears it.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule should be a little slower this year. Kramer
recently turned over his job as chairman of the BCS to the ACC's
John Swofford. Last year, Kramer renegotiated the deal with ABC
television that will keep the series in place through the 2006
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this,'' Kramer said. ``I won't be around to
renegotiate that deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The television deals will keep the conference on sound financial
footing until 2009. Someone else will be responsible after that.
</P>
<P>
   Who will the next commissioner be? The early money is on Womack,
who has been on the SEC staff since graduating from Alabama in
1978. Under three commissioners, Womack worked his way to the No. 2
spot and has been instrumental in negotiating the SEC's television
and bowl deals. Several years ago, he turned down an opportunity to
return to Alabama as athletics director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' said Womack, when asked about his chances
of succeeding Kramer. ``The 12 presidents will make that decision.
But if the opportunity is there, of course I would be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kramer shows no signs of slowing down. In the recent
spring meetings, he announced a new scheduling format for SEC
football that will, in his opinion, provide a better inventory of
games for the fans and for television in any given year. The
coaches weren't crazy about the idea, but Kramer, as usual,
convinced them that it was best for the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you argue with the guy?'' Tennessee coach Phillip
Fulmer asked. ``By now, it's pretty clear he knows what he is
doing.''

USE OF COMMON INSECTICIDE TO BE CURBED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most common ingredients in home, lawn and garden bug
killers poses an unacceptable health risk, particularly to
children, and will no longer be manufactured for that use by the
end of the year, environmental officials said Thursday. The
insecticide, chlorpyrifos, has been widely used for more than 30
years in agriculture and in products used by exterminators and
homeowners, including some Raid sprays, Hartz yard and kennel flea
spray and Black Flag liquid roach and ant killer.
</P>
<P>
   Existing stocks of consumer products containing chlorpyrifos
will not be banned from store shelves until the end of 2001, Carol
M. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said Thursday. But she added that she would encourage
retail stores to voluntarily consider such a move.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA recently reassessed the chemical, also called Dursban,
and found that it can damage the brain in newborn rats and can
cause weakness, vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms in children.
Children and adults can be exposed when the chemical is applied in
a backyard or building and through residue on fruits or other
foods.
</P>
<P>
   After prolonged negotiations with six pesticide manufacturers _
the largest of which was Dow AgroSciences _ the EPA signed an
agreement with them Wednesday night that will allow continued uses
on many crops but sharply limit the use of chlorpyrifos on apples,
grapes and tomatoes and eliminate it entirely for almost all uses
around homes, schools, day-care centers and other places where
children might be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Dow officials on Thursday said that the chemical was safe when
properly used, but that changes in federal law made continued use
of the ingredient in household products impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed, but the safety of chlorpyrifos
hasn't,'' said Elin Miller, a vice president of Dow's AgroSciences
division.
</P>
<P>
   But Browner said the scientific evidence of unacceptable risk
was clear and justified the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is faster than any other action we have taken against a
pesticide, literally in the history of the EPA,'' Browner said
Thursday at a Washington news conference.
</P>
<P>
   After television reports Thursday about the environmental
agency's decision, some large retail stores received a surge of
customer inquiries on non-chlorpyrifos pesticides. John Simley, a
spokesman for the Home Depot chain, said the company planned to
place signs in its stores identifying alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart will stop selling products with chlorpyrifos at the end
of October, or 14 months ahead of the timetable the EPA is
demanding, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, Rob Phillips, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said consumers concerned about whether products
now in the home contained the chemical should look at the label,
where, if so, the list of active ingredients will include either
``chlorpyrifos'' or ``Dursban.'' But they stressed that the
agency's decision reflected no need to pull the product from store
shelves or homes immediately, simply to phase it out in an orderly
way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of products containing chlorpyrifos listed
through the EPA's Web site (www.epa.gov) are Black Flag Liquid
Roach and Ant Killer, Black Flag Roach Control System, Ortho Home
Pest Insect Control, Ortho Lawn Insect Spray, Scotts Proturf Insect
Control Plus Fertilizer, Sergeant's Fast-Acting Flea &AMP; Tick Collar
for Dogs, Sergeant's Flea + Tick Collar, Hartz 330 Day Flea &AMP; Tick
Collar for Dogs, Raid Ant Controller, Raid Home Insect Killer
Formula II, Raid Liquid Roach &AMP; Ant Killer Formula I and Raid Max
Roach Bait III.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Goldberg, a spokesman for Consumer's Union, a private group
that publishes Consumer Reports and tests product safety, said that
the EPA's conclusions should not cause panic, but should prompt
people to consider disposing of products containing the chemical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would encourage consumers to find safer alternatives now,''
he said. He said that homeowners should call their local public
works or health departments to find out how to dispose of
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to avoid an infestation of ants or
cockroaches or other indoor pests, he said, is to clean up.
``Plugging cracks, leaving no standing water, clearing dishes out
of the sink _ if you take care of these other things then you
probably don't have to spray,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions on chlorpyrifos (pronounced
klor-PYE-ruh-fahs) grew out of a broad review of organophosphate
pesticides, a group related to nerve gas that includes
chlorpyrifos. The review was required under the 1996 Food Quality
Protection Act and calls for a much stricter appraisal of risks,
focusing on potential harm to children, whose small bodies and
fast-growing brains are particularly vulnerable to toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said that the organophosphates, many of which were
invented decades ago, are antiquated weapons for which safer
alternatives exist. ``Organophosphates are a World War II class of
chemicals,'' she said. ``We can do better today. There are too many
incidents in my experience of children becoming ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the chemical review, restrictions were placed on some
other organophosphate pesticides last summer. The decision on
chlorpyrifos has received intense attention from consumer groups
because it is so widely used.
</P>
<P>
   Simley, the Home Depot spokesman, said that most of the
poisonings and other cases of human exposure identified by the EPA
came through improper use of products with chlorpyrifos. ``Their
main concern is that people rarely read the instructions,'' he
said. ``Given that, we are redoubling our efforts to make sure
people understand how to use the products they buy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end residential use of the chemical is not
likely to have a substantial impact on the $5-billion-a-year
exterminating business, industry representatives said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many exterminators have already shifted toward using
custom-tailored chemicals, baits and techniques that kill a
targeted pest without broader effects on wildlife or people.
``We've basically been supportive of the science behind Dursban,
but it's certainly not the only tool out there any more,'' said
Steven Kramer, a spokesman for the National Pest Management
Association, which represents 5,000 pest control businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, pest-control businesses would probably
benefit from the EPA's move as consumers find their insecticide
choices at the hardware store shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Legal and environmental experts said it was unclear whether the
move to eliminate household uses of chlorpyrifos would prompt a
flood of lawsuits from people who feel they have been harmed by the
chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Dow and some pest-control companies have been sued sporadically
over the years by people claiming adverse effects from exposure to
the chemical. Several cases ended in settlements in which the
chemical and the company were not found culpable.

<P>
   In its eagerness to persuade Russia to accept deployment of a
U.S. missile defense, the Clinton administration has all but
ignored China, a nuclear power in its own right and an opponent of
these systems.
</P>
<P>
   China currently fields about 20 nuclear-armed missiles capable
of striking the continental United States. For decades, it has
relied on this small force not only to deter a nuclear attack, but
also to guarantee it a place at the table with the other great
powers and to offset their conventional weaponry. In a conflict,
even the limited, 100-interceptor missile defense being pursued by
the Clinton administration would be able to counter China's entire
strategic nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   To many critics of the Communists in Beijing, this sounds like
an excellent idea. But China could not be expected to sit idly by.
Its intentions have never been easy to read, but one point comes
through in its foreign policy statements: China must never again be
subjected to the humiliation that stronger powers inflicted on it
in the past. Nuclear weapons are its protection against such
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike North Korea and the other rogue states that would be the
primary focus of an American missile defense, China is capable of
compensating by arming its missiles with multiple warheads and
adding sophisticated countermeasures to confuse our defensive
system.
</P>
<P>
   True, China will modernize its nuclear arms to some degree no
matter what we do; the missiles it has now are antiquated and
impossible to launch quickly. But modernization is different from
expansion. An American missile defense would encourage China to
develop a larger, more flexible nuclear force and to put that force
on alert.
</P>
<P>
   China is currently debating what role nuclear weapons should
play in its security policy: the size and structure of its force
and the principles that should govern its use. Neither the
administration nor the Republicans seem concerned about how our
actions on missile defense might influence that debate.
</P>
<P>
   But as the presidential race heats up and the administration
moves toward a deployment decision, missile defense proponents must
explain why obviating a potential threat from a handful of
third-rate states is worth increasing the certain threat from an
established nuclear power.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision to
throw the book at Microsoft was not unexpected: his formal
``findings of law'' issued earlier made very clear that he viewed
the company's alleged transgressions in the harshest light.
Nonetheless, it was still a jolt to see the decision _ dividing
Microsoft into an operating systems company and an applications
company _ written in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up an enterprise that was not itself the product of a
merger is unprecedented in antitrust law. And ordering the
dissolution of the flagship firm of the software industry without
hearings on the implications approaches the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written recently about the glorious history of big
antitrust divestitures, with Standard Oil and AT&AMP;T as case studies.
But neither example goes to the point. Standard Oil was a loose
trust of some 30 oil companies, assembled with the goal of reducing
competition. The court simply ordered that the trust be taken apart
the way it had been put together.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, AT&AMP;T was a government-sanctioned monopoly with
semi-autonomous local companies and other divisions, like a
manufacturing arm, for which there was no justification for
government regulation. Dividing the company into regulated local
phone companies and an unregulated company to do everything else is
more like deregulation than the breakup of a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And for the record, a court did not force the divestiture: it
was the product of a mid-trial settlement in 1982, in which the
Justice Department granted the deregulated AT&AMP;T long-distance
company the right to go into the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson dismissed Microsoft's request for weeks (or even days)
of hearings on the proposed breakup, stating that ``the court has
found testimonial predictions of future events generally less
reliable even than testimony as to historical fact.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know what to make of a judge's rejection of expert
comment. Witnesses from the two sides would no doubt be at odds,
but the judge's unwillingness to assemble a record for both his own
information and that of appellate courts is jaw-dropping.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure, for example, how the copyrights to code
now used by both Windows and other Microsoft software would be
divided between the new operating system company and the
applications company. No one knows how the heavily regulated
Windows company could keep important employees, who would have the
option to jump to the virtually unregulated Microsoft software
applications company.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether (or how much) the independent Windows
company would raise the price of the operating system, once it no
longer had an interest in increasing sales of Office and other
profitable Microsoft applications. Perhaps most troubling, no one
knows how the breakup would affect investment in software. It is
far from clear, for example, that the owners of the regulated
Windows company would be willing to pay the billion-dollar bill for
the next version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, like everyone else associated with this case, was no
doubt impatient to rid himself of arcane talk of ``middleware'' and
``porting'' and ``elasticities of demand.'' The sad paradox here is
that if he gets his way on the remedy, he will likely be forced to
tie together a million loose ends created by this sweeping, but
casually constructed, divestiture plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the AT&AMP;T case, U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene spent
more than a decade regulating the remnants of the national phone
company. And in that case, you will remember, the division was
voluntary.

TRANSFER OF GENERAL AT SITE OF ANTI-GAY KILLING IS PROTESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army's decision to reassign the commander of
Fort Campbell, Ky., where a gay soldier was beaten to death last
year, is provoking criticism from members of Congress and
gay-rights advocates who complain that an investigation of anti-gay
harassment under his command has not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who steps down on Friday
as commander of Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne Division, was
appointed early this week to be vice director of operations for the
joint chiefs of staff at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer, which does not include a promotion in rank but
does put Clark in a position of prominence, came before the Army's
inspector general completed an investigation into whether officers
at Fort Campbell tolerated or overlooked anti-gay slurs and
taunting in the months leading up to the killing last July of Pfc.
Barry Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Clark's new assignment was announced, 30 members of
the House wrote to Secretary of Defense William Cohen urging that
he hold the general responsible for what appears to have been a
highly charged environment at Fort Campbell in the months leading
up to Winchell's death.
</P>
<P>
   The members _ most but not all of them Democrats, including the
minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt _ also criticized the decision
to move ahead with Clark's reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relocating and promoting Major General Clark prior to the
completion of this investigation would be wrong and undermine the
department's professed commitment to enforce the
gays-in-the-military policy in a fair and legal manner,'' they
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Army announced the investigation in January, saying it was
requested by Clark himself, but the deadline for completing it has
been pushed back to the beginning of July from May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials declined to discuss the reasons behind the delay.
One official said that while the inspector general's investigation
was not complete, nothing had emerged to implicate Clark in
wrongdoing or leadership failings.
</P>
<P>
   Clark did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokeswoman
said he would address the issue at his change-of-command ceremony
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki,
said Clark's command at Fort Campbell had been ``distinguished by
great competence and compassionate leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army has placed its trust and confidence in Major General
Clark,'' Shinseki said, ``and I am confident he will continue to
excel in service to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's death has become a rallying cry for critics of the
Pentagon's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gay men
and lesbians to serve in the military so long as they do not
disclose their orientation or engage in homosexual sex.
</P>
<P>
   Another private, Calvin Glover, was convicted and sentenced to
life in prison for killing Winchell with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   In Glover's court-martial, soldiers testified that Winchell had
repeatedly been taunted with anti-gay slurs and that superiors did
nothing to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   The killing prompted Cohen to order a survey of attitudes about
gays in the military, which found that disparaging and even hostile
feelings toward gay men and lesbians were commonplace and often
tolerated by superiors.
</P>
<P>
   C. Dixon Osborne, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, an organization in Washington that provides legal
aid to gay men and lesbians in the military, said Clark's
reassignment suggested that the Army did not intend to hold him
accountable for the actions of troops under his command.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that they do a full and fair investigation,''
Osborne said, ``and not try to suggest that anti-gay harassment was
simply isolated to Pfc. Winchell's unit.''

MILITARY EXPERTS CITE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM

<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing the Pentagon's own plan, critics of the proposed
anti-missile defense and even some military experts say all flight
tests of the Clinton administration's proposed $60 billion weapon
have been rigged to hide a fundamental flaw: The system cannot
distinguish between enemy warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, they said that after the system failed to achieve
this crucial discrimination goal against mock targets in its first
two flight tests, the Pentagon substituted simpler and fewer decoys
that would be easier for the anti-missile weapon to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's plan was obtained by Theodore A. Postol, an arms
expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who opposes the
weapon. It covers the four tests that have taken place as well as
future tests up to the system's projected deployment in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Other technical experts who have seen it, including both
anti-missile and decoy designers, concurred with his criticism, as
did a senior government official who has examined the Pentagon's
testing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me,'' the official said, ``that none of the
tests address the reasonable range of countermeasures'' or decoys
an enemy would use to try to outwit an anti-missile weapon.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the plan was authentic, Pentagon officials
strongly defended the testing program. Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish of
the Air Force, director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, denied that his program had engaged in any deception
or dumbing down. Kadish said the testing program would be extremely
useful and the resulting defensive weapon would defeat crude
warheads launched by inexperienced nuclear powers that might emerge
in the future, like Iran, Iraq or North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Though unclassified, the plan is considered sensitive. Postol
said he obtained it from a Defense Department source he would not
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, who is preparing a report for the White House on what he
sees as the plan's flaws, made his argument Monday at a meeting of
the State Department's advisory board on arms control, along with
another anti-missile critic, Nira Schwartz. A former senior
engineer at the defense contractor TRW, Schwartz lost her job after
after challenging the claims the company was making for the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, who worked in the Reagan administration on issues like
anti-missile defense, says the Pentagon has ignored earlier
criticism like Schwartz's and instead put flawed testing methods at
the heart of all its plans to develop and build a working weapon.
The upshot, he says, is that any real attacker _ no matter how
inexperienced _ would be able to easily outwit the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials ``are systematically lying about the
performance of a weapon system that is supposed to defend the
people of the United States from nuclear attack,'' Postol said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish conceded that ``this technology is difficult.'' As a
result, he said, his organization's approach ``is to walk before we
run, with increasingly stressful decoys to match what we expect''
by way of enemy threats. ``When we get to that end point, we'll
have the confidence to put this on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from increasing the complexity of future tests, the
Pentagon has made them easier, military experts who examined the
testing plan agreed. Two rigorous flyby experiments in 1997 and
1998, to have the weapon simply observe the targets, they said,
have been followed by interception tests designed to make
discriminating between decoys and mock warheads as easy as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good fox trot for the first couple of tests and
then slowed down to a crawl,'' said Bob Dietz, a retired former
designer of warhead decoys for American missiles. ``You have to ask
why they don't build better decoys. They've always said they'd get
better with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Munn, a retired scientist for the defense contractor
Lockheed and a pioneer in designing and testing anti-missile
weapons, said, ``The only way to make it work is to dumb it down.
There's no other way to do it. Discrimination has always been the
No. 1 problem, and it will always remain that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said manipulation of anti-missile flight tests was nothing
new. ``It's always been a wicked game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon itself is sharply divided on the testing issue. In
February, Philip E. Coyle 3rd, the Defense Department's director of
testing and evaluation, faulted the anti-missile tests as
insufficiently realistic to make decisions about moving from
research to actually building the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 interception test flights called for in the development
program would cost at least $1.6 billion, Pentagon experts say. So
far, the two observation tests have been followed by two
interception attempts, the first successful, the second a failure.
The next test is scheduled for early July.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to decide this year whether to
start building a defensive system based on such interception
technology, which is to shield the United States from limited
missile attacks by so-called rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Postol, a professor of science and national security studies at
MIT and the author of many private and federal weapon reports, was
a top Navy science adviser in the Reagan administration and for
decades has studied the issue of enemy countermeasures to
anti-missile weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 Gulf War, he challenged the Army's claims of
success for its Patriot anti-missile system, saying it had, in
fact, destroyed no Iraqi missiles at all. Though the Pentagon at
first denied his assertions, it later conceded that initial reports
of the Patriot success had been exaggerated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The current scientific fray centers on the interceptor's
120-pound homing device, known as a ``kill vehicle.'' Fired on a
rocket, it is designed to use a telescopic sensor, a computer and
jet thrusters to steer itself through space toward a warhead,
destroying it by force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   Postol's critique involves its hardest job, distinguishing
between actual enemy warheads and the cloud of decoys considered
sure to be launched to disguise them. If unable to tell decoys from
warheads, a defender would be forced to fire interceptors at every
threatening object, quickly exhausting a defensive force.
</P>
<P>
   Postol began digging into the first anti-missile flight test, in
June 1997, after reviewing Pentagon data gathered by Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   The sensors at issue are cooled to more than 300 degrees below
zero and work in the icy void of space to track faint heat
emissions from warm targets, just as ordinary telescopes track
light. They see mock warheads and decoys as twinkling points of
light, like stars.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1997 flight test, Postol charged, showed that the
infrared twinkles were random and insufficiently different from one
another to let the interceptor distinguish among them, and that the
Pentagon had conspired to hide this surprising discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, he said, has altered future tests to heighten
artificially any possible differences that could be detected
between mock warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   His accusation is based mainly on a detailed chart from the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization that gives an
overview of its program for Integrated Flight Tests of the kill
vehicle. Entitled ``IFT Targets Selections,'' the chart is dated
May 5, 2000, and at the top is labeled ``For Planning Purposes.''
The chart's bottom warns, ``Configuration controlled by NMD JPO,''
or the National Missile Defense Joint Program Office. ``Do not
alter this document.''
</P>
<P>
   The chart starts with the June 1997 test, lists another sensor
flyby and then goes through the 16 intercept tests scheduled for
the kill vehicle's entire development. The last flight is listed as
June 2004, right before the anti-missile weapon is to begin
operating in 2005. In each case, the chart spells out the exact
type and number of test decoys and warheads and depicts them in
small pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Postol said the chart showed how the initial suite of
challenging decoys, the ones that twinkled a lot, making them hard
to distinguish from a warhead, had been replaced by fewer and
simpler decoys that twinkled as little as possible, accentuating
their differences from mock warheads that fluctuate a lot in
infrared intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Long and conelike, pointy at one end, flat at the other, the
warheads can wobble and shift in complex ways while moving through
space, presenting differing heat emissions to a distant sensor. By
contrast, the spherical decoy balloons have more uniform
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   The removed decoys, Postol said in his report, all had infrared
signatures similar to the warheads. Abandoned were spherical
balloons whose stripes made their infrared emissions fluctuate,
rigid decoys that looked like mock warheads and balloons that
inflated to conelike shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decoys,'' he wrote, ``have brightness and time-dependent
oscillating signals that can be quite similar to the signals from
either warheads that are spinning around their axis of symmetry, or
tumbling end over end.''
</P>
<P>
   The only retained decoys, he said, were spherical, uniform in
materials and substantially brighter or dimmer than mock warheads.
Their signatures, he said, ``will have very uniform and controlled
intensities.''
</P>
<P>
   All the program's interception tests, Postol said in the draft
report to the White House, ``have been carefully orchestrated to
avoid encountering the discrimination problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said he hoped to get the report, a draft of
which runs to 20 pages, to the White House next week.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, while acknowledging the planning chart as legitimate, if
tentative, strongly denied that the testing program was structured
to become increasingly easy. To the contrary, he said, the decoys
were selected to make the evolving tests increasingly hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complexity is increasing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a smooth balloon could be more difficult to track than
a rigid decoy shaped to look like a warhead, he replied, ``That's a
valid technical argument'' but added that just because a decoy
seemed effective ``doesn't mean it's credible.''
</P>
<P>
   The test program, he said, was structured to make the weapon
flexible and robust. Testing it against decoy shapes that were too
specific might allow an enemy to fool the weapon by changing them
``a little bit,'' Kadish said. ``What we're after is a basic
physics approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Pentagon officials said they lessened the complexity
of some anti-missile testing when the government cut the program's
goal from trying to knock out advanced warheads from countries like
Russia and China to more primitive ones from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force, an anti-missile
spokesman, said the current testing diagram depicted provisional
goals rather than a hard-and-fast plan. The only decoy
configuration set in concrete, he added, was the next test flight,
which has been delayed repeatedly and is now scheduled for the
first week of July.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Postol belittled the Pentagon's retorts, saying
officials there were misrepresenting the program's logic. ``They've
been caught in one outright lie after another,'' he said.

 &HT;    Trump hopes to cut a deal on landscaping
 &HT;    By Trebor Banstetter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Donald Trump is hoping his deal-making
prowess can get him out of county rules forcing him to landscape a
section of Congress Avenue fronting his new $40 million golf club.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the projected $300,000 price tag is too rich for
Trump's blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much higher than the $6,000 we had originally planned,''
said land planner Bob Bentz, who is representing Trump. ``That's
why we're working to come up with some alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of delays, county commissioners are scheduled to
vote on Trump's appeal June 29. Trump's representatives have been
lobbying the county _ particularly Commissioner Carol Roberts _
since September to bend the rules for him.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity developer argues that the county's new law, which
requires builders to landscape medians on roads adjacent to their
developments, was unfairly applied to his suburban West Palm Beach
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Trump began building his lavish Trump International Golf Club
long before the landscaping rules were passed. But in September the
new law came into effect for him because he made changes to the
design of the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The changes affected just more than 1 acre of the property,
enough to trigger the median rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very minor changes,'' acknowledged Haney Frakes, the
assistant county engineer. ``It was just over the threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Trump must install landscaping along the medians
of Congress Avenue from Summit Boulevard to Gun Club Road.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the state Department of Transportation has
just built concrete traffic separators along the road.
</P>
<P>
   To tear those out, plant grass and bushes and install an
underground irrigation system would cost between $250,000 and
$300,000, Bentz said.
</P>
<P>
   The county's zoning commission, an advisory board, said in
September that Trump should follow the rules and make the
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   His hearing before county commissioners, who make the final
decision, has been delayed for months.
</P>
<P>
   But when he does finally go before commissioners, a deferral
from the law may be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules should be equally applied to anybody who modifies or
improves their development,'' said Commissioner Warren Newell. ``We
can't just go making exceptions for one guy, no matter who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump plans to offer commissioners an alternative: Landscaping
the median along a shorter, more northern stretch of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bentz didn't have a price tag for Trump's alternative, but said
it ``would certainly be cheaper'' than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to provide (the county) with the details next week
and have it before commissioners later this month,'' Bentz said.
``We think this is a fair way to work this out.''

PANAMA STILL FAILS TO STEM NARCOTICS TRAFFIC, U.S. REPORT ASSERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Panamanian government has made little progress this
year in its fight against drug trafficking and money laundering,
according to a U.S. Customs intelligence report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is expected to be discussed at a congressional
hearing on Friday, said Panama continued to be a major
transshipment point for cocaine and increasingly for heroin, which
are smuggled through weakly patrolled borders and ports. The
reported noted that in 1999 drug seizures declined 80 percent from
1998 and no major drug arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary version of the report, which was provided to a
House subcommittee on criminal justice and drug policy, originally
had harsh words for Panama's law enforcement agencies, saying they
were ``corrupt and ill trained'' and ``overwhelmed'' by drug
traffickers. The final version softened that criticism, saying they
faced ``difficulties dealing with sophisticated trafficking
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Panama's sprawling Colon Free Trade Zone
was used by traffickers not only to hide drugs in cargo containers
but also to launder profits. It cited serious security problems at
Tocumen International Airport, where there have been allegations
that cargo and ramp workers are helping to move drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials would not comment on the report, which they
said was classified.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the report's observations are sure to be used by
congressional critics and others who have expressed grave concerns
about Panama's inability to secure its border with Colombia less
than six months after the United States withdrew all its troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Panama has taken a dramatic turn for the
worse,'' said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who is the subcommittee
chairman. ``The information we have is pretty damaging, especially
since the United States exited six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With increased unrest and violence in Colombia, more traffickers
have been seeking a safe haven in Panama. At the same time, the
country's lax banking laws and dollar economy have proved as much
of a lure to them as the high-rise buildings they have settled
into.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about drugs,'' a diplomat said. ``The country is
built on dodging taxes, dodging bizarre exchange rates and evading
court settlements.'' He added, ``The narcos have grafted right
on.'' As a result, the diplomat said, efforts to crack down on
money laundering have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem has been that the government of President
Mireya Moscoso assumed power only last September and is still
feeling its way. Some critics have faulted her for not having
enough of a vision for the country's future and say that she has
been more preoccupied with petty politics and deciding which
supporters get which government posts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, her government has been ambivalent about what
kind of relationship it wants with the United States after nearly a
century of American influence on Panamanian affairs. It is also
about to sign a long-awaited national security plan that will, for
the first time, outline its strategy for securing its borders and
the canal.  &QL;

THE PARIS MATCH: PIERCE TO PLAY MARTINEZ IN FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In reality, only a few minutes separated Thursday's
women's semifinals, yet it felt more like decades.
</P>
<P>
   After Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario had offered
topspin loops, languid slices and afterthought serves of
yesteryear, Mary Pierce and Martina Hingis hit the fast-forward
button as they bashed the two-handed backhands and bold returns of
today and tomorrow at each other.
</P>
<P>
   But these two matches, so disparate in form and suspense, did
share one significant characteristic: the favorite lost in both.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario lost first, falling prey to her own
inconsistency and to Martinez's hypnotic, anachronistic rhythm
shifts by the score of 6-1, 6-2. Even more surprisingly, the
top-seeded Hingis lost next, saving a match point before winning
the second set but proving unable to match Pierce's big-swinging
baseline tempo, public support or confidence down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, the Canadian-born American resident who represents
France, began to cramp in her left calf midway through the final
set but managed to close out a 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 victory. Both the
sixth-seeded Pierce and the fifth-seeded Martinez had lost seven
times in a row to their semifinal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after enlisting her brother David as coach, Pierce
succeeded in putting an end to her run of bad form and fortune at
Roland Garros in recent years. Hingis' streak is still very much
alive.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time junior champion here who grew up playing on clay,
Hingis has won all of the Grand Slam singles titles except the
French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many other players who have never won this
tournament,'' Hingis said. ``I mean, I have a lot of years in front
of me. As you see, Pierce and Martinez never won this tournament.
One of them is going to win. One is 25 and the other 28. I have
nothing to worry about right now.''

   In 1997, not at her fittest after a riding injury, Hingis was
upset in the final by Iva Majoli, who has beaten few people since.
In last year's final against Steffi Graf, Hingis lost her composure
and the public's sympathy after crossing to Graf's side of the net
to question a line call. After that match, she sobbed on French
player Nathalie Tauziat's shoulder: saying, according to Tauziat,
that she believed she would never win here.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she played well below her best, making 44 unforced
errors against Pierce, who had beaten Hingis in their only previous
clay-court match in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary was just focused,'' Hingis said. ``Definitely that was
the best she played me in a long time. But on a hard court, it's a
different game. She's got more time on clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, a French Open finalist in 1994 who has struggled here
since and has been booed regularly for it, happens to be Hingis'
friend and doubles partner, and they reached the semifinals
together on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that Martina thinks very well on the court, and I
think in watching her play singles over the years I think I learned
a lot from her,'' Pierce said. ``I think I've learned a lot from
playing doubles with her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether she will be able to play doubles on
Friday or have enough time to recover and play her best in
Saturday's singles final. While leading by 4-2 and 15-15 on her
serve in the final set, Pierce leaped and hit a cross-court
backhand winner (her best weapon all day) and started limping after
she landed. Before serving the next point, she stretched her calf
but still managed to chase down a Hingis drop shot in the next
exchange and hold her serve. Still stretching between points, she
then broke Hingis for the ninth time to win the match.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after leaving the court, Pierce said she began cramping
severely in her legs and had to spend more than an hour stretching,
drinking fluids and receiving fluid intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would be able to play on Saturday, Pierce answered:
``I've never had cramps before; I don't know how I'm going to feel
tomorrow. I think I've done everything possible I could this
evening to help myself recover the best possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Martinez will be waiting. Long one of the world's best
clay-court players, she is now in her first French Open final. With
her mind on her father's struggle with cancer and her motivation
waning, she dropped out of the top 20 a year ago. But with the help
of Patricia Tarabini, her Argentine coach and doubles partner, and
a Spanish sports psychologist, Guillermo Perez, Martinez has
rebuilt her fitness and ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been working with Patricia, I've decided to play
tennis with a smile on my face, which was hard the past years,''
said Martinez, never the most diligent in practice or most joyful
on court.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she beat Hingis on clay en route to the title in
Berlin and by then she was already having a recurring dream about
winning in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of faith in dreams, and I have never dreamed this
until this year, but I have been dreaming it now for the last month
or month and a half,'' she said. &QL;

<P>
   What would the Federal Reserve do if American inflation was
running about 2 percent a year and the unemployment rate was 9.6
percent? Would Alan Greenspan have the nerve to raise rates by half
a percentage point?
</P>
<P>
   If that idea sounds crazy to you, then you are not in touch with
reality, European style. For that is exactly what happened Thursday
to Germans, for whom the above statistics apply. The European
Central Bank, eager to prove its credibility as an
inflation-fighter, decided to confound forecasters and impose a
half-point interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, an unemployment rate that high would have long
since become the major national economic issue _ the actual U.S.
rate is now 4.1 percent _ and politicians would be screaming for
easier monetary policy. It would take an inflation rate far higher
than 2 percent to convince anyone that tightening credit was a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   But in Europe, things are different. Wim Duisenberg, the central
bank's president, explained that they were worried about inflation
that can be traced in part to high oil prices and a weak euro, and
that the European economy was growing at around 3 percent anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing about Europe now is that it seems to have accepted
high unemployment as a virtually permanent thing. Europe's
unemployment is coming down, but the latest reported rate for the
countries in the euro currency zone is 9.2 percent. The
conventional wisdom is that unemployment is high because of
structural problems such as high wages and laws making it difficult
for employers to hire and fire at will, and that a stimulative
monetary policy would only revive inflation without doing much for
growth. Anyway, the European Central Bank is supposed to keep
inflation from going above 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Solow, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has
suggested that idea is simply wrong. ``European central banks kept
the squeeze on for a long time'' when they fought the inflation of
the 1970s, he wrote a few years ago. ``Suppose,'' he added, ``there
is a tendency for prolonged `cyclical' unemployment to turn into
something that looks like `structural' unemployment. It is not hard
to imagine how that might plausibly happen as the unemployed adapt
to the unavailability of jobs.'' Eventually, he said, central banks
wrongly convinced themselves that high unemployment was there to
stay and the banks could not ``afford to expand aggregate demand''
by loosening monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   It is perfectly true that Europe needs structural reform, but as
Solow noted, ``it would be bad news indeed if this apparently
structural unemployment really would not yield to the revival of
demand for goods and labor.'' He suggested that history indicated
it would. The European Central Bank should find out if he is right.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there was been good reason to think the
economy was overheating, and the Fed has been right to tighten. But
the Fed's action makes it all the more regrettable that the
Europeans seem scared of growth. ``From the world's perspective, a
surprising strength coming out of Europe gives us the best chance
to survive a necessary sharp slowing in the United States,'' said
Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has been weak because investors have viewed the rapidly
growing United States as a much more attractive place to put money.
The euro is cheap, and will recover eventually. But efforts to slow
European growth are not going to help the beleaguered currency.

BRITISH MILITARY ATTACHE IS ASSASSINATED IN ATHENS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Britain's senior defense official in Greece was
gunned down here on Thursday, just days after a special report
prepared for Congress recommended sanctions against Greece,
describing it as ``disturbingly passive in response to terrorist
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Greek police officials said that two gunmen they identified as
members of ``November 17,'' a left-wing terrorist group, shot
several times at Brig. Stephen Saunders, 53, the military attache
at the British Embassy in Athens. The police said the gunmen shot
from a motorcycle as he was driving alone through a busy suburban
street at 8 a.m., and they escaped through the traffic. Saunders
died at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first British official assassinated in an attack
blamed on November 17, but the killing was the 23rd attributed to
the guerrilla organization that emerged in 1975 with the slaying of
Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens. Welch was the first
of four American officials killed by the group.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 25 years, no member of November 17 has been
arrested, driving the State Department to identify Greece in a
report issued in April as ``one of the weakest links in Europe's
effort against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing on Thursday revived one of the most sensitive
disputes between Athens and its allies. Greece is a member of NATO,
and the Socialist government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis won
Western gratitude by not obstructing the alliance's bombing of
Yugoslavia last year, despite overwhelming domestic opposition. But
U.S. officials have long complained that the Greek government,
which has been ruled by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, known
as Pasok, for nearly 20 years, has shown no signs of seriously
trying to root out November 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights again that Greece needs to take a tougher
stance against terrorism,'' Kenneth H. Bacon, the Defense
Department spokesman, said on Thursday. The Clinton
administration's views on the terrorist threat in Greece are
repeated ``every time we visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, echoed the
allegation that Greece has been lax about November 17. ``I've long
been distressed by the failure of the Greek government to deal with
this group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Privately, U.S. officials have speculated that the Greek
government has not cracked down on November 17 because it fears
that an investigation could disclose that some Pasok members had
past ties to members of the terrorist group. And in an interview
with a weekly Greek newspaper, Pontiki, published on Thursday, R.
James Woolsey Jr., a former CIA director and a member of a
commission on terrorism that recommended sanctions against Greece
and Pakistan, was quoted as saying: ``I believe there are people
within the Greek government who know some members of November 17.
They are doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that reflected British determination to press the
Greek government, Foreign Minister Robin Cook said, ``I am in touch
with the Greek authorities and am offering them our full
cooperation in making sure that whoever perpetrated this brutal
attack is brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations that Greece has dragged its feet on terrorism are
often dismissed as unfair by Greek officials and much of the Greek
news media, reflecting the country's sensitivity to what it views
as American interference. After the the terrorism commission's
report, which said Greece was ``not cooperating fully'' on
antiterrorism, was released on Monday, Dimitris Reppas, a
government spokesman, said, ``The report's content bears no
relation to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ruled out sanctions, but said it was
pressing Greece for more cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Greek officials expressed outrage and grief over
Saunders' killing, but played down any notion that terrorist
attacks were more prevalent in Greece than elsewhere. Prime
Minister Simitis assured his British counterpart, Tony Blair, ``We
will not spare any effort in apprehending those responsible and
bringing them to justice, and we are determined to actively
continue our difficult struggle against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement tailored for Greek listeners, he took a
slightly different tone, saying: ``This terrorist act is contrary
to the fundamental law of respect for human life. And it takes
place at a time when Greece is charting a period of success, with
increased international prestige.'' Simitis, who was narrowly
re-elected last April, added, ``The Greek government will do its
duty and will safeguard with all means the country's stable course
and the security of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the killing, but the
police said shells found at the site came from a .45-caliber
pistol, the type of weapon used by November 17 in other attacks.
The site and the method of the killing were almost identical to two
other slayings attributed to the group.
</P>
<P>
   November 17 took its name from the date on which the United
States-supported military junta sent tanks to crush a student
protest at Athens Polytechnic University in 1973, killing dozens of
demonstrators. The Marxist-leaning group has remained anti-American
and anticapitalist, and has acquired a harsh nationalist tone. It
has has taken responsibility for hundreds of violent acts,
including the slayings of a dozen prominent Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, members fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the
German Embassy last May, narrowly missing the ambassador.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have never been wide demands from average Greeks for major
antiterrorist sweeps. Most Greeks feel untouched by November 17
violence because it has been largely limited to foreigners and
prominent people. Some of November 17's anti-American ideology is
widely shared in Greece, a country that still resents American
support of the junta from 1967 to 1974, and whose populace bitterly
opposed the British, French and American bombing of Serbia, a
neighbor that shares Greece's Orthodox faith.
</P>
<P>
   Yannis Fokas, 31, a parking attendant, said he was not surprised
to hear of another terrorist attack. But he was baffled by the
gunmen's choice. ``Why a Brit?'' he asked. ``I was expecting them
to attack an American after all this anti-Greek talk and reports
that have been coming out of Washington lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed perplexed by the international outrage. ``I'm
surprised the British have not become immune to Greek terrorism as
we have,'' said Irene Kafandaraki, 24. ``It's just an other
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Greeks, however, expressed criticism of their own
government. ``After 25 years, the Greek police is powerless to deal
with such a phenomenon,'' said Dora Bakoyannis, a leader of the
center-right New Democracy opposition party, whose husband was shot
dead in 1989 in an attack attributed to November 17. ``If we don't
at some stage realize that terrorism has to be tackled, we will
continue to be the only country which finds itself in this
situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stelios Papathemelis, a senior member of the Pasok party and a
former minister of public order, was critical of his own political
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greece must show stronger political will,'' he said on
Thursday. ``What is needed is a consistent and continuous policy
against terrorism, which Greece lacks.''

RICH PEOPLE NEED HELP DEALING WITH SWS (SUDDEN WEALTH SYNDROME) 
</HEADLINE>
 T  (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What Lorna Hudson has against the rich is
unclear, but when they come into the Ford showroom she manages, she
goes right ahead and sells them new cars, never pausing for a
second to consider the emotional damage she may thereby inflict.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Hudson said she was unaware that some of her newly
fabulously rich clients might be racked with the pain and
uncertainty of SWS, or Sudden Wealth Syndrome, a condition labeled
by two local psychologists. They treat freshly minted Internet
millionaires who, shortly after getting rich, go out and buy new
cars, houses, gadgets, clothes, art, cosmetic surgery and other
indulgences, only to feel a burning emptiness after they realize
that there's more to life than work, money and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On the mean streets of Silicon Valley, this does not exactly
elicit sympathy, especially from people whose own dreams of instant
wealth cratered with the Nasdaq. But it does elicit laughter,
followed by some virulent cases of SWRORNS _ Suddenly Wanting to
Run Over the Rich in Their New Saabs.
</P>
<P>
   Being a journalist, and therefore steeped in the art of quelling
controversy, I gently tried bridging the chasm between SWS
sufferers and skeptics like Hudson, who is the new-vehicle
operations manager at Serramonte Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``You're an enabler!''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``I don't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Me: ``Tell an SWS sufferer: `Step away from the sport utility
vehicle, sir. You've had one too many already.'''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Well, if they came in for an Expedition, and it wasn't
right for them, I might steer them to a less expensive car like a
two-door Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   My conversation with Stephen Goldbart, one of the psychologists
who named the syndrome and started the Money, Meaning and Choices
Institute in San Francisco, didn't go much better.
</P>
<P>
   Goldbart said he sensed skepticism, which, as a psychologist
trained in picking up subtle emotional signals, he inferred from my
giggling into the phone. ``If this is going to be a sneer piece, it
won't help with our mission,'' he said. ``You'll only contribute to
the problem by alienating people.''
</P>
<P>
   That mission entails helping the newly rich to find balance in
their lives, to ``invest'' in themselves, their families and their
communities, not just the office and the stock market. Goldbart
said that people were so obsessed with getting rich that they fell
into a void when wealth arrived, and that it was not just the
overnight billionaires who were susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has become overly focused on money, money,
money,'' he observed. If only I had a dollar for every time he said
that.
</P>
<P>
   I carried this perspective back onto the pavement, where I met
Del McFarlane, 27, who works behind the counter at a local hardware
store and whose body appears to be a walking showcase for the local
tattooers' guild. I explained the syndrome to him. ``Oh, I've had
that,'' he said. ``Of course, I got it a different way than most of
these guys. I had to get in a motorcycle accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an insurance company paid him $100,000 and knocked his
priorities out of whack. ``I figured I could buy anything I ever
wanted, and I'd be happy,'' he said. He said he blew the money on
speed and parties, then became depressed when the money and drugs
ran out and the ink dried on the tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Call it great reporting, but I was sure I'd found the
quintessential Silicon Valley story.
</P>
<P>
   With a happy ending: McFarlane climbed his way back, got a job
at Crown Hardware and Lock, got into a good relationship. He said
he now has ``a sense of usefulness,'' which he gets from making
keys for people who are locked out of their houses and from
``lugging stock,'' which I presumed was not a day-trading
technique.
</P>
<P>
   For syndrome sufferers, McFarlane may be some sort of object
lesson, a cautionary tale. To wit: Be grateful for what you have,
do not expect lavish spending to fill your empty heart, focus on
relationships and community, and avoid getting that Wile E. Coyote
tattoo unless you're really sure.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, maybe the psychologists are right when they
say it's time to show a little compassion. There but for fortune go
you or I: the Lotto or the Nasdaq or Regis Philbin might at any
moment fulfill our secret desires for overweening riches and make
us the syndrome's next victims. So stifle that mocking giggle if
you possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you come across any poor suffering
millionaires, please sell them only the sport utility vehicle you
think they really need. &QL;

SENATE BACKS McCAIN AMENDMENT FORCING SECRET GROUPS TO NAME DONORS 
 
By PATTY REINERT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, who made campaign finance
reform the No. 1 issue of his failed White House bid, succeeded
Thursday in pushing through the Senate a measure forcing secretive
political groups to identify their contributors and tell how they
spend their money.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first campaign finance reform legislation to pass the
Senate since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've won, it will become law, one way or another,''
McCain said after the vote. ``This is not the end. It is the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Sens. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., and Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn., attached their amendment to an unrelated defense spending
bill after senators voted 57-42 to block the Republican
leadership's attempt to thwart the measure on a constitutional
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the
amendment on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, a much more modest effort than the comprehensive
legislation that McCain and Feingold have proposed for years, was
an attempt to address a tax loophole enjoyed by so-called 527s. The
political groups currently are tax-exempt while collecting
unlimited donations from anonymous contributors. Under current law,
they do not have to disclose the contributors' names or how the
money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would like to close the 527 tax loophole altogether, but
Thursday's amendment would force only disclosure on the groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not yet voted on the defense bill, but it is
expected to pass. The bill would then move to the House with
McCain's amendment, unless Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott is
able to persuade McCain and his allies to place the amendment on
another bill instead.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 of the tax code was created in 1975 to establish tax
rules for political organizations, such as the national political
parties and political action committees. But unlike these new,
secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Federal election laws don't cover 527s because the groups do not
specifically endorse candidates, but rather concentrate on issues.
By law, they cannot coordinate their activities, such as running
television ads, with the candidates who benefit from them.
</P>
<P>
   But 527s are playing a prominent role on both sides in this
year's political campaigns. McCain himself was targeted by a Texas
group's ads when he was challenging Gov. George W. Bush for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he sent an e-mail to more than 200,000 supporters,
urging them to call their senators and ask them to vote for his
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that this is last minute,'' he wrote, ``but I need your
help now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats have filed a lawsuit against House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, alleging that the Sugar Land Republican illegally
oversees the operation of several 527s.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has denied that charge. His office did not return calls
from the Houston Chronicle seeking comment on Thursday's action.
</P>
<P>
   During two hours of debate, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called
the 527 loophole the ``largest, most disturbing, pernicious
loophole in a system rife with backdoor ways to influence
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others warned that if the Senate failed to deal with
527s, Americans would have no way of knowing whether and how
foreign governments, organized crime or drug lords are influencing
the outcome of U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to track them down or find it out . . . All
we're saying is disclose,'' Schumer said. ``This is basic
information that the people have a right to know and we have a duty
to see that they get it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier efforts to change the campaign finance system have
stalled as McCain and his allies have been unable to muster the 60
votes needed to overcome a filibuster backed by DeLay and other
Republican leaders. That fact weighed heavily Thursday on some
senators, who feared that if the defense bill were sent to the
House with McCain's amendment it would bounce right back because of
a constitutional provision that requires legislation dealing with
taxes to originate in the House.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that would jeopardize the entire defense bill, which
includes crucial health benefits for military retirees as well as
programs for active-duty soldiers and sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the
bottom of the sea,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee and a former secretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McCain had earlier offered to remove the measure from the
defense bill if opponents would agree to attach it to the next
appropriate legislation to come before the Senate. They refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just totally disclosed what this is all about,''
McCain fumed. ``This is not about the defense of the nation. This
is the defense of a corrupt system.''
</P>
<P>
   The 57-42 vote rejecting the constitutional point of order
cleared the way for passage of McCain's amendment. Lott then said
he wanted to discuss putting the amendment on another bill, and
McCain said he would consider it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL ADD END) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the amendment had also argued that if 527s were
targeted, groups like the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO should also
be included. Those nonprofit organizations also use issue ads and
tend to support Democrats, the senators argued. Under current law,
they are not required to name their contributors, but they do
release their tax returns and their political activities are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would consider broadening the type of
organizations included in his amendment.
</P>

EXPERTS PRAISE JUDGE'S RULINGS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: MICROSOFT-TRIAL, MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST, MICROSOFT-GLOBAL) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks
Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks
but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had
made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer
industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses
under antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,''
said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law
School. ``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just
because you are big you can't do whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said,
included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to
break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had
decided it abused its monopoly power. Some experts said appeals
courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts
throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of
antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive
competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into
efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or
market existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had
maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the
scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional
antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by
monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that
the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of
antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist
attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft. The company's
chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into
``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as
an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case
differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack
company, said Charles J. Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the
University of Virginia School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that
approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style. ``There has
been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the
public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional
antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be
coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with
engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from
those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law
School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in
the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft
intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it
is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him''
on his factual findings. If those findings are accepted, Elhauge
said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely
sensible'' under legal precedents. Lesser remedies like orders to
monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult
to police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions
was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its
Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied
together.
</P>
<P>
   Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product,
like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage
of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product,
like raw salt, to get the popular product.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more
correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows,
portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal. It was
on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington
overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the
decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally
tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal. But even on that
subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his
approach as consistent with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly
be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try
to protect the decisions from being overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little
support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on
antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving
computer business.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the computer age might require adjustments to
some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating
system and a Web browser are really separate products. But, some of
them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the
heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the
victim of an injustice was a familiar defense. ``Every industry, as
it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law
applies to it.''

AN UPGRADE MEANS MORE SPACE FOR MEXICO

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most exclusive clubs in Latin America is the select
group of nations with the financial stability to earn
investment-grade ratings for their bonds and notes. Just about
every politician in the region dreams of joining.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Alejandro Toledo of Peru. Fighting to unseat President
Alberto Fujimori, Toledo came to New York to denounce electoral
fraud, and ultimately pulled out of a runoff widely thought to be
rigged against him. Even so, he told reporters, he made time to
visit Wall Street and to talk up Peru's prospects for a rating
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few Latin American nations have ever had the economic
or political credentials to qualify for admission. Chile is a
member, along with Panama, Uruguay and postwar El Salvador. For a
while, Colombia was, too, but shaky finances knocked it out last
August.
</P>
<P>
   The small circle widened earlier this year, when Moody's
Investors Service bumped up Mexico bonds to Baa3, its lowest
investment grade, nearly 20 years after a government default sent
tremors around the world. (Standard &AMP; Poor's still ranks Mexico a
step lower.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Baa3'' sounds discordant, but it is sweet music to
politicians' ears. Mexican officials take it as affirmation of
their harsh policies in the 1994 peso crisis, when the country's
last flirtation with an investment-grade rating fell apart.
Naturally, it has become campaign fodder for the presidential
election in July.
</P>
<P>
   What does it really mean? By all accounts, more than enough to
justify politicians' aspirations. ``Mexico, like the entire region,
has always paid incredibly high prices for capital because of the
volatility of the past,'' said Eduardo Cabrera, senior director of
Latin America strategy at Merrill Lynch. ``Now the cost of capital
will be decreasing, which gives Mexico an incredible competitive
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smaller ``risk premium'' needed to compensate investors
for the risk of default, the government can borrow more cheaply for
new highways and hospitals. But more important, analysts say, the
investment grade opens a much larger pool of potential investors.
Many large pension and money management funds are required to hold
only investment-grade instruments.
</P>
<P>
   And the new status means Mexican bonds are now represented in
benchmarks like the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index. Steven
Berkley, Lehman's global index manager, said that as soon as
Mexico's rating was upgraded, about $16 billion of Mexican paper
was automatically added to the index, joining about $4 billion in
notes from Pemex, the state-owned energy monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The Moody's rating refers specifically to Mexican government
debt payable in foreign currency, but the benefits extend to
corporate borrowers, which are rarely able to win ratings higher
than their home country's, a limit known as the sovereign ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   To Herminio Blanco, Mexico's secretary of commerce and
industrial development, the re-evaluation by Wall Street represents
``thousands more jobs in Mexico in the near future.'' It did not
contribute to the country's blistering 7.9 percent economic growth
rate in the first quarter, he said, but it will help President
Ernesto Zedillo end his administration as he has promised, ``with
no crisis'' _ a far cry from its start in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's based its decision on the perceived success of many
Zedillo initiatives: a more manageable debt load, a flexible
exchange rate policy and a dynamic export sector that is ``well
integrated into the North American economy,'' said Luis Ernesto
Martinez-Alas, a vice president at Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did see a few areas of Mexico's economy that still
need attention and called for additional spending cuts and a
broadening of the tax base, leaving some economists grumbling that
perhaps Mexico didn't deserve the upgrade just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really should be called a confusion-grade rating,'' said
Roberto Salinas Leon, a Mexican economist. He said too much work
remained to be done in opening competition in the state-run oil and
electricity sectors, updating labor laws and fortifying a rickety
banking system. ``The investment grade was premature,'' he said,
``and the explanations given are exceedingly rosy, unreflective of
a far more problematical situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, investment-grade ratings also bring negatives. The
same decrease in interest rates that helps Mexico's finances will
drive away risk-tolerant investors seeking higher returns. Joyce
Chang, global head of international fixed-income research at Chase
Securities, said some high-stakes players she surveyed were
planning to swap out of Mexico for countries whose bonds yielded
more. Two-thirds of them said Brazil was their top choice. Toledo
would be disappointed to know that Peru, now rated two notches
below Mexico, was on no one's list.

   Newspaper Chain on Block As Another Sells 38 Papers
</P>
<P>
   Central Newspapers, which owns The Arizona Republic, The
Indianapolis Star and four other newspapers, announced that it was
putting itself up for sale. The move would take another
multigenerational newspaper family, the Pulliams, out of the
business. Shares of Central Newspapers rose $20.50, to $52. A few
hours later, Gannett and Community Newspaper Holdings said they
were acquiring 38 of the 49 newspapers Thomson had put on the
block. Gannett is paying $1.13 billion for 21 newspapers. Community
Newspaper Holdings is buying 17 papers for $455 million. The sale
of the remaining 11 daily newspapers Thomson wants to sell is
expected to be completed within days.

<P>
   Anatomy of Microsoft Court Defeat
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of state and federal officials who have investigated and
prosecuted Microsoft for the last four years, as well as industry
executives, have seen many moves by Microsoft that they think
backfired and led to a resounding court defeat in the company's
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor Profit Up
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor reported fourth-quarter earnings that
exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates as sales increased 22.5
percent. And executives raised their predictions for revenue growth
in the next fiscal year to about 30 percent from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Fall Ahead of Economic Data
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell as investors pulled back before important economic
data scheduled to be released today. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 144.14 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,668.72. The
Nasdaq composite index dropped 13.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to
3,825.56, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.69
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,461.67.
</P>
<P>
   Interest Rates Increased in Europe
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank raised its core interest rate half a
percentage point, to 4.25 percent, in an unexpectedly aggressive
attempt to help insulate Europe against inflation. The move
surprised most economists and sent currency traders into a confused
frenzy over the euro, which rose and then slipped back.
</P>
<P>
   `Survivor' Extends Its Hit Status
</P>
<P>
   Establishing its credentials as the runaway television hit of
the summer, the CBS show ``Survivor,'' which chronicles the
adventures of 16 real people coexisting on an island off Borneo,
scored extraordinary ratings for the second consecutive week, this
time even drubbing ABC's ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,'' in
every audience category. More than 18 million people watched the
show Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another Soros Executive to Quit
</P>
<P>
   The last of three top money managers announced his departure
from the dwindling empire of George Soros. Scott Bessent, who
oversees European investments for Soros Fund Management, said he
would leave to start a private investment group. The move lowers
the curtain on Soros' run as one of the world's most daring money
managers.
</P>
<P>
   May Prices for Imported Goods Fell
</P>
<P>
   The prices businesses pay for imported goods, excluding
petroleum, fell 0.2 percent in May, the first time in almost a
year, government figures showed, suggesting that inexpensive
imports are helping to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign That Looks Out for No. 1
</P>
<P>
   The recently formed MarchFirst, which offers a variety of
Internet professional services, hopes to stand out among
competitors ranging from management consultants to advertising
agencies to Web site builders through an extensive _ and expensive
_ ad campaign centered on a celebration of being, well, first.

THE MUSICIANS ON THE NAPSTER BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11) 
By ALEC FOEGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   As a rock star and actress,
Courtney Love knows how to grab the spotlight. At a new-media
conference last month in Manhattan's SoHo, she delivered her
keynote address in '70s-style hip huggers and angrily shouted at
paparazzi who were blinding her with their camera flashes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love's message was similarly striking. ``Stealing an artist's
music without paying for it is absolute piracy,'' she said. ``And
I'm talking about major-label recording contracts, not Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   In siding with Napster, the free Internet music-swapping service
that has become the record labels' archenemy, Love demonstrated
that the continuing power struggle between the labels and the
musicians is taking a new turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving the major-label system and there are hundreds of
artists watching my court case and wanting to follow me,'' Love
declared. She and her band, Hole, are in a legal fight to end their
recording deal with Geffen Records, which is owned by the Universal
Music Group, itself part of the Seagram Co.
</P>
<P>
   Love is among the musicians raising the revolutionary notion
that the Internet may offer them a better shake than the labels,
which they accuse of imposing burdensome contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Though some prominent acts like Metallica and Dr. Dre side with
the labels against the free download sites, a loose pro-Napster
coalition is forming that includes rock bands like the Offspring
and Limp Bizkit (which is touring with Napster sponsorship this
summer), as well as rappers like Chuck D and the Beastie Boys.
</P>
<P>
   At a Congressional hearing last month, Sheryl Crow, a singer and
songwriter, criticized the labels' insistence on owning the
copyrights to most songs. Aimee Mann and Jonathan Brooke, two
midcareer artists, have found new careers marketing directly to
fans via the Web, offering free downloads, CD sales and concert
schedules. Some small labels are offering free music downloads as
well as selling discs.
</P>
<P>
   Could free downloads of music, whose rapid growth challenges
existing copyright laws, give musicians the upper hand in dealing
with the record companies? The five major labels, which start
selling digital music downloads this summer, may not like the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Label executives say they offer musicians marketing and
promotion, to radio stations and audiences, that are invaluable in
developing and sustaining their careers. These executives add that
they can perform these services much better than musicians or their
managers can on their own. ``It makes better business sense to pool
together resources, which is what a record label does,'' said Paul
Vidich, an executive vice president at Warner Music, a unit of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Only a musician like Love, with proven marquee value, might be
able to survive without a label deal, executives say _ but probably
not for long. ``They don't have the clout as one artist to get the
kind of broad-reaching breakthrough on the Internet on a worldwide
basis,'' said Kevin Conroy, head of new technology at BMG
Entertainment, which has stars like Whitney Houston and Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Goldberg, a former head of Mercury and Warner Music and
now president of the independent Artemis Records, said the labels
could afford far more marketing than the musicians. ``An artist
without marketing is at a disadvantage in a very cluttered world,''
he said. ``Marketing costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   But some musicians, who complain about being charged high
recording and manufacturing costs before they even see a royalty
check, say they can market themselves with free online music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a gatekeeper is the most profitable place to be,'' Love
said in her address. ``But now we're in a world without gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even say rapid technological advances could render
copyright laws unenforceable, making battles against free music
futile and forcing a decline of the record business. Musicians
would pursue other income sources, including live performances and
merchandising of T-shirts and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Label executives say free online music will not be a threat.
They point to recent courtroom victories in cases that would
restrict the traffic in free music on Napster and MP3.com, another
digital music site. ``I believe that if we offer consumers an
effective online alternative that is reasonably priced, we have
every opportunity to build a legitimate market,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was even blunter, saying, ``I think it's equally as
likely that land would be free than copyrights would be free.''
</P>
<P>
   But a report in April by Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., a research
firm in New York, predicted that 16 percent, or $985 million, of
the nation's music sales in 2002 would be lost to what it termed as
Web piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to squelch free music have had uncertain results. In
recent weeks, the rock band Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre
pressured Napster to ban from its site hundreds of thousands of
fans who had downloaded their music free. Many, however, simply
re-registered with different names.
</P>
<P>
   Record labels say they represent their artists' best interests.
But to get recorded, new musicians often sign contracts favorable
to the labels, then hire prominent entertainment lawyers to get
them out of these contracts once they make it big.
</P>
<P>
   Even some stars say their agreements leave most of the profits,
beyond a relatively small advance, to the labels. The contracts
criticized by Love and other musicians can leave them with only
pennies per disk from royalties, after subtracting advances and
production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling records is not necessarily consistent with the
interest of the artists,'' said Ken Hertz, a partner in the law
firm Hansen, Jacobson, Teller &AMP; Hoberman, which represents big-name
acts like Alanis Morissette and No Doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Since contracts for younger, newer musicians tend to be the
least favorable _ when they can get a contract at all _ those
artists have the greatest incentives to use free music to their
advantage. Hundreds of unsigned acts have uploaded free music files
to Web sites like MP3.com in hopes of getting exposure.
</P>
<P>
   A few smaller recording labels are already using free music as a
promotion tool for young musicians. Scott Ross, director of new
media at Moonshine Records of West Hollywood, Calif., an
independent dance-music label whose most popular artists sell
100,000 albums, said giving away MP3 files over the Web had helped
to double the sales growth rate of his company in the last year and
saved on marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get mainstream radio play; we don't get on MTV,''
Ross said. ``So the Internet is our best source of exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen James Barry, a member of one of Moonshine's best-selling
acts, Cirrus, said that offering free music on the Internet _ where
many of its young fans gather _ had helped to generate bigger
audiences for his group's concerts. Although all its music was
available free on the Internet, Barry said, its CD sales were not
hurt, because Cirrus' true fans wanted to collect everything the
band produced.
</P>
<P>
   He can even see his band deciding to handle its marketing and
sales directly. ``Right now, you don't really need a record
label,'' he said. ``When it becomes cheaper and easier to get your
music and promotion out to the people, then you stop needing the
label.''

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two years of war have caused the deaths of more
than 1.7 million people in eastern Congo, where people who manage
to flee the fighting often die of hunger and malaria while hiding
in impenetrable forests, a leading refugee agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This figure means that about four times as many people have died
in the area since August 1998 as would be expected under normal
conditions, according to the study conducted for the International
Rescue Committee in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although the expected death toll in the five-province area of 18
million people would be 600,000, the actual number was 2.3 million.
Of the 1.7 million additional deaths reported in the survey,
200,000 were caused by acts of violence, whereas the rest were
attributed to the war-related collapse of health services and food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men with guns come and wreak havoc on a very regular basis,''
said Les Roberts, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who
supervised the study. ``Those men cause more death by making people
flee their homes than actually by shooting or slitting throats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People flee into the forest when a village is attacked, often
at night. If they get a little sick and they are not eating, they
often die. One girl told us how she fled her village at night with
her family of eight. Five of the eight died as they hid in the
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in April and May, with random samplings
of houses in and around Moba, in Katanga Province; Kabare, Katana
and Kolonge in South Kivu; and Kisangani in Orientale Province.
Researchers asked residents questions like how many people were in
the family, whether anyone had died since last Christmas _ a major
holiday among the many Roman Catholics in the region _ and how many
died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, where Roberts formerly worked, provided baseline
statistics for sub-Sahara Africa. The results from the region, with
a population of 1.2 million, were extrapolated to the interior
regions and neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done what scientists hate to do, extrapolate from 1.2
million people to 18 million people,'' Roberts said. ``But we have
very consistently made conservative assumptions. I think we have
protected ourselves from the criticisms that we are being
extremists or hyperbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finished his survey, Roberts asked the U.N. relief
assistance coordinator for the area and a representative of the U.
S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the region to look over
his conclusions. They thought he may have been conservative, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he and his team found abandoned health clinics, local
economies in tatters and families struggling without the
subsistence agriculture or barter systems that had sustained them
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Children under five, the survey found, account for more than
one-third of the excess deaths in eastern Congo, an area disrupted
since 1994 by waves of ethnic and civil wars, sometimes
indistinguishable from an armed scramble for gold and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda sent troops into Congo, the former Zaire, in
August 1998 in support of rebels opposed to the government of
President Laurent Kabila. Last summer Rwandan and Ugandan troops
turned on each other, and they have been fighting each other this
week around the diamond center of Kisangani, adding at least 50
more civilian deaths to the toll.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke Thursday with President
Paul Kagame of Rwanda and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and
was assured that a cease-fire, not the first in recent weeks, went
into effect Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But hours later, Ugandan and Rwandan troops were fighting in
Kisangani, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United Nations
and this month's Security Council president, said Thursday that the
council's members ``deplore the loss of life and the damage
inflicted by the forces of Uganda and Rwanda on the Congolese
population.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the International Rescue Committee report, Kisangani had been
found to be one of the brighter spots in a very bleak picture of
life in one of Africa's potentially richest countries. The United
Nations had hoped to make the city a neutral site where a large
contingent of peacekeeping troops could be based and political
negotiations begun to end the Congo war.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that eastern Congo has become ``an unchecked
incubation zone for disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that malaria and diarrheal diseases, including
cholera, appeared to be the leading causes of death, although
meningitis and suspected cases of polio were also found.
</P>
<P>
   Because blood transfusions are often needed for malaria victims,
he said, ``my strong gut feeling is that the prevalence of HIV has
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS and other deadly viruses are known to have flourished in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congo has something like the 14th-highest death rate on the
planet,'' he said. Most of the other 13 countries are in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no blood tested in this region since 1998,'' he
added.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wasting no time, Microsoft filed a court plea
overnight, asking for an immediate stay of the ruling a federal
judge entered against the company on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered expansive reasoning for the request, saying
the judgment would ``inflict grievous and irreparable harm on
Microsoft, its 35,000 employees, its millions of shareholders, its
thousands of business partners and tens of millions of consumers
around the world who rely on Microsoft's products.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of legal routine, the appeal went to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson _ the same judge who ruled against Microsoft. He
can be expected to deny the motion, an action required before
Microsoft can take the case to a Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said during a news briefing Thursday that Jackson's order
included ``straightforward remedies, things like Microsoft not
being able to intimidate computer manufacturers who choose to
select other people's products, things like not illegally tying two
products together as a way to force them on consumers, things that
are really I think rather basic and fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, offered a different
view. During a news conference on Wednesday night at the software
maker's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., he repeated the company's
complaint that the remedy would require Microsoft to ``disclose our
most valuable intellectual property, even to our competitors'' and
``that we would be required to redesign all of our
operating-systems software products to the government's vague and
ambiguous specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the continuing harsh language, both Klein and Neukom,
in response to questions, said they would still be willing to
settle the case. A civil case can be settled at any point, even if
it is before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is prepared to engage in meaningful settlement
negotiations,'' Klein said, adding that any settlement must
``meaningfully address the harm that's occurred to this market and
ensure on a going-forward basis that it not be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Neukom's theoretical endorsement of settlement discussions was
tepid as well. ``I don't think we ever have or would close the door
to good-faith negotiations to resolve differences,'' he said. ``We
do that every day in the law department here at Microsoft. We've
settled more cases than we've had to try or appeal, and that's good
management, and we'll continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   No movement has been made to start settlement talks, and none is
expected. Jackson, in a recent interview with The New York Times,
said he thought Microsoft had ``probably flexed as far as they were
going to'' during the four-month settlement talks that ended on
April 1. At the end of those talks, the two sides remained far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Klein announced on Wednesday evening that the Justice Department
would seek to route Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme
Court, under a 1974 revision of federal antitrust laws that allows
direct appeals in cases of national significance.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom responded that Microsoft would oppose such an effort to
``try to circumvent an appeal to the Court of Appeals,'' where the
company believes it will receive more favorable treatment. He also
suggested that the Supreme Court might not accept the case because
it had agreed only once before to take an expedited appeal of an
antitrust case, during the suit against AT&AMP;T in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledged that expedited appeals were rare. But he also
said that since 1974, AT&AMP;T's was the only antitrust case of true
national significance that had been in the federal courts. ``So the
paucity of precedent, I think, actually reinforces the government's
view that the act was designed precisely for this kind of case,''
Klein said.

 By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday approved a measure to
require the growing number of tax-exempt groups that now secretly
raise and spend unlimited sums on political activities to disclose
their contributors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the legislation sponsored by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., was the first since 1993 in which the Senate approved an
important tightening of campaign finance laws. It and could give
unexpected momentum to a similar measure that the House will vote
on Friday, despite opposition from Republican leaders. It could
also enhance the prospects for McCain's proposed ban on
unrestricted donations called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday's decisive procedural motion, senators refused by a
57-42 vote to defeat the measure. The margin surprised even McCain
and his chief Democratic allies, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. In an embarrassing rebuke to
Majority Leader Trent Lott, 14 Republicans voted with 43 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end, this is the beginning,'' said McCain,
beaming and ebullient after his triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote on a second major issue, senators defeated a sweeping
bill to overhaul the nation's managed care system. The vote, 51-48,
was largely along party lines, with most Republicans opposing the
measure and all the Democrats supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters said the vote could doom all hope this year for
Congress to pass bipartisan legislation on managed care. Senate and
House negotiators have been stalled for months on hammering out a
compromise. But Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, vowed that
backers would ``keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the managed care and campaign finance measures were
permitted as amendments to a $310 billion Pentagon budget bill. For
the last few weeks, the Senate has been locked in a battle over how
to conduct its business, highlighted by a shouting match on the
floor between Lott and Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   When the Senate returned this week from a 10-day recess, the two
leaders seemed chastened by the gridlock, and have been working to
patch up their differences. But it is a fragile peace that could
collapse at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both understand that we have got a job to do,'' Daschle
told reporters before the votes Thursday. ``We have to run the
Senate in a way that accommodates not only our caucus interests,
but the interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday marked a new tack by McCain and his allies to
translate his new national prominence from his unsuccessful
presidential race into traction on his signature issue of
overhauling the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   By seizing on a device used by groups large and small, liberal
and conservative, that try to avoid the donor disclosure laws,
McCain picked an issue that could not be challenged on
constitutional grounds, like his proposed ban on unrestricted
donations called soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires a growing number of political organizations
formed under an obscure part of the Internal Revenue Code known as
Section 527 to follow federal campaign law and file tax returns and
disclose a list of their contributors and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was created in 1975, after the Watergate scandal, to
establish tax rules for political organizations, like the national
political parties and political action committees. But unlike these
new secretive groups, parties and PACs register with the Federal
Election Commission, which requires them to disclose their donors
and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of the groups exist, from those affiliated with the
Sierra Club to organizations with close ties to Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the majority whip. The groups raise money, buy television
and radio ads, conduct polling, work on issues and conduct other
political activities.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail message sent before Thursday's vote to 200,000 of
his supporters nationwide, McCain tried to tap into the same fervor
that propelled his Straight Talk Express candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stood by my side throughout our quest for the White
House,'' McCain said. ``Now today, I am asking for your help to
fight one more battle. As you can imagine, this move is being
vehemently opposed by the big money fat cats who have grown quite
comfortable throwing their millions around in secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold said after the vote, ``There's no question that John
McCain's campaign had a lot to do with what happened today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill mostly sidestepped a fight on the merits of
the measure, retreating behind procedural arguments and warnings of
damage to national security to oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Two Senate Republicans, John Warner of Virginia and James Inhofe
of Oklahoma, praised the substance of McCain's amendment, but said
its passage would doom the entire military bill.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the House Ways and Means Committee warned
Thursday that the amendment amounted to a revenue measure because
it involved possible changes in the tax status of political groups.
Under the Constitution all revenue bills must originate in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have my vote,'' said Warner, chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. ``But this amendment will torpedo this bill and
send it to the bottom of the sea where only Davey Jones could
resurrect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly furious, McCain called the tactic ``a red herring'' that
exposed Republicans' claims to be champions of campaign disclosure
as hypocritical. ``The American people will see through this,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents' arguments backfired badly as supporters clearly were
willing to take the risk that the House would return the bill
unread. Several of the 14 Republicans who defied their leadership,
including Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Conrad Burns of Montana,
have not supported changes in campaign finance law in the past, but
face tough re-election races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The measure still faces the possible constitutional challenge in
the House. McCain said if the bill was returned, the campaign
finance measure could be stripped off and attached to another bill.
McCain said he was open to a suggestion made by Lott after the vote
to negotiate an even broader disclosure amendment that could
withstand House scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks will take place in the next few days. Until then
Thursday's action stands as senators' most important action on
campaign finance law since 1993, when a Democrat-controlled Senate
in tightened several parts of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats were also instrumental in forcing Thursday's
vote on the managed care legislation. They persuaded four
Republicans to side with them _ two more than last year _ and came
very close to a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the clearest message that we are going to get a bill
this year,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded
the bill through the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was identical to the one passed by the House with
bipartisan support last October. It would give patients the right
to sue their health maintenance organizations and would set uniform
national standards for health insurance. The Senate passed its own
Republican-sponsored version last July, offering fewer protections
to fewer people, two important differences that have proved
insurmountable so far to House and Senate negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called the negotiations a ``charade'' and said the two
sides had made so little progress in reaching a compromise that
Democrats felt compelled to force the House bill on the floor.
President Clinton also weighed in, expressing disappointment with
the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans, infuriated by the Democrats' course of
action, called the move a political ploy and said it all but doomed
bipartisan legislation for the year. Instead, Republicans said they
would draft their own bill and pass it with Republican votes if
they had to, even if that meant Clinton would veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Most Senate Republicans dislike the House bill, which the
insurance industry opposes, saying it would lead to runaway
lawsuits, raise premiums and put employers out of business. They
would like a bill narrower in scope, one that would restrict
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats counter that the ability to sue is critical to making
health maintenance organizations accountable for their decisions.
They say they will continue to negotiate and will try to force the
issue back on the floor, if need be. The American Medical
Association backs the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Framing Thursday's defeat as a victory, Democrats said they were
now one vote short of success. And by forcing Republicans to vote
on the bill, they hope to be able to portray them on the campaign
trail as beholden to the insurance industry and unwilling to
address consumer concerns about managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really want a bill, Republicans are going to have to
write this bill and pass it,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one
of the negotiators. ``The Democrats want a political issue.''

 &HT;    Rocker shows in Toledo
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio _ So much for John Rocker's threat to become a
stockbroker. Atlanta's demoted closer began his minor-league
rehabilitation Thursday, beating the 72-hour deadline with time to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had told an Atlanta radio station that he was
considering quitting, reported to the Class AAA Richmond Braves for
the middle game of a three-game International League series against
the Toledo Mud Hens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to never believe anything a player says when he's
first sent down,'' Atlanta assistant general manager Frank Wren
said. ``They are always upset, just like John was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was cheered loudly by most of the crowd of more than
6,000 as he walked across the field to the Richmond dugout before
the game. Then he stopped to sign autographs for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to protect him if he needed it,'' said 80-year-old
Eloise Duncan, a Atlanta Braves fan from Pemberville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did not pitch in the lopsided Toledo victory or talk to
the media contingent of more than 100. He is likely to pitch
tonight, when the series concludes. Then Richmond goes to Columbus,
Ohio, for two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he pitches once, hopefully all the TV cameras go
away,'' Wren said. ``This has taken a toll on him. You can see
there is stress there. Once he got his uniform on and got out on
the field, his whole demeanor changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker wore No. 43 instead of his usual No. 49 as he threw in
the bullpen for 20 minutes before the game. The Braves hope he can
regain the control that had deserted him recently as the
controversy surrounding him mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was sent to the minors the day after he threatened Jeff
Pearlman, the writer of the infamous Sports Illustrated article
that turned the pitcher's life around. The Braves fined Rocker
$5,000 for his conduct toward the reporter, but said he was being
sent down to the minors because of his pitching problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last 18 batters Rocker had faced, 12 reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker allowed 18 hits and 25 walks in 18 2/3 innings. During
his side session before the game with Richmond pitching coach Mike
Alvarez, Rocker still had problems controlling his fastball. After
one bad pitch, he bellowed a loud obscenity that could be heard
throughout parts of the mostly empty stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker arrived at the stadium nearly four hours for the 7 p.m
game and renewed some old acquaintances in the Richmond clubhouse.
Toby Rumfield caught Rocker several times in spring training,
including his first game back after an arbitrator reduced the
original suspension and fine for the Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a bunch of us, he's a friend,'' Rumfield said. ``There
won't be any problems in our clubhouse. We'll welcome him and kid
about all the attention we're getting. As far as I'm concerned,
he's the best lefty in the bullpen there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Said third baseman Wes Helms: ``He needs to feel welcome and
confortable. We want him to do well here and get back to the major
leagues. That's where he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Andy Barkett is new to the Braves organization and
had never met Rocker. ``I introduced myself and welcomed him to the
team. I'll pull for him like any other teammate. We are all here to
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said Wednesday he might give up baseball and become a
stockbroker. But he caught a 10:35 a.m. Delta flight Thursday and
arrived in Toledo at 12:20 p.m. More than a half dozen television
camera crews were there to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Titkemeier, 19, of Port Orange, Fla. couldn't believe
Rocker was on his flight. Titkemeier was coming up to visit his
grandmother and was already going to Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slept part of the way and talked on his phone when he
could,'' Titkemeier said. ``Then he signed some autographs after we
landed. I'm a big fan. I told him to go get them.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-car escort from the Lucas County Sherriff's Department
accompanied Rocker, riding in a red Buick Sable, to the Toledo
Holiday Inn West, the team's hotel. He eluded camera crews by going
in a side door.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at Ned Skeldon Stadium. A half dozen
uniformed police officers were stationed on the field and the
walkway that players take to get to the field was blocked off to
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Booz of Toledo came to the game hopeful of seeing Rocker
pitch. ``I've followed the Braves since they won 13 straight to
start 1982,'' he said. ``I'm afraid that all the pressure and
conflict has got to Rocker's pitching. I hope he can pitch like he
used to. Atlanta needs him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few fans seemed to be ready to heckle Rocker. One sign in
the bleachers near the Richmond bullpen read, ``Jeff Pearlman Fan
Club.''

WOODEN SPILLS ALL TO WALTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There will never be a time, says Bill Walton, when
he sits down with John Wooden and doesn't learn something new.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit Walton had Monday with the former UCLA basketball
coach at his condo in Encino darn near left him speechless.
</P>
<P>
   Which, as you can guess, is almost impossible these days.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hoosiers vs. Hollywood'' theme that NBC has given to these
Pacers-Lakers NBA Finals is practically a script of the life of
Wooden, a Hall of Fame player from Purdue who came out to coach
UCLA in the 1940s and created the Bruin mystique.
</P>
<P>
   Off an afternoon-long interview Walton did in the capacity of
NBC reporter, the network will air a comparable sliver before and
at halftime of Sunday's Game 3 coverage from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   At least, Walton says, it's all on tape and will provide an
exceptional piece of archival footage of Wooden's life - as only he
can explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most incredible times I've ever spent with
him,'' said Walton on Thursday from his home in San Diego where he
gets to go between Games 1 and 2 from Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we generally do these kind of features, we spend maybe
20, 30 minutes with the person. He sat there without getting up
from his chair or even asking for a glass of water for 2 hours -
and he was going stronger than ever by the end. He never once
stopped and asked to redo an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always reluctant to talk about himself, but I was asking
one-sentence questions and he'd go on and never stop. It was an
incredible performance for anyone, let alone someone who's 89 years
old. He's a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   In this rare personal insight, Wooden talks about life growing
up on a farm in Indiana without electricity or running water, how
his mother handmade the basketballs he played with, how his love
for poetry came from his father reading to him by the gas lamp, and
the pain he experienced when he couldn't be near his father at the
time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a chance none of that makes the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, maybe more newsworthy, is Wooden's take on the
Bob Knight situation (``I've said that I wouldn't want anyone dear
to me to play for him, but that's because of his language; he's
very profane''), his view on the changes in Reggie Miller from
college to the pros (``A lot of things with Reggie I didn't like
when he was at UCLA'') and why he never cared to coach in the NBA
(``I didn't think you have real control.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saving everything,'' Walton said of the interview,
which unfortunately has to be edited down for broadcast. ``At least
between NBC and CNBC and MSNBC, it'll all get out there. It was an
incredible thing to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking the line: The Associated Press reported Thursday that
three of Walton's four sons - Nathan, Chris and Luke - were seen
wearing NBC press credentials before Game 1, which gave them access
to areas such as the Pacers' locker room. They greeted Pacers coach
Larry Bird, a former teammate of Walton's with the Boston Celtics,
as he entered the building for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm wrong (for doing that),'' Walton admitted, ``but I
don't get to see my kids too much - I fly 650,000 miles a year -
and they don't get out to too many games. Larry was instrumental in
their lives and to be able to take them to meet up with him to
renew that friendship was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NBC says no, well, then they can't be there, or even ride
to the game in the car with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stoners unite: Bob Costas, in his third and final year as
the NBA Finals play-by-play guy before he gives it back to Marv
Albert, loves to hear theories about how NBC has tried to
orchestrate a particular Finals scenario with the NBA to get better
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Such as those who knew an L.A.-New York final was going to
happen. Then didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NBA had a conspiracy theory,'' Costas said, ``it failed
in the Eastern Conference finals and it was a real case of
brinkmanship in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the plan would have been, let's see if we can have
the team we prefer to have win go down 16 points and have to rely
on a banked-in 3-pointer, have to rely on the other team missing
open shots rather than officials calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the league was interested in cahoots with NBC or
anybody else in engineering an outcome, they wouldn't take it on
the brink that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can see that many perceive the NBA has an ulterior
motive?
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is inclined to believe that, possibly because
they're rooting for the team that is on the short end or if their
team isn't in it, they resent the New Yorks and the Los Angeleses.
And we understand that syndrome. If they are inclined to believe
that, then any fragment of evidence will be used to support it.
That's just human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the way people filter information and perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   More myths, half-truths and flat-out lies: The 2-3-2 format for
the NBA Finals as opposed to the 2-2-1-1-1 used in the earlier
rounds isn't anything new - it's been in place since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was done as a function of helping the media, print
reporters rather than TV networks are the people whose best
interests were being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at all because of TV,'' said NBA senior VP of
communications Brian McIntyre. ``It started back in the 1980s
because of the constant cross-country trips that had to be made
with the Lakers and Celtics facing each other. It was to cut down
on player travel. The byproduct of it was that newspaper budgets
couldn't always afford to send reporters back and forth, so with
this format, we actually picked up more media.''
</P>
<P>
   How many more? The NBA hasn't counted the number of credentials
issued for the series and wouldn't offer a ballpark figure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -Number crunching for those who care: NBC's ratings for Game 1
was 12.8 with a 21 share, a nine-percent increase over last year's
Game 1 between San Antonio and New York. L.A. registered a 28.7
rating and 44 share - actually, a drop from the 29.4/51 who tuned
in to the Lakers' Game 7 win over Portland. But little-ol'-Indiana
did a 39.6/56 for Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   -Did you know: Hannah Storm, NBC's NBA studio maven, has to be
the best network resource on Indiana Pacers history. Her father,
Mike Storen, was the original Pacers GM when they began in the ABA
in 1967-68 and even picked out the team colors and logo. He went on
to become the ABA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   -Jim Rome's tour stop at Blossom Music Center in Cleveland on
Saturday will be taped to show on Fox Sports Net on July 12 at 8
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -NBC's celeb cams picked off Gabe Kaplan, Tony Dow (Wally from
``Leave It To Beaver'') and horse trainer Bob Baffert during their
Game 1 let's-go-to-the-fourth-quarter montage. Sure, a welcome
break from Dyan Cannon's stretched-beyond-recognition facial, but
what a way to cheapen a big-time event.

 &HT;    Mystery muddled by a man in mink
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The prosecution, after 11 days of testimony, 40
witnesses and a deal that sprung its celebrity defendant, rested
Thursday in the Buckhead stabbings trial.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining defendants called but one witness between them
and took a little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony further helped muddle an already confusing case
for the jury, dramatically introducing a mysterious attacker in
mink.
</P>
<P>
   The defense witness testified he threw a man wearing a fur coat
off mortally wounded Jacinth Baker on a Buckhead street and heard
the man mutter, ``I stabbed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Keven Brown, a hulking bodyguard dressed in black, said the man
was holding Baker by the back of the neck and punching him in the
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was stroking him pretty nice,'' testified Brown, giving a
matter-of-fact account of the beating. ``He was wearing a black fur
coat.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither of the remaining defendants in the case _ Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore, and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami _ wore
a fur coat that night. Oakley called Brown to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard, doing what defense attorneys have
done to him during the first three weeks of the trial, turned the
oppositon's witness into one of his own. Howard's cross-examination
of Brown helped bolster testimony earlier this week by NFL star Ray
Lewis who said he saw Oakley and limo passenger Carlos Stafford
beating Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown did not identify Oakley, Howard is sure to argue
that the second man Brown said he saw beating Baker was Oakley.
Brown testified he was ``90 percent'' sure the man he pushed off
Baker was Stafford, who has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he met Stafford briefly outside the Cobalt nightclub
minutes before the melee. Stafford, a law school student from
Houston, was unable to negiotiate an immunity agreement with
prosecutors in exchange for his testimony. Stafford, through his
attorney, denies attacking anyone during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown said the attacker wearing the black fur coat had
braided hair. Stafford has been identified in testimony as wearing
a black fur coat that night. His hair was not braided. Sweeting had
braided hair but he and Oakley are being tried for attacking
different men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever it may have been, it was not Reginald Oakley,''
Oakley's lawyer Bruce Harvey said outside the courtroom. ``Reginald
Oakley did not stab anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   To further confuse jurors, Richard Lollar, the other man stabbed
to death that night, had a hair from a mink coat in his hand.
Lollar, 24, and Baker, 21, were killed Jan. 31 during a brawl after
a night of post Super Bowl partying.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are set to begin this morning and the jury
consisting of 10 women and two men should start deliberating by
early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he left the Cobalt nightclub, having escorted his
client to his car, and was driving home in his gold Honda Civic
down East Paces Ferry Road just minding his own business. But Brown
said he noticed a group of people fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Brown stopped in the street in front of Baker who was ``running
for his life,'' he said. Baker was being beaten to the ground by
the man in the fur coat when another man came up and pulled on
Baker's leg and kicked him, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an all-out brawl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little man was on the ground trying to cover up,'' Brown
said. The 5-foot-3, 146-pound Baker initially fought back but when
he went down on the pavement ``he basically looked like he was
unconscious,'' the bodyguard testified.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he yelled at the men to stop and then pushed the man
in the fur coat off. This man and the other attacker, he testified,
ran away toward Lewis' stretch Lincoln Navigator limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he also looked down the street and saw Lollar under
attack. Moments later, Brown said he saw Lollar walk slowly toward
Baker's body, stand there for a few seconds and then fall over
backward onto the street. The medical examiner earlier testified
that Lollar could have lived for at least 45 seconds after being
stabbed in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Howard tried to persuade Brown into
admitting the ``I stabbed him'' comment might not have come from
the man wearing the black fur coat. But Brown stood firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three people: me, the guy I pushed and the guy
lying on the ground,'' he responded. ``I didn't say it. The guy on
the ground didn't say it. It was the guy I pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's testimony was ironic in that the ``I stabbed him''
admission came from a defense witness. In his opening statement,
Howard promised jurors that limo driver Duane Fassett would testify
he overheard both Oakley and Sweeting say, ``I stabbed mine,'' as
the Lincoln Navigator sped away from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett never delivered that statement in a dramatic meltdown on
the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of many witnesses before him, Brown's testimony, while
confident and direct, was not without contradiction and
inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Brown testified the man in the fur coat, who he believed to be
Stafford, had braided hair.
</P>
<P>
   Howard called a rebuttal witness, Brian Johnson, who testified
he knew Stafford and had seen him Super Bowl night. Stafford did
not have braided hair that evening, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Bonner dismissed some of the charges, granting
partial directed verdicts of acquittal in favor of Oakley and
Sweeting. She dismissed murder, felony murder and aggravated
assault charges against Oakley for Richard Lollar's killing. She
did the same for Sweeting in connection with Baker's killing.
</P>
<P>
   But now the prosecution cannot argue now that Oakley and
Sweeting were part of a joint attack, said Jack Martin, a prominent
defense lawyer not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means each defendant will be held responsible for what they
personally did,'' Martin said. ``It also means that the
prosecution's original theory never panned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's ruling, in reality, has little impact. If convicted of
murder or felony murder, Oakley and Sweeting will be sentenced to
life in prison.

GORE TOURS WEST AS CLINTON IS EXPECTED TO NAME NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 and CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Vice President Al Gore tours the Hanford Reach Friday
morning, President Clinton will designate a national monument along
the 51-mile undammed stretch of Columbia River in Eastern
Washington, sources in Washington, D.C., confirmed Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The president will use his executive authority to create a
200,000-acre Hanford Reach National Monument, along with a
Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument in the Soda Mountain area of
south central Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to establish a Canyon of the Ancients
National Monument in Colorado, protecting America's highest known
density of archeological sites, and an Ironwood Forest National
Monument in uplands of Arizona's Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to take a boat trip on the Hanford Reach
Friday morning and later deliver a speech on environmental
preservation at the Tri-Cities campus of Washington State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has moved in less than three weeks to
resolve a two decade controversy over the free-flowing river, its
dramatic bluffs, and wild shrub and grassland habitat flanking what
was one of America's great nuclear weapons manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach is the spawning ground of the last great wild
salmon runs of the Columbia River. It is the only non-reservoirized
stretch of river remaining between Bonneville Dam, east of
Portland, and the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., long an advocate of protecting the
Reach and adjoining wildlands on the 560-square-mile Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, would not confirm Clinton's pending action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this: We will see from the Secretary of the
Interior and the Clinton administration a commitment to making sure
local people have a say in writing the management plan for the
Reach,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Slade Gorton Thursday tried to upstage Gore by
predicting that the vice president would announce the national
monument during his three-city swing through the state Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton spoke to regional reporters in a telephone briefing set
up by the campaign of Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush. He argued that the Reach is not threatened, and that the
administration's only urgency is that President Clinton is about to
leave office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration is doing things to people rather than with
people ... Instead of working with the local people, the
administration says, `We don't care what you want, we're going to
do it,''' Gorton said in a separate interview.
</P>
<P>
   The designation ``is designed more to get the approval of the
New York Times than anybody else,'' Gorton added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate a series
of national monuments in the American West. The law was first used
by President Theodore Roosevelt early in the 20th Century to
protect such places as the Grand Canyon and the heart of
Washington's Olympic Mountains. Both areas are now national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Clinton moved to protect wild canyonlands of
the Arizona Strip, north of the Grand Canyon, and giant Sequoia
trees in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized the president's monument designations in a
speech on the environment last week at Lake Tahoe in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen millions of acres of land declared off-limits and
designated national monuments _ just like that, with no real public
involvement and no regard for the people affected by these
decrees,'' Bush stated.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach has remained natural largely because, in 1942,
the great bend of the Columbia River north of Richland was taken
over by the Manhatten Project to make plutonium for nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Eight shut-down nuclear reactors sit along the south and west
banks of the river, a legacy of Hanford's four decades in
bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   The wilder north and east sides of the Columbia River are marked
by the White Bluffs of Hanford. The undammed river is a major bird
habitat, home to a big fall chinook salmon run, and contains
important Indian archeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach, and the Wahluke Slope just to the north, have
seen a succession of development proposals in the last
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers campaigned in the 1970's to dam and
reservoirize the river. In the 1980's, the Corps came up with a new
proposal to dredge a navigation channel down the middle of the
river to make Wenatchee a barge port.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials in Grant County have long supported some amount
of agricultural development on the Wahluke Slope, a chunk of the
Hanford Reservation now managed as a national wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department began to examine preservation of the
Reach in 1979, even as the Corps continued to lobby for damming and
dredging. The campaign for its preservation began in earnest in
1995 when Murray proposed legislation to give the area federal
protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
</P>
<P>
   As he toured the river last month, U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, himself a geologist, voiced alarm at erosion of the White
Bluffs by existing irrigation in areas adjoining the Hanford
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will ride the Hanford Reach Friday with Richard Steele, a
Hanford technician who has spent nearly 40 years fighting efforts
to dam and dredge the river, and irrigate adjoining lands.
</P>
<P>
   Steele has cited the example of a wide, gravel-covered bar in
the river where he fished in the early 1970's that is now covered
with silt up to three feet deep. ``How is that good for salmon?''
he asked Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton on Tuesday, five Democratic House members
from Washington argued for immediate designation of a national
monument. They cited the Hanford Reach as critical habitat to the
``only harvestable runs of Chinook salmon in the Columbia Basin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that Senator Murray has exhausted all reasonable
alternatives in her efforts to negotiate a compromise with those
who are unwilling to take the necessary steps to protect this vital
resource,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately this Congress, like the Congresses before it,
has again failed to act,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that monument designation was imminent, however,
GOP Rep. Doc Hastings, whose district includes the Reach, described
it as ``an insult to this community which has worked too hard for
too long on a balanced solution to have the decision unilaterally
taken out of our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray took the opposite view. The Democratic senator argued
that national monument designation will transform the image of
Hanford, long associated with bomb making and the nation's largest
volume of high-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an amazing transition,'' Murray said. ``People will
see the Tri-Cities, as I did growing up, as a wonderful place to
live, surrounded by natural beauty, and a historic place that
helped win World War II. Families, here and across the country,
will see the opportunity to visit a new national monument.''

A QUIET MAN WITH AN UNSAVORY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JO THOMAS with ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was a quiet man who
mowed his grass three times a week and grilled the hamburgers at a
neighborhood cookout two weeks ago. But the police say he had a
second life as well, using the Internet to lure women for violent
sex that went bad for the women involved.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after two women complained that Robinson, who the
authorities say called himself ``slavemaster'' on the Internet, had
assaulted and robbed them at local hotels, the police arrested him.
Over the weekend, they began to make a series of grisly
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   A search of a farm Robinson owns in LaCygne, Kan., south of
Kansas City, yielded two barrels, sitting outdoors, swathed in
plastic. Inside were the bodies of two women. A second search, of
three storage units he rented in nearby Raymore, Mo., yielded three
more 55-gallon drums and three more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the women, Suzette Marie Trouten, 28, of Monroe
County, Mich., has been identified. The authorities say Trouten met
Robinson on the Internet. And as the investigation widens, the
police have linked Robinson to four other women and a baby who have
also disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Morrison, the Johnson County district attorney who filed
the assault charges against Robinson, is now leading a two-state
task force investigating his activities. Morrison said he expects
to file more charges against Robinson, who is being held under a $5
million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's lawyer, Byron Cerrillo, said his client would plead
not guilty to the sexual assault charges and to any murder charges
that might be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent the fact that people are now claiming that Mr.
Robinson, either directly or indirectly, is a serial killer,''
Cerrillo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Detective David Brown, the Lenexa, Kan., policeman acting as a
spokesman for the task force, said the police had been
investigating Robinson's connection to Trouten when they received
the assault complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon LaPrad, owner of LaPrad Home Care in Monroe, Mich., 35
miles south of Detroit, had employed Trouten for much of the past
decade as a nurse's aide working in the homes of dying and
convalescing patients.
</P>
<P>
   LaPrad said her employee had been contacted last year through an
Internet chat room by a man who offered her a job. Trouten was
lured to her death by promises of a $62,000-a-year job as nurse and
companion for her supposed patron's ``elderly father,'' LaPrad
said.
</P>
<P>
   The job, Trouten was told, would last about a year and offered
world travel, a month off after every two months of traveling, plus
all expenses and extensive health and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Trouten made two trips to Kansas, in October and November, to
look into the job and her prospective employer, and she returned
impressed with what she saw, LaPrad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked her up at the airport in a limousine,'' LaPrad
recalled in a telephone interview. ``She told me he lived in a
mansion. She said she saw the mansion and a guest house. She said
it was something else.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPrad said she personally was skeptical, as were other friends
of Trouten. ``It sounded too good to be true,'' LaPrad said. ``But
she was so confident. `This is on the up and up,' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Trouten, who was single and had no children, left
the Newport, Mich., home she shared with her mother, Carolyn, took
her two Pekinese dogs and drove to Kansas. On Feb. 27, LaPrad said,
she received an e-mail message from Trouten saying she had arrived
with her dogs after a 14-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Trouten's mother received an e-mail message from
her daughter saying she had checked into a motel. A few days later,
Carolyn Trouten received another e-mail message, this one from the
man who had supposedly employed her. It said that Trouten would be
gone for about two months, and it gave an itinerary that did not
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   The mother became suspicious and called the police, LaPrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the other missing women linked to Robinson
include Paula Godfrey, 19, reported missing on Sept. 1, 1984;
Katherine Clampet, 27, reported missing June 5, 1987; Izabela K.
Lewicka, 22, a Polish immigrant who has been missing since last
fall; and Lisa Stasi, 19, who disappeared with her 5-month-old
baby, Tiffany, on Jan. 11, 1985. All of the women were living or
staying in Overland Park, Kan., at the time they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Citing investigators' reports from 1985, the Kansas City Star
said Stasi was staying in a domestic violence shelter at the time
she met Robinson. The newspaper reported that the police believed
Robinson promised to help her go to Texas to train for work as a
silk-screen printer. He also offered her $800 a month for living
expenses and promised to find her a baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Later, according to the newspaper, a lawyer representing
Robinson told the police that Stasi had decided to take care of
herself, and Robinson told the police she had moved to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not disclose any details about the earlier
investigations or provide information about Godfrey, Clampet, or
Lewicka.
</P>
<P>
   At Store-Mor For Less in Raymor, Mo., where the police found
three bodies in Robinson's 10-by-15-foot unit, a manager who asked
that her name not be used said the Robinsons rented three units in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's wife, Nancy, rented the first storage unit in May,
1993, and Robinson rented two more units in November or December,
1993, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his sister Beverly had gone to work for his
company, Equi II, and he was storing her furniture. She supposedly
had gone to Australia. The last time I saw him, he was saying that
she was in Italy. He said, `She's having a ball. I don't think
she'll ever return.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has a lengthy criminal record of theft and fraud. He
was sent to prison in Kansas in May, 1986. In 1991, he was paroled
and sent to Missouri to serve a sentence for theft. He was paroled
there in March, 1993. He then moved to Olathe. His wife managed the
mobile home park where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Timmons, 79, the Robinsons' next-door neighbor in a mobile
home park in Olathe, recalled that Robinson ``kept his yard
immaculate. He had elaborate decorations on all the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed he was retired,'' Timmons said. ``He looks older
than he is. They had grown children and at least one grandchild.
There was a sign outside that said `Grandpa's place. We Spoil
Grandchildren.'''

 STUDY DETAILS POPULARITY OF INTERNET MUSIC  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Demonstrating that Napster-style ``freeloading''
isn't just a college fad, 42 percent of U.S. Internet users who
download free copies of songs are between the ages of 30 and 49,
according to a new study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the independent Pew Research Center found that 13
million people, or 14 percent of American Internet users of all
ages, are projected as ``freeloaders,'' defined as people who
download music they don't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as disturbing for the big recording companies, only
2 percent of all Internet users have actually paid for music they
have downloaded, said the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``One conclusion you could draw is that Americans love free
stuff,'' said Amanda Lenhart, the main author of the study
conducted by Pew Internet &AMP; American Life Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``But another thing is that Napster in less than a year has
taken one of the major industries (recording) and got it running
scared,'' Lenhart said. ``It's forcing people to think about new
ways of marketing, new ways of selling music.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies by groups like Webnoize and Greenfield Online
have detailed how sweepingly popular Internet music, especially use
of the Napster sharing program, is among college students.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest study by Pew, a nonprofit public policy research
organization sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is the first
to detail what music industry observers already knew from anecdotal
evidence _ that the popularity of downloadable and streaming music
is rapidly cutting across a wide swath of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Pew commissioned a monthlong telephone survey of 2,503 people
during April. Of the total, 1,345 were Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found:
</P>
<P>
   -- 38 percent of all Internet users, about 35 million Americans,
have enjoyed online music, either by downloading files or listening
to songs streamed from Internet radio stations or online services.
Still, the other 62 percent of all Net users have never downloaded
or listened to music online.
</P>
<P>
   -- Internet radio and streaming music files draw a larger
audience, about 15 million, than downloading. And this audience,
which the study calls ``samplers,'' is generally older, with 46
percent between the ages of 30 and 49 and 20 percent over 50.
</P>
<P>
   -- Only 2 percent of Internet users paid for downloadable music,
while another 3 percent downloaded free copies of music they
already owned.
</P>
<P>
   -- About 13 million have downloaded free songs using file
sharing programs like Napster or Gnutella. About half were between
the ages of 18 and 29, but 42 percent were aged 30 to 49, while 9
percent were 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   -- Men (64 percent) were more likely to download songs into
their computers. But more women (52 percent) preferred sampling
songs through Web radio and streaming audio services.
</P>
<P>
   -- Napster users in April offered an average of 100 music files
each. Using the San Mateo company's claim that it has registered 10
million users since August 1999, a number that took America Online
six years to achieve, Pew researchers estimated there were as many
as 1 billion songs available from Napster users.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, major independent
record label TVT Records Inc., and individual artists Dr. Dre and
Metallica have all sued Napster Inc. claiming songs offered by its
users violate federal copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pew study called them ``freeloaders,'' the term is
a contraction of ``free'' and ``downloaders'' and not meant as a
pejorative term, Lenhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in follow up interviews, the Pew researchers found some
freeloaders were still buying CD copies of new songs they
downloaded and enjoyed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to take sides here,'' she said. ``The point
of this report is to get the facts out there to better inform the
debate between the various parties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard E. King, the Los Angeles attorney who represents both Dr.
Dre and Metallica in their suits against Napster, said the Pew
study showed how daunting a task it is control piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard not to hear those numbers and realize how
significant the issue is no matter which side of the issue you're
on,'' King said.

`DUKE OF DEL REY' DEFINED SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE JARES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The L.A. Rams ran off to St. Louis. The L.A.
Chargers long ago charged to San Diego. The L.A. Express expired.
Loyola University dropped football and renamed itself Loyola
Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Los Angeles had a dapper, congenial, intelligent
reminder of those days and teams in the person of Don Klosterman.
</P>
<P>
   Until late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man nicknamed ``The Duke of Del Rey'' for his Loyola
quarterbacking exploits died at age 70, a few weeks after
undergoing triple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best, the bravest man I know,'' said L.A.
advertising executive Dennis Holt. ``Scores and scores of people
considered him their best friend. I can picture him holding court
at the 'A' table at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel, but
he was deeper than that. Just a week or so ago he helped me get a
poor kid a two-thirds scholarship to Loyola.''
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman was best known as a pro football general manager. In
that role, he was summed up nicely by writer Dan Jenkins in Sports
Illustrated:
</P>
<P>
   ``... the most visible, capable and popular of general managers,
who seems to have been born to speak fluent Grambling, to date
lovely ladies, to know most of the world's maitre d's and to build
football winners for rich guys....''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for K.S. ``Bud'' Adams (Houston Oilers), Carroll
Rosenbloom and later his widow, Georgia Frontiere (L.A. Rams),
Barron Hilton (L.A. Chargers), Bill Oldenburg (L.A. Express of the
USFL) and Lamar Hunt (Kansas City Chiefs). Everywhere he earned
respect.
</P>
<P>
   In 22 of his 25 years in the pro game, the team for which he
worked made the playoffs. Perhaps the peak was the Baltimore Colts
team that won Super Bowl V.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Rams had an excellent draft,'' Chiefs coach Hank
Stram said in 1981. ``But then any time Don Klosterman has anything
to do with selecting players, it is bound to turn out well.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-time sports fans might prefer to remember Klosterman the
athlete, the relatively small (5-foot-11, 180) quarterback out of
Compton High (one of 15 children) who was turned down by Notre Dame
and ended up at little Loyola, on the cliffs overlooking Marina del
Rey.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great break for Loyola and its coach, Jordan Olivar, in
an era when small colleges in California fielded excellent football
teams, led by such athletes as Ollie Matson and Gino Marchetti at
USF and Eddie LeBaron and Dick Bass at Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions went 8-1 in 1950, the only loss coming to Santa Clara,
which went on to beat Kentucky in the Orange Bowl. That year, the
Duke of Del Rey completed 26 passes for 355 yards against Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Against Florida in his senior year, 1951, he completed 33 passes
for 372 yards. He finished with eight NCAA passing records
(including most passes attempted and completed in a single game,
single season and career), all since broken.
</P>
<P>
   After the 35-33 victory over Pacific in 1951, a local
sportswriter rhapsodized:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Klosterman, the confident and capable field general of
the Lions who scaled the heights of greatness last night, pulling
the team behind him in the rugged uphill struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   His days as a pro quarterback were not so glorious. He was the
first-round pick of the Cleveland Browns but was traded to the
Dallas Texans and then the L.A. Rams, where he was stuck behind two
Hall of Famers, Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin, in 1952. He
spent two years in the Air Force, then played for the Calgary
Stampeders in the CFL.
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day 1957, he suffered a broken back in a ski
accident near Banff and was told by one doctor that he'd never walk
again. But after eight operations, a year in the hospital and 18
months of recuperation, he did. He even danced.
</P>
<P>
   After a short time in insurance (with his old coach, Olivar), he
got into pro football administration with the Chargers. Among his
many feats in his executive years: signing quarterback Steve Young
for the Express.
</P>
<P>
   The USFL was a flop, but Klosterman had other good moments apart
from the Young signing. Handling owner Bill Oldenburg was perhaps
the toughest chore. After a horrible game in Denver, Oldenburg was
ready to fire the coach, John Hadl.
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman, used to the ``rich guys'' referred to by Jenkins,
sat down with his upstart, impatient owner:
</P>
<P>
   `` `Well,' the GM recalled saying, `we have a rookie team, a
rookie coach and a rookie owner. The resolution of the problem is
that you should take a six-week Valium. Come back and your team'll
be in good shape.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me and said, 'OK.' He took off and made his
plane, and he didn't come back to see us in a game for six weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman almost always could make such a tricky situation turn
out well. His disposition was naturally sunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in serious financial trouble, he never gave it
away,'' said his friend, Holt. ``Most of us would show it. With him
there never was a furrowed brow.''

 JUSTICE OPENS DOOR TO MICROSOFT SETTLEMENT  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the dust settled on a court order to split
Microsoft, the Justice Department indicated a willingness to
rekindle settlement talks, while the company _ and an outside study
_ affirmed a breakup would cause ``grievous'' harm to millions of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``is prepared to engage in meaningful settlement
negotiations'' to avoid a potentially lengthy appeals process
sparked by Wednesday's ruling, Joel I. Klein, head of the U.S.
Justice Department's antitrust division, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have to agree not ``to abuse its monopoly
power,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   But an unbowed Microsoft greeted Klein's comments with more than
a little skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Klein is posturing,'' company spokesman Jim Cullinan said
in an interview. ``We'd always be interested in reaching a fair and
reasonable settlement. But it's become clear from the behavior of
the government that they're bent on breaking this company up
regardless of the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of an accord was touched off by recent comments from U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge overseeing the
case. Last fall the judge prodded the two sides to settle and in
his ruling Wednesday he revisited the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The two-way split ``is perhaps more radical than might have
resulted had mediation been successful and terminated in a consent
decree,'' the judge wrote in an opinion that accompanied the
breakup order. The order, essentially the same plan proposed by the
Justice Department and 17 states suing the company, calls for
dividing Microsoft down the middle. One firm would develop the
various Windows operating systems, and the other would control
everything else including Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, MSN
and cable network MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which Microsoft immediately vowed to appeal, is
intended as a remedy to the software giant's antitrust violations.
On April 3, Jackson ruled in the government's favor, saying the
company illegally wielded its operating systems monopoly in an
effort to crush competitors. That, in turn, quashed innovation in
the software industry and hurt consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has insisted throughout the two-year antitrust trial
that it does not maintain a monopoly and has done nothing illegal.
Yesterday the company asked Jackson's decree be set aside until its
appeal is heard. The company is confident the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia, which sided with the software giant
in an earlier case, will overturn Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Although the D.C. court is next in line to hear the case, the
Department of Justice is seeking an expedited review by the U.S.
Supreme Court. The justices are not expected to decide whether to
hear the case for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analysts are divided on whether the high court will take
the case. Many believe it will want to read the opinion of the
appellate court first, since that court has experience with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's final ruling ``will inflict grievous and irreparable
harm on Microsoft, its 35,000 employees, its millions of
shareholders, its thousands of business partners and the tens of
millions of consumers around the world who rely on Microsoft's
products,'' Microsoft wrote in its request to stay the judge's
order.
</P>
<P>
   A report by an independent market research firm in Boston
apparently bolstered that contention _ at least on the financial
side.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Aberdeen Group, a Microsoft breakup would cost
businesses and consumers $43 billion over the 10-year duration of
the order. Businesses would pay an additional $20 billion to
integrate software from other vendors into their organizations. And
consumers would lose two ways: higher software prices or eroded
shareholder value if the two Microsofts experience lower profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see no proof that a breakup will benefit consumers or
(technology) buyers or level the competitive playing field,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions fly in the face of the goals of the
government's remedy _ increasing competition which would, in turn,
spark more choices in the software marketplace and lower prices _
and seems to support Microsoft's position that the fallout would be
wide-ranging and detrimental to both businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is much debate over whether innovation will
flourish or whether consumers will pay less for software.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Aberdeen advocated Instead, a court-appointed panel of
business, technology and legal experts to advise the Redmond,
Wash., company on anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan wouldn't comment on Aberdeen's conclusions but said the
company offered as witnesses economists, partners and its own
executives to testify about the impacts of a court-mandated
breakup. Jackson rejected that motion.
</P>
<P>
   But even he has indicated dissatisfaction with a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Washington Post, Jackson encouraged
both sides to ``swallow their own reluctance to compromise and
reach a remedy that both sides, if not elated by, nevertheless are
willing to extend.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had appointed a federal mediator to oversee talks
between the two sides in November. Those talks broke down in early
April, prompting Jackson's scathing ``conclusions of law.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would be ``in the interests of the industry (and)
it is in the interests of the company,'' as well as the nation,
Klein said at a Justice Department briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Klein declined to say whether the government would accept a
settlement that did not include a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say there's no procedural reason why the two sides
couldn't sit down together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technically, they could settle the case at any time _
tomorrow, next week, next month or next year,'' said Rich Gray, a
Silicon Valley anititrust attorney.
</P>
<P>
   However, most say the case will most likely move to another
courtroom rather than the settlement table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always surprises,'' said Richard Gilbert, a
University of California at Berkeley economics professor and former
chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division.
``But Microsoft has a lot to gain by going through the appeals
process and not much to lose. Plus, it's unlikely the government
would settle with terms that Microsoft would find acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has signaled willingness to some restrictions on its
behavior _ though not the ones spelled out in the remedy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the structural facet, Jackson's plan includes
strict curbs on the way the company conducts business. As soon as
September, Microsoft would have to release some of the Windows
``source code'' to software developers; in addition the company
would be prohibited from discriminatory pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is seeking to have those measures delayed until the
appeals process runs its course, which could take a year or more.

 REPORT SAYS CHILDREN ENCOUNTER PORNOGRAPHY ONLINE   &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Children, especially teens, stand a one in five
chance they will be solicited for cybersex or receive other risque
invitations while online, according to a first-of-its-kind study.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents ranged from a suggestive comment in an online chat
room _ such as a 13-year-old girl who was asked her bra size _ to
children being aggressively pursued by strangers who wanted to meet
them for sex in the real world. None of the children surveyed
agreed to meet with the propositioners offline, although hundreds
of cases have been investigated by law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent and your child is using the Internet, it is
very likely that your child has been solicited for activity of a
sexual manner. That's a startling piece of information for
parents,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee, which funded the study through a grant
to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come at a time when an increasing number of
children are using the Internet. A separate study, released
Wednesday by San Mateo, Calif.'s Grunwald Associates, showed that
the number of U.S. children online has tripled in the past three
years to more than 25 million. The number is expected to increase
by another 70 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional study, the first scientific examination of
risks to children online, also found that 1 in 4 children
encountered pornographic pictures while researching homework topics
or checking their e-mail. Of the 1,500 children, ages 10 to 17,
surveyed in the study, teenage girls were most likely to be victims
of sexual approaches, while teenage boys were most likely to
accidentally come across porn.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Quiet About Incidents
</P>
<P>
   Few of the children had reported the incidents to authorities.
In fact, the majority of children and their parents said they did
not know to whom they should report such incidents. Only a quarter
of children told their parents about sexual approaches, while 40
percent told their parents about accidentally seeing pornographic
images.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the missing children center, Ernest Allen, said a
big surprise was the profile of the typical sexual solicitor:
another teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There tends to be a stereotype about who the person is _ the
dirty old man syndrome. Fully one-half of the solicitors for sex
are other kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although parents probably will by surprised by the results, they
should not keep their children off the Internet, said the study's
author, David Finkelhor, a University of New Hampshire sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that our findings do anything to undermine
people's sense that the Internet has tremendous educational
possibilities for young people, and access to it and involvement in
it is an important part of citizenship in today's world,''
Finkelhor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that Congress outlaw all online activities
that would be illegal in the physical world, such as propositioning
children or giving them access to pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Although most children were unfazed by the incidents, a quarter
reported being very distressed. Finkelhor said school counselors
and other professionals need to learn how to help children who have
such encounters, and he called for more study of the psychological
effect that unwanted exposure to pornography has on children, a
field about which little is known.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling Upon Porn
</P>
<P>
   Children said they came across pornography on the Internet in
several ways. One girl ended up at an X-rated site when when she
misspelled the name of a popular teen magazine; a 15-year-old boy
turned up surprising results when he searched for information about
his parents' Ford Escort.
</P>
<P>
   Parry Aftab, head of CyberAngels, a children's online safety
group, announced Thursday that the group would soon begin ferreting
out and reporting porn sites that purposely mislead users,
especially those that target children by using words such as
``Pokemon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Paschke, a San Francisco parent who did not participate
in the study, said she was not surprised by the findings because
her 12-year-old son had encountered ``gross'' porn sites at school
while using the Internet to research ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I find really disturbing is that roughly half the
kids didn't tell anyone,'' Paschke said.
</P>
<P>
   Like two-thirds of the parents surveyed, Paschke does not use
filtering software at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know too much about those programs,'' Paschke said.
She also had doubts the effectiveness of the software, which blocks
access to sites with sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not support or criticize using filtering software,
but the results are likely to heighten the debate over whether it
is appropriate to use such software in public libraries and
schools. Critics _ including the American Civil Liberties Union _
say that filtering the Internet is akin to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this will bring this issue out more, and hopefully it
will affect all the things we are trying to do,'' said Monique
Nelson, chief financial officer of Enough Is Enough, a Santa Ana,
Calif., group that advocates installing filtering software on
library computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study showed that most incidents happened at home;
only 3 percent of porn and solicitation encounters occurred at
libraries.

Nation's Youth'' can be found at  &LR; www.unh.edu/ccrc &LR; .

 CHILD CARE PROVIDERS CONSIDER JOINING UNION  &HT;     By JEFF ST. JOHN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's tough to find good, qualified child care
workers. Just ask Rosemary Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, she has run her child care service,
Rosie's Little School, from her home in San Francisco's Stonestown
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A licensed family child care provider, she cares for seven
children - two toddlers and five preschoolers - 12 hours a day,
five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Kennedy has been looking for a
full-time worker to augment her mostly part-time, three-person
staff. Offering $9 an hour, a higher-than-average wage, she has
advertised through the newspapers, San Francisco State University
and City College job hotlines, and by word of mouth _ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always students available,'' said Kennedy, ``but
it's impossible to find somebody for full-time, consistent, every
day, all-day care because of the low pay.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a persistent problem for child care providers because
many of them are women of color or recent immigrants, who are
struggling to make ends meet and increasingly leaving these jobs
for those offering higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of quality, affordable child care is an
enormous problem in every county of the Bay Area. It's bad enough
statewide, but it is worse in the Bay Area because of the high cost
of living,'' said Patricia Siegel, president of the California
Child Care Resource and Referral Network in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a new element in the equation. Labor unions have
expressed interest in organizing child care workers in an effort to
improve their wages, benefits and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a national crisis in child care,'' said Margaret
Brodkin, executive director of San Francisco nonprofit Coleman
Advocates for Youth and Children. ``It's reached a point where
child care workers are making less than parking lot attendants and
where one-third of the workers are leaving the field every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Kennedy has gone to the San Francisco
Child Care Organizing Roundtable, searching for answers. The
Roundtable is a child care union forum hosted by Coleman Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month for the past eight months, the Roundtable has
brought child care providers together with representatives from the
American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and United Educators of San
Francisco (UESF), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU),
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees' Union and others.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking for a common solution to a shared crisis: the
lack of quality, affordable child care in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1999 report by the California Child Care Resource
and Referral Network, a child care worker in San Francisco earns on
the average $16,140 a year. With wages like this, it's not
surprising that about a third of all child care workers leave the
job every year, a turnover rate that takes its toll on the
availability and quality of child care for all families.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a year of infant child care in San Francisco
costs an average of $6,407 a year _ or more than half the annual
income of a minimum-wage earner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is a long list of low-income families seeking
state child care subsidies. On top of that, there aren't enough
licensed child care providers that qualify for the state program.
As a result, an estimated 58,961 children in San Francisco, or 68
percent of those who need it, are not receiving licensed child
care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kennedy, child care providers are desperate to
resolve the crisis, even if it means taking a step into what is,
for most of them, the unknown world of union organizing.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, unions are interested in establishing
collective bargaining rights for child care workers that will lead
to better pay and benefits. The situation is sensitive, though,
because any improvement in the compensation package will ultimately
result in higher child care rates for working parents. Child care
providers are also worried that the entry of unions could lead to a
loss of control over personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest,'' Kennedy said, ``but everyone
wants to move slowly and carefully, because this is not a
traditional adversarial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Netsy Firestein, director of the University of California at
Berkeley's Labor Project for Working Families, has been working
with groups like the Roundtable from cities across the country. She
pointed out the difficulty of organizing a workforce in a field
where little additional money is available to enhance wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In child care, you can't go to your employer and ask for more
money,` Firestein said, ``because that money comes from paying
parents, who can't afford child care as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sheila Norman, director and owner of the Candlelight Child
Development Center in San Francisco's Outer Mission, this
overriding concern made her leery of union organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wearing two hats,'' Norman said. ``One is as an underpaid
and undercompensated child care provider, and the other is as a
small-business owner with employees who don't make enough either.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Norman said, she was worried that unions'
``outspoken'' way of approaching labor-management issues would
clash with the ``quiet, gentle'' manners of most child care center
directors.
</P>
<P>
   But after attending a few Roundtable meetings, she has come down
on the side of the unions. ``I think the profession would truly
benefit from organizing efforts,'' she said. ``It would help to
professionalize and legitimize the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the Roundtable is to find models for how this
might be accomplished. Last September, Seattle child care center
director Mike Kspirzak came to San Francisco to offer one..
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Kspirzak's Interlake Child Care and Learning
Center became the first in Seattle to recognize SEIU Local 925 as
the bargaining representative for its employees. Since then, Local
925 has signed contracts with 12 Seattle nonprofit child care
centers, representing more than 150 child care teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts resulted in a union pension plan for the teachers,
as well as a marked decrease in teacher turnover. Kspirzak said he
has not lost an employee since he signed the final contract six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that he didn't have initial concerns,
however.``I talked at some length about all the reasons why people
felt nervous about the process,'' Kspirzak said. ``The overriding
concern of the directors, as I saw it, was loss of control over
hiring and firing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, ``For the teachers, the overriding
interest was that they would be listened to and acknowledged as
partners in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Gibson, a key organizer for Local 925 in Seattle, said
her union brought teachers and center directors together to
negotiate a contract that took in the concerns of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't bargain with wages, or anything that has to do
with money,'' Gibson said. ``The standards we created were
lower-end programs. We didn't want to raise the bar too high.''
</P>
<P>
   The process worked, she said, because child care labor and
management had the same interests at heart: the children.
</P>
<P>
   For child care workers who belong to unions in San Francisco,
the benefits are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 600 or so child care workers employed in the San
Francisco Unified School District's Child Development Centers.
</P>
<P>
   These teachers and aides are members of the UESF, part of the
nationwide AFT. CDC teachers can earn up to $28,000 a year,
significantly higher than the average child care teacher's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Atkinson, the AFT representative at the Roundtable, said
that UESF President Kent Mitchell has expressed interest in
organizing accredited child care teachers working in private
centers.
</P>
<P>
   However, part of the problem with using UESF model of organizing
other child care providers is the fact that UESF was able to win
its benefits through negotiations with a clear bargaining partner:
the school district and the San Francisco Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   For family child care providers, who work out of their homes and
are paid by parents through myriad government subsidy programs, the
issue of whom to bargain with, or against, is less clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, SEIU Local 250 won pay increases for 7,000
home care workers in San Francisco. But that agreement came about
only after the various state and county agencies with a hand in
childcare subsidies and referral services agreed to create an ad
hoc entity to take on the role of employer in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is nothing today in the way of a central bargaining
authority with the clout to represent the interests of the
employers and the various government programs involved in child
care services.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is no stranger to this problem. For the last three years
she has served as president of the San Francisco Family Child Care
Providers' Association, a grassroots organization representing 135
of the estimated 600 family child care providers in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping its members abreast of the ever-changing regulations
and applicable funding opportunities, the association has provided
a network for professionals with few other means of seeking out
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the unions are trying to show child care workers that
working together can make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundtable likes to point out the successful cooperative
effort between unions and child care workers in San Francisco
earlier this year. That's when Coleman Advocates brought UESF
members and child care providers together to defeat Proposition 28,
which would have repealed last year's tobacco-tax measure
Proposition 10.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco County has used its Prop 10 funds to implement the
CARES program, which will provide $1.15 million in subsidies for
child care providers this year.

NET WORTH: APPRAISERS SCRAMBLE TO KEEP UP WITH FAST-MOVING
HOME  PRICES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you offer $100,000 or more over the asking
price for a home in the Bay Area, your friends, neighbors and
Midwestern relatives might think you've lost your mind, but your
appraiser probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the real estate market was at its most insane a few
months ago, very few houses failed to appraise for the purchase
price.
</P>
<P>
   Just as home buyers are having to stretch to buy a house,
appraisers are having to stretch to justify the prices buyers are
willing to pay. And although home buyers are happy when their deals
go through, some wonder why they had to pay $300 or more for an
appraisal if it's just a rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Alfonso Acampora put in a winning $660,000 offer
for a house in the Oakland hills that was listed at $499,000. He
had already lost multiple-bidding wars on several other homes, and
was worried about losing this one if the appraisal came in below
the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not appraised, I would have had to walk way from it
because I put down everything I had to get into it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So he was pleasantly surprised when the appraisal came in at
$669,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before approving a mortgage, lenders require appraisals to
protect their investment and to make the loan eligible for sale to
institutions in the secondary market. Most won't finance more than
a certain amount _ usually 10 or 20 percent _ of the appraised
value.
</P>
<P>
   If the home appraises for less than the purchase price, the
buyer has to increase the down payment and/or persuade the seller
to lower the price. If that doesn't work, the buyer might try for a
loan with a lower down payment and higher monthly payments, for
which he may or may not qualify and that may require private
mortgage insurance. If that fails, the deal may fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although nobody publishes statistics on this, Bay Area real
estate agents, mortgage brokers and appraisers say they've seen no
increase in the percentage of homes that fail to appraise for the
purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not experienced any problems whatsoever with
appraisals,'' says Ric Rocchiccioli, president-elect of the San
Francisco Association of Realtors. ``And I don't think I've heard
horror stories'' from other brokers, even though more than 75
percent of homes sold in San Francisco in the past six months have
gone for more than asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really not been a problem,'' says Rich Brown, a
spokesman for Bank of America mortgage. He would not say what
percentage of appraisals fall below the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in 13 deals in past year. All except one came
in at the asking price,'' says Christopher Needham, a broker in San
Francisco. In that case, the appraisal was $200,000 short of the
$2.6 million purchase price, but the deal went through because the
buyer was paying cash and only got an appraisal because he might
get a loan in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't more homes fail the appraisal test?
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the purchase price may not be as inflated as it
looks because real estate agents are ``purposely underpricing''
homes to incite a bidding war, says Marcia Larrsonan appraiser in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason is that appraisers are becoming more
creative and flexible.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with a value for a home, appraisers look at a handful
of comparable houses in the neighborhood that have sold recently,
then adjust for differences in square footage, number of rooms, lot
size and squishier features such as character and views.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal market, they look at comparable sales in the last
six months or even a year. But in a rapidly escalating market,
``most of the comps we're using are in the last month,'' says Bob
Singer, owner of Trac, an appraisal firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since it's hard to find similar homes in the same neighborhood
that have sold in the past month, some appraisers are using homes
that are still in escrow or new on the market. They're also looking
in adjacent neighborhoods or clear across town.
</P>
<P>
   When appraisers still can't get a house to measure up, they
might add a ``time adjustment factor'' of 1 or 2 percent a month.
``If a comparable house sold for $100,000 six months ago, you might
say it would have sold for $106,000 now,'' says Larrson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of stuff that usually we hadn't done in
the past to get to the sales price,'' says an in-house appraiser
for one of the Bay Area's largest thrifts. ``We've had to put out a
lot of phone calls to Realtors for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Realtors are happy to help out the appraiser with comps he
wasn't aware of or a list of the multiple bids on a house.
</P>
<P>
   Rocchiccioli says one appraiser told him he wrote an
``addendum'' to an appraisal saying the $38,500 difference between
his value and the purchase price ``would be made up in the next
three months by appreciation in the market. The lender bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   David Faudman, a real estate broker in Marin, says appraisals
are really just a ``disaster check'' for the lenders. ``I would not
look at an appraiser's report as a validation of the price.''
</P>
<P>
   The best appraiser, he says, ``is a buyer with a substantial
down payment who has been looking for a long time. The second best
is a real estate agent who has been working with a lot of buyers.
The third best is the appraiser. The worst is the seller. They want
you to look at their closet organizer. They say, `I spent $5,000 on
this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many big lenders have in-house appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   Others' appraisers are independent, and usually work closely
with a handful of agents and mortgage brokers who all have a vested
interest in getting deals done. ``They (appraisers) know if they
miss too many appraisals, they just put themselves out of business.
(A real estate agent) can put a certain amount of pressure on the
appraiser.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, in-house appraisers don't seem to be any tougher
than independent ones.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean every house appraises at the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   In fast-moving markets, tract homes and condominiums sometimes
fall short. ``Condos are cookie cutters. It's hard to fiddle with
the appraisal,'' says Evelyn Walker, an East Bay real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, one of Walker's clients, Peggy McGuire, offered
$295,000 for a three-bedroom condominium in Rockridge. An identical
unit had just sold for the same price, but there was another bidder
so she increased her offer to $310,000.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire says she was disappointed when her unit appraised at
$295,000, but at her agent's urging she had put down 30 percent of
the purchase price, so the deal went through.
</P>
<P>
   Walker says that ``anytime you put down 30 percent or more
you're pretty safe'' because most lenders will finance up to 80
percent of the value.
</P>
<P>
   Appraisal problems also crop up when buyers who are priced out
of one neighborhood suddenly ``discover'' a new neighborhood and
start offering prices that are substantially higher than the going
price in that area. The first few houses that get these abnormally
high offers sometimes won't appraise for the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, this is happening in upper Peninsula. ``All of a
sudden, it is a desirable neighborhood'' for people who can't
afford San Francisco or the Midpeninsula, says Paula Ryan, owner of
Pacific Guarantee Mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   She's had a few houses in Pacifica, Calif., appraise below the
purchase price, mainly because there are relatively few houses in
the coastside city. ``In San Francisco, there are a lot more houses
per square mile to comp out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's company does about 150 to 200 loans a month, and in the
past three or four months she's had three or four houses that
failed to appraise.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, lenders will send someone to review an appraisal by
driving by the home. If the review appraiser is not familiar with
the area, there might be a problem, Ryan says.
</P>
<P>
   When a lender turns down a loan because of an appraisal, ``we
can do a rebuttal, but it's a big, long process and really messes
up the deal,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders, particularly those that loan to people with
splotchy credit records, are more stringent that others, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his institution bothers with appraisals, BofA's Brown
replied, ``It is appropriate due diligence.'' He says BofA also
needs the appraisal in case it decides to sell the loan on the
secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens if the buyer paid too much and can't make his
payments?
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Chaney, a banking analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co., explains
that banks and insurance companies ``are purchasing millions of
these kinds of loans. If somebody in San Francisco goes into
default because they paid $100,000 too much for a house,'' it might
be devastating for an individual, but it will be a blip for a big
financial institution.

 SCHWAB TO SELL BONDS ON INTERNET  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Charles Schwab Corp. gave a push to the online
bond-trading market Thursday, announcing that it is joining forces
with an Internet startup to set up an electronic network for
trading fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between the No. 1 online broker and ValuBond of
Atlanta, which trades bonds through the Web, will permit Schwab
customers to link directly with wholesale dealers to buy muncipal,
corporate and government bonds at posted prices. Officials of the
two companies said they expect to begin the new service in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab said it chose ValuBond as a partner because it operates
an electronic linking system that lets customers see what bonds an
array of wholesale brokers are selling in different categories and
buy directly from them. ValuBond charges brokers a flat fee when a
sale takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The company's technology is similar to the systems that are
shaking up the stock market by giving retail investors peeks at the
prices wholesale brokers are quoting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a neutral hub through which retail investors can see a
broad variety`` of securities, said ValuBond Chief Executive John
Pigott.
</P>
<P>
   Other online bond companies don't connect investors with
wholesale dealers. Instead, they sell securities from their own
inventory at a markup.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's deal with ValuBond is the latest development in the
growing movement of bond sales online.
</P>
<P>
   Many online brokers, including Schwab and second-ranking
E-Trade, already allow customers to buy bonds over the Internet.
But online bond sales has lagged stock trading. That's because only
a few thousand stocks are traded on public markets in the United
States. By contrast, hundreds of thousands of bond issues are
circulating and designing a system to keep track of the market is
tough.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bond-trading process typically isn't automated
once a customer clicks in an order. A human broker often has to
step in to process the trade, sometimes telephoning wholesale
dealers to complete a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Online or offline, customers typically don't know what
commission they are paying their broker to buy bonds. The broker's
profit is embedded in the price it charges the client for the
security.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, a handful of brash Internet startups have
begun to automate the bond-trading process, fueling the growth of
the market. ``In the last six months, about a dozen different
electronic platforms have emerged,'' said Richard Meister, chief
executive of Walnut Creek, Calif.'s eBondTrade.com, one of the new
players in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Inking a deal with Schwab gives ValuBond an enormous boost in
its competition with other Internet rivals. Pigott said the company
expects to announce partnerships with other retail and
institutional brokerages in the months ahead.

   A Complex Film in a Plain Wrap
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted this movie to be wrapped in brown paper, like
pornography,'' David Fincher said. This week Fox released his film
``Fight Club'' on DVD in a slipcase illustrated to look like a
wrapper tied with twine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it with the VHS box,'' he said, ``but we gave that up
to get the DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, a desensitized
young insomniac (Edward Norton) calls on a primal aspect of
himself, personified by an anarchic '60s-style radical named Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), to help reclaim his masculinity by breaking
down and coming back together. Part of the process takes place in a
club, started by the two of them, where depressed, threatened young
men gather to work out their rage and feelings of inferiority by
beating one another bloody.
</P>
<P>
   When the movie was released last fall, preconceived notions of
violence turned off many filmgoers, as did negative reports of
Durden's strutting nihilism. Generally, though, reviews noted the
movie's wit and subtle complexity. ``This film twists and turns in
ways that only add up fully on the way out of the theater and might
just require another viewing,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Her thought makes a blurb on the back of the DVD box, but
Fincher said that while he appreciates viewers taking another look
on video, the film got its due in theaters. ``It's the kind of
movie that's going to divide people,'' he said. ``You don't read
the book and say here's a mainstream fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD, he added, is essentially for preservation. ``I don't know
if the film will have another life on DVD, but it will be the
record that lasts the longest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film comes on two discs in an elaborately designed package
that opens like a book. The first disc contains the film in the
wide-screen, letter-box format and four separate movie-length
commentaries by Fincher, the stars and various others involved,
including Palahnuik and the screenwriter, Jim Uhls.
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``Seven,'' another violent and controversial
film starring Pitt that underwent frequently favorable second
thoughts after its theater run in 1995, Fincher is also known for
lightning-fast visuals and computer-generated manipulations. The
technical aspects work best on disc. ``I'm much happier having a
wide-screen DVD out there than simply a panned-and-scanned DVD,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second disc has extended scenes of the film being made.
``They must have been thinking about DVD or some sort of
after-market,'' said David Pryor, a designer and producer of DVD's
who made these discs.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher said that there were no such thoughts at the time, but
he came to appreciate the wealth of material later.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it was shot from multiple angles. ``I wanted to use as
much of that behind-the-scenes stuff as possible,'' Pryor said.
</P>
<P>
   Is all of this, not to mention the hours of commentary, too
much? ``Nobody is forced to look at it,'' he said. ``It's such a
dense movie, the more perspectives you can get the better.''
</P>

A fastidious, compassionate man with a painful bladder infection,
Edgecomb runs an orderly operation until the arrival of John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), an enormous man convicted of rape and
murder. Coffey seems as gentle as his crimes are heinous, and he is
possessed with an inner power to cure maladies. Could he have
committed such crimes? Adapted from Stephen King's novel, Frank
Darabont's film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``boils
down to a well-populated drama with a relatively simple story, one
that could have been told with more economy and fewer talky bits.''

machine up as a clockmaker. But Andrew longs to be a human and
generations later, when robots possess the emotions to fall in
love, he envisions marriage to his former employer's great
granddaughter (Embeth Davidtz). Free to employ all of Williams'
moist, sad-clown expressions, Chris Columbus' film ``pours on the

sex and the meaning of life'' (Stephen Holden).

associated with Helen O'Regan (Barbara Sukowa), an immigrant woman
who is being considered for canonization. Delving into her life,
Father Shore develops a strong attraction for her daughter, Roxanna

flashy telekinetic mayhem typical of the religious genre, Agnieszka
Holland's film nevertheless ``becomes bogged down in fussy
theological arguments'' (Holden).

Needing transportation, they are driven across the desert by Grace
(Lolita Davidovich), who was Vince's lover and is about to break up
with Cesar. Both fighters have blown big chances and their case
histories are hashed over perhaps too thoroughly during the trip.
Their fight, a slugfest with flashbacks and hallucinations,
resolves little in a film that ``ends up stranded in serio-comic
limbo'' (Holden).

STATE APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS TEXAS SODOMY LAW &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An appeals court declared Texas' homosexual conduct
law unconstitutional Thursday and threw out the convictions of two
gay men arrested in 1998 for engaging in sex acts that are legal
for heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 14th Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that
the law banning anal and oral sex between homosexuals violates the
Equal Rights Amendment of the state's constitution by singling out
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing to happen since the repeal of the
old sodomy statute in 1973,'' said Houston gay activist Ray Hill.
``It's certainly going to liven up Gay Pride Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. said his
office will appeal, probably directly to the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this is to me is a backdoor run at trying to get the
judiciary to decide that mores have changed to the extent that we
ought not to have this law,'' said Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   He said legislators should make such decisions, but that rulings
like this give them a way ``out from under a controversial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for John Geddes Lawrence, 57, and Tyrone Garner, 33,
celebrated the decision and said they welcome the chance to argue
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is plainly unconstitutional. We're happy to see it
struck down here,'' said Suzanne Goldberg, a lawyer with the Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., a gay rights group that
represented the men. ``If we need to go further, we would certainly
do that. The arguments do not change. There is absolutely no
legitimate government interest in policing the bedrooms of adults
simply because those adults are of the same sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the decision is significant, it technically applies only
to the 14th Court of Appeals jurisdiction until the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals rules on it, said local appellate attorney Brian
Wice. The state's 13 other appellate courts can rule any way they
wish on the issue until then.
</P>
<P>
   Wice said the case has always been destined to end up in the
state's highest court, but it doesn't hurt that the majority's
opinion was well-written and based on legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is that it's bulletproof,'' Wice said. ``They cut to
the chase, their reasoning is compelling and they shot more holes
in the dissenting opinion than the feds put in John Dillinger.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, acting on another man's false tip of an armed
intruder, Harris County Sheriff's deputies entered Lawrence's home
and saw the men engaged in sex acts. They were arrested on charges
of ``deviant homosexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   They pleaded no contest so they could challenge the law on
appeal, the first to come out of a state criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   In November, their lawyers argued before the 14th appellate
court panel, saying the law violates privacy rights and is
unconstitutional because it ``criminalizes'' homosexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Because the law singles out homosexuals, it violates equal
protection clauses in the U.S. and Texas Constitutions, they
argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Harris County District Attorney Bill Delmore said
nothing in the federal or state constitutions sanctions homosexual
acts and since they have always been deemed inappropriate by Texas
law, then enforcing the law does not violate privacy.
</P>
<P>
   If moral standards change, he argued, the Legislature is the
place to change the law, not the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he said, the law does not single out gays, because it
also applies to bisexuals or heterosexuals who engage in homosexual
acts.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the panel, John S. Anderson and Chief Justice
Paul Murphy, who are Republicans, sided with Garner and Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Their ruling was based solely on the arguments that the law
violated the state's Equal Rights Amendment. They did not address
privacy issues or federal rights, which were also argued in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, written by Anderson, says the problem with the
state's law can be traced back to 1973, when the Legislature
abandoned a 114-year-old sodomy law banning certain sex acts
between all people and adopted the new law, which banned them only
for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   That created two standards, Anderson wrote, and conflicts with
the state Equal Rights Amendment because it equates to sex-based
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wrote that the law can allow sex-based discrimination
when there is no other way to protect the state's interest, but
that Delmore couldn't begin to frame an argument that there was a
compelling state interest.
</P>
<P>
   As for the argument that the law served a legitimate public
purpose because it enforces conventional principles of morality,
Anderson said: ``It is not enough for the state to say it has an
important interest furthered by the discriminatory law because even
the loftiest goal does not justify sex-based discrimination in
light of the ERA's clear prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Justice J. Harvey Hudson, also a Republican, echoed
Delmore. He said the law doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex
because it's applicable to men and women who engage in homosexual
acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``More importantly, the history of the Texas Equal Rights
Amendment suggests the people of this state intended to grant to
women the same rights as those already enjoyed by men, not to
abolish criminal sanctions imposed for homosexual conduct,'' Hudson
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson also said that despite the ``modern trend'' to
``decriminalize'' all forms of consensual sexual conduct, the issue
is best handled by legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a court, we must presume that the Legislature has correctly
assessed the moral repugnance of activities it has chosen to
penalize with criminal sanctions,'' Hudson wrote. ``Accordingly, we
must assume for the purposes of analysis that homosexual conduct is
morally reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Katine, a Houston lawyer who helped represent Lawrence
and Garner, said if Hudson believes that women were granted equal
rights by the Texas constitution then those rights would apply to
lesbians, who could be prosecuted under the conduct law.
</P>
<P>
   Katine said Hudson seems to dismiss the fact that laws can be
challenged on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes and Harris County Republican Party Chairman Gary Polland
had a different view. Each said Hudson's argument was sound and
based on the law.
</P>
<P>
   Both also said they were a bit surprised that the majority used
the Equal Rights Amendment to overturn the law, because they felt
the privacy argument was more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Polland said, ``The place to debate this is the
Legislature, not the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The courts have been the battleground in other states, where
``sodomy laws'' have been struck down in Tennessee, Georgia,
Louisiana and Montana based on privacy issues. Similar laws in
Kentucky and Maryland were stricken based on equal-protection
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The law in Texas was rarely enforced. Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Kansas still have laws outlawing homosexual behavior. Twelve states
ban certain sex acts between same and different-sex partners.

SURPRISING TROJANS HAVE GOOD TIMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's starting left fielder served as a team
manager when the Trojans played in the College World Series two
years ago. The team's most talented pitcher was attending classes
at Vanderbilt a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The center fielder and designated hitter are walk-ons, who were
not recruited out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   USC might have more baseball national championships (12) than
any other school, but almost no one could have predicted this
year's team would reach the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive that any of the teams we've played,'' USC coach
Mike Gillespie said ``even now, are saying `How are those guys
doing that?' If you go back to September, you couldn't expect
this.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be a shortage of marquee players, but that hasn't
stopped the Trojans (43-18) from reaching the College World Series
as one of the hottest teams in the nation, winners of 15 straight
games entering Saturday's opener against Florida State in Omaha,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   No one would confuse this USC team with the 1998 national
championship team that featured first-round draft picks like
catcher Eric Munson and pitcher Seth Etherton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more offensive-minded guys in '98,'' said shortstop
Seth Davidson, one of three players left from that team. ``It's
definitely a bunch of guys who have just stepped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, as hot as the Trojans have been, they are not one of
the favorites to win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, we were young and didn't have
publicity,'' pitcher Mark Prior said. ``Right now, people don't
think we can win. We like being underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans have relied on excellent defense, improving pitching
and an overachieving offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best team defense we've had,'' Gillespie said. ``The
truth is, over the course of the year, the defense has been good
and spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also been a case of players performing to their maximum
potential. Left fielder Abel Montanez transferred to USC two years
ago after playing football at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make the baseball team, however, and asked to be a
part of the squad as a team manager, which meant he spent most
games holding a radar gun behind home plate to time pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he appeared in just six games and didn't get a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montanez wasn't even on our first travel squad this year,''
Gillespie said.
</P>
<P>
   But as USC struggled to find a left fielder, Montanez was given
his first career start in a nonconference game against UC Santa
Barbara on April 25. He hit a ball off the top of the center-field
wall, and moved into the starting lineup, where he is hitting .381.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start until the last two weeks of the Pac-10
season,'' Montanez said. ``There's five or six guys that played the
position. Every day, you didn't know what the lineup would look
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had a lot of big-name guys. But there were a lot
of questions in the fall and even during the season because we
didn't have a set lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Montanez is a walk-on, just like starting center fielder Brian
Barre (.285, five home runs) and designated hitter Josh Persell
(.343, 9 HR, 40 RBI), who attended Montclair Prep.
</P>
<P>
   Another walk-on, Ronald Flores, is the little brother of former
USC star pitcher Randy Flores, and has compiled a 6-1 record en
route to becoming the Trojans' top relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a tribute to the personality of the guys who have
walked on, that they are contributing,'' Montanez said. ``We've got
guys who worked hard and are glad they're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching has also received some unforeseen boosts. Prior
(10-6), who pitched for Vanderbilt last season, called USC last
summer and asked if he could transfer. The Trojans' pitching staff,
considered a weakness, suddenly inherited a pitcher who was a
high-school All-American.
</P>
<P>
   USC's No.3 starter, Anthony Reyes (6-6), is a true freshman who
wasn't a heralded member of the current recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our pitching and defense, we can stay in the game with
anybody,'' Prior said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some established players have dramatically improved. Third
baseman Justin Gemoll has hit 18 home runs, after hitting four last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things you just couldn't predict,'' Gillespie
said. ``We didn't have Prior. There's no way we expected the year
we got out of Gemoll, Persell and Barre.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things also happened at the beginning of the season that
gave Gillespie little reason for optimism. Davidson, a pre-season
All-American, was hitting .220 earlier this year, but has gotten
hot the past two months, and is hitting .393 in the postseason with
11 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself slipping,'' Davidson said. ``But I've turned it
on. We've never been about one player. We're a team.''

RETRACING THE MISSTEPS IN MICROSOFT'S DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>

a two-part series)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, Thomas Penfield
Jackson, is certainly no judicial radical. A former Navy officer,
he was an active Republican when Ronald Reagan appointed him to the
federal bench in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His record before the Microsoft case suggested, if anything,
that he was pro-business. In 1987, the federal government sued
General Motors, alleging that its cars had dangerous brake defects.
Jackson sided with the car company, dismissing the government's
evidence as merely ``anecdotal accounts of skidding events.''
</P>
<P>
   So when news reports emerged in late January that government
officials involved in settlement talks in Chicago had proposed a
breakup of Microsoft, Jackson was alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should tell you, I am not at all comfortable with
restructuring the company,'' he said in February, in a rare
audience given by a sitting judge during the course of a trial. ``I
am not sure I am competent to do that. Microsoft is a large and
important company, innovative and admirable in a lot of ways. And
it is an engine for the nation's economy. I just don't think that
is something I want to try to do on my own. I wouldn't know how to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another interview in late May, he sounded very different.
He said Microsoft's recent behavior had helped change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been astounded by some of the statements of Gates and
Ballmer,'' he said, referring to the continuing protestations of
Bill Gates, the company's chairman, and Steven A. Ballmer, the
president, that Microsoft did absolutely nothing wrong. The remarks
that so irked him came after his legal ruling in April that
Microsoft had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws with
its predatory and anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the midst of a growing realization,'' the judge added,
``that with what looks like Microsoft intransigence, a breakup is
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, he ordered just that: a plan to split
Microsoft into two separate companies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jackson's thinking has evolved, so have the views of
many others in government and industry who watched the case. In
interviews with The New York Times over the past several months,
dozens of the state and federal officials who have investigated and
prosecuted Microsoft for the last four years, as well as industry
executives, described many moves by Microsoft that they think
backfired and led to a resounding court defeat.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, the plaintiffs and defendant seemed evenly
matched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft and the government were the perfect opponents,''
observed David Boies, the government's lead trial lawyer. ``The
government has some power, but Microsoft has at least as much.
Anyone else facing either one of them would be overmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   And watching from the bench early on, the silver-haired,
63-year-old Jackson said he was awed by the legal prowess on
display in his courtroom. ``It's exhilarating to watch,'' he said.
``You'll never see better.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the months, the balance shifted heavily in favor of the
government. In fact, Microsoft's problems began well before the
trial opened in October 1998. It misjudged the legal trouble that
its own e-mail messages and other documents could create. It chose
not to reach an out-of-court settlement when the sanctions it faced
were a wrist-slap compared with the breakup plan it now confronts _
though these decisions may very well have been calculated gambles,
based on the company's conviction that it would win on appeal.
Whether that gamble pays off will not be known for months, or
years.
</P>
<P>
   In court, however, the Microsoft defense stumbled repeatedly.
And with each Microsoft misstep, the government was emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors assembled and then presented their case with
ever greater confidence, continually broadening it to embrace a far
richer array of charges than the one that started it all:
Microsoft's decision to tie a Web browser to the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   As the case progressed, the government presented evidence to
show that Microsoft had bullied friends and competitors alike,
halting innovations that threatened its Windows monopoly. And as
the allegations spilled out in court, Microsoft was increasingly on
its heels as it tried to argue that all the government had really
shown was that the company was a rough-and-tumble competitor, not
an economic outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson remained strikingly respectful of the defendant.
``There is no doubt in my mind that Microsoft is a unique, gifted,
efficient and ingenious organism,'' he said in February.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the judge had lost all patience with
Microsoft. On the trial's final day in May, a Microsoft lawyer
appealed for another round of hearings on the government's remedy
proposal, saying Microsoft could not possibly defend itself ``in
the brief time given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the brief time given?'' Jackson retorted with a sharp tone.
``This case has been pending for two years!''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview the next day, Jackson, observed: ``I am not
aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any due
process at all. The case is over. They lost.'' Besides, he added,
``I'm suspicious that they are just playing for time, hoping they
will get to deal with a new administration'' that might approach
the company with a softer hand.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed to be interviewed several times after testimony
in the trial had ended, with the understanding that his comments
could not be published until the case had left his courtroom. The
discussions, beginning last September, were friendly, informal and
unstructured.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Justice Department and the states agreed to
similar ground rules. Microsoft's cooperation was first requested
months ago; the company's general counsel granted a lengthy
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The goal in all of the interviews was to understand how the case
got started, how it grew from a technical fight over Internet
browsers into a broader battle over Microsoft's dealings with its
competitors and partners, how the government won so handily, and
why, to everyone's surprise, Microsoft fared so poorly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the case goes to appeal, where Microsoft believes it can
overturn everything that happened in Jackson's courtroom. As
Microsoft sees it, the government's case was a grab bag of
accusations based mainly on the selective use of its e-mail
messages. Some of it may look bad but, Microsoft insists, none of
it should add up to an antitrust violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of evidence that a skilled trial lawyer can use
to make the public wonder about how tough Microsoft plays this
game,'' said William H. Neukom, a senior vice president and general
counsel of Microsoft, in a recent interview at the company's campus
in suburban Seattle. ``But that is not the way the law is supposed
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will also argue on appeal that evidence Jackson relied
on should have been deemed inadmissible _ newspaper articles,
e-mail messages from low-level employees and the like. More
broadly, Microsoft believes that its view of the computer industry
_ for reasons that still puzzle the company's executives _ was
never appreciated by the government or the judge. ``It's clear that
the whole story of Microsoft, the whole story of the PC, was missed
here,'' said Gates during a press conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who fought Microsoft have come to believe that the
company suffers from a form of corporate myopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sense,'' said A. Douglas Melamed, deputy assistant
attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division,
``that the Microsoft team was so convinced of the correctness of
their view, and of the law and their story, that they didn't come
to understand as well as they might have how the story could be
told by the plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in the February interview, said simply, ``I think
Microsoft didn't take this seriously enough.''
</P>
<P>
   PAST AS PROLOGUE: `This Antitrust Thing Will Blow Over'
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, a prominent Washington appellate lawyer, joined
the Justice Department in April 1995 as principal deputy to Anne K.
Bingaman, chief of the antitrust division. The next year, he
succeeded her.
</P>
<P>
   His first task was to seek final court approval of a consent
decree reached with Microsoft the previous year to settle a Justice
Department antitrust suit. Microsoft had agreed to stop tying the
sale of one software product to the sale of another.
</P>
<P>
   But what Klein did not know then was that Microsoft had begun
flouting at least the spirit of the consent decree it had just
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This antitrust thing will blow over,'' Gates told a group of
Intel executives in July 1995, according to one Intel executive's
notes of the meeting, obtained by the government. ``We haven't
changed our business practices at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Klein heard from America Online. The company complained
that Microsoft was violating antitrust law by bundling MSN, its new
online service, with Windows. But the department decided not to
act.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, however, Microsoft took the step that led to
Jackson's courtroom. For months, James L. Barksdale, the president
of Netscape Communications, the commercial pioneer in software used
to browse the Web, had been growing increasingly irritated by what
he regarded as the bare-knuckle tactics that Microsoft deployed
against his company.
</P>
<P>
   But then Microsoft did something more: it threatened to cancel
Compaq Computer's license to Windows _ Microsoft's
industry-standard operating system, which Compaq could not survive
without _ because Compaq planned to feature the Netscape browser,
not Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a lawyer, but I have more than 30 years experience in
business,'' Barksdale recalled recently. ``I just knew that that
was something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls Microsoft's threat to cancel Compaq's Windows license
``the singular act'' that prompted him to take his grievances to
the Justice Department. To accomplish that, he asked Netscape's
lawyer, Gary L. Reback, to write a ``white paper'' detailing the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The 222-page paper accused Microsoft, among other things, of
using its dominance in operating systems to force PC makers to take
Microsoft's browser. And in August Barksdale sent a copy to Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the paper got his immediate attention. ``There was a
big difference in my mind between MSN and this,'' he said. ``To me,
conditioning one product on another was clearly a violation of the
consent decree. I authorized San Francisco to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Right away, the Justice Department's San Francisco office asked
Phillip R. Malone, an up-and-coming young lawyer, to head the
Microsoft team. And the next month, he and four other lawyers began
faxing civil investigative demands to Microsoft for documents
related to the Netscape charges and Microsoft's Internet strategy.
Such demands are the civil equivalent of a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   As each new request spilled out of a fax machine in Microsoft's
legal department, a Microsoft lawyer would discuss the request with
Malone. Then the investigators simply waited. ``The documents just
arrived in the mail,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Never once, he added, did an investigator have to visit
Microsoft and look in file cabinets or hard drives for overlooked
documents or e-mail messages. That is how the system is supposed to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers examined all the documents before they were
sent off. Several government officials said these lawyers should
instantly have realized those documents meant trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a lawyer and not know these documents are
lethal,'' Klein observed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers say they understood that some of the e-mail
messages could quicken a prosecutor's pulse. But they saw it as a
tactical problem _ the fiery communications of business aggression,
which might seem incriminating at first glance _ but not evidence
of an antitrust violation. ``No smoking gun,'' in the view of one
company lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the boxes of papers went out the door, Microsoft's legal
troubles mounted. More remarkably, the most damaging documents _
the ones that galvanized the resolve of state and federal
prosecutors nationwide _ were written months after that first
government request arrived, months after Microsoft's leaders knew
that everything they wrote was likely to wind up in prosecutors'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jackson likened the phenomenon to the federal prosecution of
drug traffickers, who are repeatedly caught as a result of
telephone wiretaps. And yet, he said, ``they never figure out that
they shouldn't be saying certain things on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neukom said Microsoft had been under investigation for so
long, and e-mail was so essential to the operations of the company,
that managers simply could not edit every thought and continue to
manage effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is a big part of how we run this company,'' he said.
``And candid, frank, open e-mail communication is a big part of our
efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   A GROWING CASE: U.S. Finds Allies In State Capitals  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft dealt with the growing federal investigation, a
new group took up the chase: state attorneys general. That
compounded Microsoft's problems. In time, the company would face
not just the Justice Department but 20 independent prosecutors from
the states as well.
</P>
<P>
   About the time the Justice Department's first document requests
arrived at Microsoft in September 1996, Mark Tobey, an antitrust
lawyer in the Texas attorney general's office, read a Time magazine
cover story about the browser war with the headline: ``An epic
battle is taking place between Microsoft and Netscape.'' Tobey _
whose state is home to Compaq and Dell Computer, two companies
highly dependent on Microsoft software _ decided to have a look at
the subject. He managed to get a copy of the Netscape white paper.
With that and other information, on Feb. 9, 1997, the Texas
attorney general's office issued its own civil investigative demand
to Microsoft _ the first formal action from a state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the state attorneys general gathered in
Washington for their annual spring conference, and during a meeting
of the antitrust section chiefs, Tobey outlined what he had been
doing, hoping to recruit allies.
</P>
<P>
   Tobey's presentation on Microsoft stirred little interest _
quite the opposite, in fact. Tom Miller, attorney general of Iowa,
was chairman of the antitrust committee, and his first thought was:
``Oh my God, Microsoft? We're not going to sue Microsoft, are we?''
</P>
<P>
   But through the spring and summer Tobey argued and lobbied and
eventually convinced several of the larger states to have a look at
the Microsoft documents. And in relatively short order, the
accumulating evidence convinced other states, including
Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin, to
join the investigation because the documents had stunned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know much about technology, or about the industry,''
recalled Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut. But
as he read the Microsoft documents, ``I was really struck by the
brutal, overt tactics. You rarely see things like this written
down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of almost every federal and state official
interviewed, three documents stood out as the most influential. The
first was a white paper that Gates wrote in May 1995, titled ``The
Internet Tidal Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new competitor born on the Internet is Netscape,'' Gates
wrote. As the leader in Web browsing software, Netscape, he added,
could set the technical rules for Internet computing and thus
``commoditize the underlying operating system'' _ Microsoft
Windows, on 85 percent of all personal computers. In other words,
Gates was saying, Netscape threatened to make Windows irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates memo, though not legally damaging on its own, pinned a
motivation to what followed.
</P>
<P>
   Two more documents that arrived during the fall of 1997 got all
of the prosecutors excited. They were e-mail messages written by
James E. Allchin, a senior Microsoft executive in charge of the
Windows group. He was worried about the company's Internet
strategy. Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, was being given
away free and bundled with Windows. Still, it was not catching on.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail messages to another senior executive written Dec. 20,
1996, and Jan. 2, 1997 _ more than three months after the federal
government had begun obtaining documents relating to Microsoft's
Internet strategy _ Allchin wrote: ``I do not believe we can win on
our current path. Even if we get Internet Explorer totally
competitive with Navigator, why would we be chosen? They have 80
percent market share. My conclusion is we have to leverage Windows
more.'' He added, ``We need something more: Windows integration.''
</P>
<P>
   To the prosecutors, this was the smoking gun. Allchin seemed to
be clearly saying that unless Microsoft deeply embedded its browser
into its monopoly product _ and thus made users go out of their way
to use Netscape _ Internet Explorer would surely lose.
</P>
<P>
   When these documents arrived at the Justice Department office in
San Francisco, Malone knew he had something special. He took them
to Washington and discussed them with Klein and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody saw it; they really captured the essence of what we
believed,'' Malone said. ``They had that power.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   AN INTERIM SUIT: Evidence of Threats Favors Prosecutors
</P>
<P>
   In early October 1997, Microsoft's lawyers attended a meeting at
the Justice Department to try to explain why it included its Web
browsing software in Windows. At the meeting, Klein ``held up two
disks, one holding Windows and the other with the browsing
software,'' Neukom said. ``He said, `You should have consulted us.
It's easy to separate these.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the level of analysis,'' Neukom said, indicating he
was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, at another crucial point, Microsoft misread its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government was feeling more confident. By the summer
of 1997, Malone said, ``I certainly felt we had a case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had not only gathered hundreds of
documents from Microsoft, but had also interviewed dozens of
industry executives, including the crucial officers at Netscape.
And by early fall, Klein said, ``it was becoming clear to me that
we had a larger case'' beyond the browser question.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the government's inquiry had gathered evidence that
Microsoft had threatened Compaq, IBM and Intel, essentially bribed
America Online and tried to hobble Sun Microsystems, among others _
all to protect the Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, 1997, Klein filed what proved to be an interim suit
against Microsoft, accusing the company of violating the 1994
consent decree by forcing computer makers to take Internet Explorer
along with Windows. The idea was to step in before Microsoft
released a new version of Internet Explorer, due out soon, ``rather
than to let that event pass, waiting for the big case,'' said
Melamed, deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice
Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was assigned that case, and in mid-December, he ordered
Microsoft to offer computer makers a version of Windows that did
not include Internet Explorer _ even though Microsoft had argued
that Windows and Internet Explorer were the same product. Microsoft
responded that the company would offer manufacturers a choice: one
version of Windows that was obsolete, or another that did not work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department reacted angrily, and, as it turned out,
Jackson was irritated, too. Asked what had struck him about
Microsoft's defense during this case, the judge referred to this
exchange in court, with David Cole, a Microsoft vice president, in
January 1998:
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed absolutely clear to you,'' the judge asked him from
the bench ``that I entered an order that required that you
distribute a product that would not work? Is that what you're
telling me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In plain English, yes,'' Cole replied. ``We followed that
order. It wasn't my place to consider the consequences of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Microsoft agreed to offer a version of Windows with
Internet Explorer hidden and partially disabled, and an appeals
court was due to consider the case in the spring. But it hardly
mattered any longer. Windows 98 was due out in just a few months,
and Microsoft was saying Internet Explorer would be even more
tightly entwined.
</P>
<P>
   THE LOBBYING: A Multistate Tour Leaves Ill Will
</P>
<P>
   In late March 1998, the antitrust chiefs in about a dozen states
agreed on a multistate action against Microsoft. At the Justice
Department, Klein still was not saying what he planned. Still, by
the first week of March anyone watching closely could have guessed
he was serious when he hired Jeffrey H. Blattner, a former chief
counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as special counsel for
information technology.
</P>
<P>
   His actual job, Blattner explained later, was chief of staff for
the Microsoft case, and as preparation for his new role he read the
evidence, principally the Microsoft documents. Right away, he said,
``I had a very clear sense that lawyers never get to see documents
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, apparently, was paying close attention, because
within a few weeks the company set out on a lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, Dennis C. Vacco, then New York's attorney
general, got a call from Fred Foreman, a former U.S. attorney in
Chicago. They had been colleagues years earlier, when Vacco was
U.S. attorney in Buffalo. Just now, it turned out, Foreman had been
hired by Microsoft, and he asked if he and representatives of his
new client could come in for a talk.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the Microsoft contingent arrived in New York,
including Foreman and David A. Heiner, a Microsoft lawyer. The
atmosphere in Vacco's office was friendly _ until Heiner made
Microsoft's pitch: Why was his company being viewed as a
competitive threat, he asked. After all, he said, Microsoft holds
``only 4 percent of the worldwide software market.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft certainly knew that Vacco was not particularly well
informed about the software industry. But before meeting the
Microsoft group, Stephen D. Houck, a lawyer in the attorney
general's office, had given him a detailed briefing about the case.
Houck said Vacco did not say much in response to the 4 percent
remark. But as Vacco thought about what he had been told, he said,
``I was almost derisive.'' After all, he added, the case was not
about the worldwide software business. It was about the PC
operating system business, and Microsoft held about 85 percent of
that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they were purposely playing me because they
thought I had a lack of knowledge,'' Vacco said. ``But I knew that
was ridiculous.'' Microsoft's visit, he said, hardened his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   That scene was replayed in state after state, about 12 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the Microsoft team showed up at the Justice
Department. During a meeting in Klein's conference room, they gave
a demonstration of Windows 98 and the benefits that the company
said resulted from the integration of Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was cordial,'' Klein said. ``We knew all of these
people. We'd dealt with them before,'' including ``on the
MSN-America Online case, when they obviously got the result they
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said Microsoft spent several days preparing for the
meeting. ``It was absolutely in our best interests to understand
their concerns,'' he said. But ``there was very little indication
of open-mindedness on the other side of the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their mentality was that there are two separate products that
you forced together to crush Netscape,'' Neukom recalled. But by
then, in fact, Microsoft had given the government hundreds of
documents that would provide ammunition for a much broader case.
</P>
<P>
   A DRAFT SUIT: The Missed Chances To Avoid a Trial
</P>
<P>
   By mid-April 1998, the Justice Department had produced a draft
of its suit that Klein, Boies and other officials took to Attorney
General Janet Reno. They met with her three times over a period of
several days. Reno and her staff asked many questions, but finally
she gave permission to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Klein asked David Boies to sign a contract as a
special government employee so he could serve as the lead courtroom
lawyer. Though he had worked for the government as a consultant
since December, Boies only then immersed himself in the Microsoft
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most impressed me was the enthusiastic zeal with which
they used their monopoly power,'' he said. ``In my experience, most
companies will use it, but they are nervous, uncomfortable about
it. But in this case there was such clarity and baldness in the
conduct. I'd never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   In late April, Klein and the other leaders of the antitrust
division met with the leaders of Microsoft, including Gates, at the
Washington offices of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, Microsoft's law firm,
where Gates made impassioned arguments against the suit. As Neukom
recalled it, Gates told Klein, ``What we're doing is good for
consumers, good for the industry and good for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill just felt that if he could talk to them and not through
lawyers, they'd understand,'' Neukom added.
</P>
<P>
   The government lawyers responded by laying out their
allegations. They tried to get Microsoft to respond. Now Gates knew
firsthand that the government had a broad and potentially serious
case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But ``we couldn't get them to focus on the issues,'' Boies said.
``They just kept saying they didn't have monopoly power.'' Once
more an opportunity to avoid the suit slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   In several phone calls in mid-May, including some between Gates
and Klein, Microsoft appeared to be making a last offer to settle
the case: Microsoft would allow computer makers to alter the
opening screen of the Windows operating system. As the case had
broadened, that issue had been added to the government's growing
list of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that, Klein agreed to meet with Microsoft and
hold ``last rites'' talks, the U.S. government's final approach to
the defendant in search of an equitable settlement before moving to
court.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, 1998, the talks opened. As the two sides sat on
opposite sides of a glossy walnut conference table, Boies leaned
forward and looked directly at Neukom.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the table knew his deep experience in antitrust
cases; he had been the lead lawyer for IBM during that company's
long antitrust battle with the government. ``You know, once the
United States government files suit against you, everything
changes,'' Boies recalls saying. ``People are more willing to come
forward and testify against you. Others are more willing to
question you, resist you. The whole world changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Boies recalled the moment, Neukom and the company's
others lawyers looked back at him with blank, unwavering
expressions. ``They didn't really respond other than to repeat what
they'd been saying all along'' _ that the government did not
understand the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, it was the government that had no intention
of settling the case. Neukom recalled the two days of talks ending
with a senior Justice Department official telling him: ``I guess
we're in litigation. You have no idea how difficult we can make
your lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``last rites'' talks fell apart. And today many government
officials and industry executives regard Microsoft's refusal to
settle the case that day, before the suits were even filed, as the
biggest mistake the company has ever made.
</P>
<P>
   But in another respect, the company's refusal was not
surprising. During a court hearing a short time later, a Microsoft
lawyer approached Boies and offered the following remark, as Boies
recalled it: ``The government has been making the same arguments
for eight years. We always give the same responses. Our side always
prevails. When is the government going to leave us alone?''
</P>
<P>
   THE JUDGE: Hoping to Avoid Another AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   As the state and federal governments were preparing to file
their suits, Jackson recalled last month, he watched these
developments with ``a fair amount of trepidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he had tried the earlier case, this new one would come
to his courtroom. It was certain to be big, complex and possibly
precedent-setting. But in truth, Jackson had tried only two
antitrust cases in his 16-year judicial career. And to say he knew
little about technology was at best an understatement. His abiding
concern: ``Please don't let me screw this up!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``I thought I could do this,'' the judge said he decided.
``I'd done it before, become literate on esoteric topics for which
I have no background,'' notably as a successful trial lawyer in the
1970s defending medical malpractice cases, another highly technical
area he had known little about.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the suits were filed, the judge called the
litigants to his courtroom to set a schedule and tell them he
wanted a fast-track trial.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said he was determined to ``stay away from disasters
like the IBM and AT&AMP;T cases,'' each of which had dragged on for a
decade. ``I'm a great believer in taking evidence, closing the
record as quickly as you can and then shipping it upstairs'' to the
court of appeals. The very last thing he wanted, he said, was to
find himself in the same position as Harold H. Greene, the judge
who spent years trying AT&AMP;T and then overseeing the breakup of the
company. Greene died in January.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, 1998, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals
handed down a ruling overturning Jackson's decision in December
ordering Microsoft to take Internet Explorer out of Windows 95. The
ruling said Microsoft had every right to integrate new products
into Windows, if there was a plausible consumer benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was jubilant, and the plaintiffs, at first, were
crushed. Jackson said he was ``wounded'' _ and angry. ``I think it
was wrongheaded on several counts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boies got a copy of the appeals court decision just as he was
boarding a plane for San Francisco, where he was to meet with the
Justice Department's investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   During the trip west, he read it and then read it again, ``and
by the time I got to San Francisco, I was convinced it was a good
thing for us'' because ``it gave us a road map of what the court of
appeals criteria would be.'' Boies could frame his case around it.
Just after he landed, he explained that to the Justice Department
team. But he added with a grin, ``They didn't immediately recognize
our tremendous good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the summer, state and federal officials feverishly
prepared for trial, trying with little success to persuade
Microsoft's supposed victims _ computer makers and others _ to
testify. ``They were afraid of Microsoft,'' said Tom Miller,
attorney general of Iowa. ``We didn't have any particular
success.'' But over the summer, even more useful Microsoft
documents came in, and government depositions of other industry
leaders gave power to the growing list of charges.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEPOSITION: A Mumbling Gates Delights Prosecutor
</P>
<P>
   By late August 1998, the trial was scheduled to begin in less
than a month, and the government was still negotiating with
Microsoft over the deposition of Gates, forcing Jackson to postpone
the opening day. Finally, in the last days of August, Boies and
Houck flew to Seattle for three days of deposition interviews with
Microsoft's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As he set up in a Microsoft conference room, Boies said he was
apprehensive as he got ready to face the powerful corporate chief.
``I was expecting him to be articulate, passionate, tough, direct,
intelligent and very, very knowledgeable about everything relating
to the case,'' just as he had been in their last meeting the
previous spring, Boies said. In other words, ``a very effective
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the deposition opened, a very different Gates was
on display. This one was mumbling, uninformed, obdurate and unaware
of anything related to the government's charges. And Boies was
thrilled. He knew just what he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to capture as much of that as you can,'' he said.
``If you have a witness that says `I don't know,' you want to get
him to say `I don't know' 1,000 times.'' Gates obliged.
</P>
<P>
   After the first two days of deposition, there was a five-day
break before the third and final day. Surely, Boies concluded,
Gates' lawyers would talk to their client in the interim, explain
how damaging his testimony had been.

KLOSTERMAN REMEMBERED FOR COURAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of all the celebrated people I've met in sports
across the seasons, Don ``Duke'' Klosterman ranked among the most
memorable because of the sheer force of his charismatic
personality, his inexhaustible supply of stories and his Who's Who
list of close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it often almost was forgotten that Klosterman was a
shrewd judge of football personnel in his long-time role as an NFL
general manager because of his storied lifestyle that brought him
in close contact with the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman, a one-time Compton High and Loyola quarterback star
who passed away at age 70 on Wednesday, once dated Bobby Kennedy's
widow, Ethel, and became close friends with the entire Kennedy
clan.
</P>
<P>
   A long-time member of the upscale Bel-Air Country Club,
Klosterman resided in Century City and moved in a rarefied social
circle that included people like the billionaire cable TV mogul,
Jerry Perenchio, the Hollywood Park president, R.D. Hubbard, the
actor, Jack Nicholson, the sportscaster, Al Michaels, and numerous
others of a similar vein.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s when I covered the Los Angeles Rams and
Klosterman was their GM---he held similar positions previously for
the Baltimore Colts and Houston Oilers---I nicknamed him the Duke
of Dining Out because of his well-known affinity for frequenting
stylish restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He even owned one for a time in Beverly Hills with his second
wife, who was from Italy and who he wound up divorcing.
</P>
<P>
   During the time he was single---and he was for most of the years
I knew him---Klosterman was active on the dating scene, and one
evening during the Rams' training camp I had dinner with him and
the actress, Madeline Rhu, at an establishment in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Don Klosterman was the most admired male I've ever
known because of his having overcome his disability,'' says Beverly
Hills attorney, E. Gregory Hookstratten, the Rams' general counsel
when Klosterman was with the team. Klosterman suffered a terrible
skiing accident near Banff in 1953, and doctors predicted he'd
never walk again.
</P>
<P>
   But Klosterman showed the same toughness and resilience in his
private physical struggle as he once did on the gridiron at Loyola,
where he threw for 19 touchdowns in 1951 and established new
single-game NCAA standards for passing attempts (63), completions
(33) and yardage (373) in a match against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He did manage to walk again, although he would suffer from his
skiing injuries---a broken back, a broken leg and broken ribs---the
remainder of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he was able to endure pain every day of his life was
truly remarkable,'' says Hookstratten. ``He was a very brave man.''
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman, one of 15 children who grew up modestly in Compton,
might have consorted with the handicapped horses on the social
scene but never forgot his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He was affable and charming to everyone he met, and often
ventured out of his Beverly Hills bailiwick to have a meal with his
myriad of friends that I'm sure could be found in every state in
America, as well as various countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He had enormous contacts in the media, and among his closest
were Howard Cosell, Bud Furillo, Melvin Durslag Jim Murray, John
Hall, Bob Oates, etc.
</P>
<P>
   He had many acquaintances and relatives in the Long Beach
area---he even worked here a while back in one of his many business
ventures---and often made appearances at Phil Trani's.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest guys I've ever had the pleasure to know,''
says the Long Beach restaurateur. ``My whole dining room lit up
when Don was in our place. And there was no one he didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman was an extraordinary raconteur, and he'd keep you
entranced with his tales about some of the people he worked for
like Baron Hilton, Lamar Hunt, Bud Adams and Carroll Rosenbloom and
some of the football players he knew well like Bobby Layne, Gino
Marchetti, John Unitas, Gene ``Big Daddy'' Lipscomb, Bubba Smith,
Otto Graham and countless others.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Rosenbloom would get mad at Klosterman once in a while
when Klosterman would exceed his expense account allotment, but the
two men had a deep fondness for each other and were responsible for
building the Rams into a powerful franchise throughout the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It became an autumn Thursday afternoon ritual during that decade
for Rosenbloom and Klosterman to show up at Blair Field, where the
Rams then trained, and they often would bring along with them
people like Ricardo Montablan and Jonathan Winters.
</P>
<P>
   I always found the repartee with Rosenbloom to be enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke Klosterman's deft one-liners and mesmerizing yarns were
just as entertaining---and will be missed by those of us fortunate
enough to have been his pal...
</P>
<P>
   -Curiously, if the Lakers are beaten tonight---a distinct
possibility unless they show up at Staples Center with
passion---the Indiana Pacers would suddenly have the advantage in
these NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the next three games will be at the Canseco
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, where the Pacers were 36-5 during the
regular season and where the Pacers snapped the Lakers' 16-game
winning streak in January...
</P>
<P>
   -I've seen horrid shooting exhibitions before---I've been
watching Glen Rice the entire season---but none matches Reggie
Miller's 1-for-16 abomination Wednesday night...
</P>
<P>
   -Poor Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's bad enough the guy has had so
many bombs lately that he was reduced to having to sit a fifth row
lodge seat at Staples Center near the end of the court, a terrible
social putdown for him. But even worse is that ol' Arnold has had
so many face lifts that I swear he looks exactly now like one of
those aliens he's played in his movies...
</P>
<P>
   -I'm sure Bob Arum was overjoyed that the Lakers survived that
Game 7 against Portland, since it will diminish coverage of his
June 17 welterweight title fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Sugar
Shane Mosley, which is not exactly the talk of L.A. at the
moment...
</P>
<P>
   -Don Fraser reports the recent Golden State Boxers Association
luncheon honoring Bobby Chacon and Danny Lopez had a sellout
turnout of 145 at the Spaghetti Factory in Hollywood. The event
commemorated the two old warriors' classic 1974 showdown at the
Sports Arena in which Chacon emerged with a 9th round knockout
victory over Lopez...
</P>
<P>
   -I just wish all the jocks that cussed me out over the years
were fined $5,000 like John Rocker was for his heated verbal
confrontation with the Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman...
</P>
<P>
   -Thank you for all the kind words of sympathy.

 UNDATED: had been.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned that a recharged Gates would come
back,'' Boies said. ``I had two days of him in the can, and I could
see its value diminishing. I almost didn't take the third day.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did, and Gates came back, his behavior unchanged. When
the deposition ended, Boies knew he had a powerful tool.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said Microsoft never expected the tapes to be used in
court, only the transcripts. Had Microsoft's lawyers known the
tapes would be shown in court, Neukom said, ``we would have
prepared our witness differently,'' changing the style of his
presentation, but not the substance. Yet, the Justice Department
thought even the transcripts were inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   Boies was determined to play part of the Gates tape on the
trial's opening day, now set for Oct. 19, and as often as he could
in the days following. He said he hoped it would send this message
to the judge: ``The chairman of the company doesn't have any
credible explanation for what they did, even though he was
intimately involved. If he doesn't have an explanation, then how
can you credit the explanations of his underlings?'' The strategy
worked.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched the Gates tape, Jackson said later, he was
thinking, ``I can't conceive of Bill Gates being allowed to testify
like that on deposition. Jackson called it ``an ingenious
strategy'' on the part of the prosecution. ``Here is the guy who is
the head of the organization, and his testimony is inherently
without credibility. At the start, it makes you skeptical about the
rest of the trial. You are saying, if you can't believe this guy,
who else can you believe? It was a brilliant move by David Boies.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TRIAL: A Loss of Patience From the Bench
</P>
<P>
   As the trial proceeded and the testimony grew ever more
technical and obscure, many evenings the government legal team left
the courtroom, and as they walked down the courthouse steps, they
would be thinking about the judge, and, as Boies recalled it, one
lawyer would ask the other: ``Do you think he understood?''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson chuckled at the question but in February said: ``By and
large, I was able to follow what they were saying.'' Still, when
Jackson left the courtroom many days, he would corner his law
clerks and ask them to explain the technology issues he did not
understand. ``I had excellent law clerks,'' he said. ``They were
computer literate enough to explain things to me. We talked all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the trial, with Microsoft's defense in
disarray, the judge grew ever more abrupt. ``There were times when
I became impatient with Microsoft witnesses who were giving
speeches,'' he said. In addition, ``they were telling me things I
just flatly could not credit,'' echoing the impression Boies had
said he hoped the judge would take away from the trial.
</P>
<P>
   When the main part of the trial ended on Feb. 25, 1999, the two
sides held settlement discussions at the judge's urging. In fact,
Jackson vigorously pushed the litigants to settle, but this turned
out to be another missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Microsoft could have little doubt that the government
held a strong hand. The post-trial mood of the federal and state
government lawyers was confident. ``I've never been involved in a
case that went as well as this one,'' said Kevin J. O'Connor, an
assistant attorney general from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft was not ready to concede a thing.
</P>
<P>
   During several meetings that opened on March 29 and ended in
early June, Klein told Microsoft for the first time that the
government wanted to break up the company. The Microsoft team said
they were unwilling even to discuss the idea. In an interview
later, Neukom said he was not particularly surprised, but regarded
it mainly as an opening maneuver in negotiations. But once again,
that was a grave misreading; the government was utterly serious.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, during the last meeting, Klein laid out a proposal
not for a breakup but for conduct remedies similar to the ones the
judge approved on Wednesday in addition to the breakup. . The
Microsoft team listened impassively. When Klein was finished, the
Microsoft lawyers said they wanted to think about it. But as Neukom
said in the interview, ``It was way over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, ``there was a clear expectation they
would get back to us,'' said Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney
general. ``But they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   THE RULING: Overcoming Qualms about a Breakup
</P>
<P>
   By fall, the trial was over; only the judge's rulings were left,
and Jackson looked back at the experience. A fast-paced trial
schedule, he said, can produce one of two results: a settlement, or
a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what we got was a war,'' said Jackson in September.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he was separating the findings of fact in his
verdict from the final ruling, the conclusions of law, because ``I
want to encourage a settlement.'' And a few weeks later the idea to
ask Richard A. Posner, chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Chicago, to serve as mediator, hit him like ``a bolt out of the
blue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew,'' he explained in February, ``that the egos were
sufficiently high on both sides that, with any ordinary person,
they would just say, `So, who are you?''' And when he called
Posner, ``I was grateful that, one, he would take a call from a
district court judge, and two, that he didn't say, `I have so many
things going on I don't have time.'''
</P>
<P>
   After four months, the settlement talks failed; Microsoft once
again rejected a package of conduct remedies prepared by the state
and federal governments _ certainly knowing, given the history,
that a break up proposal might well follow. And as the time for a
final ruling loomed early this year, was obviously troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in splendid isolation on this case long enough,''
he said. ``I would welcome another mind studying my work product to
see if I am correct or wrongheaded. I want to move this case
upstairs as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That, as much as anything else, prompted him to speed through
the remedy phase. ``The sooner this gets definitively resolved, the
better it is for the country _ including the defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his reluctance, in February, to break up Microsoft,
Jackson said last month, ``I'm still uncomfortable.'' On Wednesday,
however, he accepted the government breakup proposal without
alteration.

the consent decree'' in 1995 ``which they did not think
accomplished what they intended.''
</P>

   As for his competence to supervise a breakup, the judge said he
was certain the government would help him. Still, Jackson leaned
back in his chair and shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shades of Harold Greene,'' he said with a rueful smile. ``I
tried so hard to avoid the pitfalls he encountered in that trial.''

A PATTERN OF UNSOLVED GREEK TERRORISM CASES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With GREECE-TERROR) By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The killing of a British diplomat Thursday in
Athens came in the midst of a growing debate in Washington over
Greece's record in curbing anti-Western terrorism within its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Monday, a bipartisan U.S. commission on terrorism had
recommended that the Clinton administration consider imposing
sanctions on Greece for failing to fully cooperate with the United
States in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright quickly dismissed the call
for sanctions, yet officials throughout Washington expressed
frustration with Greece's continued failure to solve terrorism
cases, particularly actions directed at Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Greek authorities to solve anti-American
terrorism cases over 25 years has turned the group called November
17 into one of the most mysterious and most successful terrorist
groups in the world.
</P>
<P>
   American and Greek officials do not even know the names of the
group's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, five American Embassy employees have been killed in
Greece, but no arrests have been made in any of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is ``one of the weakest links in Europe,'' the State
Department's latest annual report on terrorism observed. With 20
acts of violence last year against U.S. government and other
American targets, both people and property, Greece was second in
the world, after Colombia, for the highest number of anti-American
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of strong public government leadership contributed
to the lack of breakthroughs against terrorists'' in Greece, the
State Department said in its annual terrorist report. ``Popular
opinion makers generally played down terrorism as a threat to
public order.''
</P>
<P>
   November 17, the group believed to be responsible for Thursday's
killing, is the same Marxist cell that officials believe has also
been behind a string of unsolved murders of American diplomats in
the country. The group announced its existence with the 1975
killing of Richard Welch, the CIA's Athens station chief. The
group's name is thought to refer to a protest on Nov. 17, 1973,
when students blocked traffic on a major road and were tear-gassed.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats have been prime targets of the group ever
since. Among the worst incidents were the 1983 killings of George
Tsantes, an American naval officer and his chauffeur, and the 1988
slaying of an American military attache, William Nordeen.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of progress by investigators has led to a perception
among American officials, and even within Greece, that Greek
officials have turned a blind eye to November 17's activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there are people throughout the U.S.
counterterrorism community who are convinced that there are some
Greek officials who over the last quarter century have had
important information on 17 November and have not acted on it or
shared it with us,'' said one former senior United States
government official.
</P>
<P>
   But a former American intelligence official who served in Greece
and investigated November 17 said the idea of a link between the
group and the Greek government was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real story is just that the Greek police are inept,'' he
said. ``They are just incredibly sloppy.''
</P>
<P>
   The police failures have led the terrorists to taunt the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The November 17 attackers have used the same .45-caliber pistol
in most of its killings dating to Welch's murder, switching only
briefly to a 9-millimeter one in a few incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, they also used the same typewriter to write
notes taking responsibility for assaults.

NEW DUTY FOR THE DEMOCRATS' MAIN MONEY MAN: RUNNING THE
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a personal appeal by Vice President Al Gore,
Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic Party's most prodigious
fund-raiser, has agreed to serve as chairman of the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, which has struggled to overcome
fund-raising difficulties and bickering among its organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic officials said Gore phoned McAuliffe on
Wednesday morning to ask him to succeed Roy Romer, the former
Colorado governor, who was appointed superintendent of the Los
Angeles school system on Tuesday. McAuliffe instantly agreed to the
request, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For months, senior party officials have worried that this
summer's convention could turn out to be a dud, now that Gore has
the nomination wrapped up. Several party activists had quietly
lobbied for McAuliffe's appointment, saying they needed his
enthusiasm to help energize the four-day nominating convention
scheduled to begin Aug. 14 at the Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's commitment to the Democratic Party is unprecedented,''
Lydia Camarillo, the convention's chief executive, said Thursday.
``Time and again he has demonstrated his deep devotion to our
party's goals and efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is the most prolific fund-raiser in the history of
American politics. He is also one of President Clinton's closest
friends. Most recently, McAuliffe was chairman of the Democratic
National Committee's gala at the MCI Sports Center here on May 23.
The event, a tribute to Clinton, attracted a sellout crowd of
13,625 people and raised a record $26.5 million for the Democratic
Party. Most of that money will benefit Gore's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, McAuliffe estimated that he had personally raised at
least $300 million for Clinton and Democratic causes, including the
president's 1997 inaugural, the White House millennium celebration,
the president's legal defense fund, Clinton's library in Little
Rock, Ark., and the current campaigns of Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe expects his convention duties, unlike those
earlier assignments, to require spending very little time raising
money. Democratic Party officials hope that McAuliffe can bring to
the Staples Center the pep-rally ambience that existed at last
month's gala here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be joining a terrific convention team,''
McAuliffe said Thursday. ``And I'm looking forward to working with
them to make this the greatest convention in the history of
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, senior party officials and Gore allies were
concerned that the convention could turn into a disaster. Fund
raising was _ and still is _ behind schedule; $7 million still
needs to be raised by the host committee. The billionaires who had
helped lure the convention to Los Angeles have complained among
themselves. Unions facing contract negotiations had warned of
possible labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   And to top it off, the city's public officials were reeling
earlier this year from the ugly headlines generated by the worst
police corruption scandal to hit the city in decades. There was
widespread worry that the convention would not be a worthy
successor to the last Democratic convention to be held in Los
Angeles: the 1960 party gathering that nominated John F. Kennedy
for president amid great excitement.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Democratic officials said the convention team had
made great organizational strides in the past two months.
Convention officials said they were looking forward to working with
McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stock is trading at an all-time high,'' said James
Carville, the Democratic consultant. ``He brings some panache and a
lot of enthusiasm to the convention.''

TEXAS LAWMAKERS SEEK WIDE DNA TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.Y., Ill.)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With increasing national scrutiny and criticism
focused on capital punishment in Texas, two prominent state
senators, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, Thursday
called for a new law that would allow post-conviction DNA testing
as a safeguard against executing an innocent person.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation mirrors laws in New York and Illinois
and comes after Gov. George W. Bush granted a 30-day reprieve last
week for Ricky Nolen McGinn shortly before his scheduled execution.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old
stepdaughter in 1993, but last week Bush, citing concerns that
adequate tests on DNA evidence had not been performed, granted the
reprieve to allow for new DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, Thursday announced
a package of bills for the 2001 legislative session that includes a
bill that would allow convicted people, with some restrictions, to
petition the trial court for DNA testing as part of their appeals.
Defense lawyers in Texas often unsuccessfully seek DNA testing from
the courts as a means of establishing innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal of bipartisanship, State Senator David Sibley,
Republican of Waco, appeared with Ellis at a news conference to
endorse the DNA proposal and predicted swift action in the
Legislature next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley also supported a proposal by Ellis to create an
``innocence commission,'' much like one established in Illinois,
that would review select death penalty cases and make
recommendations for improving the Texas death penalty system.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny. In his
five years as governor, Bush has presided over 131 executions,
easily the most of any governor, and he often has expressed his
unflinching belief in the fairness of the Texas system. His 30-day
reprieve for McGinn was the first he had granted.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesman for Bush, said the governor would have
to review the specifics of the DNA proposal, but added that he
``supports reviewing state law on the use of DNA evidence when the
DNA results are likely to determine guilt or innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   In three cases, including one last week, Bush has pardoned men
convicted of rape after DNA tests confirmed their innocence. As for
an innocence commission, Jones said Bush would need more
information before taking a public stance.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Scheck, a defense lawyer and a nationally recognized
authority on DNA who appeared with Ellis, praised his proposal but
cautioned that myriad other problems exist in Texas, such as
inadequate lawyers for indigent defendants in capital punishment
cases. Scheck is helping to establish the Texas Innocence Network,
a group that will investigate such cases.
</P>
<P>
   As president pro tem of the Texas State Senate, Ellis actually
signed, at the governor's instructions, McGinn's reprieve because
Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry were out of state.

FIRST RECIPIENTS OF GATES FOUNDATION SCHOLARSHIPS BRING HIM TO
TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., N.J., N.Y., Wash.)   By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which promised to spend
$1 billion on higher education for 20,000 low-income minority
students over the next two decades, Thursday announced its
inaugural class of 4,100 scholars, chosen from more than 62,000
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 scholars identified, it has been something of a
whirlwind. Most received their good news last week and were flown
to Seattle, the home of Microsoft, for the news conference at which
the awards were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Gates choked up and became teary-eyed after one student broke
down in tears while thanking him and his wife, the news agency
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually being here, meeting the kids last night at dinner,
hearing about their dreams, it's a very _ .'' At that point Gates
apparently was overcome by emotion and apologized to about 75
people at the news conference, before picking up where he left off,
`` _ exciting thing to have become reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Tears were visible in his eyes for several moments as he
continued, reported Reuters, which said he showed more emotion than
he did on Wednesday when a federal judge ordered that the company
he co-founded be broken up to prevent further violations of the
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Williams, 19, of Daphne, Ala., one of the students,
said: ``This is going to make the road so much easier. The message
that I'd won came last week when I was at work at Pizza Hut. It was
on the machine, but at first I didn't understand the words I'd been
waiting to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Williams completed his freshman year at Xavier
University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where
he is a chemistry and pre-med student. ``I'm the first in my family
to graduate from high school, and my mother and I both had to take
out loans for me to go to college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear precisely how many students will have
scholarships next September, since those selected have until June
15 to send in proof of their financial need and college enrollment
for next fall. All those who qualify will receive financing from
the foundation. Of those chosen, 1,364 are incoming freshmen, 2,542
continuing undergraduates and 200 graduate students in mathematics,
science, engineering, education and library science.
</P>
<P>
   The program will provide $50 million in scholarships a year, to
be administered by the United Negro College Fund, in partnership
with the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the American Indian College
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The program will pay the difference between what a student
received in financial aid from the college and the cost of his or
her tuition, housing and books; the awards will be renewed
annually, as long as the students maintain a 3.0 average. About
1,000 new scholarship winners will be chosen each year.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 winners include a wide range of students, from
Lenny Bonilla, a 17-year-old high school senior from Freeport,
N.Y., who will be a freshman at Johns Hopkins University in
September, to Brandy Rutledge, of Irvington, N.J., a 23-year-old
doctoral candidate in biostatistics at Virginia Commonwealth
University.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, students had to have at least a 3.3 grade-point
average and be admitted to, or enrolled in, a four-year
undergraduate program or a graduate program in the selected fields
for the 2000-2001 school year.
</P>
<P>
   For Amber Pickett, an 18-year-old Quinault Indian from a tiny
town three hours south of Seattle, the trip was not long, but it
signaled a profound change in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out I'd won on Friday, the day I graduated from high
school,'' Pickett said. ``There were 11 people in my graduating
class. I'm going to be a freshman at the University of Washington
next year and study fisheries. I want to be the first one in my
family to graduate from college and I want to make an impact for
Native Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62,000 students competing for the scholarships were judged
on the basis of grades, leadership skills, community involvement
and financial need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of weird how I heard about the program,'' said
Daniel Serna, a 22-year-old senior at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology who grew up in Georgia, Texas and Mexico. ``One of my
roommates is really big into trying to find scholarships, and I was
just hanging around when he was filling this out, right before it
was due, so I did it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Serna, a biology major with a 3.5-grade-point average, won a
scholarship but his roommate did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on vacation when I heard,'' Serna said, ``but I had to
tell him when he got back.''

BUSH PROPOSES RESTRUCTURED BUDGET PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Criticizing Washington for what he termed
``too much needless division,'' Gov. George W. Bush Thursday
proposed a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget process in
an effort to avoid the bitter annual standoffs between Congress and
the president over taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put at the center of his plan a call for the president and
Congress to shift from an annual budget cycle to a biennial process
like the one in Texas, his home state. ``If the discord in
Washington never seems to end this is partly because the budget
process never seems to end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan, however, was narrowly defeated in the
Republican-dominated House just last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also
called for a new effort to pass legislation giving the president
line-item veto power. And he asked for a change in budget
procedures to require the president to sign the annual spring
budget resolution, which now is the work of Congress alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not dismiss the serious disagreements that are part of
the political process,'' Bush said, ``but the reality is that
Americans look upon this spectacle in Washington and they don't
like what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal for structural changes came against the backdrop
of 5{ tumultuous years of partisan bickering between President
Clinton and the Republican Congress that was elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there was ``enough blame to go around.'' But appearing
in the home state of Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic
opponent, he went on to level most of his criticism at the Clinton
administration, particularly at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Gore for the tone of his responses to Bush's
policy proposals, particularly one to divert some Social Security
payroll taxes into individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas he doesn't share are never just the other side of the
issue,'' Bush said. ``They're called reckless or radical. Proposals
he disapproves of are never just arguable, they are always `risky
schemes.' This unnecessary rhetoric is characteristic of the tone
in Washington, D.C. It's the war room mentality: the hostile
stance, the harsh charges, the lashing out at enemies. We have had
eight years of this, and eight years is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, which in recent days has toned down much of
its criticism of Bush, said the governor was trying to duck serious
policy debate. ``This rhetoric is Gov. Bush's way of avoiding real
debate on issues such as his plan to privatize Social Security,''
said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With his appearance Thursday, Bush continued the reliance on
policy speeches that have marked his campaign this spring and that
he and his advisers believe help him draw a contrast with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech allowed him to compete with Gore on one of the
vice president's trademark issues _ ``reinventing government'' _
and it also borrowed from Bush's Republican primary opponent, Sen.
John McCain, who crusaded against pork barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed the creation of a bipartisan legislative
commission that would comb spending bills for pork barrel projects,
combine them into one list and then require Congress to take an up
or down vote on whether to approve the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the governor's ideas were not new. President Clinton
also sought line-item veto powers, and Congress passed such a law
in 1996. But two years later the Supreme Court held that it had
unconstitutionally granted the president unilateral power to change
statutes, and it struck down the law.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, said
the campaign had consulted with constitutional experts and believed
line-item veto legislation could be rewritten to meet
Constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Clinton administration and the Republican Congressional
leadership also support biennial budgeting. Although Republicans
like Rep. Bill Archer, who heads the Ways and Means Committee, and
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert support the idea, such a plan was
defeated 217-201 in the House last month. The opponents, mostly
Democrats, said it would reduce Congress to fiscal lame ducks,
unable to exercise authority over federal agencies. A proposal like
Bush's to have the president sign the congressional budget
resolution was also defeated in the House 250-166.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined several other steps to end gridlock. To head
off the threat of a government shutdown he proposed that if
spending bills were not passed by the start of the new fiscal year,
spending would continue at whatever was lowest: the previous year's
levels or levels proposed by the president in his own budget.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the Senate to take no more than 60 days to act on
presidential nominees. The delays have become so severe that during
the Clinton administration 44 percent of nominations took more than
six months to come before the Senate, and some have been stalled
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Senate confirmation hearings had become too partisan.
``Often,'' he said, ``they are occasions for pushing a larger
agenda having nothing to do with the merits of the nominee. At some
memorable low points, hearings have become a gantlet of accusation,
interest group warfare and public humiliation. And this has done
too much harm to the process.''

A YOUNG BUSH IS THE STAR IN ADS SET FOR NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Calif.)   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Bush will be featured in a new commercial that
is to run here on Sunday. No, not that George Bush, and not the
other one, either. This is George P. Bush, the 23-year-old nephew
of the presumptive Republican nominee and a budding star of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The new spot, produced in Spanish and in English _ George P. is
fluent in both, campaign advisers say _ is being released to
coincide with the staging on Sunday of the Puerto Rican Day Parade
in Manhattan, in which the younger Bush is also scheduled to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, the young man, the son of the candidate's
brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and his Mexican-born wife,
Columba, talks about how his uncle is reaching out to voters of
diverse backgrounds, Bush strategists say. But they add that his
good looks could also help draw in younger voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to deliver a message in a very natural way, and is,
in fact, not only a handsome young man, but also totally
Latino-looking and as proficient in Spanish as he is in English,''
said Lionel Sosa, a San Antonio advertising man and an architect of
Gov. George W. Bush's marketing campaign directed at Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are making an aggressive pitch this year for the
Hispanic vote, long seen as reliably Democratic, in part because
Bush has been successful in winning Spanish-speaking voters in
Texas. In Fresno, Calif., several weeks ago, the Republican
National Committee spent about $150,000 on a test run of a
commercial intended to attract voters of Latin American descent.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising time in New York for the English-language spot was
bought during WNBC's coverage of the parade, and the
Spanish-language version will be broadcast on the Telemundo
network, Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he recognized the telegenic potential of George
P., who is to begin law school in the fall, when he saw him work
the crowd at a meeting with farm workers in San Bernardino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   People there were so taken with him, Sosa said, ``they forgot he
was a Republican.''

GORE PLANS TOUR ON PROSPERITY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE with RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore plans to kick off a new
stage of his campaign next week, making a ``progress and
prosperity'' tour devoted to the relatively new questions of how
best to guide the nation in an era of budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would open the discussion on Tuesday in New York
City with a speech about protecting Medicare from what he called
``political poaching'' and reserving it for the use of the 40
million Americans for whom it was collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a turning point in our country's history,'' Gore, the
putative Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview here
Thursday. ``We've never had a debate about how to make decisions
concerning a large, continuing surplus, and there are a number of
big choices that we have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The decisions related to the surplus are no less
difficult or important than the decisions we have made concerning
the deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Medicare, he said he would delve into other questions,
including: ``How to use entitlements correctly; how to pay off the
debt more quickly in order to reduce interest rates and promote
more economic growth; and how to make the investments that are
needed in top priorities like education, to get people access to
the skills they need.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's new focus is less about Medicare than about
the ongoing debate over how best to take advantage of the nation's
newly found fiscal health. It is part of Gore's effort to sell
voters on debt reduction as a smarter alternative to the big tax
cuts advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his expected
Republican rival this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is also part of the Gore campaign's effort to put a positive
sheen on Gore's candidacy and to make explicit use of what his
advisers say is perhaps his best argument for being elected: the
unprecedented prosperity of the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not received much direct credit for that prosperity,
but the tour, to highlight the economic progress in states like
Pennsylvania and Ohio that will be major electoral battlegrounds,
should increase his association with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people deserve the credit for the strength of the
economy,'' Gore said. ``I think the policies of this
administration, which I've helped shape, have indeed unlocked some
of that potential and made it much more likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president frequently points to his association with
Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and one of the
nation's most respected financial analysts, as testimony to his
fiscal discipline, but he said that he came up with the idea of
putting Medicare into a ``lock box'' on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consult with Bob Rubin all the time,'' Gore said Thursday.
``But this particular proposal on the Medicare lock box I put
forward, and I hoped that he would react positively to it, and he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare surplus this year is projected by its trustees at
$22.3 billion, and to total $250 billion over 10 years. The surplus
comes from payroll taxes levied on employees and employers to pay
for hospitalization, nursing home care and other health benefits
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government's accounting rules, the Medicare surplus
has been considered part of the general government surplus, unlike
the surplus generated by Social Security, which both legally and
politically has been segregated from excess general government
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democratic and the Republican parties have agreed to
use the Social Security surplus, which amounts to more than $2
trillion over the next decade, only to reduce the national debt
held by the public. The public debt stands at $3.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the non-Social Security surplus over the next
decade range from $800 billion to nearly $2 trillion, depending on
what assumptions are made about how fast government spending will
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is relying on the non-Social Security surplus to pay for
his tax cut plan, which is valued at $1.3 trillion over the rest of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Medicare ``lock box'' proposal would reduce the amount of
money available for tax cuts by $250 billion, making it easier for
him to portray Bush's tax plan as fiscally irresponsible,
especially when added to Republican proposals for additional
spending on programs like national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been determined to avoid negative
references to Bush over the last few weeks. He said Thursday that
the intention of his Medicare proposal was not to make Bush's plan
seem riskier, but he would not be unhappy if a voter drew that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that makes it harder for someone to use the Medicare trust
fund for purposes other than Medicare, then that should be one of
the effects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would also restrict Democrats from using all of the
non-Social Security surplus for additional spending.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Horney, an analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, said of the Gore
plan: ``This is obviously an attempt to reduce the likelihood of
there being big tax increases or spending that would eat up the
surplus. If it helps to avoid big tax cuts or spending increases
before dealing with the long-term issues of Medicare and Social
Security, that would be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Medicare surplus, Horney said, ``It's not
nearly as much as the Social Security surplus, but it's still a
significant amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's lock box plan would not do anything to shore up Medicare,
which, without any changes, is expected to become insolvent around
2025. By earmarking the Medicare surplus for debt reduction, the
main economic effect of Gore's plan would be to underscore his
commitment to paying off the national debt by 2013 or sooner, a
path that he says would help keep interest rates down and stimulate
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But by setting up even an indirect tradeoff between Medicare and
tax cuts, Gore is returning to a political strategy that Democrats
have used successfully against Republicans for years: implying that
Republican tax cuts for the rich would endanger health insurance
for some of the nation's most vulnerable citizens.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MEMO SAYS DONOR WAS CLEARED 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a House committee released thousands of pages
of Justice Department documents on Tuesday about Democrats'
fund-raising activities, the papers included some that cast a new
and more forgiving light on the activities of Bernard Schwartz, a
top Democratic Party contributor and the chairman and chief
executive officer of Loral Space and Communications, a satellite
company.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Schwartz, who contributed about $1.5 million in 1996,
has lingered under a shadow of a Justice Department investigation.
That was because Schwartz's donations to the Democratic Party came
as Loral was seeking White House support for a waiver that would
allow the company to export satellite technology to China. The
inquiry into Schwartz was not closed until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., suggested at a hearing
that the former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance
unit, Charles G. La Bella, had, in a 1998 memorandum to Attorney
General Janet Reno, urged the appointment of an independent counsel
to investigate Schwartz's dealings with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But La Bella's memorandum of July 16, 1998, and an addendum on
Aug. 12, 1998, cast a fuller light on the matter. The documents,
which were made public by the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, show that La Bella never believed there was any evidence
against Schwartz and concluded that Schwartz had not broken the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a matter which likely did not merit any
investigation,'' La Bella wrote in his addendum. Portions of La
Bella's memorandums about Schwartz were first reported by The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a Loral spokesman expressed satisfaction that the
documents had finally come to light. ``We are pleased that the
facts in this case have now been made public and that Schwartz and
Loral are shown to be innocent of any wrongdoing,'' said Thomas B.
Ross, a company vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said in an interview that he did not realize at the
hearing that Schwartz had been exonerated by the Justice Department
because he had not seen La Bella's addendum. ``When I was
questioning him it was from his initial report,'' Specter said. ``I
did not know at that time there was a supplemental report.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first report La Bella suggested that the justification
for the inquiry into Schwartz was based not on evidence but on the
concerns of Justice Department officials that they could be
criticized if they did not investigate.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella wrote, ``Although no one could articulate a solid basis
upon which to predicate a criminal investigation, given the
political climate, it was generally felt that the department had to
commence an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   La Bella said in an interview that he never believed that there
was concrete evidence against Schwartz. He said he cited the matter
in his memorandum because of what he had concluded was a double
standard in which the Justice Department began an inquiry into
Schwartz over the contributions but refused to open an
investigation of Clinton.

WHITE HOUSE CANNOT RECOVER A YEAR OF MESSAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, under pressure to produce
thousands of lost e-mail messages sought by Congress, has informed
a House committee that it cannot find any backup records for
messages sent to or from Vice President Al Gore's office in 1998
and part of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Wednesday to the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee, Steven F. Reich, a White House lawyer, said
that because of a problem in the computer system, the White House
had no backup tapes for e-mail messages from March 1998 to April
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But a White House spokesman said Thursday that some of the
messages might still be found.
</P>
<P>
   Technical consultants have been trying to reconstruct thousands
of messages that were subpoenaed in congressional investigations
but were lost, apparently because of malfunctioning computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were aware of the problem in mid-1998, but
said they did not realize its scope or significance. Some
congressional investigators have said they suspect that the White
House may have used the computer problem as an excuse not to search
the e-mail records for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, congressional investigators said it might never be
known whether the vice presidential messages held information that
could have served as evidence at a time when the battle to impeach
President Clinton was at its height and the Justice Department was
investigating possible fund-raising abuses by the Clinton-Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, the White House spokesman, said Thursday that the
e-mail messages were lost in a system upgrade and that some might
still be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several ways some e-mails may exist, on the
computers of individual users, in hard copy or copies sent to other
White House users,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees of Northrop Grumman Corp., the company that
maintained the e-mail system, have said at hearings that White
House aides had told them to say nothing publicly when they
discovered that more than two years of e-mail messages were
missing.

 &HT;    Expect comeback of hack-a-Shaq
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So, what do you do with a man who rips you open
for 43 points and 19 rebounds, who makes two-thirds of his shots
and does it with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   When the question was put to Shaquille O'Neal after Game 1 of
the NBA Finals, he said, ``I'd just go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers won't do that, so the question remains. They
still have to try to stop the Lakers' 7-foot-1, 320-pound center.
</P>
<P>
   When your own team is soft in the middle and slow to react on
the wings, how do you prevent the most dangerous man in the NBA
from beating you into submission?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the hack-a-Shaq,'' analyst and former NBA coach Kevin
Loughery said Thursday. ``I mean, the guy took 31 shots (and made
21) and only took six free throws, four of which came on
three-point plays. So, they didn't make him do it from the line. I
don't understand that. You've got to foul him, and you do it with
everyone except (power forward) Dale Davis because that's the guy
you can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers lack the depth and quickness to challenge O'Neal as
Portland did in a seven-game Western final. But Loughery says they
can stymie him by using a cadre of players to prevent the league
MVP from catching the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand in front of Shaq,'' Loughery said. ``Put guys in front
of him on the strong side of the floor. That's what Portland did.
You can ignore (Ron) Harper and Kobe (Bryant), as long as he's on
the perimeter. Now you have numbers, and they can't find Shaq to
get it to him. The other guys have to make outside shots. If they
can't, L.A.'s in a lot of trouble. That's why I still think Indiana
has a chance in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird said his Pacers must make dramatic changes today.
``After the way Shaquille laid us up last night, obviously we're
going to try to be more aggressive. We got there last night on the
double teams, but it wasn't aggressive. If you come down there soft
on him, he'll make you pay every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird agreed that O'Neal must be forced to the line in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's going to take 30 shots, he should go to the line
12, 14 times. There will be situations we might have to foul him,
if he gets the ball too close to the basket. Last night it looked
like Rik (Smits) had his hands on the ball several times, and Shaq
went and powered through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird sees no easy fix. ``It's going to be tough. No question.
It's not an easy series for us. The matchups aren't good. They're a
quick team. They're big with Shaq and strong. They're able to score
points in bunches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' defensive strategist, Dick Harter, says the Pacers
must be more attentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have to give more fouls. Portland had (Arvydas)
Sabonis, who is stronger (than Smits) with a wider base, and Brian
Grant. Beside that, they've got Scottie Pippen and Rasheed Wallace
back there one step off, and they can be effective. If we're one
step off, we might as well be out back posing for holy pictures.
We've got to get nose to nose and get tough on them. If we don't
come out of this with bloody noses and skinned-up knees, we won't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Harter wants to see if the Pacers can come back from a soaking,
as they did in previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got backed up into Lake Michigan by Milwaukee one night,
came back and won the series. We got shoved into the Hudson River
and embarrassed by New York and came back and dominated. This time
we put our toes in the Pacific, and we'll see what happens.''

PULVERIZED PACERS TRYING TO SLOW DOWN O'NEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, Shaquille O'Neal
rumbled through Indiana with such force that the Pacers probably
felt as though they were in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers center scored 43 points and overpowered
them for 19 rebounds, as the Lakers shook up the Pacers in winning
the opener of the best-of-seven championship series, 104-87.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a Pacer to do in order to prevent another devastating
attack from Shaq in Game 2 at 8 tonight at the Staples Center?
</P>
<P>
   ``After the way Shaquille laid us up \RWednesday\S night,
obviously we're going to try to be more aggressive,'' Pacers coach
Larry Bird said. ``We got there on the double teams, but it wasn't
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come down there soft on him, he'll make you pay for it
every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits was no match for O'Neal as he fouled out trying to
defend the self-proclaimed ``Big Aristotle.'' Sam Perkins and Dale
Davis also tried to guard O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would defend himself, O'Neal said: ``I wouldn't. I
would just go home. Or fake an injury or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said there will be situations where he'll advise his team
to intentionally foul O'Neal so he has to work on his weak
free-throw shooting. O'Neal, who was only 1-of-6 from the
free-throw line in Game 1, bristled at that philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't worked yet,'' he said. ``So, no need for me to make
it work now.''  &QL; 
Jackson thrives
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Shaquille O'Neal's performance in Game 1 and Reggie
Miller's off night was the fact that Pacers point guard Mark
Jackson played perhaps his best game of this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was 6-of-8 from the field and contributed seven assists
and five rebounds in 28 minutes. He was playing in the late crucial
minutes, a time when Jackson is normally on the bench in favor of
Travis Best.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was glad he was able to show he still can be efficient
at critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is they're trying to disrupt our offense,'' he
said. ``But all I have to do is remain aggressive and try to put
pressure on them offensively.''  &QL; 
Miller: Lakers not tough
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller dismissed the Lakers as anything but a physical
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't physical at all,'' Miller said of the Lakers'
Game 1 showing. ``Our last two series \Ragainst New York and
Philadelphia\S were physical. This is nothing.'' Former TCU
standout guard Mike Jones scored a team-high 18 points in leading
the NBA Ambassadors to a one-sided 96-74 victory over the CTBA
all-stars in a game played yesterday in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the opener of a 20-game season for the
Ambassadors.]  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for the Pacers is that in their 15-year history
playing in the NBA, they are 0-11 in playoff series in which they
lost Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have won Game 1 won three championships.

LAKERS EXPECT MILLER TO FIRE RATHER THAN RETREAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last summer during a chance meeting at an area
gymnasium, Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant and Indiana Pacers
guard Reggie Miller decided to share some secret information about
their basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Bryant didn't teach Miller everything he knows.
After going 1-of-16 from the field and scoring just seven points in
the Pacers' 104-87 loss to the Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals
on Wednesday, Miller might be tempted to seek more advice from
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who joined Ron Harper in defending Miller, said their
chance meeting last summer was interesting, with Miller showing him
how to come off screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just taught him some basic skills, the crossover dribble
between the legs, and kind of being creative with the basketball,''
Bryant said. ``He did a good job getting to the basket \Rin Game
1\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't have the hops to put his elbow on the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller might not have had any hops, but the Lakers expect him to
bounce back in Game 2 at 8 tonight at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the first five times he has a chance, the ball will be
flying up,'' Harper said. ``I expect every time he touches the ball
he'll fire it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's performance Wednesday was the worst of his postseason
career, and the third-worst in NBA Finals history. Seattle's Dennis
Johnson (1978) and Baltimore's Chick Reiser (1948) each were
0-for-14 from the floor in their respective championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Miller refused to credit the Lakers for his dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of my 16 shots, 11 of them were wide open,'' he said.
``And as a shooter, you know you encourage that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep shooting. It can't get any worse; it can
only get better. So I'm going to shoot my way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said he was going to defend Miller the same way he did in
Game 1. When asked how he defended Miller, Harper was quick to say:
``I didn't do anything. He missed shots. He missed wide-open
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers know Miller can get hot like he did when he closed
out the Eastern Conference Finals by scoring 17 points in the
fourth quarter against the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hits any shot right now, for him it could start him off
on a pace where there's a fire that would be hard to put out,''
Lakers forward Rick Fox said. ``One-for-16 is not characteristic of
shooting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you don't want to get him started. You don't want to give
him any kind of light, or give him the same kind of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's shooting woes in Game 1 probably would have been easier
for him to accept if this wasn't the NBA Finals. Add that to the
fact that Miller _ he grew up here, his parents still live here,
and he played at UCLA _ had friends and family members at the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Miller was even talking about trying to concoct some
hatred for the Lakers, much like he despises the Knicks. He figures
that mindset could jump-start his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any bad feelings about LA, but you know you need
that extra motivation,'' Miller said. ``You need to create that own
little something to get you ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've created that myself by going 1-for-16 in Game 1
of my first- ever NBA Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers coach Larry Bird remains confident in Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one that's taken us through the playoffs, and he's
played extremely well this year in the playoffs,'' Bird said.
``That's why we're here now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie worked hard for me the last three years, not only in
the games but in practice. He gave me an honest effort at least
95-96 percent of the time. Obviously he's not happy with his \RGame
1\S performance, but I'll never give up on the guy.''

BELMONT HARD TO FIGURE DESPITE HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports sometimes gives us things that are difficult to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Look to Paris. No American-resident singles player made it past
the quarterfinals of the French Open this week, marking the first
time since tennis' ``open'' era began in 1968 that Americans have
performed so poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Look to New Jersey. Didn't you hear more than once that the team
that advanced past the Stars-Colorado Avalanche series could go
ahead and hoist the Stanley Cup? So who are these Devils guys?
</P>
<P>
   Look at New York. For the first time since 1970, the winners of
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes both will miss the Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   When the rest of the sports world reads about these items,
people lose interest. There must be a lake to swim in on Saturday,
a flea market to browse through.
</P>
<P>
   But junkies don't ditch their sport. Tennis fans will tune in to
the French Open and watch unknowns Franco Squillari and Magnus
Norman play in the semifinals, even though the rest of us have no
idea who those guys are. And horse racing fans will go out to the
track to bet on Aptitude and Appearing Now, even if those horses
were also-rans in previous races.
</P>
<P>
   What the average sports fan thinks is a dud, a horse racing fan
thinks is a good betting race. And if this Belmont turns out like
the 1970 Belmont, this will be a good betting race.
</P>
<P>
   When Derby winner Dust Commander skipped the '70 Belmont and
Preakness winner Personality was scratched out of the race, High
Echelon won the Belmont at odds of 9 to 2. Needles N Pens finished
second and paid $11.80 to place. Third-place Naskra was 9 to 1. My
Dad George, second in the Derby and Preakness, was a 6 to 5
favorite but finished off the board.
</P>
<P>
   If they had offered an exacta or trifecta in those days, the
exacta would have paid an easy three-digit price and the trifecta
would have threatened or surpassed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone trying to find a historical trend from 1970 to help them
in betting the race this year likely will be frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   High Echelon won the Belmont after running third in the Derby
and fourth in the Preakness. That sounds kind of like Impeachment
this year, third in the Derby and third in the Preakness. But High
Echelon also raced at Garden State Park in between the Preakness
and Belmont and finished fourth in that race.
</P>
<P>
   Needles N Pens and Naskra both raced competitively (first and
third respectively) in the '70 Peter Pan before the Belmont. So
this year's Peter Pan winner Postponed, second-place finisher
Unshaded and third-place finisher Globalize could run well in the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   My Dad George ran second in the '70 Derby and lost the Preakness
by a neck before throwing the dud in the Belmont, so does that mean
Impeachment (the only horse this year to finish on the board in the
Derby and Preakness) is due to go backward?
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded is a supplemental nomination, a horse whose owner had
to pay an expensive late entry fee. There was one of those in 1970,
too. Delaware Chief won a race at Belmont, which encouraged his
owners to pay the late entry fee. He was 5 to 1 (Unshaded's
morning-line odds are 5 to 1), but Delaware Chief finished ninth in
the field of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Trends or trash? The only thing history dictates is that this
year's Belmont _ without Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus or Preakness
winner Red Bullet _ is still a race worth a look, and a bet.

RANGERS NEED TO GIVE YOUNG PITCHERS A LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Clark's time has come and gone. The time has come instead
for the Rangers to take a hard look at their starting rotation and
see if some of their young pitchers can actually do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Matt Perisho, then Ryan Glynn and finally Doug Davis.
Keeping them stuck in the bullpen or Triple A isn't doing them or
the Rangers any good. They've been developed. Now it's time for
trial by fire.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if the Rangers are in a pennant race. At least
one of the three should be able to improve on Clark's 8.15
earned-run average and be able to give the Rangers six decent
innings on a regular basis. Clark was once able to do that, but
continuing to hope he can recapture that form is only wasting
valuable time that could be used looking at some of the young
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Because, come August, the Rangers must decide on a fifth
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho should get first crack because he's sitting there taking
up a roster space based on potential alone. The Rangers are afraid
to expose him to outright waivers because they might lose him to
another team, but they'll never know how good he can be if they
never pitch him.
</P>
<P>
   So let him pitch against the Tampa Bay Devils Rays on June 17
and put Clark in the bullpen. Give Perisho] two or three starts and
see what he has. If Perisho does the job, he stays, Glynn and Davis
keep pitching in Triple A and Clark works in middle relief. It
might be 10 cents on the dollar in return for Clark's $5 million
salary this season, but at least it's something.
</P>
<P>
   If Perisho can't do the job, then bring Glynn back after the
All-Star break and give him a month to do the job. His 2-0 victory
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday suggests he would be
fine. But if he should falter, then it would be time for Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, one of the three ought to be able to serve as a fifth
starter. If not, the Rangers are doing a lousy job developing
pitching in their farm system.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers need to start finding out now, and not just
because Clark is struggling. Both Kenny Rogers and Darren Oliver
have missed time because of shoulder trouble and that might be a
recurring problem all season. Oliver especially should be a concern
considering his arm history and that he has complained about his
shoulder after each of his past two starts.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some long-term considerations, starting with
Esteban Loaiza, who is 3-3 with a 4.99 ERA. Loaiza is raking in
$2.65 million and is eligible for arbitration next year. The
Rangers still harbor hope he'll be a big winner, but if he's not,
he's going to get too expensive. If the Rangers have to make a
decision about him it would be made much easier if they had a
better idea about some of their young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since the Rangers had a young pitcher
come up from the farm system, break into their rotation and stay
there for an extended period. Oliver did so, but only after a year
in the bullpen (1994) and a year of arm trouble (1995). Roger
Pavlik came close but could never stay healthy. After that you have
to go back to Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rangers have either bought their pitching through
free agency or traded for it at the expense of good young talent
like Ryan Dempster, who was sent to Florida in the 1996 John
Burkett trade and is now the best pitcher on the Marlins' staff.
But some of that money is going to be needed elsewhere this winter
to give Rusty Greer a three-year, $21 million contract extension,
to re-sign John Wetteland or to extend Tim Crabtree's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said one of his goals all
along was to start developing young pitching in the farm system.
The time has come to give it a chance.

   ARLINGTON _ Former Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin has turned
out to be a great free-agent signing for the Colorado Rockies. He
is hitting .330 with a .420 on-base percentage as the Rockies'
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He also has become a dangerous base stealer. Goodwin has 26
stolen bases in 30 attempts, which has helped the Rockies' overall
running game. They are second in the majors behind the Florida
Marlins with 58 steals in 78 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just puts so much pressure on the defense and makes
pitchers speed up their deliveries,'' Colorado manager Buddy Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies will put their running game to the test this weekend
against Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who has led the major
leagues in throwing out base stealers for five consecutive years.
The Rangers open a three-game series tonight at Coors Field in
Denver.  &QL; 
Rangers sign four
</P>
<P>
   Rice outfielder Jason Gray, drafted in the 26th round of the
First-Year Player Draft this week, has signed with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also signed20th-round pick Tyler Martin, a second
baseman from Mississippi State, 21st-round pick Marion Gleason, a
right-handed pitcher from Bountiful (Utah) High and 23rd-round pick
Robert Evans, an outfielder from Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also signed three undrafted free agents:
right-handed pitcher Thomas Graham from Fresno State, right-handed
pitcher Reggie Rivard from Washington State and shortstop Leland
Swenson from College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers assigned Martin and Evans to Pulaski (Va.) of the
Appalachian League and sent the other five to the Gulf Coast
Rangers of the Gulf Coast League.

PETTY TRUCK TEAM MAKING STRIDES TOWARD RECOVERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A little less than a month ago, the
foundation of Petty Enterprises was rocked by the death of
19-year-old Adam Petty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petty, the first fourth-generation driver in NASCAR who made his
only Winston Cup start at Texas Motor Speedway in April, died May
12 after he crashed during practice for a Busch Grand National
event at New Hampshire International Speedway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His death was felt throughout racing, but yesterday at TMS,
Richard Petty, Adam's grandfather and NASCAR's king, was in the
garage making sure the entry he owns, Steve Grissom's No. 43 Dodge
Motorsports truck, was running well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Racing is the Petty family business, and life has continued at
the racetrack and at the shops in tiny Level Cross, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really hard to put into words what you felt or what you
feel now,'' said Grissom, who is in his first year in the Truck
Series. `` It has been a tough situation and is a tough situation.
But it really shows the character and the strength of the Petty
family and Petty Enterprises. Everybody is doing everything they
can to get through and move on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petty Enterprises is moving on after the devastating events in
May and the loss of family patriarch Lee Petty in April. Kyle
Petty, Adam's father, returned to racing last week at Dover, Del.,
and Richard met the media for the first time since Adam's death
before the Coca-Cola 600 last month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard was here this weekend overseeing his Truck Series
operation and will be in the pits for tonight's race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The shop ``is getting back to normal, and it is a whole lot
better this week than it was last week and each week it just keeps
getting better,'' said Travis Owens, the interim crew chief on
Grissom's truck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grissom enters tonight's Pronto Auto Parts 400k at the 1.5-mile
quadoval seventh in points, but that comes after a frustrating
couple of races. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, crew chief Fred Wanke left to ``pursue other
opportunities,'' and the team is using a two-crew-chief system in
which Owens, the team's jackman, makes calls at the racetrack and
Dale Smith, the shop foreman, oversees the operations during the
week at the race shop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Wanke left, Grissom finished 21st in Fountain,
Colo., which broke a streak of eight consecutive finishes of 11th
or better. Two weeks later, he finished a disappointing 26th at
Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The team seems to be rallying around Travis,'' Richard Petty
said. ``Really, the team hasn't run that bad; it's just that luck
hasn't been on our side lately. Luck is a strange thing. When it's
going your way it's your best friend; when it's not it's your worst
enemy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those two finishes dropped Grissom from third in the standings
to seventh, and Owens also talked about luck leaving the team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The first of the year we had all the luck we needed,'' said
Owens, who has been with the team since it was formed in 1996.
``The last couple of weeks we have run better than what we showed;
it's just luck has got to go in our way. When we get the luck back
on our side we will be all right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Texas could be the place where Grissom's luck returns.
Grissom qualified 20th for tonight's race, but he has had success
at the track in a Winston Cup car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 and 1998 Cup races, Grissom, who was driving for
Larry Hedrick, finished 10th after starting 42nd and 35th,
respectively. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Petty Enterprises has been around for 50 years and is still
going strong,'' Grissom said. They've been through all kinds, types
and sorts of situations. All the equipment is there for what we
need to win and basically it is just up to us.'' nn

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Lone Ranger had the ``William Tell
Overture.''
</P>
<P>
   Gil Favor, Rowdy Yates and the boys had that great ``Rawhide''
ditty _ ``Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on; Move
'em on, head 'em up, Rawhide! Count 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em
in, count 'em out; Count 'em out, ride 'em in, Rawhide!''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rockford didn't start solving cases, and the cops on ``Hill
Street Blues'' didn't leave the squad room to be careful out there
until the Mike Post music was cued. The gang at Cheers didn't begin
trading witticisms in earnest until we heard that they hung out at
the place ``Where Everybody Knows Your Name.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every hero _ and anti-hero _ has a theme song, it
seems. So why should baseball players be any different?
</P>
<P>
   While baseball players have requested music be played for them
for many years, the current practice of a song for almost every
player is a recent development.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers leadoff batter Luis Alicea walks to the plate as Salsa
music plays. Public address announcer Chuck Morgan turns down the
music, introduces Alicea, then turns it up again. The music stops
as the pitcher looks in for the sign.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Ivan Rodriguez steps in to a Ricky Martin
song. Rafael Palmeiro has ``Changes'' by 2pac, David Segui ``All
Along the Watchtower'' by Jimi Hendrix, Chad Curtis ``One of These
Days'' by FFH, and on it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes back to when the organ first came into play,''
Morgan said. ``The organist would come up with a little ditty that
would have something to do with the player's name or where he was
from. Then I think it's evolved into what we have now.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers have now is a song for almost every batter in
the lineup. The only exceptions are rookie Mike Lamb, who said he's
got other things to worry about, and veteran Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him not to play anything,'' Greer said. ``It doesn't
interest me, I don't guess.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. It interests just about everyone else on the team to
one degree or another. There are almost as many musical styles and
reasons for choosing songs as there are players.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, one of the most active players in choosing his own
music, has five songs play in rotation, all from the contemporary
Christian field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is what I do, but Christian is what I am,'' he said.
``I think it's good music, and it's also proclaiming what I'm
about. Actually, I listen to a lot of slower, worshipful-type
songs, but you're not going to play that in the stadium on your way
up to bat. The idea is kind of energy. For the setting, it works
good to have these songs. I really enjoy the lyrics. Those are
powerful songs that have great messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro also chose his song, ``Changes,'' because of the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to the whole song, it talks about change, how
things need to change for the better, making a difference in
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The player whose song perhaps best fits his role is closer John
Wetteland, who enters to ``Don't Fear the Reaper'' by Blue Oyster
Cult. But Wetteland said he didn't choose it off the title or the
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said what's your favorite, and it was the first thing off
the top of my head,'' he said. ``I just liked the song. It has
nothing to do with lyrics or anything like that. I like the guitar
work in it, I like the feel of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wetteland, most of the players picked their songs because
of the sound, not the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton usually asks that an old ``classic'' by
Funkadelic called ``Knee Deep'' be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of my favorite songs of all time,'' he said. ``The
guitar solo at the end is off the hook. The beginning part of it is
good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler also goes by the music, but his is the pulsating
rhythms of rap, the ``stuff I listened to growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the beat more than the lyrics,'' he said. ``Most guys
play something that gets them going, makes them feel good. But you
have to be real careful with the lyrics when you go with rap music.
It's a family ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The family ballpark not only is subjected to Kapler's rap, it
also rocks to Segui's Hendrix and Frank Catalanotto's Pearl Jam and
Creed, and dances to the Latino rhythms of Alicea's Salsa music and
the Martin song Rodriguez uses.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has been playing music for Rangers players since the
mid-to-late '80s. Former reliever Jeff Russell wanted to hear the
theme from ``Top Gun'' when he entered the game. Nolan Ryan, for
reasons no one is certain about, liked ``Don't Go Breaking My
Heart'' by Elton John and Kiki Dee.
</P>
<P>
   While only selected players used to request music, now almost
all of them want a special song to mark their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ring-leader in '96 was Bobby Witt,'' Morgan said. ``He got
a list together and kept me updated on what guys wanted to hear.
Then it went over to Mark McLemore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now clubhouse attendant Kelly Terrell is responsible for
rounding up the players' choices. Morgan doesn't care what style of
music they pick, but he does screen the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way a lot of today's music is, you've got to be real
careful on what you play,'' he said. ``I make sure we listen to it
and make sure it's OK to play. The last thing we want to do is
offend somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is a family ballpark.

WINNING WAYS HAVE FANS WANTING TO BE SHAQ OFF THE RACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Laker mania sweeps L.A., fans are flocking to
sports merchandise stores to load up on anything purple and gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest sales push I've had in the NBA
(merchandise) in 10 years,'' said Scott Damschroder, owner of the
Scorecard sports store in the Studio City neighborood. ``It's just
like Super Bowl week.''
</P>
<P>
   Damschroder said store sales of Shaquille O'Neal jerseys and
other Lakers gear shot up nearly threefold Wednesday, the day the
Lakers won Game One of the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, fans stopped by the store to buy dozens of
T-shirts to celebrate L.A.'s dramatic come-from-behind victory over
the Portland Trail Blazers to win the Western Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Scorecard is not the only company that is seeing brisk sales.
Stores throughout the area have been cashing in on the Lakers all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to be strong, but it has been strong the entire
year,'' said Craig Levra, president and chief executive officer of
Sport Chalet. ``There was an excitement in town the day Phil
Jackson got here, and all the Lakers fans' expectations are being
fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   National Basketball Association officials estimate that
postseason sales represent anywhere from 15 percent to 25 percent
of total merchandise sales, depending on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs and the finals are like our holiday season,''
said Chris Heyn, senior vice president of the NBA's global
merchandising group.
</P>
<P>
   Individual retailers also have a lot at stake in the closing
weeks of the NBA season. After the Lakers won the Western
Conference on Sunday, retailers such as Scorecard began stocking up
on Western Conference Champions gear that will be obsolete in a
matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a countdown,'' Damschroder said. ``You get this stuff,
and you only have 10 days to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levra said Sport Chalet does not usually stock up on Western
Conference gear, waiting instead to see if the local team goes all
the way to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a somewhat fickle town,'' he said. ``You have to win a
lot to get people excited. You have to win championships.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lakers do beat Indiana, retailers say they will be
ready with T-shirts and caps the next day. And other popular items
_ including shot glasses, beer steins, mugs, pins and wastebaskets
_ will not be far behind

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Kim Mulkey-Robertson admits to having been the
inquisitive type as a little girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nosy, I guess,'' the new women's basketball coach at Baylor
confessed.
</P>
<P>
   So, on that day more than 30 years ago when she saw a man drop
off a package on the Tickfaw, La., elementary school playground for
the physical education coach, she couldn't resist learning the
contents. She slapped her jeans, freeing small clouds of dust
accumulated from that spring day's recess football game as she
ambled over to the package. What she found was a stack of
application forms for summer Little League baseball that the PE
coach later passed out to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking that here he is giving out these forms to boys
that I play with on teams every day, and I'm better than any of
them are,'' Mulkey-Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   She stuffed an application into a back pocket. The form sat on
the desk in her room at home for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a deep thinker,'' Mulkey-Robertson said. ``I put a lot of
thought into it for a couple of days. There were no organized
summer activities for girls to compete in then. I just wanted to
play, and I knew all the guys I would be playing with and against,
because I played with them every day at school.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one night at supper, she handed the form to her father
and told him what she planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if that's what I wanted to do, to go for it,'' Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
   She showed up for tryouts dressed in her trademark jeans and
T-shirt, pounded the pocket of her red-white-and-blue glove and
walked straight to the pitching mound, where she proceeded to
handcuff most of the boys who tried to hit against her.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first player chosen in the draft. Later in the
summer, she made the all-star team as a pitcher, shortstop and
catcher _ five years before legal challenges forced Little League
Baseball in 1974 to change the rules to allow girls to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some people mouthed about it,'' Mulkey-Robertson
reflected. ``But really, in my hometown it wasn't a big deal.
People knew who I was because of my family. I had grown up in the
area. And they knew I could play. But it did kind of shock some
people that I made the all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot of lessons because of that ... that some
people don't learn until later in life. Although things were out of
my control sometimes, I didn't let it defeat me.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials kept her out of the all-star playoffs that year
on a thinly-veiled technicality, but Mulkey-Robertson persevered.
She moved up to Pony League the next season and made the all-star
team at that level, too. It was the start of one of the most
memorable athletic careers in Louisiana sports history, one that
will be capped tomorrow with her induction into the second Women's
Basketball Hall of Fame class in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the last time she shocked her peers.
\Nsubheds:Success came early From the moment she began playing
basketball, Mulkey-Robertson knew nothing but winning.
</P>
<P>
   She played on an undefeated basketball team in the eighth grade.
She led her Hammond (La.) High School basketball team to four
consecutive state championships in Louisiana's highest
classification. In July 1980, she was honored with her own day in
Hammond and commissioned an honorary state representative before
her adoring fans sent her off to Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Her life was only slightly less eventful playing for the Lady
Techsters, who won 130 games in her four years, including two
national championships. She played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team
that won a gold medal, after which she returned to yet another day
in her honor in the township of Tickfaw, where much of her family
had its roots and where she lived before moving to Hammond. The
street that runs in front of the Tickfaw elementary school was
renamed Kim Mulkey Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympics were the greatest experience of my life,'' said
Mulkey-Robertson, who married former Louisiana Tech quarterback
Randy Robertson in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter she settled in as an assistant coach for Leon
Barmore, where the winning continued, right up to this spring, when
the Lady Techsters made it to the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   It was always assumed Mulkey-Robertson would succeed Barmore
when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Mulkey-Robertson, however, shocked a university and legions of
longtime Lady Techster fans in April when she turned down a
four-year offer to succeed Barmore and accepted Baylor's five-year,
$1 million offer. After 20 years as a player and assistant coach,
the past four as Barmore's associate head coach, she was suddenly
gone. Barmore soon afterward came out of retirement to take his old
job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a stage in your life when you make decisions that
are challenging,'' Mulkey-Robertson said. ``And this is a challenge
ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who questioned how she could leave a college she spent
nearly 20 years at as a player and coach, Mulkey-Robertson said,
``I will always have a special place in my heart for Louisiana
Tech. How could I not? But I don't think there was a right or wrong
and there shouldn't have been a division.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people would step back, they should be happy for both.
Happy they could get Leon out of retirement because he's so loved
in the community. And happy for me because I had a belief, and I
gave 19 years of my life to that university.''
</P>
<P>
   At Louisiana Tech, the best she could have done was continue a
tradition. At her first news conference at Baylor, she said she
felt she had to escape from Barmore's shadow to make her own mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was very important to go where I felt my career
could develop,'' she said. ``At Louisiana Tech, we'd been to 13
Final Fours; it's hard to keep that going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulkey-Robertson's mother says the storm has passed over in
Louisiana, though she admits shock at her daughter's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got over it yet,'' Dru Mulkey said. ``But when I
asked her why, she said, `Momma, I've got a gut feeling that I'd
better do this.' And when she has a gut feeling, you'd better back
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulkey-Robertson's husband, Randy, fully supports his wife's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the choice she made was the best for her career,''
Robertson said. ``I have encouraged her to look for offers to
become a head coach for a lot of reasons. She passed on some
wonderful opportunities, but I'm 100 percent behind the choice she
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people haven't gotten over her decision, which she
grudgingly has conceded turned in part on Louisiana Tech's refusal
to give her a five-year contract. Barmore apparently remains so
sensitive about the turn of events and the feelings they stirred
that he declined to be interviewed. \Nsubheds:Ready to take off For
most, Mulkey-Robertson's memories and accomplishments as a young
woman would be enough for a lifetime. Now, however, she approaches
a new job in a place she never thought she would be.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year old first-year head coach looks to her future at
Baylor with the expected optimism of a rookie, calling the program
``a rocket ready to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   She has hired a staff and signed three players off a Grayson
County College team that won 36 of 37 games and finished third in
the NJCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But her heart will always be back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the country with aunts, uncles and grandparents
down the road,'' she said. ``My grandparents had a dairy and
strawberry fields, where they later built a ball field when they
became too old to tend the strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was old before my time. I never got into riding
around the drive-in. My idea of fun was sitting on the porch
drinking a Barq's root beer and talking to my grandmother, then
going to a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dru still has one problem. Standing in her yard is a large
birdhouse that Kim received as a gift last year from inmates she
visited at a Louisiana prison, where an original 20-minute talk
turned into a three-hour discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That birdhouse is one of her most prized possessions,'' Dru
said. ``But it's painted red, white and Columbia blue, which are
Louisiana Tech's colors. I've got it up, but now I need a Baylor
flag to put on the top.''

POLICE GET A BOOST WITH ELECTRIC BIKES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police officers who patrol the streets of Chicago
on bikes are about to receive some motorized help in an effort to
reduce fatigue and lengthen the amount of time they're on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's ComEd, an electric energy company serving Northern
Illinois, has placed an order with Currie Technologies for 130 of
their electric bicycles, a Currie official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bikes will be donated to 100 police departments in Chicago
and Northwestern Illinois, said Ken Justice, executive vice
president of Currie Technologies, based in the Los Angeles suburb
of Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the largest single order for police bikes in
the history of the industry were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Justice said the ``Law Enforcement Special,'' which can be
pedaled normally until officers activate the battery propulsion
system, is a modified 27-speed Fuji mountain bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the system is that it's on demand,'' said
Justice. ``It gives bike police officers a greater range, and the
power allows them to respond quicker to an emergency call.''
</P>
<P>
   The bikes are also designed to reduce officer fatigue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech bicycles are powered by the company's patented
direct drive propulsion system, which utilizes a 24-Volt brushless
DC motor, for instant acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of bikes will be delivered next week, with the
balance of the order delivered over the next couple of months, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fuji Police Special bicycles are modified at the company's
Van Nuys plant, he said. Each bicycle is equipped with pursuit
lights, sirens and a storage bag for police equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech bikes also feature an oversized lightweight
aluminum alloy frame and is rugged enough to work in all weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with Fuji and then adapt the bike to fit our power
systems that drives the motor,'' Justice said. ``The engine can
provide enough torque for speeds up to 18 miles per hour to help
climb any hill encountered.'

CWS ENDS TEXAS FANS' DOUBTS ABOUT COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Two years ago, as the Texas baseball team
struggled through the program's first losing season since 1956,
second-year coach Augie Garrido stopped construction on a house he
was building in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Garrido _ who had lifted Cal State Fullerton from
supreme obscurity to glittering prominence with three national
titles _ said simply, ``Thank God I didn't get this job when I was
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 61, Garrido is young again and the Longhorns (46-19) are
here to face LSU at 6 p.m. tomorrow in their first College World
Series engagement in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 28th trip overall for Texas and the eighth for Garrido
_ who won a national championship on his last visit with Fullerton
in 1995. Although he is third on the all-time career list with
1,284 victories, he had begun to wonder if he and the Longhorns
would ever do this together.
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to put Texas back where it belongs, where it
has been so many times in the past,'' Garrido said. ``The longer
the drought went on, the more impatient the fans became.''
</P>
<P>
   Hired as Cliff Gustafson's replacement, Garrido arrived in the
fall of 1996 with a respect for Texas traditions that bordered on
reverence. There were other aspects of the situation, however, that
offered a rude awakening.
</P>
<P>
   One was the state of the program, which had begun to slip
talentwise and was no longer the dominant force in a region of
programs that made annual postseason appearances. Another was the
cherished dream of those programs to rub Bevo's nose in the dirt at
every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   A mediocre year was followed by the unthinkable _ a losing
season _ before the 'Horns finally made it back to postseason play
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an adjustment, really, a matter of adjusting to a
totally different environment,'' Garrido said. ``I had to make some
changes, and there has been pressure and a lot of passionate
feelings involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebuilding it has taken time ... in some people's minds, too
much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Harmon, a former UT player who has been an assistant coach
there for 12 years, said, ``Augie had won three national
championships coming in here, but this place is an adjustment for
anybody. I doubt if there is a program in the country where you
have the pressure you have here. It's been a tremendous load on him
and he's handled it well.''
</P>
<P>
   One particular oddity manifested itself immediately: in
Garrido's first three years, the Longhorns went 15-11-1 against
national powers Southern Cal, Stanford, LSU and Miami, Fla., but
were cuffed around so much by the locals that Garrido said, ``This
year, we wanted to beat Baylor so badly that we rendered ourselves
incapable of playing effectively against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have things here _ such as the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M rivalry _
that almost exceed anything you find elsewhere. I learned quickly
that the `X' in `Texas' is where you shoot the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``And obviously, there are people who don't think I should be
the coach. But we have finally built the kind of team we wanted.
This is the first group that has totally bought into what we were
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time-tested Garrido style, it is a team long on pitching
and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs? The Longhorns have hit 31 of them _ putting them one
ahead of LSU's Brad Cresse, the national leader. They have also set
an NCAA record with 126 sacrifice hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I wouldn't mind it if we had more power,'' Garrido
said. ``I honestly prefer the home run _ it requires less teaching.
But it will probably be our style, most of the time, to manufacture
runs as a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is rarely a problem, with even the outfielders turning
double plays, and the second base//shortstop tandem of Tommy
Nicholson and Todd West is officially the best in the nation with a
.974 percentage that does not take into account the runners they
have thrown out while down on their knees or flying through the
air. They also rank fourth among keystone combos in hitting, with a
combined .338 average.
</P>
<P>
   As for pitching, Beau Hale (12-5) is a first-round draft choice
(Baltimore), with a fastball that has hit 99 mph, the most recent
outing being a three-hit, 12-strikeout shutout of Penn State in the
final of the Super Regional. Starter D.J. Jones (12-5) is battling
a sore arm, which could turn the spotlight on Phil Seibel (5-1),
who missed 10 weeks with arm problems but beat Arizona State in the
regionals. Closer Charlie Thames is third in the nation with 19
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the iceberg. More to come in future reels. And the house?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not built yet,'' Garrido said. ``But I'm working on it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All-oval all the time, the Indy Racing
League is providing a clearly defined paved path to the
Indianapolis 500 for aspiring all-American drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ray, Scott Sharp, Mark Dismore, Robbie Buhl, Davey
Hamilton, Jeff Ward and Sarah Fisher all fit the born-in-the-USA
model envisioned by IRL founder Tony George when he launched the
open-wheel series in January 1996. But the league never has
operated as a closed shop, offering equal amounts of opportunity
and frustration to a steady lineup of foreign-born drivers. Five of
the 27 drivers entered for the Casino Magic 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway tomorrow night are foreigners, ranging in experience and
from two-time Indy 500 runner-up Scott Goodyear of Canada to series
rookie Shigeaki Hattori of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into its 39th race, the IRL acronym easily might stand
for International Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll ever have just an all-American series,
and I don't think that was Tony's intention by any means,'' said
team owner Dick Simon, who fields the car driven by series regular
Stephan Gregoire of France. ``Tony wasn't saying we don't want any
foreign drivers. He never said that. Tony was trying to make it an
all-American series that anyone could come to.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the most needed series in automobile racing
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost containment and the opportunity for all comers to compete
with equal equipment remain key ingredients of George's formula for
the renamed Indy Racing Northern Light Series. While Ray, the
reigning series champion from Plano, has been among the format's
biggest benefactors, the league also helped accelerate the
open-wheel career of Sweden's Kenny Brack. The 1998 IRL champion
and winner of the 1999 Indy 500, Brack parlayed his success in this
series into a ride with Team Rahal in the rival Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, whose background is in European road racing, joined the
IRL with Galles Racing in 1997 after a Formula One test program
with the lackluster Arrows team. With no oval-track experience and
without benefit of financial backing from a major corporate
sponsor, Brack rolled the dice with the IRL _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an attraction for foreign drivers to come and race in
the States, to begin with, because of the Indianapolis 500,'' said
Eddie Cheever Jr., an IRL owner/driver whose background includes
stints in Formula One and CART. ``A lot of foreigners have won the
Indianapolis 500. You can't begrudge somebody for wanting to run in
the States, anymore than you could begrudge Kenny Brack for wanting
to come and race in the IRL.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, a native of Toronto and defending champion of the TMS
spring event, said the IRL offers several incentives to aspiring
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the draw of gaining experience in high-horsepowered,
open-wheel cars,'' said Goodyear, driver for Pennzoil Panther
Racing. ``And it's having an opportunity to race at a lot of
diversified tracks _ one-mile, mile-and-a-half, high-banked tracks
and flat tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``And times have changed in the last decade. As a North
American, when I first went to Europe in the 1980s and tried to get
into Formula Three, they wanted nothing to do with me. Teams now
are going to take drivers and crew members who are the best people
for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL rookie Airton Dare of Brazil, homeland to F1 heroes Ayrton
Senna, Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet, said Brack's positive
experience definitely influenced his decision to run this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indianapolis is the biggest deal,'' said Dare, who joined
Rockwall-based TeamExtreme in December 1999 and raced as high as
third during the 84th Indy 500 last month. ``And the second thing,
I used to race in Indy Lights, a series that's a `school' for CART.
I was talking to both IRL and CART at the end of last year, and I
figured out the teams I was talking to in CART were going to be
teams that if you really do well, you finish top 10. Since I
started my career in Jet-Ski, I like to win races and be fighting
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series, you are motivated every race. You can win every
race, if you do everything right. You can show what you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lopes, team manager for TeamExtreme, said Dare's
nationality did not factor into the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an evaluation of talent,'' said Lopes, who has paired
Dare with IRL veteran and grassroots racer Davey Hamilton. ``We
looked at Airton's oval record, and if his car was running at the
end of the race, he was always in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we would love to have all-American drivers in the cars.
Davey Hamilton, he fits the bill of what the IRL has been all
about. And I think Airton does as well. He just happens to be
Brazilian.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, whose primary sponsorship is provided by aircraft
insulation manufacturer Mexmil, has brought a distinguished list of
drivers to open-wheel racing in the States. Simon and his wife,
Dianne, have fielded cars for Dutchman Arie Luyendyk, before he won
two Indy 500s; IRL regular Eliseo Salazar of Chile; Raul Boesel of
Brazil; and Americans Jimmy Vasser, Scott Brayton, Scott Pruett and
Lyn St. James.
</P>
<P>
   But one driver Simon could not work out a CART deal for was a
young Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where Jeff Gordon decided to go to NASCAR,'' Simon
said. ``He came and talked to me way back, me and many of the
owners. All he got was turned down, because he didn't have enough
money to get a ride in CART, or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 28, has won 50 Winston Cup races and three championships
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Americans, Michael Andretti and Vasser, currently have
permanent rides in CART. While that has made the series an easy
target for critics who contend foreign drivers are buying up those
rides, Cheever said it is easy to understand an owner's thought
process when trying to secure a $12 million to $15 million CART
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``On equal footing, with the same amount of backing for one
driver and another, I would go obviously for talent,'' Cheever
said. ``I wouldn't even care about gender. The IRL allows you to do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've _ Tony George _ made Indy very accessible and
competitive. And the tires do not know if you are from Mars, from
Venus, if you are male or female, black or yellow, old or young.
The tires have a certain amount of grip, and every driver has to
decide how hard they're going to push 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you have the ability and the will, you will make it.
And you will enter a car in the Indy 500.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Cheever describes the International
Race of Champions series as ``racing against the good ol' boys in
good ol' boys' cars.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's ``good ol' boys'' will race at their convenience, too.
</P>
<P>
   The third leg of the IROC series will be contested tomorrow at
Michigan Speedway, site of the Winston Cup Kmart 400 on Sunday.
That means Cheever, Mark Dismore and Plano's Greg Ray will be
forced into double duty with the Casino Magic 500 scheduled
tomorrow night at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The three Indy Racing League drivers plan to practice until 5:15
tonight at Texas Motor Speedway's 1.5-mile quadoval before
departing for Brooklyn, Mich., to compete in tomorrow's 11 a.m.
IROC race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, really enjoy it,'' Cheever said of the IROC series,
``but it is a bit of a pain in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, Dismore and Ray plan to fly to Michigan tonight on the
Challenger jet of IRL founder Tony George. The three plan to return
to Fort Worth tomorrow afternoon on George's jet before racing in
the Casino Magic 500, scheduled for 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRL is my primary series, and it's going to be a little
bit of a physical struggle,'' Ray said. ``First time I've done two
races in a single day on opposite ends of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would a driver put himself through such a harried day?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pain,'' Cheever said, ``but I'm happy to be doing it
because the IROC is a very prestigious series.''
</P>
<P>
   The IROC series pits drivers from the IRL and NASCAR's Winston
Cup Series in 12 identically prepared Pontiac Firebirds. The
four-race series concludes Aug. 4 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty hectic lifestyle,'' Ray said. ``The thing is
knowing you have good people around you, and it's a lot easier to
handle when you're confident that you have good cars and people
around you and you do what you do _ and that's drive the race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's prestigious for me, and whether you finish first, fifth
or last, all you can do is critique what you've done and try to
learn. With having a race later in the day, it puts a premium on
not getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what effect will the doubleheader have on the three IRL
drivers?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I fare well,'' Ray said, ``I can see doing it in the
future.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Greg Biffle's eyes widened when he started
talking about whether there was any speed left in his Ford F-150
race truck after winning the pole for tonight's NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series event.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle, driving the No. 50 Grainger.com Ford Truck owned by Jack
Roush, will start inside the front row for tonight's Pronto Auto
Parts 400k at Texas Motor Speedway after a hot lap yesterday of
178.130 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It might not have been a record lap, such as has been common
when the Truck Series comes to TMS, but Biffle said with NASCAR's
aerodynamic package for this weekend, his truck performed nearly
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys may have wiggled and had a little bit of speed left
to give,'' said Biffle, who is second in Truck Series standings.
``But that was as fast as the thing would go.''
</P>
<P>
   Biffle heads an all-Ford front row, with Rob Morgan starting
second after posting a speed of 177.760 mph. It's the best start of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's champion, Dennis Setzer, will start third after a
lap of 177.334 mph in his No. 1 Mopar Performance Dodge. Marty
Houston had the fastest Chevrolet at 176.257 mph and will start
fourth. Rookie Kurt Busch, Biffle's teammate, will start fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost had a race setup when we qualified, and that is
good,'' Setzer said. ``With the new package that NASCAR has, the
good trucks are going to be able to run wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying speeds were slower this year because of a new
aerodynamic package NASCAR implemented for the boxy trucks at the
1.5-mile quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   The rear spoiler was raised from seven to eight inches, and the
angle on it was increased from 55 degrees to 65 degrees. Also,
NASCAR made modifications to the front end to create more drag,
which results in slower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The package is similar to what the series used at Daytona
International Speedway and will use at two-mile racetracks in
California and Michigan. After the Winston Cup-Busch weekend at
Texas, where speeds increased dramatically because of a new
Goodyear tire, NASCAR officials wanted to slow the trucks..
</P>
<P>
   Biffle said the new rules actually helped his Ford, which he
says has consistently been behind the Chevrolets and Dodges on the
superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cab, or greenhouse area, the Dodges are almost two
inches narrower than we are, and the Chevrolets are 11/2 inches
narrower,'' said Biffle, who gave Ford its first truck pole on a
track 11/2 miles and longer since1997. The Dodges and Chevrolets
``were probably a little bit tight, but the package has made the
trucks more stable and makes it easier to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   And making the trucks easier to drive could help create some
interesting racing tonight. Setzer said the draft, which has always
been a factor on the high banks at TMS, could be an even bigger
player in tonight's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR and Dodge have given us a safe package for a track like
this and still kept the aerodynamics competitive,'' Setzer said.
``If you can get it tightened up enough to run flat out, it could
be who can stay on the floor the longest.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was not talking about aerodynamics after he qualified
second, but how his team has continued to improve this season. For
the third time in four races, Morgan will start in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hired \Rformer Winston Cup crew chief\S Bill Ingle, and
under his direction, the team has come a long way,'' Morgan said.
``We also changed our motor program. So, it's just a lot of little
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Reffner, driving for Indy Racing Northern Light Series car
owner John Menard, will start sixth, Jamie McMurray seventh and
rookie Scott Riggs eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Houston, who is third in points, will start ninth alongside
series points leader and defending champion Jack Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what I ran, but it was wide open and pretty
uneventful,'' Sprague said. ``It was all she'd go.''

CUNNINGHAM SIGNS THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Quarterback Randall Cunningham became a Cowboy
yesterday when he signed a three-year deal that will pay him $1
million this season ($500,000 signing bonus, $500,000 base salary)
to be Troy Aikman's backup.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, will count $667,000 against the salary cap. His
contract essentially is a one-year deal because of what is believed
to be a sharp increase in base salary for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cowboys offensive coordinator Jack Reilly tried to
entice Cunningham into joining him in St. Louis. Reilly was the
Rams' offensive coordinator and Cunningham was an out-of-work
quarterback after 11 seasons in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked him out. I took him to dinner. I really got to like
him,'' said Reilly, who ended up not signing Cunningham, who sat
out the '96 season before signing the following year with
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham referred yesterday to Aikman as ``a gentleman who has
won three Super Bowls,'' then added, ``I think Troy and I are two
quarterbacks who can get along. I know my role _ and he's the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham and Aikman have radically different playing styles.
Together, they give the Cowboys a quarterback tandem that will
force opposing teams into extra preparation in case Aikman has to
come out of a game or is unable to start.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, without a playoff victory since 1996, are returning
to the same basic philosophy of offense that helped win three Super
Bowls in the 1990s, an offense best suited to Aikman's accuracy on
timing routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be adjustments that we're going to have to
see from Randall ... \Rbut\S he's going to fit in just fine here,''
said Reilly, who is eager to see Cunningham in action during the
Cowboys' upcoming mandatory minicamp, Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who missed two starts and parts of two other games
because of back-to-back concussions last season, now has a
change-of-pace backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to do all the timing stuff when \RCunningham\S
is in there,'' Reilly said. ``There's enough variety in this
offense that we can pick and choose what he's most comfortable in
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly was just as positive that there is no problem with Paul
Justin, who was signed three months ago to a $500,000 contract to
be Aikman's backup. The 31-year-old free agent has had 10 NFL
starts in five seasons with Indianapolis, Cincinnati and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't, in any way, want to minimize how much we care about
him,'' Reilly said of Justin, who will battle Cunningham for the
No. 2 job, or could possibly make the team if the Cowboys can find
a way to fit a $500,000 third-string quarterback's contract under
the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Patterson, Cowboys defensive tackles coach, spent the past
two seasons with Cunningham at Minnesota, and marveled at the 1998
NFL Player of the Year's ability to be a loyal backup to Jeff
George, who became the Vikings' starter seven games into the '99
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall was still a leader in the locker room,'' Patterson
said. ``He was tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Cunningham, the Cowboys waived rookie
quarterback Charles Puleri of New Mexico State.

IRAN'S NEWEST NEWS SOURCE BROADCAST FROM AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   California's San Fernando Valley may be thousands of miles from
Iran, but a new satellite television station there is hoping to
provide the news and entertainment Iranians lack from sources
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting from a modest North Hollywood studio _ which was
shown off during its official launch Thursday _ National Iranian
Television produces news and talk shows focusing on Iranian culture
in America. The Farsi-language station also creates original pop
music videos and broadcasts classic Iranian movies.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcasts are sent by satellite to Iranian communities
throughout the world _ including to Iran itself, where the station
claims to provide the only native-language news not regulated by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   NITV, as it is known, has been broadcasting since March. Station
executives don't have exact audience figures, but said it is
possible for 74 million people around the globe to receive its
signal.
</P>
<P>
   NITV's founder and chief executive officer is Zia Atabay, a
popular singer in Iran before the 1979 revolution. He came to the
United States in 1980 for a concert, met his wife here and soon
settled in Los Angeles. Since then, he has remained involved in the
business side of the entertainment industry, including producing
Persian television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Atabay said the station is his way of linking Iranian people now
scattered across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to America following the revolution, it was my
dream to one day reunite my countrymen around the world, to combine
and share my cultural experiences as an American Iranian,'' Atabay
said.
</P>
<P>
   Atabay said the station does not have a political stance, and
simply seeks to report news as well as entertain Iranians
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   The station's news department has reporters in Paris, London,
Washington and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters in Iran, however, operate clandestinely, phoning
or faxing their reports without official government sanction.
</P>
<P>
   NITV News Director N. Sabetlmani said many people in Iran are
skeptical of the government-approved newscasts, and look to
independent voices like NITV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell the truth,'' Sabetlmani said.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, satellite dishes are technically illegal, but the
government does not actively prosecute dish owners, Atabay said. He
does not know how many people there watch his programming, but said
the station's talk shows get numerous calls from Iran, as well as
Europe, Africa and the United States.

CAMPAIGN NEWS AND NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS GORE ADDRESSES PRIVACY
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 20-year-old Amy Boyer of New Hampshire was killed by
a man who had bought her Social Security number for $45 from a Web
site and then tracked her down. Vice President Al Gore, who early
on took an interest in Internet and privacy issues, held several
discussions with her parents about ``identity theft'' and Thursday,
in a campaign stop in Whittier, Calif., he proposed making it a
federal crime to sell Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put security back in Social Security,'' Gore said, the
family at his side.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Democratic allies in Washington were introducing a
bill in Congress to make it a civil and criminal offense for
someone to sell or buy another person's Social Security number
without that person's consent. The Social Security Administration
logged 30,000 complaints of abuse of numbers in 1999, an increase
of 175 percent over 1998, and the theft of numbers accounts for
much of the increase in cyber crimes and identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS DISENCHANTED DONORS
</P>
<P>
   Political donors are still giving, but they are increasingly
disenchanted with the way campaigns are being run, a new poll has
found. In the survey, conducted by the Institute for Global Ethics,
a nonpartisan organization in Washington, 76 percent of the
respondents said attack-oriented campaigns were wrong, and 59
percent said such campaigns were on the increase. What to make of
that? Nearly half of the respondents said that in the future they
would be more likely to contribute to a candidate who ``publicly
signs a code of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Rourke, the institute's vice president, said, ``When even
the people who fund campaigns voice serious concern about the tenor
of campaigns and call for reform, it is clearly time for change.''
The survey covered 600 donors of all political persuasions whose
contributions ranged from $200 to $500, and was conducted from
April 25 to May 1. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THE OTHER CONTEST: A BOLD STAND ON BASKETBALL
</P>
<P>
   It's a free throw for Al Gore. Asked Thursday to pick the winner
of the NBA finals, the vice president blurted out: ``Lakers.'' Like
other politicians, Gore does not normally like to pick sides in
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in Los Angeles. And California, with the biggest
block of electoral votes, is crucial to his presidential bid.
Besides, the Lakers' rivals, the Pacers, are from Indiana, a small
state that almost always votes Republican. So what did he have to
lose when a local television reporter asked him which team he was
rooting for?
</P>
<P>
   In supporting the Lakers, Gore may also have been trying to
repay a favor to Shaquille O'Neal, the Laker star, who endorsed him
after Michael Jordan threw his support to Bill Bradley, Gore's
erstwhile rival. Asked what he would say to Pacers' fans, the vice
president said: ``I try to avoid the subject.''

FRESH SIGNS OF CONSOLIDATION IN NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newspaper industry, already radically changed this year by
the pending merger of Tribune Co. and Times Mirror, was reshaped
Thursday as one company offered itself for sale, a second
consolidated its dominance in daily circulation and a third moved
into first place in the sheer number of newspaper properties it
owns.
</P>
<P>
   Central Newspapers Inc., owner of The Arizona Republic, the
country's 11th-largest daily; The Indianapolis Star and four other
daily newspapers announced it was up for sale. The move would take
another multi-generation newspaper family, the Pulliams, out of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, a second announcement confirmed that Gannett
Co. and Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. were growing bigger by
buying the bulk of the 49 newspapers Thomson Corp. had put on the
block four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett is paying $1.13 billion for 21 daily newspapers in
Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah. With the
acquisition, the company enhances its dominance in the daily
circulation division. It will now own 94 newspapers, including its
flagship, USA Today, with a combined circulation of about 7
million. The 31 newspapers of No. 2 Knight Ridder have a combined
daily circulation of just under 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Community Newspaper Holdings, which is financed by the resources
of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, paid $455 million for 17
papers in Indiana, southern Georgia and the Appalachian region of
West Virginia and western Maryland. After the purchase, the company
will own 112 daily newspapers with a combined circulation of almost
1.1 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Van Essen, the president of Dirks, Van Essen &AMP; Murray, the
newspaper brokerage firm based in New Mexico, said Thursday that
these deals, coupled with the $8 billion purchase of Times Mirror
by Tribune Co. and a variety of other pending agreements were
likely to push the total amount of money spent on newspaper
purchases to $15 billion by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the newspaper industry, that is a breathtaking number, 150
percent higher than ever before. As Van Essen said, ``The previous
record was $6.2 billion in 1997, and we blew through that with the
Tribune deal alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Relative to other media segments, the amounts are still very,
very small,'' Van Essen said. ``There's going to be $40 billion of
TV that sells and $30 billion of radio and probably $50 billion of
cable. By newspaper standards, this is a lot of activity. But the
consolidation frenzy is just catching on with newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Central Newspapers _ whose stock symbol,
ECP, mirrors its founder's initials _ powered its stock to a 65
percent gain Thursday; the share price increased by $20.50, to $52.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the mergers, the vestiges of hometown newspapering
are fewer and fewer. The conservative Pulliam family _ one of whose
members is Dan Quayle, the former vice president _ was strongly
identified with Indianapolis, where it published two newspapers
until The Indianapolis News folded last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Favre, a vice president of McClatchy Co. whose tour in
newspapering has given him a close view of a generation's worth of
changes in the industry, said Thursday that the Pulliam family,
``meant a tremendous amount in Indianapolis _ like any great
publishing family.'' He added, ``It's a loss to any community to
lose a family like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale is the second instance this year of a
multi-generation newspaper family deciding to sell the business it
created.
</P>
<P>
   And, as with the Chandlers in Los Angeles, the controlling
shares of the company _ in Central's case, the Class B shares _
were held in trust for the Pulliam descendants. As with the
Chandler trusts, the Eugene C. Pulliam trust contained language
that posed a barrier to any sale.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trust document, the limitations on the
trustees' power to sell their Central stock ``shall become void''
if they determine that remaining independent would ``seriously
threaten'' to cause ``substantially complete loss'' of the shares'
value.
</P>
<P>
   But Central's dropping stock price _ before Thursday, it had
lost 20 percent of its value this year _ and the very high
valuations that newspapers have commanded recently helped create a
climate in which the three trustees _ the former chief executive,
Frank E. Russell; the current chief executive, Louis H. Weil; and
Myrta J. Pulliam, a granddaughter of the company's founder _
decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Weil nor Pulliam would comment on the decision when
contacted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Garner, the president of Thomson Newspapers, kept his
comments brief, saying that he was ``very pleased'' with the prices
the two companies paid for the 38 newspapers. Someone else who knew
the terms of the deal said that Gannett and Community Newspaper
Holdings paid prices that averaged about 12.8 times 12-month
earnings before interest and taxes. The sale of the remaining 11
daily newspapers in the United States is expected to be completed
within days. One source said there were four potential buyers,
including Media General, which is based in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Also out for bid are a large group of newspapers currently owned
by Hollinger International Inc., the company of Conrad Black, as
well as some smaller-circulation newspapers owned by The New York
Times Co. None of these match the size of The Republic, which has a
daily circulation of 482,000. The Republic's daily circulation
dipped slightly in the last reporting period, but not as much as
that of The Star, which dropped more than 8 percent, to 247,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, although no executives of likely buyers like Knight
Ridder and McClatchy would talk on the record about the prospects,
one who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ``Phoenix is a great
market. And Indianapolis is a community that is growing
tremendously.'' &QL;

 JEFF MacNELLY, 52, PULITZER-WINNING EDITORIAL CARTOONIST  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff MacNelly, who skewered presidents, politicians and the
pompous in editorial cartoons that won him three Pulitzer Prizes,
died June 8 in Baltimore. MacNelly, who was also the creator of the
syndicated comic strip ``Shoe,'' lived in Flint Hill, Va. He was
52.
</P>
<P>
   He had been under treatment for lymphoma since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although MacNelly, who worked for The Chicago Tribune, announced
in January that he would reduce his output while undergoing
treatment, he continued to produce ``Shoe'' and his editorial
cartoons until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in ``Microgoose,'' a cartoon about the government's
lawsuit against Miscrosoft, he depicted the government as an
ax-wielding executioner labeled ``Feds.'' Holding a severed,
bespectacled goose head above a goose torso not far from a carton
labeled ``Antitrust,'' Feds tells the head, ``We want you to lay
smaller eggs and make 'em square, so they fit in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   And last year, in a cartoon titled ``Bill 2001,'' a pudgy former
president is seen beneath a banner labeled, ``Somewhere in
Westchester Circa 2001.'' He is pushing a vacuum cleaner through a
living room while wearing an apron inscribed, ``A Woman's Place is
in the House and in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pat Oliphant and Garry Trudeau, MacNelly was regarded as
one of the nation's foremost political cartoonists, a profession
that calls for the combined talents of artist, social critic,
political analyst and humorist.
</P>
<P>
   He was only 24 and had worked for The Richmond News Leader for
little more than 16 months when he won the 1972 Pulitzer Prize for
editorial cartooning. He won again with The News Leader in 1978 and
with The Tribune in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In his first prize-winning portfolio was a cartoon dealing with
President Richard M. Nixon's difficulties with the economy.
Characteristic of the cartoons in his second prize-winning
portfolio was one that showed an IRS Form 1040 asking the taxpayer
how many talking chickens he owned and whether any of them played
the oboe. His third prize-winning portfolio dealt in part with the
1984 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 MacNelly abandoned editorial cartooning to devote
himself full time to ``Shoe,'' the comic strip he created in 1977.
It dealt with P. Martin Shoemaker, the irascible, cigar-chomping
editor of a daily newspaper called The Treetops Tattler, and its
staff of disheveled hacks. All of them were birds.
</P>
<P>
   MacNelly said he originally drew humans, ``but it was terribly
boring.'' He went on: ``But a bird smoking a cigar is an
interesting sort of bird. You really want to listen to him. And
you've got flying stuff and things in trees. It's kind of zany on
its face to have a bunch of birds walking around with clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1982, while continuing ``Shoe,'' MacNelly had decided to
return to editorial cartooning, and he joined The Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really missed editorial cartooning,'' he said. ``I thought
that through the strip I could vent my spleen and be funny at the
same time,'' he said. ``But when it comes to humor, there's no
substitute for reality and politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   He also illustrated the syndicated column of the humorist Dave
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his Pulitzer Prizes, MacNelly twice won the Reuben
Award, the highest accolade of the National Cartoonists Society.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey K. MacNelly, who was born in New York City, was reared
in Cedarhurst, on Long Island. The son of a portrait painter,
Clarence L. MacNelly, he attended the University of North Carolina,
where he worked on The Daily Tar Heel for Jim Shumaker, now a
professor, for whom he named ``Shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   MacNelly dropped out of college to take a $120-a-week job on The
Chapel Hill Weekly before joining The Richmond News Leader.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Susan, and two sons, Danny and Matt.
Another son, Jeffrey Jr., a 24-year-old editorial cartoonist for
The Aspen Times, died in 1996 of injuries sustained in a
rock-climbing accident.
</P>
<P>
   Like others in his profession, MacNelly cherished the days of
the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``When everybody is tuned into the same story, and
everybody is familiar with the details, you can go a lot further.
You can allude to various events and people, and you don't have to
label everything.''

ANGELS CAN'T HIDE FROM RANDY JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 WITH BOTTENFIELD ON DL-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- The Angels might have thought there were rid of Randy
Johnson when he left the Mariners, their counterpart in the A.L.
West. But Johnson, who considered signing with the Angels going
into the 1999 season, just won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will come off the disabled list and pitch tonight
against the Angels at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has enjoyed pitching against the Angels throughout his
career -- he's 14-6 with a 2.70 ERA against them in 25 games. The
14 wins against the Angels are the most by Johnson against any
other team (he also has 14 wins vs. Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Angels faced Johnson was March 15 in Tucson,
Ariz. in a spring training game. The Angels roughed up Johnson for
11 runs and 12 hits in three-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tim Salmon after the game: ``Any time you evaluate our
performance or his performance, hey, it's spring training. It feels
good, but at the same time you try not to get overly confident.
Because when the gun sounds he's going to have his A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   Good advice. Johnson is 9-1 with a 1.41 ERA and 131 strikeouts
in 95 2/3 innings. Johnson also has hit well, for a pitcher. He's
hitting .222 with five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield is the latest pitcher to go to the disabled
list. Bottenfield has tendinitis in his right shoulder, which has
limited his ability to pitch deep into games. In his past four
starts, he's pitched at least six innings only once.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield going to the DL saves Seth Etherton from a trip to
the minors. Because the Angels don't need a fifth starter again
until June 17, the Angels were able to called up bullpen help --
Lou Pote -- to replace Bottenfield on the roster and keep Etherton
in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield is 5-5 with a 5.21 ERA in 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton has made three starts for the Angels, and the last one
was his best -- four runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings vs. the
Giants. Etherton's biggest problem has been the home run ball. Of
his 17 hits allowed, seven have been home runs (16 1/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad was the runner-up for A.L. player of the month for
April after he hit .449 to tie Rod Carew for highest batting
average (minimum 75 at-bats) by an Angels player in any month. But
his name in the record book has already been erased.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Bengie Molina, who has emerged as the leading candidate
for Rookie of the Year, hit .461 in May to set the new record for
highest average in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS AT ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 at BankOne Ballpark
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: KCAL-9; KMPC-1540, KIK-FM 94.3, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Brian Cooper (2-1, 3.86 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Arizona's Randy Johnson (9-1, 1.41). Tim Salmon has two
career homers off Johnson, but overall is hitting .188 (9 for 48)
against him. Garret Anderson has never gotten a hit off Johnson (0
for 9). Mo Vaughn is hitting .333 (8 for 24) with two homers
against him.

MAN'S FARM REVEALS UNSAVORY SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout; subs headline)   By JO THOMAS with ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was a quiet man who
mowed his grass three times a week and grilled the hamburgers at a
neighborhood cookout two weeks ago. But the police say he had a
second life as well, using the Internet, where he called himself
``Slavemaster,'' to lure women into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the police arrested Robinson after two women, who say
they met him in local hotels for sadomaschostic sex, complained
that he assaulted and robbed them. The arrest took place Friday,
and then over the weekend, the police began to make a series of
grisly discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   A search of a farm Robinson owns in La Cygne, Kan., 57 miles
south of Kansas City, yielded two barrels sitting outdoors, swathed
in plastic. Inside were the bodies of two women. A second search,
of three storage units Robinson rented in nearby Raymore, Mo., 54
miles northeast, yielded three more 55-gallon drums and three more
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the women, Suzette Marie Trouten, 28, of Monroe
County, Mich., has been identified. The authorities say Trouten met
Robinson on the Internet, although they declined to discuss the
nature of the site. And as the investigation widens, the police
have linked Robinson to four other women and a baby who have also
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Morrison, the Johnson County district attorney who filed
the assault charges against Robinson on Friday, is now leading a
two-state task force investigating the suspect. Morrison said he
expected to file more charges against Robinson, who was being held
on a $5 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's lawyer, Byron Cerrillo, said his client would plead
not guilty to the sexual assault charges and to any murder charges
that might be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent the fact that people are now claiming that Mr.
Robinson, either directly or indirectly, is a serial killer,''
Cerrillo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Detective David Brown, the Lenexa, Kan., police officer acting
as a spokesman for the task force, said the police had been
investigating Robinson's connection to Trouten when they received
the assault complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has been investigating computer crimes for several
years, said the case underscored the importance of caution when
meeting people through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon LaPrad, owner of LaPrad Home Care in Monroe, Mich., 35
miles south of Detroit, had employed Trouten for much of the past
decade as a nurse's aide working in the homes of dying and
convalescing patients.
</P>
<P>
   LaPrad said her employee had been contacted last year through an
Internet chat room by a man who offered her a job. Trouten was
lured to her death by promises of a $62,000-a-year job as nurse and
companion for her supposed patron's ``elderly father,'' LaPrad
said.
</P>
<P>
   The job, Trouten was told, would last about a year and offered
world travel, a month off after every two months of traveling, plus
all expenses and extensive health and other benefits. The money,
she thought, would pay for her dream _ to train to become a
licensed practical nurse and eventually a registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Trouten made two trips to Kansas, in October and November, to
look into the job and her prospective employer, and she returned
impressed with what she saw, LaPrad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked her up at the airport in a limousine,'' LaPrad
recalled in a telephone interview. ``She told me he lived in a
mansion. She said she saw the mansion and a guest house. She said
it was something else. The man had a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   They were going to travel for a couple of months, she told her
friends, and then she would have a month off.
</P>
<P>
   LaPrad said she was skeptical, as were other friends of
Trouten's. ``It sounded too good to be true,'' LaPrad said. ``But
she was so confident. `This is on the up and up,' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouten related that she had received and signed a contract for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   When Trouten quit her job at LaPrad Home Care at the end of
January, no one advised her not to go to Kansas. ``All we said was,
`Suzette, please be careful,''' LaPrad said. ``We hope you are
positive and know who this man is.' Oh, she said, he lives in a
mansion. He's got a lot of money. We're going to travel. It's
$62,000 and everything paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouten told LaPrad that it was not a permanent arrangement.
``Her last words to me summed it up,'' LaPrad said. ``She put her
arm around me and I wished her luck and she said, `This is only
going to be for a year. It's not forever. I'll be back and forth.
I'll see you in a couple of months.'''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Trouten, who was single and had no children, left
the Newport, Mich., home she shared with her mother, Carolyn, took
her two Pekingese dogs and drove to Kansas. On Feb. 27, LaPrad
said, she received an e-mail message from Trouten saying she had
arrived after a 14-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Trouten's mother received an e-mail message from
her daughter saying she had checked into a motel. A few days later,
Carolyn Trouten received another e-mail message, this one from the
man who had supposedly employed her. It said that Trouten would be
gone for about two months, and it gave an itinerary that did not
provide details.
</P>
<P>
   The mother became suspicious and called the police, LaPrad said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the authorities released the names and, in some
cases, photos of four missing women and one missing baby whose
disappearances, they said, might be linked to Robinson. They were:
Paula Godfrey, 19, reported missing on Sept. 1, 1984; Katherine
Clampet, 27, reported missing June 5, 1987; Izabela K. Lewicka, 22,
a Polish immigrant who has been missing since last fall; and Lisa
Stasi, 19, who disappeared with her 5-month-old baby, Tiffany, on
Jan. 11, 1985. All of the women were living or staying in Overland
Park, Kan., at the time they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Citing investigators' reports from 1985, The Kansas City Star
said Stasi was staying in a domestic violence shelter at the time
she met Robinson. The newspaper reported that the police believed
Robinson promised to help her go to Texas to train for work as a
silk-screen printer. He also offered her $800 a month for living
expenses and promised to find her a baby-sitter and a place to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Later, according to the newspaper, a lawyer representing
Robinson told the police that Stasi had decided to take care of
herself, and Robinson told the police she had moved to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not disclose details of the earlier
investigations or provide information about Godfrey, Clampet, or
Lewicka.
</P>
<P>
   At Store-Mor For Less in Raymore, Mo., where the police found
three bodies in Robinson's 10-by-15-foot unit, a manager who asked
that her name not be used said the Robinsons rented three units in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's wife, Nancy, rented the first storage unit in May,
1993, and Robinson rented two more units in November or December,
1993, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his sister Beverly had gone to work for his
company, Equi II, and he was storing her furniture. She supposedly
had gone to Australia. The last time I saw him, he was saying that
she was in Italy. He said, `She's having a ball. I don't think
she'll ever return.'''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said Robinson had paid his rent on time, often in
person. ``He would run through here _ I guess to check on his
bones,'' she said. ``Lately he's been sending his check in.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has a lengthy criminal record of theft and fraud. He
was sent to prison in Kansas in May, 1986. In 1991, he was paroled
and sent to Missouri to serve a sentence for theft. He was paroled
there in March, 1993. He then moved to Olathe. His wife managed the
mobile home park where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Timmons, 79, the Robinsons' next-door neighbor, recalled
that Robinson ``kept his yard immaculate. He had elaborate
decorations on all the holidays _ Christmas, Halloween, Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed he was retired,'' Timmons said. ``He looks older
than he is. They had grown children and at least one grandchild.
There was a sign outside that said `Grandpa's place. We Spoil
Grandchildren.' They were cordial, but they were always in a
hurry.''

ADVERTISING: A CAMPAIGN CENTERED AROUND `FIRSTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a riddle that used to appear in magazines
like Highlights for Children and Boys' Life, asking readers to name
the only day of the year that can also be a sentence. The answer:
March Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Back up the calendar three days and you have the name of a
recently formed company, offering a variety of Internet
professional services, that seeks to solve another riddle: how to
stand out amid competitors ranging from management consultants to
advertising agencies to Web site builders. The company, called
MarchFirst Inc., is hoping the right answer will be an extensive _
and expensive _ offline and online media campaign centered on a
celebration of being, well, first.
</P>
<P>
   MarchFirst began operations on, yes, March 1, with the
completion of the merger of the USWeb/CKS Group, a Web services
company, and Whittman-Hart, an Internet consulting firm. A brief
``teaser'' campaign ran in newspapers to introduce the name, which
was created by staff members at McKinney &AMP; Silver, the ad agency
unit of USWeb/CKS perhaps best known for its work for the Audi
automobiles sold by Volkswagen of America.
</P>
<P>
   The second, much larger, phase of the MarchFirst campaign, also
produced by McKinney &AMP; Silver, is to begin on Monday with ads in
daily and weekly newspapers. Ads in business, trade and lifestyle
magazines will follow later in the month along with TV commercials
on sports and other programming. The online portion includes a Web
site to go up on Monday (www.marchfirst.com).
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the entire campaign, carrying the theme ``A new
company for the new economy,'' is $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to cut through all the clutter,'' said Robert
Bernard, chairman and chief executive at MarchFirst in Chicago,
particularly, he said, when dozens of dot-coms are striving to
establish themselves in the business-to-business and
business-to-consumer realms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for us to get the name out there, to
create a strong brand awareness,'' Bernard said, adding that basing
the campaign on ``the human desire to be first'' would accomplish
that ``because people will be attracted to the emotion, the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about crossing a finish line first,'' he added,
``but also about tackling problems, taking risks, taking on
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The device the campaign uses to gain attention is to demonstrate
the effects of famous firsts rather than portray the causes. For
instance, a print ad captioned ``The first rock star'' shows not
Chuck Berry or Elvis Presley or Bill Haley but screaming, sobbing
fans pressed against a chain-link fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to being first,'' the text reads. ``Here's to
leading.''
</P>
<P>
   A second print ad, captioned ``The first cubist exhibition,''
displays not ``Nude Descending a Staircase'' but a gallery of men
and women staring, glaring and even tilting their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be first,'' the text reads, promoting MarchFirst
as providing businesses with ``a new way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV commercials are to present the effects of events like the
wearing of the first miniskirt, as passers-by are seen registering
shock and surprise; the first man on the moon, as a family watching
television is glimpsed crying and cheering; and the first
expedition to the South Pole, as penguins are shown turning their
heads in unison from left to right as if they were humans at a
tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power is in the effects these firsts had in moving
society,'' said David Baldwin, senior vice president and executive
creative director at McKinney &AMP; Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have said: `MarchFirst. Integrated solutions for your
many needs,''' he added, laughing. ``But it's better to say we're
making sure MarchFirst is always trying to win for clients and
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Sara Cavin, executive vice president for marketing,
the campaign is aimed at MarchFirst's employees _ current and
prospective _ as much as existing and potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly `re-recruiting' our employees to make sure
they've an understanding of what we do,'' Cavin said. That is
crucial because MarchFirst, with 9,000 employees at 70 offices in
14 countries, does so much: creating traditional advertising;
building and putting up Web sites; offering brand and corporate
identity consulting and strategic positioning; and installing
so-called front-end and back-end technology services.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you like the company's unusual name, it offers
one major advantage, according to Bernard: ``Every year, we can
celebrate our anniversary.''

SEEKING ENERGY SELF-RELIANCE, BRAZIL AUCTIONS 21 OIL LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ With the sale of 21 potential oil-producing
areas on and offshore, Brazil has taken a major step toward
reducing its dependence on energy imports _ even as the country
gives foreign petroleum companies a greater role.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too soon to tell how much Brazil's oil production
will increase because of the concessions that were auctioned by the
government on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, attracting bidders from
all over the world. But as a result, the domestic petroleum
industry is expected to receive as much as $1 billion in technology
and infrastructure investment over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can think about growth without energy,'' said the vice
president of Brazil, Marco Maciel, whose presence at the auction
underlined the government's commitment to modernize the oil
industry in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nation imported an average of 339,000 barrels of oil a day
last year _ about a third of its oil needs _ spending $2 billion.
This year, with the surge in oil prices, Brazil's spending on
imported petroleum will be far more. And with a growing population
and an expanding industrial base, Brazil has been struggling to
meet new demand for oil.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum industry experts said the auction, where international
oil companies spent $262 million to buy 9 onshore and 12 offshore
concessions, was a forward step for Brazil's ambition of energy
autonomy and an important vote of confidence in the opening of
Brazil's petroleum industry, which until two years ago was
dominated by state-owned oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro, or
Petrobras.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To attract foreign investment and help expand exploration and
drilling, the Brazilian Congress voted to open the oil industry in
1997, after a protracted battle with nationalists, who feared
excessive foreign influence over a strategic resource.
</P>
<P>
   A new regulatory body, the National Petroleum Agency, forced
Petrobras to give up the rights to potential oil finds that it
lacked the resources to develop. The company kept 397 areas, and
has since signed a number of joint venture agreements with
multinational oil companies to develop the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the government auctioned the first set of concession
areas that were relinquished by Petrobras, earning $178 million.
Although the government considered the effort a success, only 12 of
the 27 blocks on offer were sold, partly because of economic
uncertainty caused by the devaluation of Brazil's currency, the
real, early in 1999. The sales were also hampered by some concern
about the government's commitment to free competition in a country
where, until a few years ago, many major industries had been
state-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of the first round didn't give time for a lot of
people to assimilate what the changes in the Brazilian market
meant,'' said Martin Jones, general manager in Brazil for Amerada
Hess. ``We are now moving from the theory of investing in Brazil to
the practice of investing in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   While partly relying on high oil prices to invigorate interest
in the auction, the government this time around also relaxed some
bidding restrictions to attract smaller domestic and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was a larger pool of bidders in this round,
Petrobras still emerged as the big winner, buying seven of the
concessions and participation in an eighth. The company surprised
auction participants by offering winning bids of $56 million and
$89 million on two offshore blocks in the Santos basin, where it
already has operating wells.
</P>
<P>
   There was some grumbling about the strong Petrobras showing in
the auction. Critics said the company benefited from an insider's
knowledge of the local oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave a very competitive bid, but it wasn't good enough,''
said Victor Dauzacker, the representative in Brazil for Fay
Richwhite Holding Ltd., which was outbid for an onshore concession
by Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring more companies into Brazil's oil industry,
Petrobras plans to auction 73 mature fields _ those with declining
production in the northeast of the country _ on a date to be
announced in July. The National Petroleum Agency also plans to
auction a third round of concession areas in 2001.

LAST MANAGER SET TO LEAVE SOROS FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last of three top money managers announced his departure on
Thursday from the dwindling investment empire of George Soros.
Scott Bessent, who oversees European investments for Soros Fund
Management, said he would leave to start his own private investment
group.
</P>
<P>
   The move lowers the curtain on Soros' run as one of the world's
most daring money managers. In late April, after sustaining bracing
losses, Soros, 69, said he would reorganize his investment group
and abandon many of the risky strategies that made him a
multibillionaire. But it was unclear then just how thorough an
overhaul his firm would undertake.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the extent of the transformation was apparent.
Bessent, 37, the last of the money managers that oversaw Soros Fund
Management's global investment strategies, will take nine Soros
staff members with him to his new firm. The other top managers,
Stanley F. Druckenmiller and S. Nicholas Roditi, announced their
retirements in late April, after the firm's flagship Quantum Fund
had fallen 22 percent through the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   All three executives will depart at the end of the month and
will not be replaced. Instead, Soros will reduce his staff and farm
out much of the management of his fund group to outside managers
like Bessent, in an attempt to greatly reduce risk and make his
investment group a more suitable launching pad for his charitable
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors, preferring the old Soros to the new, tamer
Soros, have withdrawn their money. Because of withdrawals and
performance setbacks, assets in the five Soros funds currently
stand at $13.3 billion, down from $17 billion at the end of last
year. In addition, Duncan Hennes, the chief executive of Soros Fund
Management who indicated in April that he would stay on to help
rebuild, said last week that he would also depart at the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   The departures and the more conservative philosophy will leave
Soros Fund Management a much different organization from the one
that managed over $22 billion in 1998 and rattled markets with big
bets on the directions of global currencies, stocks and bonds.
Soros was nicknamed ``the man who broke the pound'' in 1992 for
betting millions of dollars against the British pound, but Bessent
wrote in a recent letter to friends and associates that the
environment that made these so-called ``macro'' strategies
successful in the past had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Both a Soros spokesman and Bessent said his departure was
amicable. Bessent will use $150 million of his own money to start
two private funds, and Soros will add another $150 million. Bessent
said he would keep some of his own money in Soros' $3.5 billion
venture capital fund and sit on a Soros advisory board.

RUSSIA IMPRESSES SOROS

<P>
   MOSCOW _ George Soros, who owns one of the biggest failed
investments in Russia, said Thursday that he was impressed with the
country's economic improvement and the new administration's
apparent willingness to protect investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to invest more in Russia,'' he said at a news
conference here. ``The economy's doing very well. There's genuine
growth. There are opportunities for those who are strong-hearted.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros has sunk more than $1 billion into commercial investments
in Russia. Most of that is stuck in an ill-fated purchase of a
stake in the main state telephone holding company he has called
``the worst investment decision of my career.'' The 25 percent
stake is currently worth less than half of what it was in 1997 when
he purchased it through a group called Mustcom Ltd. Now, he said,
he is not ruling out further purchases in the company.

IT'S NOT A SHAQ BRICK, JUST A FREUDIAN SLIP!
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, as Sigmund
Freud is said to have said. And, may I add, sometimes a
buzzer-beater is just two points, an alley-oop pass is just an
assist and an airball is just a misfire.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't know it by listening to the analysis - verging
on psychoanalysis - that follows any big NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   There it was again Thursday, when as the NBA finalists convened
at Staples Center to figure out what happened in Game 1 and
practice for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the Lakers trounced the Indiana Pacers because
Shaquille O'Neal is bigger, stronger and faster than everybody
else, and Reggie Miller had a really bad shooting night. Oh, no,
it's never that simple.
</P>
<P>
   In the language of pro basketball, the Lakers are on their way
to the NBA championship because O'Neal is on a mission, Kobe Bryant
has come of age, the two of them have bonded and the squad as a
whole has accepted Phil Jackson's leadership and the concepts of
``sustaining energy'' and living ``in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the language of pro basketball, the Pacers lost in their
first-ever NBA Finals game not because they're smaller, weaker and
slower but because - well, let their boss handle the pop
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I was sitting, we looked a little shell-shocked,''
Pacers president Donnie Walsh said after watching his team fall
behind the Lakers 33-16 in the series' opening minutes. ``Maybe
they (the Indiana players) were overwhelmed by the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Overwhelmed by the occasion'' being the opposite of ``stepping
up in pressure situations,'' which is what the Lakers are credited
with doing lately.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, had the Lakers' Game 7 rally against the Portland
Trail Blazers fallen short, it might be have been attributed to the
Lakers' being ``overwhelmed by the occasion'' - or lacking ``guts''
or failing to ``learn how to win'' while winning 67 regular-season
and 10 previous playoff games.)
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that all this talk about players' mental and
emotional states, and their intricate professional relationships
with each other, seems a bit high-flown. You'd think they're being
asked to walk a tight rope across the Grand Canyon or form a new
civilization on a desert island, not throw a ball in a hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It just seems to me that the athletes and teams in basketball
are subjected to more probings of their moods and proclivities than
those in any other sport.
</P>
<P>
   A pitcher throws a home run pitch and it's because his release
point is off. A quarterback throws an interception and it's because
somebody failed to execute the X's and O's from the playbook. But a
basketball player bricks a free throw and it's because he's afraid
of failure. Or success. One of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely is amusing to hear some of the things that are
said sometimes,'' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. ``(The game)
(begin ital)is(end ital) psychological, but to be able to put a
specific definition on things, I think it's hard, because each
player has his own things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal makes all nine free-throw attempts in Game 4 against
Portland, and explains that his 3-year-old daughter told him to
``bend your knees.'' It's all in the head, see?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal goes right back to his usual 50-percent foul shooting in
the ensuing games, and - what, he already forgot his daughter's
sage advice?
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scores 25 points on 11-for-18 shooting, and passes to Ron
Harper for the game-winning basket in Game 3 against Portland and
his performance is hailed by teammates John Salley as
``Jordanesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant goes 9 for 28 in the next two games and we're told to
remember he's just a kid.
</P>
<P>
   If you believed this stuff, you'd have to conclude that NBA
players are the most unstable creatures this side of rats in a
psych student's lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a game that requires split-second timing, so
there is a focus on whether guys are at the point in their careers
where they can read defenses, react the right way,'' Walsh said.
``(But) I laugh when some of the analysis goes so deep. You think
you're talking to Freud himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we overanalyze, to be honest with you. We're
overanalyzing why we lost (Game 1). It could be as simple as we
weren't good enough, we didn't shoot well enough, we didn't defend
well enough. But we always feel like we've got to go deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys do it at the end of the game, we think he's got
this, that or the other (quality), when it's just (that) he's good.
Michael Jordan was really good. Shaq is really good. And bigger and
stronger....''
</P>
<P>
   There might not be a psychologist's couch sturdy enough to hold
Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   Some sportswriters wish they'd studied labor relations (to make
it easier to cover baseball) or criminal law (the NFL). I wish I'd
paid better attention in psychology class so I could understand an
NBA press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this emphasis on head games began with Pat Riley and the
old Lakers coach's talk of ``message games,'' the ``comfort zone''
and something he called ``toxic envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, like most phenomenons we think are recent
developments, it actually has been going on forever. Maybe, while
Dr. Naismith was hanging the first peach baskets, he was muttering
about the players' lack of ``intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody suggested I ask a doctor about this.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Ramsey happened to be in. And he thinks he understands
why everybody turns into Frasier Crane when we get around
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball, you've got fewer players, they're very visible
and you see the emotion,'' said Ramsey, who coached Portland to the
1977 NBA title. ``While it's a team game, there's a lot of
individualism and you (begin ital)see(end ital) demonstrations of
leadership. Guys do it in all different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the simplest explanation. We think we can see
into the minds and hearts of basketball players because - unlike
the helmeted and scripted athletes in football, hockey and baseball
- they appear almost literally naked to us on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   So Walsh's perception from the stands was correct? The Pacers
were ``overwhelmed by the occasion''? ``Shell-shocked''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not any more than we were,'' said Fisher, who had a closer
view.
</P>
<P>
   I still want to know what Red Auerbach likes about those cigars.

STAKES WILL STILL BE HIGH AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ There may not be a Triple Crown at stake at
Belmont Park this weekend. But three days of major racing with $2.5
million in purses will be staged, starting Friday with the Acorn
Stakes, the first event in the Triple Tiara series for fillies, and
closing on Sunday with the 112th running of the Brooklyn Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the 132nd Belmont Stakes, the main event of the year
in New York racing, will be run. True, it will be run without the
two top 3-year-old colts in the country, the injured Fusaichi
Pegasus and the resting Red Bullet. But it will feature 11 other
horses searching for the 3-year-old championship the two absent
colts are still expected to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend will be anchored by four Grade I stakes, beginning
with the Acorn and its undefeated star, Roxelana, who has won all
four of her starts by a combined total of 29 lengths. A month ago,
she scored big time in the La Troienne Stakes at Churchill Downs by
nearly 12 lengths. ``She amazes me each time she runs,'' said her
trainer, William Huffman. ``The Acorn is never an easy race. It's a
Grade I in New York. So, we're going to run her and see if she fits
in with that group. She's passed every test so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxelana will be surrounded by nine other fillies in the
one-mile run, including Darling My Darling, Finder's Fee, Circle of
Life and Tugger. The second race in the Triple Tiara series, the
Mother Goose, at a mile and an eighth, will be run at Belmont on
July 1, and the third, the Coaching Club American Oaks, at a mile
and a half, on July 22. Only eight fillies have swept all three,
most recently Sky Beauty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Racing reaches a peak Saturday when four other stakes support
the Belmont on a day festooned by parachute jumping, world-class
buglers and marching bands. The cast for the $1 million Belmont
includes several candidates for the 3-year-old championship,
including the favored Aptitude, who ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus
in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Belmont is a great race for the pedigree,'' said Bobby
Frankel, who trains Aptitude, ``and the money isn't bad, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the mile-and-a-half Belmont will be the $400,000
Manhattan Handicap at a mile and a quarter on the inner turf
course; the $150,000 Riva Ridge at seven furlongs; the $150,000
True North at seven furlongs; and the $150,000 Just a Game
Breeders' Cup at one mile on the turf. The Manhattan will be
contested by five Grade I winners, notably Yagli, who won the race
last year, but has struggled since then.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's run of races will close with flourishes on Sunday
with the Brooklyn Handicap at a mile and an eighth, a race that has
been won by such stars as Exterminator, Whirlaway, Assault and
three straight times by Discovery in the 1930s and by Forego in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The horse with a cause this year is Running Stag, who won the
race last year and who campaigns as relentlessly as a political
candidate. He is an international traveler who has raced in
England, America, Dubai and Hong Kong in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   For Running Stag, who is 6 years old, this will be his 38th
start and his third in three weeks. He won an allowance at Belmont
on May 24, won the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs last
Saturday and will be back in action Sunday at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a lot? Roger Teal, the assistant trainer, said the
horse got back to Belmont last Sunday and took life rather easy
this week. ``We can't see any problems in running back on Sunday,''
he said.

FLORIDA INMATE CLAIMED ABUSE DURING EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (subs 1st and 19th grafs to change `botched' to `flawed'; subs 2nd

<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida, which switched to lethal injections after a
series of flawed executions in its electric chair, has had trouble
with another execution.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Demps, a three-time convicted killer sentenced to die by
lethal injection on Wednesday, was strapped to a gurney for 33
minutes while, he said in his final words, technicians at the
Florida State Prison struggled to insert the lethal intravenous
drip into a veins.
</P>
<P>
   When the procedure to insert the intravenous drip, which
normally takes a few minutes, was completed and the curtain between
the execution chamber and witnesses was opened, witnesses said that
Demps pleaded with his lawyer to investigate the way the state's
executioners had handled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They butchered me back there,'' witnesses said that Demps
complained from the gurney. ``I was in a lot of pain. They cut me
in the groin; they cut me in the leg. I was bleeding profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   The state went ahead with the execution, its third since
shifting from the electric chair in February.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, said that Demps was
left strapped to the gurney for so long because the paperwork was
delayed, and because the state's technicians had trouble finding a
vein for an alternate intravenous drip.
</P>
<P>
   But Demps said the state's technicians twice sliced painfully
into his body, and had stitched up one wound before taking him into
the execution chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said the delay was partly because the state was
awaiting word from the U.S. Supreme Court on a last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Demps' lawyer, George F. Schaefer, told The Miami Herald that
the court had notified the warden by 5:30 p.m. that it would not
act on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, his lawyer said in a written statement, was pronounced
dead at 6:53 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to State Attorney Rod Smith, Schaefer called for a
formal investigation into the execution, saying that ``those
complaints of abuse sounded sincere to me.''
</P>
<P>
   David Thomas, director of health services for the Florida
Department of Corrections, said the state did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol used in lethal injection is a flexible document
that gives us the professional discretion to locate a suitable vein
to inject the chemicals,'' Thomas said. ``As with other states that
use lethal injection, a minor surgical procedure may sometimes be
necessary to locate a vein. Such a procedure could take a
considerable amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Demps,'' Thomas said, ``the protocol was
complied with and the execution was carried out in a professional
manner. The inmate suffered no undue discomfort.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Demps had evaded the death penalty once.
</P>
<P>
   He was on death row for taking part in two murders in 1971 when
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was
unconstitutional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the court allowed capital punishment to resume, and
less than two months later, Demps was sent to death row again after
taking part in the killing of an inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, who held down an inmate while another man stabbed him,
said he was not guilty and that the state had framed him because he
had been spared the death penalty in the earlier case.
</P>
<P>
   His execution comes after several flawed electrocutions.
</P>
<P>
   Blood spurted from Allen Lee Davis, a three-time murderer, when
he was electrocuted in July.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1990 and 1997, inmates caught fire in the chair as they
were put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty supporters in Florida were afraid the chair's
gruesome history would result in a backlash, in the courts and
among the public. Earlier this year the state switched to lethal
injection as a less troublesome means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   But death penalty opponents said the state just seemed to have
trouble executing its inmates, no matter how it was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has a remarkable history, in terms of its inability to
get its act together as far as killing people,'' said Stephen
Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in
Atlanta. ``It sounds like Florida has failed again in terms of
carrying out an execution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem,'' Bright said, ``is there is no good or
right way of killing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's history of problems in corrections is not confined
to the death chamber. Last year, Frank Valdez, a death row inmate,
was beaten to death by prison guards armed with stun guns. Valdez
had murdered a corrections officer 12 years ago.

PERKINS HAS UPHILL BATTLE WITH MT. SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sam Perkins patrols the post for Indiana. His
wife, Dionne, patrols the streets of Seattle. Normally we wouldn't
deign to question which partner in this power couple has the more
treacherous job. Usually we'd agree that being a police officer
makes being a power forward seem like, well, child's play.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, this isn't any ordinary assignment that Perkins
has drawn in the ongoing NBA Finals. He is being asked to move a
mountain so majestic many people worship at its foot. Perkins has
never scaled Mount Whitney or Mount Rainier, but he does feel a
little like Sir Edmund Hillary now that he's face-to-face with
Mount Shaq, a.k.a. ``The Big Himalaya.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a conquest, almost, in a sense,'' said Perkins of
the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, who is four inches taller, 70 pounds
heavier and nearly 11 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 of the best-of-seven championship series, Perkins
couldn't have felt more powerless if he had been trying to stop an
avalanche. He leaned on O'Neal, he jostled him and, still, the
7-foot-1 center converted nine field goals to Perkins' one in the
21 minutes they stalked each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so strong,'' Perkins said of O'Neal. When he has the
ball, ``he leans in on you and you flop, but it's not really a
flop. It's the real thing. A couple of times (Wednesday) I was
leaning in on him and the refs were telling me, `Hey, that's
enough.' What they don't realize is that was just a tap compared to
what I really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to inequity, O'Neal blocked one of Perkins' shots
in the second quarter, after which the former Laker put up just two
more shots the remainder of the Pacers' long, long night.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked Perkins after the Pacers' practice Thursday if
there was anybody else he could think of who is O'Neal's equal
physically. Perkins smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterbean,'' he said, referring to the pro boxer. ``But
that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think the coming of age of the 28-year-old O'Neal is
reason enough for veterans such as Perkins to be going, you'd be
wrong. He could have retired after last year. He's glad he returned
to take O'Neal's physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go out against the best to say, `Cool, I did
it,''' said Perkins, who is leaning toward calling it a career
after this series. ``It's not disheartening. You just take it as a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   People say Perkins personifies the old, slow Pacers. Perhaps,
but he also is capable of keying their perimeter game. He has the
outside shot to pull O'Neal out of his comfort zone on defense,
into his no-man's land, the high post. Perkins, who turns 39 next
week, once made eight 3-pointers without a miss in a game against
Toronto three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles basketball historians might also remember Perkins
made the winning jumper in the Lakers' lone NBA Finals victory of
the 1990s, against Phil Jackson's Chicago team in the 1991 series
that the Bulls took in five. Jackson, in his first season with the
Lakers, waxed eloquent as he is want to do on Perkins' star turn
before Wednesday's Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good that he brought it up,'' Perkins said. ``But that
ain't going to do any good for me in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is no good to the Pacers so long as he lets O'Neal
freeze him. That's especially true if Reggie Miller, Indiana's
designated gunner, comes out again in tonight's Game 2 shooting so
cold he'd be hard-pressed to hit the Pacific Ocean with a beach
ball.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Lakers backup center John Salley, the Pacers were too
passive in the way they played O'Neal. Salley's opinion carries a
lot of weight insofar as he battles O'Neal every day in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The bad boys he played with in Detroit in the 1980s OK, mainly
bad boy Bill Laimbeer wouldn't have been so tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Shaq to death,'' Salley said, ``but he would have
thrown a punch at Bill, and that's exactly what we would have
wanted to happen. These guys come down and go, `Oh, my god, I've
got to play against Shaquille. Bill would have thought of a way to
get Shaquille (in foul trouble).''
</P>
<P>
   To play like that, Perkins first would require a personality
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Salley understands. He really does. He won't give Perkins
advice, but he'd be happy to slip him the name and phone number of
his chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got him on call,'' Salley said. ``Every day, I gotta go
to him, and he re-adjusts my back and neck. I get dumped on by
Shaquille in the tailbone and the ribs and the shoulders on a
regular basis. I have scoliosis because of him. If he can hit me
and I'm his boy, I feel sorry for anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins played for Dean Smith at North Carolina. Surely the Dean
of college coaches had some sage advice for handling O'Neal.
