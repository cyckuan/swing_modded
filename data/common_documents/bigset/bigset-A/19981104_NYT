<P>
   BOSTON _ Acting Governor Paul Cellucci edged out Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger in the Massachusetts governor's race
Tuesday night, barely fending off a last-minute Democratic surge
that buried a host of Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the precincts reporting, Cellucci and his running
mate, Jane Swift, had pulled ahead of Harshbarger and his
ticket-mate Warren Tolman, 50 percent to 48 percent, after a day in
which surveys of voters at the polls put the race dead-even.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly tight race reflected a national trend Tuesday
in which Democrats _ benefiting from what some say is a backlash
against Republican impeachment attempts _ made strong showings in
US House and Senate races as well as gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cellucci was unexpectedly hit by an unusual political
phenomenon that threatened to sink his attempt to win a full
four-year term. Democrats nationwide bucked a historic trend in
which the party that controls the White House loses large numbers
of congressional seats in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger has benefited from that,'' said US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat. ``The base of
the Democratic Party, including the unions in Massachusetts, was
mobilized to get its members to polls in numbers no one realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters at both camps Tuesday nightwere settling in for a
long night as returns trickled in with no definite trends.
</P>
<P>
   The strong Democratic voting Tuesday also helped the state party
to sweep the contests for the other constitutional offices.
Secretary of State William F. Galvin, seeking a second four-year
term, and State Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci, first elected to the
post in 1986, handily won reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Shannon O'Brien, a former state senator from
Easthampton, won her bid to replace Republican Joseph D. Malone as
state treasurer, ending the GOP's eight-year lock on that office.
She defeated Bob Maginn, a wealthy business consultant from
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the race for attorney general to replace
Harshbarger, his one-time protege, Middlesex County District
Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat from Watertown, easily won
over his Republican rival, Brad Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also failed to gain another foothold in the
state's all-Democratic congressional delegation. In the North
Shore's 6th District, US Representative John F. Tierney of Salem
turned back a rematch challenge from Republican Peter G. Torkildsen
of Danvers, who had held the seat for two terms. Tierney had
defeated him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3rd District, which extends from Worcester to Fall River,
US Representative James McGovern, a first-term Democrat from
Worcester, overcame his Republican challenger, Matthew J. Amorello,
a state senator from Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of Cellucci's strategy throughout the fall campaign
was to cut into Harshbarger's Democratic base, but surveys of
voters leaving the polls showed the attorney general, while not
widely popular among some rank-and-file members, was able to take
over three-quarters of his party's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harshbarger won a majority of women voters, a bloc
that earlier surveys showed backing Cellucci, in some cases by a
wide margin. Cellucci had courted women voters by citing his work
on domestic violence and by choosing Swift. Cellucci said working
mothers would have a voice in his administration through her.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also got a big boost from several major
Massachusetts Democratic figures, including US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry, who made a series of appearances with
the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more important, Harshbarger received huge support
from organized labor, most notably the state AFL-CIO, which
provided him with workers and paid for mailings and leaflet-drops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is in an economic boom, Cellucci had been
struggling to establish an identity since he took over as governor
in July 1997 when William F. Weld resigned. A low-key figure who
had toiled in the state Legislature for the last 22 years, Cellucci
never commanded a high profile like Weld did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci was able to maintain a more disciplined campaign
message than Harshbarger, attacking the attorney general on
so-called wedge issues such as the death penalty, taxes, and
welfare. He was also able to fend off Harshbarger's attempts to
bring his personal finances into the debate. And he was even able
to beat Harshbarger where the attorney general lives _ the largely
Republican Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other races around the country, the Massachusetts
gubernatorial race, in terms of issues, was never about very much
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci argued that he and former governor Weld were
responsible for the economic boom and that he was the fiscal
conservative who would continue the prosperity and impose
discipline at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger argued that the state needed new leadership, one
that would bring compassion and innovative ideas to state
government.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue bubbled up to dominate the campaign or
captivate the voters. At the same time, the rhetoric stayed highly
charged, negative, and personal, but the differences between the
two on issues such as education, child care, and expanded health
care seemed small.

EARLY COUNT SHOWS TIE IN N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seizing on the gaffes and ethics accusations
surrounding his incumbent opponent, Eliot Spitzer surprised the
state's political professionals Tuesday night by pulling even with
Dennis Vacco in the race for New York state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   With about half the votes in, unofficial returns showed Spitzer
and Vacco tied.
</P>
<P>
   No poll or political figure in the state predicted such a close
race. It appeared to be at least partially attributable to the
unexpectedly strong vote that gave Charles Schumer a victory in the
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot will gleefully ride on those coattails,'' said Steven
Goldstein, Spitzer's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign officials said one of the biggest factors in
Spitzer's showing was a remark in the last week of the campaign in
which Vacco referred to ``banditos'' outside ``bodegas'' in a
discussion of criminals affected by the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, which outraged Hispanic leaders around New York
City, occurred just as voters were beginning to pay attention to a
race that had never been at the top of the news. It did not create
a favorable impression of an incumbent that few voters had come to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer capitalized on the comment, and also stressed Vacco's
opposition to abortion, accusing him of fostering an environment
that led to the recent killing of a Buffalo abortion doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the race, Vacco certainly did a lot to revive
our campaign,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant who served
as an adviser to Spitzer. ``His record on abortion was certainly a
factor, and the bandito gaffe was another major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, 39, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer and former prosecutor
who won the Democratic primary this year after coming in last four
years ago, vigorously assailed Vacco for the same reasons some
newspapers' editorial pages failed to endorse the incumbent:
Vacco's decision to fire more than 100 experienced lawyers on his
staff, who had been hired by his Democratic predecessors, and
replace them with younger, inexperienced lawyers with ties to the
Republican and Conservative parties.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the firings, many of his office's cases were thrown
into disarray, and several judges complained publicly about the
competence of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's frequent attempts to remind voters of Vacco's
opposition to abortion were somewhat defused when a lawyer for
several abortion clinics said Vacco's office had actually been
helpful in securing court decisions that set up protective barriers
around the clinics. But Spitzer raised the issue at every debate
and at most campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   As he did four years ago, Vacco, 46, sought to make the election
a referendum on crime-fighting, playing on the common misimpression
among voters that New York's attorney general, like his federal
counterpart, has a major role in criminal law enforcement. In fact,
the state office mostly defends New York state in civil lawsuits
and enforces laws not given to local district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently said at campaign events that his top priority was
to protect citizens from crime, and often pointed to the falling
crime rates around the state as evidence of his success over the
last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that drop has been the result of improved crime-fighting
by the New York City Police Department, but Vacco frequently won
cheers by unabashedly jumping on the bandwagon already occupied by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki, both of whom
strongly supported his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   With the death penalty not a major issue this year, Vacco began
promoting his work in several noncriminal areas that he played down
the last time, including consumer and environmental law. Late in
his term, for instance, long after other states had already sued
tobacco companies over the costs of treating tobacco-related
illnesses, he abandoned his earlier resistance and joined the
lawsuit, becoming a vocal critic of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But these issues were often drowned out by personal gaffes and
shrill television commercials. After being assailed for weeks on
the source of his campaign finances, Spitzer admitted last month
that he had made a series of misleading statements about how much
of his father's real-estate fortune was paying for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The admission seriously tarnished his credibility at a time when
he was trying to seize on Vacco's own ethical issues. But it came
only a day before he was able to criticize Vacco for the
``banditos'' remark, and at a time when the attention of most
voters was on the U.S. Senate race.

DEMOCRATS RETAIN HOLD ON ASSEMBLY IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The balance of power in the New York state
Legislature remained relatively unchanged Tuesday, as Democrats
retained their firm grip on the state Assembly despite a strong
statewide Republican victory for Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly, where the Democrats have long dominated, the
party finished the night with 97 of 150 seats, unchanged from two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the state Senate, the Republicans remained in control of the
chamber, where they hold 35 of 61 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the Legislature draws the lines, the
districts tend to be dominated by one party or the other. As a
result, the overwhelming number of contests are effectively decided
in the September primary and the general election usually produces
few surprises. Still, there were a handful of hotly contested races
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In what was possibly the most hotly contested and costliest of
the legislative races, Vincent Gentile, the incumbent Democratic
state senator from a district in Brooklyn and Staten Island,
survived a strong challenge from Christopher Mega, a former state
senator who retired from the State Court of Claims to run as a
Republican for his old seat.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates together spent more than $1 million in a race
that drew some of the state's best known politicians from both
parties to the district, and the Senate campaign committees of both
parties contributed heavily to their candidates in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which includes the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bay
Ridge and Bensonhurst and a sliver of northeast Staten Island,
often votes Republican but has a history of ticket splitting.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Mega, 67, strove to emphasize that he could
accomplish more for the district as a member of the Republican
majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gentile, 39, campaigned energetically and was endorsed by an
array of Democratic officials. In his campaign, Gentile suggested
that his positions on education and health care were closer to the
mainstream of the moderate-to-conservative district than were those
of his Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly, Eric Vitaliano, a Democratic, eight-term
incumbent from Staten Island, survived a vigorous challenge from
Glenn Yost, a 35-year-old Republican who resigned as a detective
with the New York City Police Department to run for the Assembly
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Yost, a political neophyte, labeled Vitaliano as a liberal who
was out of step with the conservative voters of the district. He
was actively supported by Gov. Pataki and New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. But Vitaliano, 50, repeatedly pointed out his
support of the death penalty and his votes to lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Whitestone section of Queens, Ann Margaret Carrozza, the
Democratic incumbent, won re-election to the Assembly, fighting
back a challenge by her Republican predecessor, Douglas Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   In Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Peter Abbate, a 12-year incumbent
Democratic assemblyman, survived a challenge with a lopsided
victory over Luigi Marano, 77, a former assemblyman and retired
state Court of Claims judge. Tuesday night's results also produced
a new political dynasty with the election to the state Senate of
Daniel Hevesi, the 27-year-old son of Alan Hevesi, the New York
City comptroller. Daniel Hevesi, a Democrat who ran unopposed, was
elected in the 13th Senate District in central Queens, succeeding
Emanuel Gold, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Thomas Duane, a New York City councilman since 1992, was
elected to the state Senate, making the 43-year-old Democrat the
first openly gay member of that body. Duane succeeds Catherine
Abate, who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general.

BUSH WINS IN TEXAS LANDSLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: 4graflede, adding quotes; pickup: Questions about)

 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a race overshadowed by the future, Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday crushed Democrat Garry Mauro in a
landslide victory that surpassed the Republican's own expectations
and may set the stage for a presidential run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In early returns, the incumbent won 68 percent of the vote to
become the first Texas governor elected to consecutive four-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we celebrate, and there are many all across the state
who share in this great victory,'' Bush told a throng of
supporters. ``Tomorrow I start working on implementing a plan for
great schools, lower taxes and a safer Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's victory is a victory of ideas built on a philosophy
that is conservative, compassionate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bush's presidential plans were pervasive during
the election. While the son of former President Bush said he was
interested in the presidency, he said he would not make up his mind
about running until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's brother, Jeb, was elected governor Florida
after an unsuccessful bid for the office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided victory over Mauro surpassed the governor's own
hope of winning 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush won about 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a record for a Texas Republican. In the 1994 race, Bush won
24 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored,'' Bush said of the Hispanic vote as he watched
early returns at a downtown hotel. ``This is a big vote, and I'm
working hard to earn the respect of los Espanos.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had campaigned hard this time among Hispanics, which was
seen by some as a test of his ability to reach out to
non-traditional Republican voters should he decide to run for
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor tried to stay focused on his re-election
campaign, he was hounded with questions about whether he would run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation generated a crush of state, national and
international media attention. And Tuesday was no different, with
an astonishing 275 reporters and photographers covering the
election night rally at the downtown convention center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day in Austin voting, jogging and getting ready
for an evening victory rally.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, a four-term Texas Land Commissioner, hit the campaign
trail one last time, making stops in Waco, Dallas and San Antonio
before returning to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The race never was close, but the two men campaigned as if it
were up until the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, outdistanced Mauro, 50, in the polls and in
fund-raising from the start. By the end of the campaign, Bush had
raised $17.2 million, compared to $4.8 million for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Because of problems raising cash, Mauro hit the streets early,
embarking on a grassroots campaign of knocking on doors across
Texas. He aired television commercials for a brief period early in
an attempt to raise his name recognition, but he didn't have enough
money to go back on television until the final days of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, the two candidates criss-crossed the state
stumping for votes and encouraging people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's platform included plans to end the practice of passing
failing students, cutting local school property taxes by $2 billion
and eliminating the sales tax on over-the-counter drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wanted to give all teachers in the state a $6,000-per-year
pay raise; eliminate the sales tax on cars, trucks and vans; and
put 10,000 more police officers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro sought to portray Bush as a popular governor with a famous
family but also a politician who was out of touch with Texans. He
insisted he would win because he was ``right'' on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned across Texas, Mauro noted that polls for the
governor's race had been wrong before, and he predicted they would
be wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so far behind in the polls,'' Mauro said Tuesday in
San Antonio. He added he thought a barrage of television
commercials he aired the final weekend in Houston and Dallas would
``give me a little punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Skies were mostly sunny across Texas on Election Day, but
Secretary of State Al Gonzales predicted a low turnout of between
3.3 million and 3.6 million voters, down from the 4.4 million
Texans who voted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the low early turnout primarily to a lack of voter
interest and recent weather disasters in some parts of Texas.

MCCALL RE-ELECTED AS NEW YORK STATE COMPTROLLER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 3rd graf to add vote count. Polishing and tightening

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl McCall, who climbed from an impoverished
childhood to become the first black candidate elected to statewide
office in New York, easily won re-election Tuesday to a second term
as state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a 63-year-old Democrat, handily dispatched a challenge
by Bruce Blakeman, a Republican who is majority leader of the
Nassau County Legislature. McCall was first appointed to the
comptroller's post to fill a vacancy in 1993 and won a full term in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   With 56 percent of election districts reporting, the vote was
McCall 1,437,891 (64 percent) and Blakeman 738,898 (33 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York and across the nation, the Democratic Party is
coming back because we have a message that sends hope and
opportunity to all the people,'' McCall said to cheers Tuesday
night at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, McCall won a tight race against Herbert London,
a New York University professor, surviving the Republican tide that
lifted George Pataki to the State House. This year, McCall scared
off potential challengers by amassing more than $5 million in
campaign money and he did not face serious opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman, a 43-year-old lawyer who has been majority leader of
the Nassau County Legislature since it was created in 1995, was
selected to run against McCall during a telephone conference call
among state Republican Party leaders last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller is the sole trustee of the state pension fund,
which is worth about $100 billion and is one of the single largest
pools of capital in the nation. McCall collected millions in
campaign contributions from lawyers, real estate advisers and
investment companies that do business with his office.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions are legal. Still, Blakeman sought to make
criticism of them the thrust of his bid for office. Polls, however,
consistently showed McCall ahead by about 30 points, and the race
received little attention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, similar questions were raised about the
fund-raising of prominent Republicans, including Gov. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, McCall's campaign spent $3.8 million on
advertising and kept up a busy schedule of events.
</P>
<P>
   McCall had considered running against Pataki this year but was
dissuaded by the governor's own aggressive fund-raising. By August
1997, Pataki had raised more than $9 million and McCall, saying he
was content in his job as comptroller, announced he would seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   McCall repeatedly trumpeted his success in directing the
investments of the pension fund, noting that under his stewardship
the fund had nearly doubled to more than $100 billion from $56
billion. He also described his conducting of various audits of
state and local agencies, and said the audits had benefited the
state on many issues, like education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman emphasized his close ties to Republican officials, and
he suggested that McCall, as a Democrat, could not be as effective
with the Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, for his part, paid scant attention to his opponent and
rarely, if ever, mentioned him.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The governors of New York and Connecticut won re-election so
easily this year that their victories were overshadowed by the more
dramatic races around the country and the debate over whether
Tuesday's voting was some sort of referendum on the Clinton
presidency. But George Pataki and John Rowland deserve their full
moment in the sun. They identified a brand of Republicanism that
went over well in what are basically liberal Democratic states, and
they sold it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The gubernatorial campaigns were notable mainly for what they
were not. They were not negative. While citizens complained about
the hostile quality of so many political ads this year, Pataki and
Rowland stayed firmly on the sunny side of the street. They had the
luxury to do so, since neither man really faced a challenge.
Woefully outspent, Peter Vallone, the Democratic candidate in New
York, had a long list of ideas and criticisms that he never managed
to fully articulate, and Pataki refused to show up for even a
single debate. In Connecticut, Democrats thought Rep. Barbara
Kennelly would be the perfect choice to give Rowland a run. But the
idea turned out to be far more compelling than the reality. Mrs.
Kennelly was so shy of negative campaigning that she seemed
incapable of making a case against a second term for Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints about negative campaigns _ particularly negative
television advertising _ have been almost as shrill as the ads
themselves. Hard-fought contests like the New York Senate race
seemed to get nasty very fast. All around the country, the issue of
which candidate was the greatest liar seemed to overshadow health
care, Social Security and even impeachment. But in the broad sweep
of American history, campaigns rife with over-the-top accusations
are not unusual. Thomas Jefferson's election in 1800 might serve as
an example. It was a Connecticut newspaper that predicted that if
the Jeffersonians won the presidency, ``Murder, robbery, rape,
adultery and incest will be openly taught and practiced, the air
will be rent with the cries of distress, the soil will be soaked
with blood and the nation black with crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the issues were diffuse it was probably
inevitable that candidates would try to magnify small differences,
make hay out of votes cast a decade or more in the past, and harp
endlessly on trivial flaws in their opponents' resumes. Pataki's
commercials, full of picture-postcard views and glad tidings about
the environment, were positive. But they did not exactly educate
the voters about the issues they should be considering. Because the
campaigns were such runaways, Pataki and Rowland will resume
governing their states with little information about what the
people would like them to do over the next four years. Both men
have committed themselves to expensive, crowd-pleasing programs
that will not really be put into effect or paid for until the next
term is well under way. The New York tax cuts may be more expensive
than the state can afford, but since Pataki never had to run a real
campaign, he never had to explain how he was going to finance them.
Rowland's much-vaunted conversion to a pro-education, pro-urban
agenda is based on new programs that exist mainly on paper.
</P>
<P>
   We endorsed both governors for re-election, and congratulate
them on their impressive victories. But we expect them to live up
to their campaign promises and then some. Pataki must turn his
vague talk about campaign finance reform into something concrete.
His annual State of the State Messages typically contain only a few
major plans, and fixing the state's woefully lax restrictions on
campaign donations should be at the top of next January's list.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Connecticut are both saddled with too much debt.
Although the regional economy has been good, it is far from
structurally sound. The tremors on Wall Street should serve as a
reminder of how easy it would be for New York City, the engine of
the state's economy, to falter. The gap between rich and poor is
growing, and middle-class families are scrambling to keep up on
stagnant wages. The expectations of the future may be harder to
conquer than the opposition was this fall.

 &HT;    Texas, Florida governors continue political dynasty
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If there was any doubt before, it's an uncontested fact
now: the Bush family is an American political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The sons of former President George Bush came up big winners on
Election Day, with Jeb Bush, 45, sweeping to victory as Florida's
new governor, joining his older brother, George W., 52, who was
re-elected to a second term as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both are Republicans, and they become the first pair of brothers
to serve simultaneously as governors since the Rockefeller brothers
_ Winthrop in Arkansas and Nelson in New York _ did it in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The dual wins are surely sweet redemption for their father,
George Bush, whose one term as president ended with a loss to Bill
Clinton in 1992. His father, Prescott, served as a U.S. Senator
from Connecticut in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed Bush family assault may not stop at southern
statehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he waltzed to a second term Tuesday, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush was being touted as a potential presidential
candidate on the GOP ticket in 2000. Bush has said he will make up
his mind on running sometime in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother Jeb took the Florida governor's seat in his
second attempt, having lost by an eyelash in 1994 to incumbent
Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles, who will retire in January having
never lost an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for doing things the new way,'' said Jeb
Bush, who was joined at his victory party in Miami by his parents.
</P>
<P>
   His victory solidifies the Republican hold on Florida, where
voters have already installed a GOP-controlled Legislature, the
first Republican control of both state houses in the South since
Reconstruction. Bush is the third Republican to serve as Florida
governor this century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defeated former Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, a lifelong
politician who once served in Congress and spent the past eight
years as Chiles' lieutenant governor. MacKay trailed Bush in polls
all year, at times by as much as 18 points, but managed to close
the gap as the election neared. It wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Bush to make waves in Florida_and perhaps nationally.
Tall, earnest and deeply conservative, his main campaign promise
was to institute a system of controversial school vouchers that
will allow parents to send their children to private schools with
public dollars. Critics fear the vouchers will turn inner-city and
minority schools into wastelands with few resources or good
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also opposes abortion, and his election could see new
initiatives on that divisive issue. Last year Florida's Republican
Legislature passed a law creating a ``Choose Life'' automobile tag,
only to see Chiles veto the law. But Bush toned down his
conservatism considerably for the 1998 race, downplaying the
abortion issue and reaching out to women and minorities. After a
nasty split divided Democratic Party leaders from one of their core
constituencies, African-Americans, Bush campaigned hard for black
votes. Significantly, he was joined onstage at his victory party by
several top black Democrats, and exit polls showed he won 11
percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory of inclusion rather than exclusion,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Robbery probable motive in Atlanta slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A desire to steal is probably what drove Timothy Carl
Dawson to shoot three strangers to death in a tiny room on the 24th
floor of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said evidence left behind by
the 37-year-old Dawson shows signs of his possibly being both a
serial killer, because of the methodical elements of the slayings,
and a ``spree killer,'' because of the disorganized elements. A
spree killer, Lloyd said, is someone who can snap and embark on a
killing binge. Lloyd declined to discuss what evidence was left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson is charged with the murder of Phillip Dover, 31, Gerrold
Shropshire, 50, and Ronald Gutkowski, 51, in the Atlanta hotel and
of LaDarris Hawkins, 19, in a College Park hotel. He is also
suspected in the home invasion slaying of DeKalb County real estate
agent Raycell Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they have found no evidence that Dawson knew the
three men who were shot in the hotel. Together with the other
robberies police believe he committed, that leaves theft as the
most likely motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a killer,'' Lloyd said Tuesday afternoon. ``We know
as of now that he did not know his victims at the Hilton and we
believe for now that robbery was the motive. But, then again,
murder could have been the motive and robbery a justification for
that murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   One robbery witness picked out her attacker from a photo lineup
and an elderly couple did not recognize their assailant from the
photos.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson pleaded not guilty through his attorney in Municipal
Court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Riley Jr. ejected all reporters and the public
from the courtroom while Dawson appeared briefly. According to his
attorney, Thomas McKee West, Dawson wore a shirt over his face and
shackles on his legs and arms and he waived a first appearance
while the reporters were out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   West had argued that witnesses could be in the audience and they
should not be allowed to see his client in shackles. The attorney
also said Atlanta police and Shelby County, Tenn., sheriffs
authorities probably conspired to plant evidence in Dawson's 1988
Chevy Celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to several victims
were found in Dawson's car on Oct. 31 after Shelby County deputies
stopped him for speeding in a construction zone just east of
Memphis. Police also found a .45-caliber handgun that investigators
believe was used in the four shootings. The weapon, along with
Dawson's car and the identification, are being tested at the State
Crime Lab, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people who police believe were robbed at gunpoint by
Dawson were shown a photo lineup by police Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Forest Reid, who was robbed in her suburban Atlanta hotel
room on Oct. 11, identified a man from at least six photographs
shown her by detectives at her home in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   However, armed robbery victims John and Virginia Rogers of
Joliet, Ill., were unable to pick out a suspect in a photo lineup
shown to them by Clayton County investigators at their winter home
in Bonita Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man I identified in my photo line-up is the same man that
robbed me that night in the hotel,'' Reid said on Tuesday. ``They
showed me six pictures and I picked him out. But investigators told
me I will never know from them whether this (Dawson) is the man
that attacked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County (Ga.) police spokesman Robert Quigley said
detectives on the case could not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and a friend were staying at the North Atlanta Hilton in
Cobb County on Oct. 11 when a man fitting Dawson's description
burst into her hotel room and threatened to kill her. ``He was cold
and deliberate,'' Reid said of her attacker. ``I was sure he was
going to kill me and I can't understand why he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Virginia Rogers meanwhile, said they could not identify
a suspect from their photographs because it was too dark in their
hotel room the night their attacker pushed his way inside.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 8:40 p.m. on Oct. 17 when someone knocked on the
Rogers' hotel room door at the Holiday Inn Express in Stockbridge
and tricked them by saying he had a food delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one light on in the room when he came in and he
forced us to close our eyes,'' John Rogers said Tuesday. ``He kept
checking to see if we had our eyes closed. He then told us to go
into the bathroom and stay in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Virginia Rogers, who suffers from asthma, began
to have an attack, John Rogers said: ``We begged him to let us get
my wife's medicine but he said no. Then my wife said loudly, 'God I
need you now' and the robber answered 'Jesus loves you _ you won't
die tonight.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Clayton County police spokesman Capt. Doug Jewett said they
still have an armed robbery case against Dawson because he had the
Rogers' identification with him when he was arrested.

CELLUCCI HOLDS ON TO GOVERNOR'S JOB -- BARELY 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Subs first 2 grafs; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acting Governor Paul Cellucci edged out Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger in the Massachusetts governor's race
Tuesday night, barely fending off a last-minute Democratic surge
that buried a host of Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the precincts reporting, Cellucci and his running
mate, Jane Swift, had pulled ahead of Harshbarger and his
ticket-mate Warren Tolman, 50 percent to 48 percent, after a day in
which surveys of voters at the polls put the race dead-even.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly tight race reflected a national trend Tuesday
in which Democrats _ benefiting from what some say is a backlash
against Republican impeachment attempts _ made strong showings in
US House and Senate races as well as gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cellucci was unexpectedly hit by an unusual political
phenomenon that threatened to sink his attempt to win a full
four-year term. Democrats nationwide bucked a historic trend in
which the party that controls the White House loses large numbers
of congressional seats in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger has benefited from that,'' said US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat. ``The base of
the Democratic Party, including the unions in Massachusetts, was
mobilized to get its members to polls in numbers no one realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters at both camps Tuesday nightwere settling in for a
long night as returns trickled in with no definite trends.
</P>
<P>
   The strong Democratic voting Tuesday also helped the state party
to sweep the contests for the other constitutional offices.
Secretary of State William F. Galvin, seeking a second four-year
term, and State Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci, first elected to the
post in 1986, handily won reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Shannon O'Brien, a former state senator from
Easthampton, won her bid to replace Republican Joseph D. Malone as
state treasurer, ending the GOP's eight-year lock on that office.
She defeated Bob Maginn, a wealthy business consultant from
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the race for attorney general to replace
Harshbarger, his one-time protege, Middlesex County District
Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat from Watertown, easily won
over his Republican rival, Brad Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also failed to gain another foothold in the
state's all-Democratic congressional delegation. In the North
Shore's 6th District, US Representative John F. Tierney of Salem
turned back a rematch challenge from Republican Peter G. Torkildsen
of Danvers, who had held the seat for two terms. Tierney had
defeated him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3rd District, which extends from Worcester to Fall River,
US Representative James McGovern, a first-term Democrat from
Worcester, overcame his Republican challenger, Matthew J. Amorello,
a state senator from Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of Cellucci's strategy throughout the fall campaign
was to cut into Harshbarger's Democratic base, but surveys of
voters leaving the polls showed the attorney general, while not
widely popular among some rank-and-file members, was able to take
over three-quarters of his party's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harshbarger won a majority of women voters, a bloc
that earlier surveys showed backing Cellucci, in some cases by a
wide margin. Cellucci had courted women voters by citing his work
on domestic violence and by choosing Swift. Cellucci said working
mothers would have a voice in his administration through her.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also got a big boost from several major
Massachusetts Democratic figures, including US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry, who made a series of appearances with
the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more important, Harshbarger received huge support
from organized labor, most notably the state AFL-CIO, which
provided him with workers and paid for mailings and leaflet-drops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is in an economic boom, Cellucci had been
struggling to establish an identity since he took over as governor
in July 1997 when William F. Weld resigned. A low-key figure who
had toiled in the state Legislature for the last 22 years, Cellucci
never commanded a high profile like Weld did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci was able to maintain a more disciplined campaign
message than Harshbarger, attacking the attorney general on
so-called wedge issues such as the death penalty, taxes, and
welfare. He was also able to fend off Harshbarger's attempts to
bring his personal finances into the debate. And he was even able
to beat Harshbarger where the attorney general lives _ the largely
Republican Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other races around the country, the Massachusetts
gubernatorial race, in terms of issues, was never about very much
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci argued that he and former governor Weld were
responsible for the economic boom and that he was the fiscal
conservative who would continue the prosperity and impose
discipline at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger argued that the state needed new leadership, one
that would bring compassion and innovative ideas to state
government.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue bubbled up to dominate the campaign or
captivate the voters. At the same time, the rhetoric stayed highly
charged, negative, and personal, but the differences between the
two on issues such as education, child care, and expanded health
care seemed small.

GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS TAKES AIR OUT OF IMPEACHMENT BALLOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A better-than-expected election for Democrats
Tuesday night is good news for President Clinton in his battle
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed that even though Democrats would not retake
the House, they would hold their own and might even pick up a seat
or two. The Senate, now 55-45 Republican, looked to change little.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed most voters turned their backs on GOP efforts
to make the impeachment scandal an electoral centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 in 10 voters said the impeachment inquiry now underway
had nothing to do with their vote for House candidates. The
remaining 40 percent were about equally divided between those
expressing opposition to Clinton and those showing support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air is out of that balloon,'' Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado,
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (voters) are saying to Congress is: Wrap this up, finish
it off, get back to business,'' Romer added. ``The majority of
voters feel impeachment is not justified by these acts (Clinton's
oral sex with Monica Lewinsky) even though they don't approve (of)
the acts at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans brushed off losses of incumbents such as GOP Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina.
``The important thing for us is to get this election behind us and
focus on issues for next year,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The House is poised to hold impeachment hearings later this
month on Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky, the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Republican leadership, many pundits and academic
specialists had cast the election as a referendum on whether the
House should impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in the exit polls, a majority said they did not want Clinton
to resign and more than half said they wanted to shelve the
impeachment proceedings altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, ``this is a very important symbolic victory,
although clearly in raw numbers, it doesn't amount to very much,''
said Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were some unsettling signs for Democrats. Almost
two thirds of those polled said Clinton's ability to lead has been
hurt. As expected, education, taxes, Social Security and the
economy ranked high on the list of voter concerns. But about 20
percent said moral and ethical values were the top issue, with only
education rated as high.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta noted that with
the lame-duck lawmakers still in Congress, the impeachment process
``is going to go forward'' in the coming weeks. But he added that
``the election takes some of the sting out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic incumbents, particularly in the South and rural
areas, feared the scandal might work against them. For the most
part, those fears proved groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., held back GOP challenger Dan Page,
who ran campaign ads accusing ``liberal Bob Etheridge'' of standing
side-by-side with an immoral president and his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, was ahead in
fighting off a tough challenge by Republican challenger Rudy Izzard
in his conservative central Texas district.
</P>
<P>
   To inoculate themselves politically, both Stenholm and Etheridge
had voted for the House Republican resolution Oct. 8 authorizing an
impeachment inquiry against Clinton with neither time nor
subject-matter limits.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic challengers had hoped that public weariness with
the scandal would help put them over the top against GOP
incumbents. But that was not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky's third district, Democratic House challenger Chris
Gorman ran ads attacking what he called Republicans' obsession with
scandal, but he lost to Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., a one-term
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results are likely to mean that the House impeachment
inquiry envisioned by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill, will be conducted with dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is expected to announce, perhaps this week, a timetable for
the inquiry. Some reports suggest that hearings will begin in
mid-November and wind up before Christmas, with a limited witness
schedule that may include key players such as presidential
secretary Betty Currie, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan and maybe
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason that the GOP's late-inning, $10 million ad
campaign targeting the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal fizzled is that
Democrats countered with ads that characterizing Republicans as
scandal-obsessed. In contrast, the Democrats said they wanted to
move forward on education, health care and saving Social Security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Clinton's sex scandal was also blunted somewhat
by disclosures that such prominent congressional Republicans as
Reps. Hyde, Dan Burton of Indiana and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho also
had committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last weekend, the scientific journal Nature reported that
DNA tests proved that President Thomas Jefferson had fathered at
least one child by Sally Hemings, his slave at his Virginia home.
The disclosure further reduced any lingering moral shock stemming
from Lewinsky's involvement with President William Jefferson
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a good night for Democrats sprouted in the last day or
so.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Washington-based Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press detected a significant shift for Democrats in
the campaign's final days. The polls showed 46 percent of likely
voters supporting Democratic congressional candidates while 44
percent preferred the GOP. A Pew survey two weeks earlier showed
precisely the reverse _ 48 percent of likely voters supporting
Republican congressional candidates and 43 percent favoring
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll also on Monday showed 67 percent
opposing impeachment of Clinton, while 27 percent supported it.
Forty-one percent said their votes would send a message on Clinton,
with 23 percent expressing support and 18 percent disapproving.
Fifty-four percent said their votes would contain no message.

<P>
   A ballot measure that would have made Michigan the second state
in the nation to legalize physician-assisted suicide was decisively
defeated in Tuesday's voting, one of more than 235 statewide ballot
initiatives passed on during the day from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   The measure went down by a ratio of 2-1 after coming under sharp
criticism from a coalition of religious, medical and right-to-life
organizations that, somewhat surprisingly, included Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, the nation's foremost advocate of physician-assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the way the measure was written it would have
imposed too many restrictions on physicians and patients. Other
members of the coalition, which outspent the measure's proponents
$5 million to $1 million, argued that terminally ill people
deserved all the care and comfort possible but the measure, as
written, was a wordy muddle that would create a ``death
bureaucracy'' and do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon authorized physician-assisted suicide a couple of years
ago. But its law has not been widely used yet and appears headed
for a court challenge or an override by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of assisted suicide vowed to try again to push
through legalization in Michigan. If so, leaders of the opposing
coalition said, the fight would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely the vote does not signal the end of the debate,'' said
one of the leaders, Dr. Cathy Blight.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan initiative was one of the most hotly debated ballot
measures faced by voters Tuesday. But there were plenty of others,
ranging from proposals to outlaw affirmative action, late-term
abortions and gay marriages to proposals to expand casino gambling,
tighten campaign-finance laws and legalize marijuana for medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the measures were on ballots in states west of
the Mississippi, the region of the country where citizen drives to
change public policy in the ballot booth have a long history. But a
fair number of initiatives also were on Eastern ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, voters decided not only whether to ban most
forms of state-sponsored affirmative actions, one of the hottest
ballot measure in the country, but also decided whether to ban
late-term abortions and whether to raise the state's minimum wage,
with increases tied to the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Californians voted on whether to expand Indian casino gambling,
an issue so economically and socially contentious that proponents
and opponents together set a national record for initiative
spending _ more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii and Alaska, voters were asked to decide whether
marriage should be defined only as a heterosexual union.
</P>
<P>
   And in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Washington state and the District
of Columbia, voters decided whether to legalize marijuana for
medical use. However, the vote in the District was not released,
under instructions from Congress, because the ballot issue there is
tied up in court.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina voters decided whether to remove a century-old
section of their Constitution that forbids marriage between whites
and blacks, a provision courts have already ruled is unenforceable.
Massachusetts decided whether to scrap its utility deregulation
plans. Iowans voted on whether to add ``and women'' to their
constitutional guarantee that all men are ``free and equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 200-plus statewide initiatives that were voted on
Tuesday, there also were votes on scores of local issues, most
serious, some arcane, a few good for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In Newport, Maine, where there have been complaints about a
resident mowing her lawn while topless, voters decided whether to
ask selectmen to ban all display of ``female breasts visible from a
public way.''  &QL;

GOP HOLD ON HOUSE SLIPPING; THREAT TO GINGRICH SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Subs first 7 grafs; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Republicans were on the brink Tuesday night of losing seats in
the House, a stunning development that would fray the GOP's already
fragile majority and lay the seeds for a possible challenge to Newt
Gingrich's speakership.
</P>
<P>
   While GOP leaders earlier this fall were predicting major gains
in the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority in the
Senate, national results and projections for late races Tuesday
night showed the GOP retaining a modest majority in the Senate, but
losing part of its 11-seat majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The results could politically imperil Gingrich, who barely
survived an attempted coup last year and was assailed by
conservatives last month for endorsing a $500 billion spending
compromise that broke a balanced-budget cap by more than $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appear to have defied history, marking the first time
since 1934 that the party controlling the White House picked up
House seats the sixth year of a president's term.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans appear to have squandered a chance to exploit
President Clinton's weaknesses amid an impeachment inquiry stemming
from his sexual affair with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This almost certainly means there will be a challenger to
Speaker Gingrich within the Republican caucus,'' said
Representative Richard E. Neal, a Springfield Democrat who easily
won a sixth term Tuesday night. ``I can't imagine he can escape a
serious challenge now.''
</P>
<P>
   The slim GOP majority in Congress is likely to retain enough
power to stymie some of Clinton's agenda on education, health care,
and his other prized issues. But Republicans probably will lack
enough clout to achieve many of their top initiatives, from cutting
taxes to privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the apparent GOP failure to substantially strengthen
the party's grip on the House and Senate is expected to slow, if
not stall, momentum toward Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders said before the election that supporters of
Clinton's impeachment lacked the 67 votes they would need to remove
him from office. And the early projections Tuesday night indicated
that Republicans, who now control 55 Senate seats, may pick up no
more than one or two additional seats, fewer than party leaders had
hoped and too few to increase the pressure for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee poised to open impeachment
hearings this month, the lack of support in the Senate to remove
Clinton from office increases the chance the process will end in a
negotiated compromise between the White House and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs of the GOP's apparent failure to post substantial
gains in the Senate were pivotal losses by such GOP incumbents as
Senators Alfonse D'Amato in New York and Lauch Faircloth in North
Carolina. The defeats were projected by several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was defeated by Representative Charles E. Schumer,
and Faircloth, who lost to trial lawyer John Edwards, ranked among
Clinton's leading nemeses in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the race to succeed another Clinton foe, retiring
Senator Dan Coats, also was won by a Democrat, former governor Evan
Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, who was
considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, was
projected as the winner over Representative Bob Inglis, a
Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also successfully defended the seat of retiring
Senator Dale Bumpers in Arkansas, who will be succeeded by former
Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat, according to
network projections.
</P>
<P>
   However, voters apparently were leaning toward sticking with a
Congress ruled predominantly by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
other Southern conservatives, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Whether rank-and-file Republican lawmakers will stick with
Gingrich and Lott is another question, though, as the GOP leaders
could come under fire for failing to substantially expand their
majorities while Clinton was weakened by his sex scandal involving
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich narrowly survived an attempted coup in 1997, and
conservatives assailed him last month for pushing a $500 billion
spending compromise that exceeded a balanced-budget cap by more
than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did pick up a former Democratic seat in Ohio, where
the GOP governor, George V. Voinovich, will succeed Senator John H.
Glenn Jr., the space hero and four-term Democratic stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also were running neck-and-neck with Democrats for
open seats in several other states, most notably Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Hotly contested House races across the country were too close to
call early Tuesday night. Among the incumbents facing tough
reelection races were two members of the Judiciary Committee:
Representatives Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, and Mel Watt, a
North Carolina Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House was expected to become slightly more
conservative, despite apparently minuscule Republican gains. Among
the reasons is the retirement of several longtime liberal
Democrats, who are expected to be replaced by more centrist,
pro-business Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new class of Democrats is expected to include Charlie
Gonzalez, a retired state judge who is the son of retiring
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a leading liberal during his 38
years in the House.

BOXER WINS HARD-FOUGHT CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ In one of the most closely watched
Senate races in the country, Barbara Boxer, the junior liberal
Democratic senator who won her first election in a hard-fought
squeaker, won an even harder-fought race against her Republican
challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election polls closed here at 8 p.m., early exit
polls of voters had Boxer leading Fong by between 6 and 9
percentage points. Roy Behr, a spokesman for Boxer's campaign, said
that he expected the race to get closer when absentee ballots were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, it was clear that Boxer would win. ``Every time
we added another issue to the mix, we gained support,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at Boxer's campaign headquarters here at the Fairmont
Hotel was jubilant well before the polls closed, with supporters
laughing, hugging and toasting each other with wine. Minutes after
the polls closed, as CNN and ABC projected Boxer the winner, the
crowd began talking more boisterously and the music became louder.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, political analysts predicted that Boxer, an
outspoken liberal in a moderate, wildly diverse state, would face a
tough race. In her six years in the Senate, she has not managed to
broaden her base of support, and her approval ratings have been
below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by the Field Institute in San Francisco before
the June primary found that even though Fong was much less
well-known than his Democratic rival, his favorability ratings were
close to hers. By August, the political newcomer had pulled even.
</P>
<P>
   The race remained even until the final weeks, when it began to
seesaw.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Boxer began to falter. She fumbled over
questions regarding President Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky. Fong, seizing the opportunity, made political inroads by
contrasting Boxer's outspoken criticism of Clarence Thomas, accused
at his confirmation hearings of sexual harassment of Anita Hill,
and her ``deafening'' silence on the Lewinsky matter. A Field Poll
released Oct. 9 had Fong leading Boxer by 48-44 percent of likely
voters, with 8 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Boxer began a series of television commercials
painting her opponent as an extremist who opposed new gun control
laws, legal abortion and tougher environmental standards. Her poll
ratings began to perk up, especially after she publicly embraced
President Clinton for his part in negotiating the Middle East peace
accord, which was signed the day before he spent a weekend in
California helping to raise $2 million for her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer began to pull ahead over the last 10 days, after the San
Francisco Examiner reported that Fong had given $50,000 in campaign
funds left over from a past race for state treasurer to the
Traditional Values Coalition, a right-wing group that favors prayer
in schools and opposes gay rights, abortion and birth control. For
the first time in her six years in the Senate, Boxer's approval
ratings rose above 50 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fong, who had been taking great pains to portray himself as a
moderate Republican _ pro-business and pro-flat-tax, but flexible
on social issues _ spent days trying to explain the donation.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly lost the support of a conservative gay group that had
endorsed him _ the Log Cabin Republicans. But its members decided
to stick with Fong, providing he would sign a pledge of support for
a list of gay issues, including greater financing for AIDS research
and new protections for gay employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Fong began running ads directly attacking Boxer. One
featured his mother, March Fong Eu, the longtime Democratic
secretary of state here, who said Boxer had been telling lies about
her son.
</P>
<P>
   His last minute strategy didn't work. One of Boxer's supporters,
Glenn Dedman, who was festooned with Boxer buttons on his lapel,
said he always knew she would win. ``If you polled my friends,
Boxer would've won by 100 percent,'' he said.

ELECTION RESULTS SET STAGE FOR POSSIBLE GORE-BUSH CLASH IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: UPDATES throughout  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 A News Analysis   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Tuesday's election out of the way, potential
presidential candidates will now begin publicly declaring their
long-whispered candidacies for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The flood gates will have to open wide to accommodate a large
troupe of White House aspirants lining up for the first
presidential election without an incumbent since President Ronald
Reagan retired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the would-be contenders, Vice President Al Gore and Texas
GOP Gov. George Bush emerged from Tuesday's results as the most
likely candidates to face a showdown for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore benefited as much as President Clinton from Republicans'
failure to score big gains in the House and energize the House
impeachment investigation. With Clinton stronger, it appears less
likely that Gore will face a divisive Democratic primary challenge
for the party's nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, emerged
stronger by demonstrating a stunning appeal to traditional
Democratic voting blocks. He carried 65 percent of women voters in
Texas and 21 percent of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish-speaking former business executive scored even
bigger with Hispanics, boosting his share of the Hispanic vote from
28 percent in 1994 to 46 percent in 1998 _ a staggering 64 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a matching gubernatorial victory by his brother Jeb
Bush in Florida, the Texas governor can look to Hispanic voters in
2000 to potentially help sway the outcome in California, Texas,
Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York _ states with large
Hispanic populations that control 67 percent of the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national survey pitting Gore against Bush, completed
on Oct. 25, showed Bush leading Gore, 57 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wins the Democratic nomination in 2000, he faces long
odds historically: Only one of the last three vice presidents to
seek the presidency has succeeded _ Vice President George Bush in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush can take solace from history: Sixteen governors have
served as president, including three of the last four presidents _
Clinton, from Arkansas; Ronald Reagan from California; and Jimmy
Carter from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls already showed Gore, 51, a former Tennessee
senator and defeated 1988 presidential primary candidate, holding a
wide lead over his closest Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wall Street Journal survey in mid-September, Gore
draws 51 percent compared to 12 percent each for House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vowing to declare their intentions include: Gore,
Gephardt, Bradley, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, who led the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee that
helped fund Democratic Senate upsets in New York and North
Carolina, said he would announce his own presidential plans by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   With the election over, ``it's closer to the end of the year so
I'm closer to a decision,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerges from his victory in Texas with polls showing a wide
lead over prospective rivals for the Republican nomination, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans expected to announce their plans in coming months
include Bush; Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.; former GOP vice
presidential candidate Jack Kemp; former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former 1996 GOP presidential primary candidate Malcolm ``Steve''
Forbes Jr.; former Tennessee GOP Gov. Lamar Alexander; former GOP
Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole; conservative Republican Gary Bauer,
a domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan; two-time GOP
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan; Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.; outgoing California Gov. Pete Wilson.

<P>
   Apparent setbacks for Republicans in the House spelled immediate
trouble for the presidential prospects of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., the mastermind of the GOP's historic 1994 takeover
of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the mid-term election results show the
electorate turned off by Republican efforts to exploit Clinton's
sex scandal, some GOP presidential aspirants appear to have landed
on the wrong side of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Both Quayle, the former Indiana senator who joined Bush on the
GOP ticket in 1988, and Ashcroft had sought to exploit the Clinton
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-term contests gave both Democratic and Republican
contenders for their party's presidential nominations ample
opportunity to gain political debts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, a two-time Democratic
presidential primary candidate, emerged from Tuesday's midterm
congressional elections as a stronger force in the Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Chicago-based Operation PUSH pressed get-out-the-vote
efforts in African American communities across the nation, helping
to tilt key Senate races in North Carolina, South Carolina,
California and New York but falling short in the re-election bid by
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' inability to gain traction with the impeachment
issue also may strengthen the presidential prospects of House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. He made it a point
of working on budget issues rather than getting enmeshed in the
political firestorms of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results also buoyed the vice presidential fortunes of
a variety of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Ohio Gov. George Voinovich won his bid to
fill the Senate seat of retiring Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. New York
Gov. George Pataki scored a landslide for a second term; Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson swamped his opponent to win a fourth term;
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating won a second term.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Indiana Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh won a
Senate seat from his traditionally GOP state, raising the
possibility of a national role in 2000 for the son of former Sen.
Birch Bayh, D-Ind., a Democratic presidential candidate in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The 38 percent turnout in Tuesday's nationwide election _
roughly equal to the turnout in 1994 _ is expected to bolster
claims by political outsiders that the nation's traditional
politicians are turning off the electorate. The results may help
revive the populist-oriented campaigns of Buchanan or independent
Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who competed unsuccessfully for the
presidency in 1992 and 1996.

THREE RECRUITS COMMIT TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The USC women's basketball team has picked up three oral
commitments, including one from Portia Mitchell, considered one of
the top-10 post players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a 6-foot-4 center from Narbonne High School, committed
to USC last weekend. Mitchell chose USC over Georgia, Vanderbilt
and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Women of Troy also picked up a commitment from Mitchell's
teammate, 5-10 guard Jessica Cheeks. Her father is a cousin of
former NBA player Maurice Cheeks. She selected USC over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The third commitment came from Tennille Grant, a 5-11
swingperson from Kansas City. Grant chose USC over Kansas and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   USC has one scholarship remaining. Players can begin signing
letters-of-intent on Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Clark finished: Guard Kim Clark's basketball career came to an
end Sunday when she suffered a broken leg while playing for the
women's soccer team against UCLA. Clark, who is a junior, will miss
the season. Clark had already decided to concentrate on soccer and
not play basketball her senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller makes quick recovery: Guard Kiyoko Miller, who was
expected to miss the entire season after undergoing reconstructive
shoulder surgery, is now projected to return in late December or
early January.

BOXER, MURRAY FEND OFF GOP CHALLENGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of the endangered women has turned
into the election of some empowered women.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington state, who rode a feminist ``Year of the Woman'' wave
into Washington in 1992 but looked like possible victims of a voter
backlash in 1998, turned away strong GOP opponents and won second
six-year terms Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Democratic Senator Carol Moseley-Braun lost her seat to
conservative state Senator Peter Fitzgerald, but narrowly, and not
before she battled back from a double-digit deficit in the polls
and made it, for a time at least, a race too close for network
pollsters to call.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boxer and Murray fended off charges by their opponents that
they were hypocrites for being silent on President Clinton's sex
scandal while being vocal six years ago about sexual harassment
allegations made against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned hard in recent weeks for both
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defeated Republican California State Treasurer Matt Fong
in a negative and costly race. Murray overcame Representative Linda
Smith, a maverick Republican, in an equally nasty contest.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first African-American
woman elected to the Senate, was dogged throughout her term by
questions about her character, ethics, and judgment. She was
investigated for campaign-spending irregularities and criticized
for repeated visits in Nigeria with the late dictator Sani Abacha.
In a television ad, she told Illinois voters she had let them down.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, the notable difference this decade in the way
men and women vote, was a big factor in elections again, according
to exit polls conducted by the Voter News Service, and it appeared
to particularly help Democrats, who benefited from the strong
support of women. Moseley-Braun, for example, was garnering 54
percent of the women's vote, compared to 45 percent for Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrat Charles Schumer upset incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato as women gave Schumer 61 percent of their vote, according
to exit polls. In North Carolina, Democrat John Edwards defeated
Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth with 59 percent of the women's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap is damn well determining these very significant
Democratic victories,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, a women's rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to close the gender gap this year by
campaigning on issues women say are important to them _ education,
health care, and Social Security. But a New York Times poll
conducted the last week of October showed GOP candidates were not
winning over voters on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, elected as the
only newcomer to the Senate sisterhood, got 59 percent of the
women's vote Tuesday in defeating Fay Boozman, an ophthalmologist
and state senator who sponsored the state's 1997 bill to ban
late-term abortions. Lincoln had retired from the US House in 1997
because she was pregnant with twins.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen got twice
as many votes from women as her opponent, Republican Jay Lucas, and
easily was elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Women did not give Republican challenger Ellen Sauerbrey the
boost she needed in her rematch with Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening. In fact, 60 percent of the women voters supported
Glendening Tuesday, according to exit polls, compared to 57 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerbrey was one of 10 women running for governor this fall,
and for weeks polls showed her contest with Glendening a dead heat.
It looked like it could produce a replay of 1994, when voters
delivered such a squeaker that Sauerbrey challenged the results in
court.
</P>
<P>
   What was different this time, however, was Sauerbrey's style and
issues. Trying to close the gender gap, she softened her
conservative edge, downplayed her opposition to gun control and
abortion, and highlighted her credentials as a former schoolteacher
and a friend of working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like she went to acting class and got a new wardrobe
and hairdo to be more appealing,'' said Rita Regino of Bethesda,
Md., who couldn't bring herself to vote for Sauerbrey, even though
she thought Glendening had been a poor governor. ``I vote on gender
issues, but I don't vote for a woman because she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, voters returned Republican Jane Dee Hull as
governor, while Democrats Barbara Kennelly in Connecticut, Myrth
York in Rhode Island, and Laura Boyd in Oklahoma lost their
gubernatorial bids. Republican Ruth Dwyer lost to Democratic
Governor Howard Dean in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   A record 121 women ran for the US House, including 28 who
opposed each other and, for the first time, three who declared they
are lesbians. Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who is gay, held a wide lead
Tuesday night over Republican Josephine Musser for an open seat in
Wisconsin. The other gay women _ Democrats Christine Kehoe of San
Diego and Margarethe Cammermayer of Seattle _ were running against
Republican incumbents in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Indianapolis reelected Democrat Julia Carson, who had
been on the endangered list, and in Baton Rouge, La., 32-year-old
Marjorie McKeithen, a Democratic newcomer, was moving toward an
upset of GOP incumbent Richard Baker.

PATAKI CAPTURES SECOND TERM AS NEW YORK GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Securing the voter mandate he was denied four years
ago, Gov. George Pataki easily won re-election Tuesday in an
election that the popular Republican views as a powerful
affirmation of his policies.
</P>
<P>
   With about a third of the votes counted, Pataki had 57 percent
of the vote, short of a record landslide. Pataki and running mate
Mary Donohue, who replaced Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross on the GOP
ticket, declared victory shortly after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not great that we are going to have a tremendous new
lieutenant governor?'' Pataki asked a cheering crowd at the New
York Hilton, where the Republicans held their victory party. ``I
guarantee you, Mary Donohue is going to be a great lieutenant
governor. I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded enthusiastically chanting ``Mary! Mary!
Mary!'' Just four years after unseating Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo
with less than a majority of the vote, the laid-back son of a
mailman crushed Democratic opponent Peter Vallone and all other
comers, won a second-term and positioned himself as a contender for
the 2000 presidential or vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the strong victory gives Pataki added clout to
pursue his agenda of cutting taxes, cracking down on crime and
limiting the role of government.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, echoing his campaign theme, told supporters ``the
best New York is yet to come.'' Also mirroring his campaign, Pataki
promised only more of the same, providing few specifics of what he
intends to do in a second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kept our word in making this a safer state, making
this a healthier state, making it a state with more environmental
opportunities for our children and the children of the next
generation,'' Pataki said. ``Let me tell you something, the job
isn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, a cheerleader for the governor throughout the campaign,
has pledged to be a team player, an obvious contrast to McCaughey
Ross who, after several highly publicized disagreements with
Pataki, switched parties and ran against him.
</P>
<P>
   The race never was much of a contest.
</P>
<P>
   Well-funded and buoyed by a strong economy, the Pataki-Donohue
team ran a front-runner's campaign from day one, touting the
governor's record, barely acknowledging his opposition and steering
clear of controversy or debate. Despite incessant demands for a
public airing of the issues, Vallone never got Pataki on the same
stage for a debate.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, speaker of the New York City Council, attracted only 28
percent of the vote, according to early returns, and the bulk of
the votes he garnered came from his home city.
</P>
<P>
   Businessman Thomas Golisano received about 10 percent on the
Independence Party line, with about a third of the votes counted,
and McCaughey Ross got about 2 percent as a Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Looking simultaneously exhausted and relieved, Vallone said he
knew from the start that his was an uphill fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought this battle because it was the right thing to do,''
Vallone told supporters at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. ``What
we did was worth doing. What we said was worth saying.''

WORKERS HURT BY NBA LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ With every game deleted from the Lakers' schedule,
Shaquille O'Neal loses $183,000. Ervin Ortiz loses about $35.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz arguably has the rougher end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   To support his family, he works four jobs, the fourth as an
usher at the Great Western Forum for Lakers and Kings games. The
work only accounts for about 10 percent of his income, but with a
wife and seven children, every dollar has a destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was just like a filler job for me, but I'm really
dependent on it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz should be working the Lakers' season opener against the
Minnesota Timberwolves tonight. Instead, he'll be at home in
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum will be open, but only to host a high school ice
hockey tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's four-month-old labor battle has wiped out November's
schedule _ 194 games in all, including 13 for the Lakers and 14 for
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   All Ortiz and about 500 other Forum employees _ cashiers,
vendors, custodians, ticket-takers, parking attendants, waiters,
security officers _ can depend on now for their $6 to $9 an hour
are Kings games and the occasional Shania Twain concert.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players have forfeited about $200 million in salaries, and
team owners stand to lose millions more. But it's folks like Ortiz,
the ones earning an atom-sized piece of the $2 billion NBA pie, who
have nothing to gain and no voice in the lockout, who stand as the
big losers today.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at all 29 NBA arenas are losing rent money and could
potentially lose their jobs if the season is canceled. But the
NBA's trickle-down economy doesn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   It hits the waiters and waitresses at the restaurant across from
the Forum. And the T-shirt stand down the street. The ticket broker
downtown. The scalpers. The TV cameramen. Everyone down to the
proverbial ``guys in the truck'' working for KCAL-9 and Fox Sports
West.
</P>
<P>
   The real victims of the lockout clearly are not commissioner
David Stern or Celtics guard Kenny Anderson, the latter of whom
recently joked he might have to sell one of his eight cars.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Woods has greater concerns. A widower, she supports
herself in part by cashiering and cooking at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a !ital!month!off!?'' she said upon hearing November
had been canceled. ``Aww. That !ital!hurts!off!.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' Forum pay accounts for about half her income.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a financial burden. . . . I'll just have to depend
on my family until something else comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   George Lew will celebrate his 10th anniversary working at the
Forum in two weeks. In the meantime, he's contemplating collecting
unemployment to supplement his income as a food service worker.
</P>
<P>
   And the ripples go far beyond the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Cleveland, manager of the Sizzler at Manchester and
Prairie avenues, is losing one of his best dinner crowds without
Lakers games bringing 17,000 people to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's having anywhere between a $600 to $1,000 effect
per game,'' Cleveland said. ``It's really affecting us, so tell
them to cut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Cleveland has just cut back his staff's hours, but if the
lockout drags on . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd definitely have to cut back on staff. . . . It's gonna be
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's older brother, Bob ``Butterbean'' Love, played eight
years for the Chicago Bulls, so Cleveland has sympathy for the
players. But they're testing his patience.
</P>
<P>
   Same for Charles Harkey, who has owned and operated Inglewood
Tickets for 13 years. He sells 20 to 30 tickets to every Lakers
game, up to 10 for every Clippers game and dozens more to games
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when you're missing that many tickets per game, it
affects business,'' Harkey said.
</P>
<P>
   The message from the so-called ``little guys'' to the
millionaires in charge?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurry the hell up,'' groused a Forum worker. ``Solve it.
There's others involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   The response from the powers that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly empathize with those individuals,'' said players
union director Billy Hunter. ``But keep in mind, the players, to a
great extent, will take a much greater hit. More importantly, the
players are the economic engine, they're the ones who made it all
possible for those people to have their jobs in the first
instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Kobe Bryant was a bit more sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I want to get out there and play,'' Bryant said,
``but I think it's selfish on our part to just talk about
basketball. I mean, you have people who are missing their jobs
right now . . . and they have families, they have mouths to feed,
just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Said NBA spokesman Chris Brienza, ``We realize it probably
doesn't make you feel better about us right now, but please hang in
there. It's unfortunate what those people are going through right
now and we do sympathize.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for all involved, sympathy doesn't have a seat at
the bargaining table.

BOXER, MURRAY FEND OFF GOP CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of the endangered women has turned
into the election of some empowered women.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington state, who rode a feminist ``Year of the Woman'' wave
into Washington in 1992 but looked like possible victims of a voter
backlash in 1998, turned away strong GOP opponents and won second
six-year terms Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Democratic Senator Carol Moseley-Braun lost her seat to
conservative state Senator Peter Fitzgerald, but narrowly, and not
before she battled back from a double-digit deficit in the polls
and made it, for a time at least, a race too close for network
pollsters to call.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boxer and Murray fended off charges by their opponents that
they were hypocrites for being silent on President Clinton's sex
scandal while being vocal six years ago about sexual harassment
allegations made against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned hard in recent weeks for both
senators.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defeated Republican California State Treasurer Matt Fong
in a negative and costly race. Murray overcame Representative Linda
Smith, a maverick Republican, in an equally nasty contest.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first African-American
woman elected to the Senate, was dogged throughout her term by
questions about her character, ethics, and judgment. She was
investigated for campaign-spending irregularities and criticized
for repeated visits in Nigeria with the late dictator Sani Abacha.
In a television ad, she told Illinois voters she had let them down.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, the notable difference this decade in the way
men and women vote, was a big factor in elections again, according
to exit polls conducted by the Voter News Service, and it appeared
to particularly help Democrats, who benefited from the strong
support of women. Moseley-Braun, for example, was garnering 54
percent of the women's vote, compared to 45 percent for Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrat Charles Schumer upset incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato as women gave Schumer 61 percent of their vote, according
to exit polls. In North Carolina, Democrat John Edwards defeated
Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth with 59 percent of the women's
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap is damn well determining these very significant
Democratic victories,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, a women's rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to close the gender gap this year by
campaigning on issues women say are important to them _ education,
health care, and Social Security. But a New York Times poll
conducted the last week of October showed GOP candidates were not
winning over voters on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, elected as the
only newcomer to the Senate sisterhood, got 59 percent of the
women's vote Tuesday in defeating Fay Boozman, an ophthalmologist
and state senator who sponsored the state's 1997 bill to ban
late-term abortions. Lincoln had retired from the US House in 1997
because she was pregnant with twins.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen got twice
as many votes from women as her opponent, Republican Jay Lucas, and
easily was elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Women did not give Republican challenger Ellen Sauerbrey the
boost she needed in her rematch with Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening. In fact, 60 percent of the women voters supported
Glendening Tuesday, according to exit polls, compared to 57 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerbrey was one of 10 women running for governor this fall,
and for weeks polls showed her contest with Glendening a dead heat.
It looked like it could produce a replay of 1994, when voters

Md., who couldn't bring herself to vote for Sauerbrey, even though
she thought Glendening had been a poor governor. ``I vote on gender
issues, but I don't vote for a woman because she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, voters returned Republican Jane Dee Hull as
governor, while Democrats Barbara Kennelly in Connecticut, Myrth
York in Rhode Island, and Laura Boyd in Oklahoma lost their
gubernatorial bids. Republican Ruth Dwyer lost to Democratic
Governor Howard Dean in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   A record 121 women ran for the US House, including 28 who
opposed each other and, for the first time, three who declared they
are lesbians. Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who is gay, held a wide lead
Tuesday night over Republican Josephine Musser for an open seat in
Wisconsin. The other gay women _ Democrats Christine Kehoe of San
Diego and Margarethe Cammermayer of Seattle _ were running against
Republican incumbents in swing districts.
</P>

   Voters in Indianapolis reelected Democrat Julia Carson, who had
been on the endangered list, and in Baton Rouge, La., 32-year-old
Marjorie McKeithen, a Democratic newcomer, was moving toward an
upset of GOP incumbent Richard Baker.

FHS SAYS IT WILL TAKE WRITE-OFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Managed-care specialist Foundation Health Systems
said on Tuesday it will miss analysts' third-quarter earnings
estimates and take more than $175 million in charges as the company
struggles to refocus its business.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation, one of the nation's largest publicly traded
managed-care companies, said it will take six separate charges
ranging from $14 million to $43 million, resulting from issues as
varied as severance pay for fired workers in Colorado to
money-losing government contracts in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the one-time write-offs, Foundation said it
would miss earnings estimates by about 14 percent, generating an
estimated profit of 24 cents per share, compared to the 28 cent
average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. After the
charges, Foundation expects to report a loss of 73 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of cleanup necessary there, and they've
still got a lot of work to do,'' said Greg Crawford, an analyst at
Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation spokesman David Olson said the unexpectedly large set
of charges is an attempt to ``clean the slate and get on with our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, do you want to keep dribbling out charges or
get it done with all at once? Our CFO said this is the time to
clean house,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation's new chief executive, Jay Gellert, has sought to
shed the company's money-losing enterprises, including its workers'
compensation unit, and scale back its Medicare HMO contracts.
Resources are instead being directed toward profitable HMO
operations in California, Florida and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But one analyst, who asked not to be identified because of a
professional relationship with the company, said several previous
charges, including those stemming from real estate losses and the
workers' compensation unit, make the latest round of charges
frustrating for analysts and investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of it,'' the analyst said. ``Their record of
estimates is horrible. And who the hell believes this is really
(going to be) a clean slate?''
</P>
<P>
   But, the analyst added, the latest news will likely have little
impact on Foundation shares ``because the stock is so depressed
already it doesn't really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation shares fell 50 cents Tuesday to close at $11.75. The
issue hit a 52-week high of $32.125 on May 8.

 &HT;    Edwards ousts incumbent Faircloth in North Carolina
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH _ Newcomer John Edwards ousted Republican Lauch
Faircloth in a fiercely fought U.S. Senate race marked by
Clinton-bashing that backfired on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a 45-year-old trial lawyer from Raleigh seeking public
office for the first time, is headed to Washington where he'll be
in stark contrast to North Carolina's senior senator, Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwards represents young people, the newcomers who have been
successful,'' said Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of hard-hitting ads by Faircloth that portrayed his
Democratic opponent as a ``Clinton clone'' failed to sway
conservative swing voters. ``They were perceived as negative attack
ads, and they didn't work,'' Beyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Even late Tuesday night, supporters of Faircloth, a 70-year-old
eastern North Carolina farmer and businessman, were counting on
last-minute votes from ``Jessecrats,'' voters who traditionally
back Democrats in local and state elections but favor Republicans
in national contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't happen,'' said Joseph Williams, 52, a car
dealer in Durham who supported Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore telephoned Edwards at 8:45 p.m. to
congratulate him on his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thank you, Mr. Vice President. We are very excited,''
said Edwards, sitting on the edge of a bed in his family's room at
North Raleigh Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   But at Faircloth's headquarters at the Brownstone Hotel in
downtown Raleigh, some supporters refused to concede defeat until
Faircloth appeared on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP was banking on Faircloth's reelection to bolster
Republicans' control of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like Clinton, you'll love Edwards,'' said Jim Holt, 71,
of Raleigh. ``He is the crookedest shyster lawyer who ever came
down the pike.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of campaigning, Edwards put another $1.1
million of his own money into his campaign, bringing his personal
investment to nearly $6 million. He refused to accept money from
political action committees. Faircloth, meanwhile, loaned his
campaign more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' campaign also ran negative ads, portraying Faircloth as
an unscrupulous businessman. The state Democratic Party pulled an
attack ad reminding voters of a 1996 spill at Faircloth's cattle
farm after Democratic hog farmers complained that their industry
was being picked on unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Faircloth is a mean-spirited person,'' said Lynn
Williams, 72, of Louisburg. ``We have better people in North
Carolina to represent us than Lauch Faircloth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Edwards, almost as the lesser of two evils,'' said
Don Stewart, 25, exiting the polls at Martin Middle School in
Raleigh. ``Being a personal-injury lawyer, that is one of the least
respected jobs you can have, but it seems good to bring in some
fresh blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them used negative ads, but Edwards tried to take the
high road until Faircloth turned on him,'' said Bill Correll, 47, a
state employee. He added that he wasn't swayed by Faircloth's
attempt to brand Edwards as a ``Clinton clone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``National politics are national politics,'' said Correll, who
voted at Martin Middle School. ``State politics are state
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates jockeyed for the support of North Carolina's
tobacco belt, where farmers grow $1 billion a year in flue-cured
leaf, the most of any state in America.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, who grows tobacco, rejected criticism that he hadn't
fought hard enough for farmers during national tobacco settlement
talks in Congress. Meanwhile, Faircloth's ads have labeled Edwards
as a ``tobacco-taxing liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to growers, Edwards vowed he'd be he ``most
passionate, fierce advocate you have ever seen for North Carolina
farmers.''

 &HT;    GOP standstill puts Gingrich on the spot
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republicans were on the way to their third successive
majority in the House of Representatives, but Tuesday's election
appeared to leave the GOP with another slim edge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, early returns and exit polls raised the prospect that
Democrats might gain seats in the election, a rare feat in a
midterm election for the party that controls the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The election seemed likely to increase criticism of Speaker Newt
Gingrich by the party's conservative wing and perhaps subject him
to a challenge to his leadership of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also considered the early trends a victory because as
recently as a month ago, Republicans were hoping to use President
Clinton's sex scandal to add two dozen seats or more to their
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even, pick up a few seats or even lose a few, this
would be a historic reversal,'' House Minority Richard Gep- hardt
of Missouri said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who forecast gains of between 5 and 30 seats, declared
victory Tuesday night in Marietta. ``Republicans will chair every
committee. We'll chair every subcommittee and we'll set the
agenda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker predicted gains in the House, Senate and
governorships. ``In every one of those categories, we will be
adding more victories this year,'' he said in an early victory
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said nothing about the House's ongoing impeachment
inquiry against Clinton. But in an interview on CBS, he scoffed at
the suggestion that he might have to fight for a third term as
speaker and indicated his entire leadership team would return.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was a very, very good night for House incumbents.
First-term Democratic Rep. Julia Carson of Indiana and Republican
Rep. Anne Northup of Kentucky, both considered vulnerable, won
re-election to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) held a hotly contested district
that had not re-elected an incumbent in at least the past four
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even where seats changed hands, the messages were mixed. In
Kentucky, for example, Republican Ernie Fletcher and Democrat Ken
Lucas picked up seats that had been held by the other party. The
result was no gain for either party in the Bluegrass State.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas defeated state Sen. Gex Williams, who campaigned with the
strong support of the Christian Coalition and the professional help
of Georgia-based political consultant Ralph Reed, the coalition's
former executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans picked up at least one Democratic seat in
Pennsylvania. Republican Pat Toomey won the seat that had been held
by Democrat Paul McHale, the first House Democrat to call for
Clinton's resignation this year.
</P>
<P>
   There was no unifying theme to the election, no rallying cry or
battle plan like the Contract with America that helped Republicans
seize control of the Congress in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich even suggested Tuesday that Republicans pick up their
contract when they return to Washington in January.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas predicted the 106th
Congress would pursue large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four incumbents, 55 Republicans and 39 Democrats, ran
unopposed or without major-party opposition. Dozens more incumbents
had only token opposition or overwhelmed their challengers in
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Republicans holding 228 seats in the House,
the Democrats, 206. There is one independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican margin in the 105th Congress was the smallest in
by either party in more than 40 years. The fractious GOP majority
led to frequent headaches for the House leadership as it sought
ways to placate the party's conservatives and moderates, and put
together a majority on the floor of the House on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, were unusually united in blocking
major Republican initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   If he is elected by his colleagues, Gingrich would become the
first Republican speaker to preside over three successive
Congresses since the 1920s.

TEAMMATES' SCOLDING HELPS USC'S HARRIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC tight end Antoine Harris was openly criticized by his
teammates, and it might just have turned his season around. During
a team meeting last week, Harris and tight end Lonnie Ford were
taken to task by teammates for not performing up to their
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sulk over the comments, however, Harris embraced the
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt what they said was true,'' Harris said. ``We knew we
weren't doing too well. It did help us a lot. Guys did tell us we
weren't doing as well as we're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who is known for his blocking skills, had one of his
best games of the season against Washington. He graded a score of
86, as the Trojans allowed just two sacks to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like my teammates were belittling anybody,''
Harris said. ``It was just man-to-man, sharing our business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't putting people on their backs. Things weren't going
too well. I felt a lot better against Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicking competition: Although he remains upset about the kicking
position, USC coach Paul Hackett said he suspected Adam Abrams
would start at kicker this week.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hackett said he might alternate Abrams and David Bell,
just to make sure Bell gets some experience in case a change is
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just terribly disappointed in what should be a slam-dunk
position,'' Hackett said. ``It's going to be tough for him to kick
much longer if he doesn't improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams has missed five of his past seven field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed. I'm disappointed,'' Abrams said. ``I'm
probably the most experienced player on team.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also had to deal with being removed from the game by
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time it's ever happened,'' Abrams said. ``I
deserved it. I have no excuses for missing kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   No misunderstanding: Quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst said Hackett
spoke to him about not using the sophomore against Washington,
after telling Van Raaphorst he would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he intended to put me in and it didn't happen,'' Van
Raaphorst said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Hackett apologized, Van Raaphorst said: ``I don't think
with coaches in his position, apologies are given. He's coaching
the team. It's his butt on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting news: Among the names to remember as recruiting
begins to heat up next month: Esperanza kicker Nathan Fiske and
offensive lineman Nate Steinbacher; Mater Dei offensive lineman
Lenny Vandermade; Pacific tailback Joe Weber; El Camino College
tailback Delvon Flowers, and linebacker Kevin Mack of Rio Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Fiske, considered the top kicker in the area, made a 56-yard
field goal earlier this season. Flowers is one of the top JC backs
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Weber has USC high on his list and could possibly commit before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome aboard: There's another Hackett in the football program.
Hackett's son, David, has been hired part-time as an recruiting
administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty healthy: Offensive lineman Travis Claridge (ankle) and
linebacker David Gibson (sore knee) took the day off but are
expected to play.

 &HT;    Gingrich vows renewed tax cut fight
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's influential Republican congressional
delegation will return intact to the House for the 106th Congress,
easy winners Tuesday against mostly token opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich is promising an aggressive agenda that
will try for significant tax cuts and long-term reform of Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   After Democrats thwarted an $80 billion tax reduction package
this year by painting it as detrimental to Social Security's
solvency, Gingrich said, ``We'll be back knocking on the door again
in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Strahan, an Emory University professor who is writing a
book about Gingrich and other powerful speakers, said he expects
Gingrich to push for the two items as a package no matter the size
of the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, he is constrained by the factional balance in
his party, but it is hard to predict his course of behavior,''
Strahan said. ``He has an unusual willingness to take political
risks in order to achieve larger benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old speaker won his 11th term Tuesday against
Democrat Gary ``Bats'' Pelphrey, whose low-profile challenge
effectively allowed Gingrich to abandon a local campaign for a
national effort.
</P>
<P>
   He has served in the House so long that Sam Nunn was the state's
junior senator when Gingrich first took office.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, House Republicans re-elect him as speaker,
Gingrich will be the first Republican to win three successive terms
as speaker since Nicholas Longworth of Ohio, who became speaker in
1925.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, elected to his fourth term, said he expects to
be given another two-year stint as chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which raises money and recruits
candidates for House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, 56, assumed a particularly high profile in the closing
days of the campaign after his committee began airing TV ads that
raised President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He overwhelmed Democrat Vince Littman, a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder did not play a leading role in any legislation in
the 105th Congress _ devoting his energy to the campaign committee
_ he has a seat on the powerful Rules Committee, which controls
what reaches the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said the prescription for Republican success in the next
Congress is simple: ``We have to go back to our base and start
talking about tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters gave Rep. Bob Barr an early birthday present Tuesday,
returning him for a third term in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who turns 50 Thursday, defeated insurance agent Jim
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Barr gets more attention than
most junior members of Congress, mainly because he takes strong
stands on controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Barr will return
to the spotlight even before the next Congress begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is expected to meet in the next few
weeks for hearings in its impeachment inquiry on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A vocal critic of Clinton's, Barr can be expected to renew his
call for the president's removal for office and is likely to resist
efforts to impose a punishment on the president that is less severe
than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss and Rep. Charlie Norwood, who represent
Middle and eastern Georgia districts, respectively, had been
expected to be targeted by Democrats, who believed the districts
would be favorable to challengers. But the Democrats failed to
recruit strong candidates in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, who turns 55 next week, breezed to a third term over
business consultant Ron Cain.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, 57, also coasted to a third term, defeating Denise
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss will continue to use his seats on the Agriculture and
National Security committees to protect the important farming and
defense interests in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood became a thorn in Republicans' sides in the past
Congress when he pushed for a stronger managed care reform bill
than Gingrich and his lieutenants wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He is promising more of the same in the 106th Congress,
including a push to lift the ban on most lawsuits against insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going to barrel forward exactly as we did last year with
a greater push,'' said John Stone, Norwood's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of the startling change in Georgia politics is that
three Republicans, Jack Kingston of Savannah, Mac Collins of
Hampton and Nathan Deal of Clermont, were unopposed Tuesday for
their fourth terms.
</P>
<P>
   It was not that long ago that Republicans had trouble recruiting
challengers to Democratic incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston, 43, will retain his key seat on the House
Appropriations Committee, which decides how to spend the nearly $2
trillion federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 54, will remain a member of the House Ways and Means
Committee, where he has pushed tax breaks for business.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-writing committee is expected to play an important role
in Gingrich's drive to get a hefty tax cut through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, 56, who became a Republican in 1995, is the least likely
of the Georgians to grab headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But he has quietly built a reputation as an effective
congressman who is responsive to constituents.

<P>
   Democrats roared back in the midterm elections Tuesday, winning
impressive victories in crucial Senate and gubernatorial races
around the country despite months of dire predictions by
Republicans and Democrats that President Clinton's scandal would
drag down his party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans maintained control of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, the Democrats' strong showing, in an off-year
election when the party in the White House typically loses seats,
made it far less likely that the Congress would move ahead
aggressively with its impeachment inquiry of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not come close to the goals publicly stated by
party leaders to win a magic 60 Senate seats, the number needed to
cut off filibusters by Democrats blocking Republican legislation,
or to substantially widen the party's narrow 11-seat edge in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to transform the campaign into a public
outcry for Clinton's impeachment. But as the returns came in many
party leaders had stopped talking about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, insisted
last night that impeachment had never ignited as an issue. ``If it
was,'' he said, ``we should be winning a lot more seats right
now.'' He added: ``There wasn't really a national theme. It
depended on issues at the local level, personalities, and what kind
of campaign they ran.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most coveted single prize of the day, Gray Davis, the
lieutenant governor of California, defeated Dan Lungren, the
Republican attorney general, to become the first Democrat elected
governor of the state in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   But since Davis had outpaced Lungren in the polls for months,
Democrats last night were celebrating surprising triumphs in races
that had been viewed as excruciatingly close. Many Democrats were
relieved that Senator Barbara Boxer of California had fought off a
spirited challenge from the state Treasurer, Matt Fong, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest upset of the day was the ouster of Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican, by Congressman Charles
Schumer. In another major upset, John Edwards, a Democratic trial
lawyer, defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The election was also marked by a resurgence of Democrats in the
Deep South, spurred in part by better-than-expected turnout among
black voters. In South Carolina, Jim Hodges, a former Democratic
state representative, ousted Gov. David Beasley, a rising star in
his party who was chairman of the Republican Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman toppled Gov. Fob James Jr.
And in a race to replace Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, a Democrat,
Roy Barnes, a Democratic state legislator, defeated Guy Millner, a
Republican businessman.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats ended up fighting Republicans to a draw in many
parts of the country, the outcome was considered a victory for
Democrats because of the the tendency of the party in power to lose
seats in midterm elections. In addition, Republicans had predicted
throughout the year that they would capitalize on the Clinton
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans did mount some important wins. They
maintained their domination of governorships around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, the younger son of former President George Bush, won
the Florida governorship in his second try for the office, building
something of a political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was re-elected by a
wide margin, solidifying his position as the early favorite among
many in his party for the Republican presidential nomination in
2000. It was the first time in 24 years that a governor of either
party had been re-elected to a consecutive term in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other incumbent Republicans who were re-elected governors of
major states _ some of whom also have Presidential ambitions _ were
George Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were hard-pressed to describe an overarching issue on
which they based their vote. In interviews as they left their
polling stations, many voters cited many issues that moved them to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marked contrast to four years ago, when voters rebelled
against incumbents and handed control of the House to Republicans
for the first time in 40 years. Two years ago, President Clinton
was re-elected and some voters said they were disturbed by what
they viewed as the extremism of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the new
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 34 Senate seats were up for election, as were all 435
seats in the House of Representatives. There were contests for
governor in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   Many races were excruciatingly close. While Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky was a subtext for the entire
election season, voters leaving the polls said they were not
particularly driven by the scandal one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were gleeful about the California outcome, even though
Davis had outpaced Lungren in the polls for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest political trophy in this midterm election in
sheer size and importance in presidential politics in the year
2000,'' Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House adviser, said last
night. ``California has proven to be on the leading edge of where
the country's going politically.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Republican National Committee said his party
was still optimistic. ``The South as a region is trending
Republican,'' said the spokesman, Clifford May. Borrowing a Wall
Street metaphor, he said. ``It's a bull market for us, despite an
occasional correction.''
</P>
<P>
   In other returns, former Gov. Evan Bayh recaptured a Senate seat
from Indiana that had been held by Republicans since his father,
Birch Bayh, was defeated for re-election in 1980. But Republicans
also grabbed a Democratic seat in Ohio. Gov. George Voinovich was
elected to succeed Sen. John Glenn, who was orbiting Earth this
week aboard the shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators who were re-elected included Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland; Bob Graham of Florida; Patrick Leahy of
Vermont; Christopher Dodd of Connecticut; John B. Breaux of
Louisiana, and Byron Dorgan of South Dakota. Republicans who were
re-elected included the party's whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma; Judd
Gregg of New Hampshire; Sam Brownback of Kansas; Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania; Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado; Christopher Bond
of Missouri, and John McCain of Arizona. Sen. Richard Shelby of
Alabama was re-elected in his first race since he switched to the
Republican party in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors who were elected to new terms included Democrats
Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Howard Dean of Vermont. Among
Republican governors, Frank Keating romped to victory in Oklahoma,
as did John Rowland in Connecticut, Bill Graves in Kansas and Don
Sundquist in Tennessee. Mike Huckabee won his first full term in
Arkansas. He had taken office when his predecessor resigned after a
Whitewater conviction. In Maine, Angus King, an Independent, also
won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had been concerned about spotty turnout in both
parties. But in some heavily black precincts turnout among black
voters, who are reliably Democratic, was impressive. In
Representative Elijah Cummings's largely urban Baltimore district,
turnout among black voters was heavier than in past races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went today, folks were lined up,'' said Cummings,
a two-term Democrat. In one inner-city precinct, 187 people had
voted by noon, nearly four times the turnout at midday Tuesday at
the same precinct in 1994, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings attributed the surge to President Clinton's appeal in
the district on Sunday. ``This was the first time African Americans
had the opportunity to do something in support of the president,''
Cummings said. ``People are fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters were largely approving of Clinton, confident about the
economy, resentful of the impending impeachment hearings and
disappointed in Congress's performance, according to a survey of
voters leaving polling places around the country. Voters said the
issues that mattered to them most were education, taxes, Social
Security, jobs and ethical and moral standards, rather than any one
overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lewinsky affair loomed over the entire campaign
season, 6 in 10 voters surveyed said they did not think the
President should be impeached, did not approve of the way Congress
has handled the matter, and did not even want the House to hold
impeachment hearings. Voters were divided on whether, as a lesser
punishment, Congress should censure Clinton.

VOTERS SAY TO GOP: GET BEYOND LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From seacoast to seacoast, across the prairies and mountains,
American voters expressed their general satisfaction with the
economy, their leadership, and the division of power in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But within that verdict came a subtle but sobering message for
Republican Congressional leaders: An electorate inclined to retain
the status quo in the Congress apparently also prefers the status
quo in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And though the final changes in the composition of the House and
Senate may prove unremarkable, the message from the voters was
almost unmistakable. Casting ballots in nearly 500 separate,
idiosyncratic, and locally oriented political races, they made
little change in the political lineup and, by doing so, they urged
the politicians they elected Tuesday to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In any other year, that would mean almost nothing. This year it
means almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee less than two weeks from
beginning formal impeachment hearings against President Clinton,
the voters failed to give the Republicans a boost in the Congress
that would stand as an endorsement of their drive toward
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as they maintained the Republicans in power in the
House, the voters may have substantially reduced the party's clout.
</P>
<P>
   The voters gave the Republicans their third consecutive majority
on Capitol Hill, but they denied the GOP leadership any signal that
the public wants the Congress to exercise the most forbidding power
the Founders provided the legislative branch: the ability to change
the leadership of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has been assailed, ridiculed, investigated,
and brought to the edge of impeachment, the public has struggled to
have its viewpoint pierce the Washington din. Tuesday, it spoke in
the only way that politicians cannot avoid, producing relief in the
White House and consternation in the Republican congressional
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interviews with voters leaving polling places produced a
classic midterm muddle and no patterns but one: Though the public
believes that President Clinton's ability to lead has been impaired
by the White House sex scandal, it still supports the president and
it still opposes his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By voting to leave Washington basically unchanged, the voters
also are raising the prospect of two more years of bitter struggle
between Capitol Hill and the White House on areas outside of
impeachment, including important questions of taxation and spending
at a time when the budget is in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' preference _ perhaps even its passion _ for the way
things are produced the ultimate political conundrum for the
Republicans who control both the Congress and, ultimately, the
destiny of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The voters delivered almost every incumbent another term and
another chance to do just what the voters don't want them to do:
Impeach the president and bring him to trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this century, the party holding the White House has
lost an average of 38 seats in the sixth year of an administration.
By that measure, the GOP's performance Tuesday was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the path toward removing the president from office
seems more littered with obstacles this morning than it was
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Republicans had expressed their hopes of
reaching 60 seats in the Senate, enough to end a Democratic
filibuster, enough to put the GOP within reach of the 67 votes
required to convict the president in a Senate trial and force him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters denied that to Republicans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they handed the GOP leadership the biggest strategic
challenge faced on Capitol Hill since Democrats wrestled with the
implications of opposing the war being conducted by Lyndon Johnson,
a popularly elected president of their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans face an important calculation: Do they press
forward with an unpopular attack against a popular president? Do
they search for a middle-ground solution, such as a congressional
censure or reprimand? Do they risk the opportunity to press for GOP
priorities such as a tax cut or further restrictions on abortion by
pressing forward with impeachment anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In polling stations around the country, the voters did more than
simply signal that the Republicans were off course; they also
signaled that the Washington establishment and the media were off
course.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-January, the investigation of the president's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky has dominated the discussion
in Washington and the coverage of the capital. More than half the
voters, according to surveys taken by the Voter News Service, said
that the Clinton scandal was not a factor in their votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is a factor in Washington, despite his troubles,
despite the Democrats' minority status on Capitol Hill, despite the
fact that he soon will be in his seventh year in office, when power
almost always seeps away from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results may have been muddled, but the message to the
president, who was not on the ballot, and to members of Congress,
who were, is clear. Carry on. And get beyond the Lewinsky scandal.

 UNDATED: censure Clinton. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation into the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton has been buoyed by a high job approval
rating, and voters Tuesday said they liked the way he was running
the country. More than half said they approved of the job he was
doing, even though most had a negative view of his personal
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute television blitz by the Republican Party
to remind Americans of Clinton's conduct during the inquiry, 6 in
10 voters surveyed said they disapproved of the way Republicans in
Congress had handled the matter. More than half also said that
Republicans in Congress had not done a particularly good job in the
last session, and those voters tended to support Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews with voters also help explain why Clinton and
other prominent Democrats invoked Speaker Newt Gingrich in their
drives to move people to the polls. More than half the voters said
they did not have a favorable view of Gingrich; those people voted
largely for the Democratic House candidate in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp contrast to the midterm elections four years ago,
voters said overwhelmingly Tuesday that the nation's economy was
strong and they fully expected it to stay that way. People also
registered contentment with their own lives. Most voters said their
family's finances had either improved in the last two years, or at
least not deteriorated. As a result, most voters said the country
was on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts described the elections as a competition
between the most extreme wings of both parties _ the loyal
partisans who are always most likely to vote _ half the voters
Tuesday described themselves as moderates. The survey of voters
also found a gender gap of about seven percentage points, roughly
what it was in the 1994 elections; men voted more heavily for
Republicans while women favored Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invited a
small group of friends to the White House to watch television
coverage of the returns. While his political director, Craig Smith,
checked returns on a computer in the office of John Podesta, his
chief of staff, the president quickly called three Democrats to
congratulate them on their re-election, Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina, Dodd and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader. Clinton also called Evan Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never remember a time when we had probably eight Senate
seats within a few points one way or the other,'' Clinton told
reporters earlier in the day, ``and it appears to me almost three
dozen House seats within a few points one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The president shrugged off a question about whether the election
was a referendum on his fate. ``I think this election is a
referendum on all the hopes of the American people for the future,
and their assessment of the present condition, and how we get from
here to a better tomorrow,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was re-elected Tuesday, and his
brother, Jeb Bush, was elected governor of Florida, meaning that
brothers will be serving simultaneously as governor for only the
second time.
</P>
<P>
   In the race with the highest stakes, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, defeated state Attorney General Dan Lungren to win the
governorship of California, the largest state. But Republicans will
still be governor of the next eight most populous states.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, Democrats reversed a decades-long trend toward
Republican control of governorships, ousting Republican governors
in South Carolina and Alabama and retaining a hotly contested seat
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush's victory in Florida over Lt. Gov. Kenneth H. MacKay
Jr. was a gain for Republicans in the region. Gov. Lawton Chiles, a
Democrat, is retiring. In Texas, George W. Bush won easily over
Gary Mauro, the state land commissioner; his victory could pave the
way for a run for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 36 governorships were at stake, 24 now held by
Republicans, 11 by Democrats and one by an independent, Angus King
of Maine, who was handily re-elected. Nationwide, going into the
election, 32 governors were Republicans and 17 were Democrats _ the
largest spread Republicans have enjoyed in the state capitals since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections were especially important because the
nation's governors will preside over the redistricting of state
legislatures and congressional seats that will occur after the 2000
Census.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, one of the most conservative and normally
most Republican states in the country, Jim Hodges, a Democrat and a
former state legislator, defeated the Republican governor, David
Beasley. In Alabama, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat, beat Gov.
Fob James, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, gambling was an issue. Hodges favored the
legalization of video poker in South Carolina, and Siegelman
advocated a lottery in Alabama to raise money for education.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Roy Barnes, a state representative, held the seat
being vacated by the Democratic governor, Zell Miller. Barnes
defeated Guy W. Millner, a Republican businessman who was making
his second straight run for the office.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also won a close race in Maryland, where Gov. Parris
N. Glendening was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors were re-elected in New York, Connecticut,
Arkansas, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were re-elected in New Hampshire and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, seats changed hands in Iowa and Nebraska, where
governors are retiring. In Iowa, state Sen. Tom Vilsack, a
Democrat, was elected to replace the Republican governor, Terry
Branstad. In Nebraska, Mayor Mike Johanns of Lincoln, a Republican,
was elected to replace Gov. Ben Nelson, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were elected in Ohio, Idaho and New Mexico. The new
governor of Ohio is Bob Taft, the son and grandson of senators,
while Idaho's new governor is Sen. Dirk Kempthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The race was tight in Minnesota, where the Democratic attorney
general, Hubert H. Humphrey III, son of the former vice president,
was in a three-way contest with St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, a
Republican, and Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler who
ran as an independent. Another close race was in Massachusetts,
where Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci, a Republican, was challenged
by Attorney General Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The only time that brothers have been governors at the same
time, the National Governors Association said, was from 1967 to
1971, when Nelson A. Rockefeller was governor of New York and his
brother Winthrop was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when George W. Bush was first elected, Jeb Bush
lost to Gov. Chiles. In Miami Tuesday night, to the wild cheering
of hundreds of supporters in a hotel ballroom, former President
George Bush and his wife, Barbara, both beaming with pride, came on
stage to introduce their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I introduce to you the next governor of Florida, Jeb
Bush,'' was all the former president said. His son thanked, in
order, God, his family, his supporters and ``the best parents in
the world.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton years have been political disasters for Democrats in
the state capitals.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton took office in January 1993, Democrats held the
governorships of 30 states. Republicans held 18, and two governors
were independents. But in 1993, Democratic governors were ousted in
New Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven more governorships were taken over in the 1994 Republican
sweep. And Republicans picked up three more in 1996, including the
governorship of Arkansas, where Jim Guy Tucker, a Democrat,
resigned after he was indicted and was replaced by a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, going into this year's election, Republicans
were governors of eight of the nine most populous states in the
country, the ninth being Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout has been especially striking in the Rocky
Mountains and the Great Plains. Fifteen years ago, only two states
in this 14-state region, North and South Dakota, had Republican
governors. Now, 11 of the governors in the region are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 governor's races on the ballot Tuesday, 25 involved
incumbents: 17 Republicans, seven Democrats and King of Maine. Of
the 11 governors who are retiring, mostly because their states have
two-term limits, six are Republicans and five are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, the main effect of Tuesday's elections for
governor may be felt in the states that are likely to gain and lose
congressional seats as a result of the 2000 Census. The gainers are
expected to include California, Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Colorado
and Florida. States that may lose seats include Connecticut,
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The issues in this year's races for governor were mostly similar
to those in congressional contests. Republicans advocated lower
taxes and smaller government. Democrats stressed the need for
better health and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   But local issues also cropped up. In South Carolina, the
candidates battled over whether to legalize gambling in the form of
video poker. In Alabama, there was a fight over whether to create a
state lottery to raise money for education.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, the main issue was a statewide recession, a result
largely of the sagging economies in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. In
Maryland, by contrast, the economy is strong, and the campaign
debate turned to other matters like the state's financing of two
new football stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, the candidates for governor scrapped over the
legal fees due lawyers who represented the state in the suit it
settled with the major tobacco companies. Laws against hate crimes
and concealed weapons have been big issues in the New Mexico race.

EARLY COUNT SHOWS SPITZER VIRTUALLY TIED WITH VACCO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seizing on the gaffes and ethics accusations
surrounding his incumbent opponent, Eliot Spitzer surprised the
state's political professionals Tuesday night by pulling even with
Dennis Vacco in the race for New York state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   With about half the votes in, unofficial returns showed Spitzer
and Vacco tied at 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No poll or political figure in the state predicted such a close
race. It appeared to be at least partially attributable to the
unexpectedly strong vote that gave Charles Schumer a victory in the
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eliot will gleefully ride on those coattails,'' said Steven
Goldstein, Spitzer's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign officials said one of the biggest factors in
Spitzer's showing was a remark in the last week of the campaign in
which Vacco referred to ``banditos'' outside ``bodegas'' in a
discussion of criminals affected by the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, which outraged Hispanic leaders around New York
City, occurred just as voters were beginning to pay attention to a
race that had never been at the top of the news. It did not create
a favorable impression of an incumbent that few voters had come to
know. Spitzer capitalized on the comment, and also stressed Vacco's
opposition to abortion, accusing him of fostering an environment
that led to the recent killing of a Buffalo abortion doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the race, Vacco certainly did a lot to revive
our campaign,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant who served
as an adviser to Spitzer. ``His record on abortion was certainly a
factor, and the bandito gaffe was another major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, 39, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer and former prosecutor
who won the Democratic primary this year after coming in last four
years ago, vigorously assailed Vacco for the same reasons some
newspapers' editorial pages failed to endorse the incumbent:
Vacco's decision to fire more than 100 experienced lawyers on his
staff, who had been hired by his Democratic predecessors, and
replace them with younger, inexperienced lawyers with ties to the
Republican and Conservative parties. Because of the firings, many
of his office's cases were thrown into disarray, and several judges
complained publicly about the competence of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's frequent attempts to remind voters of Vacco's
opposition to abortion were somewhat defused when a lawyer for
several abortion clinics said Vacco's office had actually been
helpful in securing court decisions that set up protective barriers
around the clinics. But Spitzer raised the issue at every debate
and at most campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   As he did four years ago, Vacco, 46, sought to make the election
a referendum on crime-fighting, playing on the common misimpression
among voters that New York's attorney general, like his federal
counterpart, has a major role in criminal law enforcement. In fact,
the state office mostly defends New York state in civil lawsuits
and enforces laws not given to local district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently said at campaign events that his top priority was
to protect citizens from crime, and often pointed to the falling
crime rates around the state as evidence of his success over the
last four years. Most of that drop has been the result of improved
crime-fighting by the New York City Police Department, but Vacco
frequently won cheers by unabashedly jumping on the bandwagon
already occupied by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov.
George Pataki, both of whom strongly supported his re-election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the death penalty not a major issue this year, Vacco began
promoting his work in several noncriminal areas that he played down
the last time, including consumer and environmental law. Late in
his term, for instance, long after other states had already sued
tobacco companies over the costs of treating tobacco-related
illnesses, he abandoned his earlier resistance and joined the
lawsuit, becoming a vocal critic of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But these issues were often drowned out by personal gaffes and
shrill television commercials. After being assailed for weeks on
the source of his campaign finances, Spitzer admitted last month
that he had made a series of misleading statements about how much
of his father's real-estate fortune was paying for his campaign.
The admission seriously tarnished his credibility at a time when he
was trying to seize on Vacco's own ethical issues. But it came only
a day before he was able to criticize Vacco for the ``banditos''
remark, and at a time when the attention of most voters was on the
U.S. Senate race.

IN NEW YORK UPSET, SCHUMER OUSTS INCUMBENT SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a surprisingly strong finish, Rep. Charles
Schumer flashed past Sen. Alfonse D'Amato to give New York two
Democrats in the U.S. Senate for the first time since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In a mud-caked contest where every vote counted, Schumer
harnessed his popularity in New York City and among Jewish voters
to end the colorful 18-year senatorial career of the man whose
service to constituents earned him the nickname ``Senator
Pothole.'' The vote showed Schumer's strength in New York City,
overwhelming D'Amato's popularity among voters upstate and in the
city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m., Schumer entered the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria
Hotel with a host of high-level Democrats, including Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who held Shumer's fist aloft as the crowd
cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Above the strains of the song ``Simply the Best,'' Schumer
shouted, ``I want to thank you, I want to thank you, New York: You
have honored me with your trust. I promise, as hard as I fought for
this election, I'll fight for this state even harder and for the
country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech he directed to the youth of America, he declared,
``You should not confuse the rough-and-tumble of a campaign with
the rewards of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most expensive senatorial campaign _ Schumer's win
cost him an estimated $15 million, and D'Amato spent more than $21
million _ was marked by a barrage of negative advertising on each
side.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, unknown statewide a year ago, campaigned tirelessly in
winning the Democratic nod over early front-runner Geraldine
Ferraro and D'Amato's 1986 opponent, Mark Green. When he pulled
ahead of D'Amato in the polls after the primary, D'Amato fought
back fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists last night said the Schumer win can be
attributed to a better-than-expected voter turnout, especially in
Democratic strongholds. They also cited campaign visits by
President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the
clear differences between the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Amato's career of ethical lapses and voting beyond the
mainstream created a mountain that he couldn't climb over,'' said
Green, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee against D'Amato in 1986.
``This was a referendum on the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the jubilant crowd, Schumer stressed the need
to restore civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a senator to bring unity to our state, and bring
our state together. ... We cannot afford division between race,
religion and sexual ideology,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the packed ballroom, representatives of several of Schumer's
key constituencies _ environmentalists, teachers, Jews and
African-Americans _ toasted the victory, saying the room reflected
the candidate's broad support.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said that over the past
six weeks, party workers placed 3.6 million phone calls, including
2.4 million over the last 48 hours of the race alone. The calls
targeted traditionally low turnout districts known to favor
Democratic candidates. Further, she said, Clinton placed a
conference call to all 62 county Democratic leaders and hundreds of
district leaders to spur their get-out-the-vote activities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats nationwide were casting votes to ``register their
disapproval of a partisan impeachment process,'' Hope said.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schumer joins Moynihan in representing the Empire State, the
first Democratic tandem since Robert Wagner and James Mead paired
in the late '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically and on issues, the shift in the senatorial seat is
startling: Schumer, the candidate of the Liberal and Independence
parties as well as the Democrats, ousted a Right-to-Life and
Conservative candidate who was the darling of the National Rifle
Association. Schumer, a pro-choice advocate, has been a target of
the National Rifle Association for years as perhaps the biggest
gun-control activist in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat authored the Brady Bill, the Assault Weapons Ban
and the 1994 Crime Bill that he says put 100,000 more police
officers on the beat nationally.
</P>
<P>
   New York gets a new senator with a reputation as a legislative
workhorse able to get major bills accepted by both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, 47, pledges to make education, campaign reform and job
creation top priorities. Endorsed by the major teachers unions,
Schumer promised to reduce class size, raise education standards,
attract more teachers by offering college incentives for the field
and making college tuition costs for all tax deductible.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would introduce a plan to spur the economy
upstate by working to create electric power deregulation and to
share tobacco lawsuit settlements with local taxing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet New Yorkers lose a forceful and powerful voice on Capitol
Hill, one able to draw campaign donations not just to himself but
to the war chests of the New York Republican Committee and leaders
such as Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the ouster of D'Amato, 61, after he played a key role in
building up the state Republican Party and mentoring Pataki, is a
major blow to state Republican Chairman William Powers. Powers
listed re-electing D'Amato a top priority and contributed staff and
financial resources to get out the vote and buy advertising for
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's chairmanship of the Senate banking committee and his
seat on the tax-writing Finance Committee, giving him influence on
laws that affect institutions from Wall Street to Main Street, are
lost. Likewise, his ability to take part in cutting up billions of
dollars in transportation and housing funds is gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer maintains that as a freshman senator with strong
ties to the Clinton administration, he can get a great deal done.

 &HT;    Two southern GOP governors defeated
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Two Southern Republican governors backed by
the Religious Right in their states _ Fob James in Alabama and
David Beasley in South Carolina _ lost Tuesday to Democratic
challengers who parlayed campaigns hitched to state lottery
proposals into upset victories.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman launched his Democratic campaign
in the spring and hitched it almost immediately to a proposal for a
Georgia-style lottery to fund college scholarships. With the help
of a defensive_ some say unfocused_campaign by James, Siegelman
surged ahead in early polls _ a lead he never relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   After years of having only Florida as a lottery competitor on
its border, Georgia now faces the prospect of competition from
Alabama and South Carolina, should the new governors prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, Republican incumbent Don Sundquist easily defeated
political gadfly John Jay Hooker, and in Arkansas Republican Gov.
Mike Huckabee, who ascended after the Whitewater conviction of Gov.
Jim Guy Tucker, defeated lawyer Bill Bristow.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman becomes Alabama's first Democratic governor since
George Wallace in 1982. At a crowded Siegelman victory party, the
boisterous audience chanted ``No more Fob! No more Fob! No more
Fob!'' One of James' campaign slogans had been ``More Fob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let this not be an end but a beginning,'' James said in a
short concession speak three hours after the polls closed. ``It's
important the Alabama family come together. ... In closing, I say,
thank you, thank you. God bless you, and God bless Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Siegelman, ``The do-nothing days of the governor's office
are officially over.''
</P>
<P>
   State senator Wendell Mitchell, a Democrat, said, ``It's not a
given that the lottery will pass the Legislature. It's a very
conservative body. But with the decisive victory (by Siegelman)
that will be taken into consideration by the legislative body.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman said his victory sends a loud and clear message that
``the people of Alabama demand the right to vote on an education
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democrat Jim Hodges, state House minority
leader, also gloamed on to the lottery issue. Hodges was funded
largely by the video gambling industry, which Beasley angered by
fighting to have video poker shut down in South Carolina. Early in
the campaign, Beasley led in some polls by double-digits. But the
advantage disappeared as Hodges pushed the lottery and connected a
low-rated public education system to Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both races, if the Republicans had found more moderate
candidates, those wouldn't have been close races,'' said Kevin
Geddings, Hodges' campaign spokesman. ``Fob James is more of a
buffoon than David Beasley, but they both still represent the
extremes of their parties. If they had had more moderate candidates
_ like Don Sundquist in Tennessee _ there wouldn't have been a
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist, Huckabee in Arkansas and Jeb Bush in Florida helped
Republican governors in the South save face with easy victories.
James became an icon for Christian conservatives across the nation
by defending a state judge who hung the Ten Commandments over his
bench and was ordered by another judge to remove them. James
threatened to call out the National Guard to protect the wooden
tablets made by Etowah County circuit Judge Roy Moore. At James
headquarters, supporter Mary Jim said, ``I feel like this is an
indictment against the church. The Christians of Alabama should
have come out in full force for a governor who doesn't believe in
gambling.'' A well-financed, well-focused campaign by Siegelman
outspent the Republican incumbent. James, a former Auburn football
star, says he won't seek another elected office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he held out a clear vision of what he was going
to do the next four years,'' said U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions
(R-Ala.). ``The Siegelman campaign ran an intellectual, smart
campaign. Everytime you watched TV or opened a mailbox something
just popped out.''

BALLOT QUESTIONS NATIONWIDE LET VOTERS MAKE THEIR OWN LAW 
</HEADLINE>

 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michigan voters rejected a proposal to allow
physician-assisted suicide. In Alaska and Hawaii, voters considered
the legal status of gay marriages. In New Hampshire, where Democrat
Jeanne Shaheen easily won re-election as governor, voters decided
whether to make the state constitution more ``gender neutral'' by
dropping male pronouns.
</P>
<P>
   From abortion to animal rights to the medical use of marijuana,
voters in many states had a chance to decide directly on public
policy through the use of ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot questions were first legalized 100 years ago this month
in South Dakota. Oregon was the first state to use one, in 1904,
with a question on changing its laws on how parties nominate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ballot initiatives have been used to cap taxes,
write new laws, and overturn laws passed by state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of ballot questions proposed by citizens
this year fell by one-third from 1996, said Dane Waters, president
of the Initiative and Referendum Institute in Washington. This
decrease, Waters said, was largely because legislatures have
toughened the qualification process to protect their law-making
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Both conservative and liberal groups backed significant
initiatives this year. In Washington state, for example, exit polls
showed voters were poised to ban all racial preferences in state
hiring, contracting, and higher education. Voters also were asked
to decide whether to bar late-term abortions. Both measures are
favorites of conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington voters also considered a plan to allow people to
use marijuana for medical purposes, as well as the nation's first
law to raise the minimum wage each year in step with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular ballot questions involved legalizing
marijuana for medical use, which was considered in Alaska, Nevada,
Oregon, and the District of Columbia, as well as in Washington.
Voluntary term-limit questions were decided in Alaska, Colorado,
Idaho, and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters considered a 50-cent increase in the
cigarette tax, to 85 cents a pack, with the proceeds to be spent on
childhood programs.
</P>
<P>
   Californians also voted on what has been called the most
expensive ballot question in US history, a proposal to expand
casino gambling on Indian tribal lands.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, tribes and other groups that want to increase
casino gambling had spent $74.5 million, while opponents had spent
$26 million, said Gina Stassi, spokeswoman for the No on
Proposition 5 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the measure would allow ``unlimited, unregulated,
and untaxed'' gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times endorsed the ballot question, calling it
the best way to settle the question of how to help tribes rise from
poverty while preserving states' rights.

BUSH WINS LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN TEXAS 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush won a landslide victory
Tuesday, becoming the first Texas governor in 25 years to win
re-election to consecutive terms of office and setting the stage
for a presidential bid in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate,
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place,'' Bush
said, with his wife, Laura, and daughter Jenna at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today's election says something more. It says that a
leader who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender
gap, can open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and
new voices,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic challenger Garry Mauro congratulated Bush in a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him elections are partisan, but governing is bipartisan
and I was willing to do anything to help make Texas the proudest
place in the world,'' Mauro told supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly proud of the way he and I conducted our
campaigns. We differed on the issues, but we never got personal,
never,'' Mauro said. ``I'm proud we ran a campaign of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush's devastating defeat of
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro may trigger Republican victories
of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp were in a
neck-and-neck race for lieutenant governor, while Republicans in
early returns were leading in the races for comptroller and for
seats on the state Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals. But
all of those races were still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won races for attorney general, land commissioner,
agriculture commissioner and railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep this year on the heels of the Republican tidal wave
of 1996 would leave Democrats without a single statewide
officeholder by January. The Democrats would be shut out of the
highest levels of state government for the first time since
Reconstruction ended 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent size of Bush's victory likely will enhance his
position as a possible candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000. Bush said he will spend time with his family
over Christmas discussing whether to make such a bid and would give
a first signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Texans during the campaign that I didn't know, and
I'd make up my mind when the election was over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I intend to spend private time thinking about the
commitment and whether or not I want to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President George Bush of
Houston. Bush's brother, Jeb, won election Tuesday as the governor
of Florida.

VOTERS SAY TO GOP: GET BEYOND LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From seacoast to seacoast, across the prairies and mountains,
American voters expressed their general satisfaction with the
economy, their leadership, and the division of power in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But within that verdict came a subtle but sobering message for
Republican Congressional leaders: An electorate inclined to retain
the status quo in the Congress apparently also prefers the status
quo in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And though the final changes in the composition of the House and
Senate may prove unremarkable, the message from the voters was
almost unmistakable. Casting ballots in nearly 500 separate,
idiosyncratic, and locally oriented political races, they made
little change in the political lineup and, by doing so, they urged
the politicians they elected Tuesday to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In any other year, that would mean almost nothing. This year it
means almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee less than two weeks from
beginning formal impeachment hearings against President Clinton,
the voters failed to give the Republicans a boost in the Congress
that would stand as an endorsement of their drive toward
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as they maintained the Republicans in power in the
House, the voters may have substantially reduced the party's clout.
</P>
<P>
   The voters gave the Republicans their third consecutive majority
on Capitol Hill, but they denied the GOP leadership any signal that
the public wants the Congress to exercise the most forbidding power
the Founders provided the legislative branch: the ability to change
the leadership of the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   While the president has been assailed, ridiculed, investigated,
and brought to the edge of impeachment, the public has struggled to
have its viewpoint pierce the Washington din. Tuesday, it spoke in
the only way that politicians cannot avoid, producing relief in the
White House and consternation in the Republican congressional
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, interviews with voters leaving polling places produced a
classic midterm muddle and no patterns but one: Though the public
believes that President Clinton's ability to lead has been impaired
by the White House sex scandal, it still supports the president and
it still opposes his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By voting to leave Washington basically unchanged, the voters
also are raising the prospect of two more years of bitter struggle
between Capitol Hill and the White House on areas outside of
impeachment, including important questions of taxation and spending
at a time when the budget is in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The voters' preference _ perhaps even its passion _ for the way
things are produced the ultimate political conundrum for the
Republicans who control both the Congress and, ultimately, the
destiny of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The voters delivered almost every incumbent another term and
another chance to do just what the voters don't want them to do:
Impeach the president and bring him to trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this century, the party holding the White House has
lost an average of 38 seats in the sixth year of an administration.
By that measure, the GOP's performance Tuesday was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the path toward removing the president from office
seems more littered with obstacles this morning than it was
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Republicans had expressed their hopes of
reaching 60 seats in the Senate, enough to end a Democratic
filibuster, enough to put the GOP within reach of the 67 votes
required to convict the president in a Senate trial and force him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters denied that to Republicans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they handed the GOP leadership the biggest strategic
challenge faced on Capitol Hill since Democrats wrestled with the
implications of opposing the war being conducted by Lyndon Johnson,
a popularly elected president of their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans face an important calculation: Do they press
forward with an unpopular attack against a popular president? Do
they search for a middle-ground solution, such as a congressional
censure or reprimand? Do they risk the opportunity to press for GOP
priorities such as a tax cut or further restrictions on abortion by
pressing forward with impeachment anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In polling stations around the country, the voters did more than
simply signal that the Republicans were off course; they also
signaled that the Washington establishment and the media were off
course.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-January, the investigation of the president's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky has dominated the discussion
in Washington and the coverage of the capital. More than half the
voters, according to surveys taken by the Voter News Service, said
that the Clinton scandal was not a factor in their votes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is a factor in Washington, despite his troubles,
despite the Democrats' minority status on Capitol Hill, despite the
fact that he soon will be in his seventh year in office, when power
almost always seeps away from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results may have been muddled, but the message to the
president, who was not on the ballot, and to members of Congress,
who were, is clear. Carry on. And get beyond the Lewinsky scandal.

SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS FARE WELL; GAINS INCLUDE TWO GOVERNORSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story is now on the New York Times front page;
originally skedded as ELN-ALA-GOV, the story is expanded to discuss
results throughout the South.) 
(JT) 
 By KEVIN SACK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ In a remarkable night for a once dying breed,
Southern Democrats regained governorships in Alabama and South
Carolina, held on to the governorship of Georgia, defeated an
incumbent Republican senator in North Carolina, and kept a Senate
seat in South Carolina, according to partial vote tallies and
surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tuesday's results suggest a new bipartisan balance or
simply a pause in a two-decade trend toward Republicanization
remains to be seen. Several of the Southern races were influenced
by unique factors, including flawed Republican candidates and the
one-time appeal of lotteries proposed by Democratic candidates. But
at least here in Alabama, which had been all but written off as
Republican turf, Democratic strength extended past the race for
governor and into other contests for statewide offices and
judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Republicans won the governor's race in Florida,
where Jeb Bush led throughout the campaign, and the U.S. Senate
race in Georgia, where the incumbent, Paul Coverdell, defeated
cookie entrepreneur Michael Coles by a narrower margin than
anticipated. But in all of the Southern races that had been
considered competitive, Democrats prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman used a lottery proposal as a
silver bullet to shoot down Gov. Fob James Jr. in the governor's
race, becoming the first Democrat in 16 years to win the state's
top job.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Georgia, where the most recent polls had shown
the Republican candidate, Guy Millner, with a slight lead, the
Democratic nominee, Roy Barnes, stormed to victory on the strength
of heavy turnout by black voters. Barnes' success maintained
Georgia's status as the only state that has not elected a
Republican governor since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hit the jackpot in South Carolina. The incumbent
Republican governor, David Beasley, was ousted by Jim Hodges, the
former minority leader of the state House of Representatives, and
Sen. Ernest Hollings fended off an aggressive challenge from
Representative Bob Inglis, a 39-year-old Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Like Siegelman, Hodges centered his campaign on a proposal for a
lottery that would pay for college scholarships, pre-kindergarten
programs and other educational improvements. He was aided by
missteps by Beasley and by a large infusion of cash from the
state's video poker industry, which considered Beasley its mortal
foe.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Carolina, a charismatic trial lawyer and political
novice, John Edwards, unseated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a one-term
Republican. Edwards will become the fifth different occupant of the
North Carolina seat in as many terms. The seat has switched parties
in each of the last four elections.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Alabama, Siegelman's victory seemingly ends Alabama's
status as the only Southern state that has not elected a
``progressive'' governor from either party in the post-civil rights
era, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   It also presumably ends the quirky political career of James, a
former Auburn football star and millionaire barbell manufacturer
who has switched parties twice and served two terms as governor,
first from 1979 to 1982 and then from 1995 to the present. During
his current term, James became a national icon for the Christian
conservative movement because of his fervent support for returning
prayer to the schools and his defiant disdain for federal judges
who have enforced the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   James' tactics, described as buffoonish by some, reminded many
Alabamians, particularly business leaders who are sensitive to the
state's national image, of the populist demagoguery practiced by
former Gov. George Wallace. And on Tuesday, enough of those
normally Republican voters abandoned their partisan loyalties,
either because of dissatisfaction with James or the lure of the
lottery, and joined Democrats in building a majority coalition for
Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman has said he shares James' view that teachers should be
able to lead students in prayer. But he stressed that educational
issues and not social issues will be his priority.
</P>
<P>
   William Stewart, the chairman of the political science
department at the University of Alabama, said that James' defeat
reflects a rejection of the governor's style far more than of his
stands on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Although criticized as exceedingly political, Siegelman, 52, is
as presentable and telegenic as James, 64, is rumpled and
unpolished. A Mobile native, he began his political career as the
student body president at the University of Alabama, earned a law
degree at Georgetown and then studied international law at Oxford.
He has run for statewide office every election cycle since 1978,
and has served as secretary of state, attorney general and
lieutenant governor. His only loss came in a 1990 campaign for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he ran a highly disciplined campaign that rarely
veered from its focus on a proposed state lottery that would raise
an estimated $150 million a year for merit-based college
scholarships, pre-kindergarten programs and classroom computers.
</P>
<P>
   James has pumped money into the state's elementary and secondary
schools, and pledged to infuse more if re-elected. But the lottery
proved to be a dramatic vehicle that allowed a Democratic candidate
to promise vast new spending on education without raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery proposal placed James squarely on the defensive
throughout the campaign, and he trailed in every poll taken during
the last three months. He also depleted his campaign coffers in the
Republican primary, when Winton Blount, a Montgomery businessman,
forced him into a runoff. Siegelman, by contrast, won his primary
with ease and managed to hoard most of the $7 million he raised for
his assault on James. Although Blount supported James
enthusiastically in the general election, many of his supporters
refused to follow and expressed their frustration with James by
voting for Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   The final weeks of the campaign got a bit rough, with James
calling Siegelman ``a liberal, slick politician'' whose ``eyes go
two ways at once.'' Campaigning for James in Birmingham last week,
former Sen. Bob Dole urged voters not to elect ``another Bill
Clinton,'' and an independent group supporting James ran television
advertisements comparing the two Democrats, including their
youthful experimentation with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman, meanwhile, told supporters that voting for ``more
Fob,'' as was suggested by the governor's slogan, would be ``like
asking for more disease or famine.''

 &HT;    Coverdell beats back challenge from Coles
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell cruised to re-election
Tuesday, defeating Democrat Michael Coles and Libertarian Bert
Loftman in a one-sided contest that was largely overshadowed by the
race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell became the first incumbent to retain that Senate seat
since Democrat Herman Talmadge in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell made his victory speech at 10:15 pm after CNN
projected him the winner. He stressed the need to reform the tax
system, upgrade education and gear up the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture also needs Washington's special attention, he added.
Coverdell said his recent campaigning in Georgia underscored to him
how much farmers have been suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cornerstone of our national security is our ability to feed
our people, our troops and our allies,'' Coverdell said in his
speech at the Sheraton Colony Square.
</P>
<P>
   Coles didn't immediately concede and withheld comment until more
complete results were available from metro Atlanta precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9 p.m., when he was trailing by more than 10
percentage points, Coles declared to supporters that he was
confident he would still pull out a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution showed Coverdell
dominating Coles by better than 2-1 among white voters. But Coles
ran neck and neck with Coverdell among women and held a slight edge
among voters under the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who did not identify themselves as religious right
favored Coles, according to exit poll results.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, a former insurance executive, served in the state
Legislature before being appointed by President Bush to head the
Peace Corps. He upset Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During his first term in the Senate, Coverdell emerged as a
behind-the-scenes workhorse for the Republican leadership,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss).
</P>

   Coverdell initially ran a low-key campaign around the slogan
``Coverdell Works.'' As Coles began airing commercials that
attacked his votes on health care and veterans, Coverdell went on
the offensive with charges that Coles planned to cut Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Coles, the founder of The Great American Cookie Co., contributed
nearly $3 million from his own self-made fortune to fund his race
when Democratic contributors shied away. Coles raised about $1
million from contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Coles tried to seize the initiative in the race in July by
inviting President Clinton to a fund-raiser in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But after Clinton was forced to disclose his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, Coles was put on the defensive for accepting the
president's support.
</P>
<P>
   In his television commercials, Coles aired health care horror
stories to emphasize his differences with Coverdell over patients'
rights to sue their HMOs or health insurers. Coles favored
expanding those rights, while Coverdell did not.
</P>
<P>
   Coles also hammered Coverdell for his votes on veterans's
issues, pointing to a crucial procedural vote in July that cleared
the way for cutting $15.5 billion in health care benefits for
veterans with smoking-related illnesses.

   Loftman, who campaigned on the need to abolish the IRS and
replace the federal income tax with a federal sales tax, could not
overcome his lack of name recognition.

 &HT;    Texas lieutenant governor race leaning towards Perry
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The race for lieutenant governor appeared headed
to the wire Tuesday night as Republican Rick Perry carried a narrow
lead over Democrat John Sharp in early ballot counts.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the current agriculture commissioner, was looking to join
fellow Republicans in a sweep of statewide offices. Sharp,
meanwhile, was looking to save his party from a total loss and keep
the powerful lieutenant governor's office in Democratic control.
Votes in the heavily Democratic Travis County were slow to be
counted in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A Perry victory, though, would ease at least one concern for
Gov. George W. Bush, who won an easy re-election bid and is
weighing a race for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would have to at least consider the impact of leaving the
state to a Democrat if Sharp, the current comptroller, were to win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said the result of lieutenant governor's race will be
only a small part of his decision regarding a presidential bid in
2000. He endorsed Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Perry leaned heavily on Bush's popularity, promising to work
with him to improve education, crack down on violent criminals and
cut taxes. The governor and former President Bush appeared in
last-minute television ads for Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said he would work with any governor to accomplish the
same things, but would not be anyone's ``man.'' He netted the
support of retiring Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and the Texas
Farm Bureau political action committee. The last time the PAC
opposed the sitting agriculture commissioner, Perry defeat then
Agriculture Commission Jim Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Sharp's high-dollar race for the lieutenant governor's
job was expected to reach more than $20 million by its end. That
for a job that pays $7,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The former Texas A&AMP;M classmates, both 48, waged a bitter fight
for the state's No. 2 office.They campaigned through the end,
exchanging accusatory ads in the American-Statesman as late as
Monday and Tuesday. Otherwise, both men largely set aside attacks
in the closing days.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaigning, though, Sharp and Perry accused each
other of supporting laws that led to the release of criminals. Each
called the other extremely partisan and lacking in plans for Texas'
future.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp campaigned on plans to pump more state money into the
state's school system. If lawmakers agree with his plan _ similar
to one being pushed by the governor _ schools would get more state
money per child, the level at which wealthy schools are forced to
share their local tax revenues would be raised and teachers would
get a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp also campaigned on a proposal to redirect about half of
the state's lottery income to a college scholarship program for all
Texas students who maintain a 'B' average. Since lottery money goes
to public education, the money taken for the program would have to
be replaced, most likely with additional money expected to be
available for state spending in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Perry campaigned on issues close to those pushed by the
governor, including the end of social promotion in public schools
and property tax cuts. He also said he would support a proposal to
give publicly funded vouchers to students in low-performing schools
so that they could attend other schools, including private or
religious ones. Sharp opposed the idea. As lieutenant governor,
Sharp or Perry will take the reigns of the Senate, though the
31-member body could rewrite some of the office's powers. Sharp or
Perry also will serve as governor when Bush is out of state. That
would happen with regularity if Bush were to take a run for the
presidency. The lieutenant governor also is the head of the
powerful Legislative Budget Board.
</P>
<P>
   Either man will have the difficulty of replacing longtime
Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who has risen to the level of a
living legend. Bullock commanded the comptroller's office for 16
years before being elected twice as lieutenant governor. Though he
chose retirement over a bid for a third term, Bullock, 69, was seen
as a dominating force in keeping the Senate from breaking down into
partisan in-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp was elected comptroller _ the state's chief bean counter _
in 1990 after serving in the state House, state Senate and the
Texas Railroad Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Perry has been agriculture commissioner since 1990. Before that,
he served in the Texas House.

 &HT;    CNN's McCurry shines
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a great night for political couch potatoes,
with TV reporters and analysts hunkering in for a long night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard Bob Morton say we might be here until 3 in the
morning because of that Kentucky race,'' sighed CNN's Judy
Woodruff. ``Nobody likes election night more than I do _ but I hope
you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (Morton was _ CNN called it at 10:57 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   A notable exception to the night's too-close-to-call theme: CNN
called the Indiana Senate election of heavily favored Evan Bayh the
moment polls there closed, leading Jeff Greenfield to quip, ``We
were projecting him the winner in about 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry was the night's most welcome addition, stepping
seamlessly through the political looking glass _ from White House
press secretary to CNN analyst. He was as smooth and likable as he
ever was batting away pesky questioners during the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message tonight (from the White House) is, `We're beating
the spread,' and I think they're doing that,'' McCurry said of
Democratic candidates' showings.
</P>
<P>
   When counterpart Tony Blakely, House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
former press secretary, contradicted a McCurry point, McCurry had
no problem giving Blakely his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Score Blakely the point on that one,'' he smiled, like a rare
thing indeed: a partisan secure enough to admit when he's been
one-upped.

 &HT;    Jeb Bush becomes only 3rd GOP governor in Florida this decade
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a private hotel suite with tears in his eyes, former
President George Bush hugged his second son and congratulated Jeb
Bush for becoming Florida's 42nd governor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush becomes only the third Republican governor in the last 98
years. His overwhelming victory over Democrat Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay
had been predicted by the polls for weeks. More importantly,
Florida became the first state in the South this century where
Republicans control both the legislature and the governor's
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for inclusiveness, not exclusiveness,'' Bush
told cheering supporters at 10:14 p.m. at the ballroom of the
Wyndham Hotel, shortly after receiving a call from MacKay conceding
the race to Bush. ``This is a victory for fresh ideas, for new
ideas to begin the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined on the stage by several black leaders, including
Rep. Willie Logan, the Opa-Loca Democrat who was forced from a
party leadership role in January and then swung to Bush's side.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay was forced to spend valuable time mending fences with
black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando Tuesday, MacKay told the 300 supporters gathered in
the Orlando Marriott ballroom said although the party may have lost
the race, it won pushing education to the front of the agenda. ``I
believe we have won tonight,'' he said in an upbeat, 10-minute
speech. ``I believe the state of Florida has won tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   With 81.3 percent of the state's precincts reporting Tuesday,
Bush had taken 56 percent of the vote to 44 percent for MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will enter the governor's office with a state Cabinet that
remains evenly divided with three Republicans and three Democrats.
Republicans kept control of the state House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not know his parents were coming to Miami. When Bush
arrived at the 18th floor Cypress Suite, at 7:14 p.m. his staff
brought them as a surprise. Bush entered the room, let out loud
sound of surprise as his parents rose and hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they joined Bush on stage in the ballroom. Backstage, the
former president said that the election of Jeb and reelection of
his son George W. as governor of Texas was ``one of the most
exciting moments in my life. This is the great thing that could
happen to Barbara and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, as 14 television cameras peered through the
window watching him, Bush, wearing khaki pants, a blue shirt and
black shoes with a missing tassel, entered the voting booth at
precinct 625 at Gulliver Preparatory Academy and ``voted for
Columba's husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he hopped into a leased campaign mini-van with a
campaign aide and three reporters for to visit Cooper City High
School in Broward County. During the hour-long round trip, Bush
talked about his campaign strategy, the plans for his transition
team and what he will look for in making appointments to top in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   By September, it became clear to Bush that should he win, he
would need to prepare for the rapid succession. So he brought
together a small group of advisers who would have nothing to do
with the campaign but who would ``look at the legal realities of
the transition and help put together some ideas for how to make
this process work smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The question at the Orlando Marriott was never ``will we win,''
but ``how close might we get?''
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., campaign staff was arranging for a concession speech.
Campaign manager Robin Rorapaugh said she hoped that this year's
``kinder, gentler'' Jeb Bush remained true to the image his
campaign built for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that is more than a cosmetic change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando volunteer Judy Douglas, 58, said she didn't have any
illusions about his chances Tuesday, but was disappointed
nonetheless. ``I'm a little frightened that we have a governor
who's got as little experience as he's got. Hopefully, we can keep
him honest, and maybe we can help him out, like Buddy said.''
</P>
<P>
   Rorapaugh said the campaign's strong emphasis on winning back
black voters seemed to have paid off. Exit polls showed the Mackay
had won about 90 percent of the black vote, she said: less than the
93 percent Gov. Lawton Chiles had won four years ago, but far
better than the 80 or 83 percent some experts were predicting just
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, MacKay apparently won only 55 percent of the
elderly vote, compared to the 60 percent Chiles won, Rorapaugh
said. She attributed the declined to the barrage of television,
radio and direct-mail ads Bush sent out accusing MacKay of a poor
record on elderly issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will take the oath of office on Jan. 5., He must have a
budget prepared for the legislature by Jan. 15. Last year's budget
was more than $40 billion. His packaged of proposed legislation,
which will lean heavily toward education issues, must be ready by
the start of the 60-day legislative session on March 2. And on that
day, he must give his first state-of-the-state address.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to do in hurry,'' said former Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez, who held office from 1987 to 1991, during an interview
Monday. ``It's always bigger than you imagine. It's always more
complicated than you expect. He's doing the right thing by getting
started as early as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his pre-transition advisers, Bush declined, saying
only that they were close friends who were not involved in the
campaign. ``It was important to me to keep this out of the politics
of the campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to announce his formal transition team today. He said
he would look throughout the country for ``talented people who are
willing to be creative and try new ideas,'' to be part of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of innovative ideas going on all over the
country and I want to look around and find the very best people who
might want to do some things differently,'' he said. ``We going to
need a mix of people with a lot of Tallahassee experience and
people with a lot of real world experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would not say who he would name as his chief of staff, the
top positioin in his administration, but the likely candidate is
Sally Bradshaw, his campaign manager and closest political
confidant. ``I want her to stay involved,'' Bush said. ``I want her
to serve in some capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinting strongly about several key positions, Bush said he likes
Florida Department of Law Enforcement Director Tim Moore, a
Martinez appointee, ``a lot.'' Moore is an appointee of the
governor and the Cabinet but without governor's support he job
could have been in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he thinks Health Secretary, James Howell, a
Chiles' appointee, is ``doing a good job.'' As for Doug Cook,
director of the Agency for Health Care Administration and another
Chiles' appointee, ``I don't think will be around,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a mix of people who are political and non political,''
said Bush making it clear that working for the campaign does not
guarantee a state job. ``just because someone worked for the
campaign does not mean they can work well in Tallahassee. I've seen
where some governors have made the mistake of making the
administration too political. Tallahassee is a different process
than what politics is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will begin his first day as Governor-elect this morning by
attending Catholic mass at 6:30 with his family. He will then visit
the Liberty City Charter School that he started with civil rights
activist T. Willard Fair. At 2 p.m. he will announce the formation
of his transition team.

 &HT;    Taft sails in Ohio governor's race
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ In the most expensive race for governor in Ohio
history, Republican Bob Taft sailed to victory over Democrat Lee
Fisher Tuesday, becoming the first member of his distinguished
political family to be elected to the state's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   Taft was leading Fisher 50 percent to 44 percent, with 91
percent of the vote counted.
</P>
<P>
   Taft emerged before thunderous applause from hundreds of
supporters at the Columbus Hyatt Regency about 11 p.m. and said,
``What a great day for Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked all those who supported him, including his wife and
daughter, and said, ``Family is the foundation of who we are...and
with their support I know we can make a difference in Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   He credited his running mate, Summit County Prosecutor Maureen
O'Connor, for getting the state Fraternal Order of Police
endorsement, which supporters said was key to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   He also commended Fisher for a hard-fought campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating what he said during the campaign, Taft said he will
focus on funding schools first ``so every child can succeed.'' He
also said he will push to raise graduation standards and, ``we will
pass our patient-protection plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft's spokesman, Brett Buerck, noted jubilantly that 90 years
ago tonight, Taft's great-grandfather was elected president of the
United States for his first term. ``Four generations later, Bob
Taft carries on the tradition of public service,'' Buerck said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Republicans won all the statewide races, he added, ``The
Taft/Voinovich ticket led the way for another GOP sweep.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft is the great-great grandson of a U.S. Attorney General,
great-grandson of a U.S. President, and grandson and son of two
U.S. senators _ one of whom was dubbed ``Mr. Republican.'' But the
56-year- old Cincinnati native will become the first Taft to claim
the title of Ohio governor.
</P>
<P>
   The win was historical in another key respect. Taft, who will
take the seat of Gov. George Voinovich, is the first Republican
elected to succeed a Republican in Ohio since 1904.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Fisher appeared to be gaining ground on Taft in the
polls, but in the end he could not overcome his better known
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks away, in another Columbus Hyatt Regency,
Fisher, 47, of the Shaker Heights suburb of Cleveland, gave his
concession speech about 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain we may feel and you may feel is a lot less than some
of the men and women we were standing up for,'' he said. He said he
won't spend a lot of time thinking about how the campaign could
have been run differently.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his speech a woman stepped up on stage and began
screaming at the crowd about the party's loss. After several
moments of trying to calm her down, Fisher announced that he would
take a five-minute break and his campaign workers removed her from
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said
despite the party's losses Tuesday, ``We're still going to be
fighting the fight for issues that affect working families.''
Leland said he doesn't believe that Democrats were hurt by the
Clinton backlash. He said the Taft and Voinovich races were decided
by the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's defeat put an end to the vicious battle waged over the
airwaves this fall. Both sides ran hard-hitting ads against their
opponents, accusing each other of raising taxes while holding
earlier public offices, taking money from big insurance companies
and lying about each other's records. Their acrimony carried over
in debates in the last two weeks in Toledo, Columbus and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the debates, Taft proved that despite his nerdy,
cautious image he had the stomach for rough-and-tumble politics,
aggressively going after Fisher, particularly for proposing what
Taft called a ``risky tax scheme.'' In the third debate, Fisher did
well, hitting Taft for backing a workers' compensation reform
initiative that Fisher said would hurt workers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped an Ohio Elections Commission ruling that
found Taft aired false ads about Fisher would hold weight with
voters. In fact, the Fisher campaign ran an ad asking voters to
send a message to all politicians, ``If you lie.. You lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that message was sent, it was lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they weren't surprised by the Taft victory. Robert
Adams, a political science professor at Wright State University,
said Taft won for two reasons: ``the economy and his family name.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much better known than Fisher and there weren't any big
issues percolating that got voters excited,'' Adams said. He said
Fisher may have made a big mistake by not talking much about
education in his television ads. ``To me, that was a no-brainer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buerck noted that Taft started out his campaign running ads
about education because that ``there is no issue that people care
about more than improving schools and Bob Taft's election tonight
proves that's what he's been given a mandate to do,'' Buerck said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Taft said he will implement a hiring freeze in
state government while he explores areas where money can be saved
so more can be spent on education. He has also promised to push HMO
reform, give families with college students an income-tax break,
and get tough on juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said voters may have been confused by Fisher's campaign,
which ran ads on everything from Fisher's work in finding mission
children to HMO reform to a proposed tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The two minority candidates, Natural Law Party Zanna Feitler,
47, a transcendental meditation teacher from Shaker Heights, and
John Mitchel, 51, a retired air force officer from Beavercreek, got
2 percent and 3 percent respectively.

 &HT;    Despite allegations, Voinovich takes retiring Glenn's seat from
Ohio
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last-minute allegations of misuse of campaign funds clouded what
should have been the brightest day in the political career of Gov.
George Voinovich, who on Tuesday gave Republicans both U.S. Senate
seats in Ohio for the first time since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also took the other statewide offices that will give
them the majority on the board that redraws the political
boundaries after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of Ohio's vote counted, Voinovich held a
commanding 57 percent to 43 percent lead over Democratic challenger
Mary Boyle to succeed retiring Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   For Voinovich, a Senate seat that is likely be the final stop in
a long political career could be threatened by allegations released
Monday that he played a part in illegally funneling $60,000 in 1994
campaign money through his brother's company to pay a political
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich ignored the complaint Tuesday evening when, surrounded
by his family, he pledged to continue in Washington the work he
started in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I deserved (to win), I hoped the people thought
I deserved it,'' Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, in Cleveland on Tuesday, conceded defeat early in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did well, we feel good,'' Boyle said. ``We got a long way
on little resources, doing more with less.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's campaign complained Tuesday in a letter to the secretary
of state's office at the delay in announcing the allegations
against Voinovich.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bob Taft filed two Ohio Elections Commission
complaints against Voinovich's 1994 campaign last Wednesday but did
not publicly announce them. The allegations did not become widely
known until a Democratic press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle's campaign said the late notice meant Tuesday's election
was being held under a cloud, and asked Taft to not certify the
election until the Boyle campaign can pursue in court whether the
election should be voided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a lawyer or a chief elections officer to
figure out that this information about a candidate for U.S. senator
should have been public information immediately,'' wrote Boyle's
campaign manager Marc Dann.
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State's office said it cannot withhold
certification of an election unless ordered to do so by a court.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Voinovich's grew out of a federal grand
jury and Internal Revenue Service investigation in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich began his political career as an Ohio House member
representing his East Side Cleveland neighborhood of Collinwood.
</P>
<P>
   He was trounced in his first Senate bid in 1988 by incumbent
Howard Metzenbaum, but went on to two terms in the governor's
mansion before last night's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's victory could have some national impact in terms of
strengthening the Republican domination of congress, but will bring
little philosophic change, according to political observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty I don't see a lot of difference between John
Glenn and Voinovich,'' said Charles Funderburk, chairman of Wright
State University's political science department.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich has even pledged to seek Glenn's seat on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, an important position that will determine
the future of military bases such as Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   The big philosophic shift already took place two years ago when
fiscal and social conservative Mike DeWine took the Senate seat
held for two decades by Metzenbaum, Funderburk said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Republicans in the majority in the Senate, Ohio may
now be better served by having a Republican delegation. ``It is
always better to be in the majority,'' Funderburk said.
</P>
<P>
   With its apparent sweep of the statewide administrative offices,
though, Republicans are in a position to keep at least keep their
momentum going here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a reflection of the quality of the job that was
done in the last four years,'' said state GOP chairman Robert
Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the governor's office, state auditor's office and the
secretary of state's office, Republicans are guaranteed to have a
majority of the five seats on the apportionment board, the panel
that will redraw the political boundaries statewide after the 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Political parties always use that process to form districts
favorable to them. Republicans redrew the boundaries in 1990 and
took complete control of the Ohio General Assembly in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Chairman David Leland was hinging his hopes on a
possible effort to change the apportionment process altogether to
take it out of the hands of the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said the power of redrawing the lines will be offset by
term limits, which will force most state legislators out of their
current offices in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be much more competitive out there,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle campaigned for two years leading up to last night in hopes
of keeping the Senate seat left by retiring Sen. Glenn in
Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   In a final frustrating irony for her campaign, Boyle saw her
opponent besmirched by scandal on the last day of the election
after spending months trying to drive home the message that
Voinovich was not as clean as his image.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was announced an election complaint had been filed
against Voinovich for possibly illegally sending $60,000 in 1994
campaign contributions through his brother, Paul's, construction
company to pay a political supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich's campaign treasurer told federal authorities the
governor personally approved the use of the campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty of the misrepresenting campaign spending,
Voinovich faces penalties ranging up to removal from office and
fines up to $10,000, although it was unclear if he could be removed
from his senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, a former state representative and Cuyahoga County
commissioner, spent the campaign offering herself as a more
labor-friendly and compassionate public official than Voinovich.
She said Voinovich's record was bleak on everything from protecting
Ohio's farmland to improving its schools.
</P>
<P>
   But her arguments made little inroads against Voinovich, who won
his second term as governor in 1994 with more than 70 percent of
the vote.

 &HT;    Texas Bush wins in landslide
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a ballot-box decision about as certain as
they get, Texans on Tuesday handed Gov. George W. Bush four more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush must decide if he wants them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush whacked Democrat Garry Mauro by the largest margin in the
20 years since Texas gubernatorial races became two-party events.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide made Bush the first Texas governor elected to
consecutive four-year terms. He topped a GOP ticket that, with
about half the precincts reporting, was within a hair of sweeping
all statewide races. And, for Bush, the win put him on course for a
decision on whether to run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A yes answer would require Bush to get a campaign in place by
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to search my soul and take a good hard
look,'' Bush said last week as he flew from Texarkana to Austin in
the campaign's closing days.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, he said, will be made by a committee of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's me,'' Bush said. ``There are no group therapy sessions on
whether to run or not. It's me. I've got to make up my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, once as dependably Democratic as any state in the nation,
made up its mind on Tuesday to put itself solidly in the GOP
column. Republican John Cornyn was elected attorney general. The
GOP's Rick Perry was in a tight battle with Democrat John Sharp for
lieutenant governor, and Republican Carole Keeton Rylander was in a
close fight with Democrat Paul Hobby for state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP maintained control of the state Senate and, incomplete
returns indicated, the Democrats were en route to maintaining a
House majority.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep of the statewide races would leave one Democrat,
Supreme Court Justice Raul Gonzalez, among the 27 officials elected
statewide. And Gonzalez has announced he will retire later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we Democrats have a heck of a lot of rebuilding to
do,'' Jim Mattox, the party's unsuccessful candidate for attorney
general, told his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big day for Bush's family, as well as his party.
Younger brother Jeb was elected governor of Florida, making the
Bush brothers the first siblings to serve simultaneously as
governors since Nelson Rockefeller of New York and Winthrop
Rockefeller of Arkansas did it 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the best parents in the world, by far,'' Jeb
Bush told cheering supporters, including his mom and dad, in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good going brother,'' George W. Bush said near the start of
his victory speech at the Austin Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   He painted his win as a landmark, as well as a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's election says something more. It says a leader who is
compassionate and conservative can erase the gender gap and open
the door of the Republican Party to new faces and new voices,''
said Bush, who ran well among Democrats and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to addressing supporters, Bush said it's still not time to
think about a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's a night for celebrating a victory. I'll think about
the future in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Job one, Bush has said, is pushing a legislative agenda aimed at
cutting property taxes, ending social promotion, testing a school
voucher program, ending the sales tax on some health-care products
and requiring parental consent for abortions performed on minors.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, underfunded and overwhelmed, had guaranteed victory in
recent days. Tuesday night, he spoke to supporters at the Driskill
Hotel on a night when he did worse than any Democratic
gubernatorial nominee in state history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, what would y'all have done if I'd gotten 40 percent?''
Mauro told them after he was greeted with a thunderous ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush and his family will serve Texas well,'' he said,
adding, ``This was a campaign of issues and ideas, not of
personalities, and I will always be proud of this race that we ran
in 1998. I guess I don't have to tell you that I had very little
money, but I had a blast going door to door with 20,000
volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mauro said he lacked the firepower to make it much of a
battle. His TV ads _ too little, too late _ were lost in a blizzard
of ads for other candidates for other offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you are proving air support for your ground troops and
your passionate ideas they are not going to go very far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results had inescapable presidential overtones. Bush
easily cleared hurdles he set for himself. An exit poll conducted
by Voter News Service showed he captured 47 percent of the Hispanic
vote, up from 24 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking Spanish and advertising heavily in Hispanic
areas, spent about a fourth of his ad budget to tap into the
traditionally Democratic community. He had hoped to get at least 40
percent of that vote.
</P>
<P>
   The exit poll showed he also got about one-third of the
Democratic vote. And he captured every region of the state, every
age group and every income group.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro prevailed among Hispanics (54 percent) and blacks (77
percent). Bush won 21 percent of the black vote, up from 15 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success among Hispanics positions him as some kind of new
Republican, stripped of stereotypes that have hounded other GOPers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party hasn't given them much to vote for.
That's what I'm doing. I'm laying out a positive agenda,'' Bush
told a reporter from Spain in the campaign's closing days.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's exit polling showed voters almost evenly split on
whether Bush should run for president or serve out his four-year
term. But two-thirds said Bush would be a good president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is well-equipped to know what a presidential race
and a presidency means.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knows what the deal is like like I know
what the deal is like,'' said the son of a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you just reach inside your soul and ask the question:
`Is this what I want to do?,' '' he added, noting ``I've never been
a guy who woke up every morning and said, `Gosh, gee, I want to be
president.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand about me,'' Bush said as he flew high
last week, literally and politically, toward Tuesday's clean kill
at the ballot box. ``If I choose not to run for president I won't
think anything less of myself. I'm comfortable with who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he also knows some other things about himself.
Asked if he thought he would make a good president, he said,
unhesitatingly, ``Yes, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also knows that he is riding a coast-to-coast popularity
wave based on name ID and ZIP code. Though he believes he has
proven he is more than ``some kind of fancy-name guy with no
record,'' he knows the current way-too-early presidential poll
numbers are fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some mystique about Texas. I realize that. Sometimes
some of these little witticisms of mine have some truth. I'm from a
big state and I've got a famous mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush margin was, by far, the largest since Texas went
two-party in gubernatorial elections in 1978, when Bill Clements
became the first GOP governor since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush landslide approached those posted back in the one-party
days. Tuesday's win was the most one-sided since Democrat John
Connally picked up 72.8 percent of the votes case in his 1966 race
against Republican T.E. Kennerly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro campaigned headed nowhere, fast, from the day he
announced in Bryan last November. Early polls showed Bush with a
massive lead, as much as 50 points, and Mauro was never in the
race. The challenger struggled to raise about $5 million. Bush
topped $17 million, which checks from every state.

BALLOT QUESTIONS NATIONWIDE LET VOTERS MAKE THEIR OWN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Michigan voters rejected a proposal to allow
physician-assisted suicide. In Alaska and Hawaii, voters considered
the legal status of gay marriages. In New Hampshire, where Democrat
Jeanne Shaheen easily won re-election as governor, voters decided
whether to make the state constitution more ``gender neutral'' by
dropping male pronouns.
</P>
<P>
   From abortion to animal rights to the medical use of marijuana,
voters in many states had a chance to decide directly on public
policy through the use of ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot questions were first legalized 100 years ago this month
in South Dakota. Oregon was the first state to use one, in 1904,
with a question on changing its laws on how parties nominate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ballot initiatives have been used to cap taxes,
write new laws, and overturn laws passed by state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of ballot questions proposed by citizens
this year fell by one-third from 1996, said Dane Waters, president
of the Initiative and Referendum Institute in Washington. This
decrease, Waters said, was largely because legislatures have
toughened the qualification process to protect their law-making
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Both conservative and liberal groups backed significant
initiatives this year. In Washington state, for example, exit polls
showed voters were poised to ban all racial preferences in state
hiring, contracting, and higher education. Voters also were asked
to decide whether to bar late-term abortions. Both measures are
favorites of conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington voters also considered a plan to allow people to
use marijuana for medical purposes, as well as the nation's first
law to raise the minimum wage each year in step with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular ballot questions involved legalizing
marijuana for medical use, which was considered in Alaska, Nevada,
Oregon, and the District of Columbia, as well as in Washington.
Voluntary term-limit questions were decided in Alaska, Colorado,
Idaho, and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters considered a 50-cent increase in the
cigarette tax, to 85 cents a pack, with the proceeds to be spent on
childhood programs.
</P>
<P>
   Californians also voted on what has been called the most
expensive ballot question in US history, a proposal to expand
casino gambling on Indian tribal lands.
</P>

   As of Monday, tribes and other groups that want to increase
casino gambling had spent $74.5 million, while opponents had spent
$26 million, said Gina Stassi, spokeswoman for the No on
Proposition 5 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the measure would allow ``unlimited, unregulated,
and untaxed'' gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times endorsed the ballot question, calling it
the best way to settle the question of how to help tribes rise from
poverty while preserving states' rights.

 &HT;    Shuttle crew captures satellite
 &HT;    (Subbing story; earlier one was yesterday's.)

   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _The successful recovery of a
satellite capped a busy but quiet Tuesday for Discovery's seven
astronauts as they passed the halfway point of their orbital
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists for the Spartan 201 solar observation satellite were
jubilant about the data it collected from two telescopes that
captured hundreds of images of the sun's glowing corona during its
two-day mission free of the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Spartan mission manager Craig Tooley said the satellite ``hit
the ball out of the park'' in terms of its science return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collected more data than we had planned to collect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the bonus was a telecommunications experiment on
the spacecraft. It allowed the scientists to download about 30
percent of Spartan's data and make it available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The data, which was never immediately available on four previous
Spartan missions, drew 10 times the usual number of about 4,000
daily ``hits'' on the Web site, said Dr. Richard Fisher, Spartan
payload scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the data is preserved on tapes that will be removed
from the satellite after Discovery lands Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the satellite, mission specialist Steve Robinson
carefully moved the orbiter's robot arm until it touched the
2,978-pound spacecraft, then closed a grapple firmly on a spike
that juts from the spacecraft's side.
</P>
<P>
   Mission commander Curt Brown had spent much of the day carefully
moving Discovery into position for the retrieval. Pilot Steve
Lindsey and mission specialist Scott Parazynski assisted in the
capture.
</P>
<P>
   While they were wrangling the satellite, John Glenn and rookie
astronaut Pedro Duque were monitoring an experimental process to
form special coatings on microcapsules of anticancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Microencapsulation Electrostatic Processing System is one of
a dozen microgravity experiments Glenn is working on in addition to
studying the effects of space flight on his own 77-year-old body.

DEMOCRATS WIN SOME, BUT REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROL

<P>
   From the South to the West, an electorate that expressed little
concern about President Clinton's sex scandal handed Democrats a
series of key victories in Tuesday's midterm election. But the
Republican Party, while bruised in the South and elsewhere, was
expected to hold its control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who feared losing 10 House seats, headed late into
the night hoping to pick up one or more seats, as some television
networks projected. Not since 1822 has a party controlling the
White House picked up House seats in the sixth year of a
presidency, according to Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even, if pick up a seat or two, this would be a
historic reversal,'' House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said
Tuesday night on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also rolled to victory in several key Senate races,
including an upset in New York where Democratic Representative
Charles Schumer beat Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato. In North
Carolina, Democrat John Edwards ousted Republican Senator Lauch
Faircloth. Those races helped prevent Republicans from picking up a
filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican control of Congress was not likely to change,
according to network projections. Prior to the election,
Republicans controlled the House by a 228-206 and the Senate by
55-45.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the relatively tepid showing by Republicans raised
questions about whether the party will want to move forward
aggressively on the Clinton impeachment hearings. Democrats were
hoping that a strong showing would give them enough power, when
combined with some moderate Republicans, to prevent Clinton's
impeachment and to have more input into the congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said a strong minority vote and a backlash
against the Republican focus on Clinton's sex scandal helped the
Democratic Party pick up hotly contested races for the House,
Senate and governorships. The officials said Tuesday night that the
party spent three times as much money on voter turnout this year
compared to the last two elections, with a special emphasis on
black and Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked turnout like crazy,'' said Olivia Morgan of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's most impressive showing may have been in
the South, where Republicans especially had hoped voters would back
the GOP, partly out of disgust with Clinton's sex scandal. In
addition to the Faircloth and Hollings victories, Democrats also
picked up at least two Southern governorships, in South Carolina
and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not oust Democratic House incumbents in South
Carolina, despite a GOP ad campaign targeted at the state
highlighting the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did win one of the most closely watched Senate
races. In Illinois, Republican Peter Fitzgerald defeated Democratic
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, the only black member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky Senate race, Republican Representative Jim
Bunning was neck and neck with Democratic Representative Scott
Baesler.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the focus on the hotly contested races, the bottom line
was the vast majority of incumbents in both parties were expected
to win most campaigns for reelection and retain control of the
Senate and House.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for five television
networks and the Associated Press raised serious questions about
the GOP decision to spend $10 million last week on ads in 68 key
districts that highlighted Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that only one in 20 voters thought the
president's relationship with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky, was the most important issue. About 60 percent of
those surveyed said they disapproved of the way Congress has
handled the matter. That could hurt House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
who reportedly endorsed the ad campaign and who is up for
reelection as speaker when the newly elected Republican caucus
convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Democrats didn't win simply by running against the
Republican impeachment effort. In Kentucky, Democrat Chris Gorman,
who ran ads critical of the GOP impeachment effort, was defeated by
freshman Republican Representative Anne Northup.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round of campaigning, Democrats concentrated on core
constituencies including minorities, women, and senior citizens,
while Republicans appealed to suburban and rural voters,
particularly conservatives and males.
</P>
<P>
   The election was notable for the success of political family
legacies. Two sons of former President Bush were expected to, and
did, win their elections for governor, George W. Bush in Texas and
Jeb Bush in Florida. That could set up a powerful electoral
combination in advance of George W. Bush's possible presidential
bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, meanwhile, Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of former
Senator Birch Bayh, was projected by the television networks to be
elected senator, picking up a seat now held by Republican Senator
Dan Coats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was widely expected that the election would be
interpreted as a vote for the status quo, with only slight shifts
in the makeup of the Senate, House, and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans entered Election Day with a huge financial
advantage, with the three GOP national committees having raised 73
percent more money than their Democratic counterparts between Jan.
1, 1997, and Oct. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Maine's Colby
College, said the election will be remembered for the way so much
money was poured into a relatively small number of races, with
incumbents getting most of the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In over half of the congressional races, we had challengers
outspent by incumbents by margins of at least 10 to one,'' Corrado
said. ``So essentially they didn't have the minimal amounts needed
to run a viable campaign. We had 30 to 40 races around the country
that were considered the key races which were the focus of tens of
millions of dollars in spending, both in terms of the money raised
by candidates and the money flooded in by outside interest groups
and the national parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The money factor became the prime issue in the reelection bid of
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, the cosponsor of
a measure to ban unregulated and unlimited contributions of soft
money. As a result, the race between Feingold and Republican
Representative Mark Neumann was viewed as a referendum on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties were closely watching turnout, which analysts
predicted would be between 36 percent to 38 percent. A slightly
higher turnout, and especially one heavy with senior citizens,
would tend to favor the Democrats, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a relatively small number of congressional races were
considered highly competitive. Of the 435 House races, incumbents
were running for reelection in 402, and nearly all were likely to
be reelected, analysts said. Fifty-six Republicans and 39 Democrats
in the House had no opposition except for some third-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the national attention was focused on the races
for Congress, many of the most important and interesting races were
for the governorships, back in the state capitals, where the
day-to-day work of education and welfare reform is actually done.
Of the 36 governorships up for election Tuesday, 24 were held by
Republicans, including most of the nation's largest 10 states,
prompting GOP loyalists to constantly refer to the mantra that 75
percent of the population live in a state with a Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the most important race of the night, Democrats captured the
California governorship for the first time in 16 years, with
Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis defeating state Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, Democratic challengers
defeated incumbent Republican governors in South Carolina and
Alabama. A Democrat also won election in Iowa for the first time in
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, who had presided
over a strong economy but had no effective proposal to counter
Hodges' plan for a state lottery to fund wholesale education
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a state lottery proposal to finance his education reforms,
and defeated incumbent Republican Governor Fob James Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, popular Republican governors won in many of the nation's
largest states, including including the Bush brothers in Texas and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won reelection in Texas by an overwhelming
margin, in a race that could catapult him towards a run for the
White House in the 2000 campaign. In Florida, Jeb Bush, who lost
his first bid for the office four years ago, defeated Democratic
Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Republican incumbents won in Kansas, Michigan,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Arkansas and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly odd race, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a
former professional wrestler running as a Reform Party candidate,
was poised to capture the governorship of Minnesota -- a
particularly notable feat because he was running against Democratic
state Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, the son of
the former vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republican Governor George S. Pataki also coasted
to an easy reelection over Democratic New York City Councilor Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton told reporters that he felt good
about Democratic prospects on the sixth anniversary of his election
as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   While pundits predicted that the election results would
determine the fate of his presidency, the president sounded
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my sixth anniversary, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``They
have been six very good years _ very good years for our country.
Even the bad days are good. It's an honor to serve, and my
gratitude today is immense to the American people for giving me two
chances to do this.''

D'AMATO CONCEDES SENATE RACE TO SCHUMER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Alfonse M. D'Amato, the feisty ``Senator
Pothole'' of the GOP, it is apparently the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn congressman who
spent nearly as much as the three-term Republican in his challenge
and more than matched his tenacity, was projected as the winner
seconds after the polls closed at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. with two-thirds of the ballots counted and Schumer
leading, 54-45, D'Amato phoned his challenger and conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore each came here
twice to campaign for Schumer. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at
Schumer rallies four times, most recently before an enthusiastic
union group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are popular in New York and Schumer, who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee, which could vote on impeachment
later this year, has defended the president in crisis, saying he
should be punished but not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has famously chaired the Senate Banking Committee's
Whitewater hearings, which went nowhere, but not before D'Amato
lambasted the Clintons, especially Hillary, who is particularly
admired here.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an important ethnic group in any New York election, and
D'Amato, who pulled in 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his last
race. Exit polls Tuesday showed his support among Jews was down to
24 percent against Schumer, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, D'Amato made a possibly fatal blunder a few weeks
ago when, speaking to a small group of Jewish supporters, he
referred to Schumer as a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism that
apparently offended many Jews, not so much as an ethnic slight as
for its crudity.
</P>
<P>
   Every preelection poll painted this contest as a statistical
dead heat, with Schumer way ahead in New York City, D'Amato
somewhat ahead upstate, and the two virtually tied in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this equation, D'Amato was thought to have an edge
because, in recent elections, a smaller percentage of residents of
New York City, Schumer's stronghold, have actually turned out to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, exit polls Tuesday suggested a higher-than-usual
turnout in New York City, with the vast majority of the extra
voters pulling the lever for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., more people had voted in the city than had voted all
day in the Democratic primary two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer was expected to attract two-thirds of the city's
voters, the exit polls showed him winning 78-22 in the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   William Lynch, a prominent black Democrat, said turnout was
unusually high in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of Brooklyn,
the Bronx, Harlem, and Washington Heights, where nearly all
residents are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer &UR;  &LR; did well with senior citizens, too, winning 59 percent
of their vote in exit polls. In the exit polls, a quarter of his
supporters cited Social Security and Medicare as the most important
issue. Schumer has played up his support of these programs, while
painting D'Amato as having voted for Representative Newt Gingrich's
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was also able to repel D'Amato's efforts, early in the
campaign last September, to paint him as a ``liberal.'' The
Democrat emphasized his record as a tax-cutter and a crime-fighter.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato picked up momentum when he shifted gears and started
denouncing Schumer for missing votes in the House while he was out
campaigning. He turned this into his main theme the last few weeks,
saying Schumer's absenteeism showed he put his political goals
above his public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In the other major race, Republican Governor George S. Pataki
handily won reelection. With two-thirds of the votes counted, his
opponent, , Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New York City
Council, was trailing 55-31 percent.

DEMOCRATS WIN SOME, BUT REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITETHRU-BOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   From the South to the West, an electorate that expressed little
concern about President Clinton's sex scandal handed Democrats a
series of key victories in Tuesday's midterm election. But the
Republican Party, while bruised in the South and elsewhere, was
expected to hold its control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who feared losing 10 House seats, headed late into
the night hoping to pick up one or more seats, as some television
networks projected. Not since 1822 has a party controlling the
White House picked up House seats in the sixth year of a
presidency, according to Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even, if pick up a seat or two, this would be a
historic reversal,'' House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt said
Tuesday night on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also rolled to victory in several key Senate races,
including an upset in New York where Democratic Representative
Charles Schumer beat Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato. In North
Carolina, Democrat John Edwards ousted Republican Senator Lauch
Faircloth. Those races helped prevent Republicans from picking up a
filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican control of Congress was not likely to change,
according to network projections. Prior to the election,
Republicans controlled the House by a 228-206 and the Senate by
55-45.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the relatively tepid showing by Republicans raised
questions about whether the party will want to move forward
aggressively on the Clinton impeachment hearings. Democrats were
hoping that a strong showing would give them enough power, when
combined with some moderate Republicans, to prevent Clinton's
impeachment and to have more input into the congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said a strong minority vote and a backlash
against the Republican focus on Clinton's sex scandal helped the
Democratic Party pick up hotly contested races for the House,
Senate and governorships. The officials said Tuesday night that the
party spent three times as much money on voter turnout this year
compared to the last two elections, with a special emphasis on
black and Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked turnout like crazy,'' said Olivia Morgan of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's most impressive showing may have been in
the South, where Republicans especially had hoped voters would back
the GOP, partly out of disgust with Clinton's sex scandal. In
addition to the Faircloth and Hollings victories, Democrats also
picked up at least two Southern governorships, in South Carolina
and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not oust Democratic House incumbents in South
Carolina, despite a GOP ad campaign targeted at the state
highlighting the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did win one of the most closely watched Senate
races. In Illinois, Republican Peter Fitzgerald defeated Democratic
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, the only black member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky Senate race, Republican Representative Jim
Bunning was neck and neck with Democratic Representative Scott
Baesler.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the focus on the hotly contested races, the bottom line
was the vast majority of incumbents in both parties were expected
to win most campaigns for reelection and retain control of the
Senate and House.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for five television
networks and the Associated Press raised serious questions about
the GOP decision to spend $10 million last week on ads in 68 key
districts that highlighted Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that only one in 20 voters thought the
president's relationship with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky, was the most important issue. About 60 percent of
those surveyed said they disapproved of the way Congress has
handled the matter. That could hurt House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
who reportedly endorsed the ad campaign and who is up for
reelection as speaker when the newly elected Republican caucus
convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Democrats didn't win simply by running against the
Republican impeachment effort. In Kentucky, Democrat Chris Gorman,
who ran ads critical of the GOP impeachment effort, was defeated by
freshman Republican Representative Anne Northup.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round of campaigning, Democrats concentrated on core
constituencies including minorities, women, and senior citizens,
while Republicans appealed to suburban and rural voters,
particularly conservatives and males.
</P>
<P>
   The election was notable for the success of political family
legacies. Two sons of former President Bush were expected to, and
did, win their elections for governor, George W. Bush in Texas and
Jeb Bush in Florida. That could set up a powerful electoral
combination in advance of George W. Bush's possible presidential
bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, meanwhile, Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of former
Senator Birch Bayh, was projected by the television networks to be
elected senator, picking up a seat now held by Republican Senator
Dan Coats.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was widely expected that the election would be
interpreted as a vote for the status quo, with only slight shifts
in the makeup of the Senate, House, and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans entered Election Day with a huge financial
advantage, with the three GOP national committees having raised 73
percent more money than their Democratic counterparts between Jan.
1, 1997, and Oct. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Maine's Colby
College, said the election will be remembered for the way so much
money was poured into a relatively small number of races, with
incumbents getting most of the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In over half of the congressional races, we had challengers
outspent by incumbents by margins of at least 10 to one,'' Corrado
said. ``So essentially they didn't have the minimal amounts needed
to run a viable campaign. We had 30 to 40 races around the country
that were considered the key races which were the focus of tens of
millions of dollars in spending, both in terms of the money raised
by candidates and the money flooded in by outside interest groups
and the national parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The money factor became the prime issue in the reelection bid of
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, the cosponsor of
a measure to ban unregulated and unlimited contributions of soft
money. As a result, the race between Feingold and Republican
Representative Mark Neumann was viewed as a referendum on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties were closely watching turnout, which analysts
predicted would be between 36 percent to 38 percent. A slightly
higher turnout, and especially one heavy with senior citizens,
would tend to favor the Democrats, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a relatively small number of congressional races were
considered highly competitive. Of the 435 House races, incumbents
were running for reelection in 402, and nearly all were likely to
be reelected, analysts said. Fifty-six Republicans and 39 Democrats
in the House had no opposition except for some third-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the national attention was focused on the races
for Congress, many of the most important and interesting races were
for the governorships, back in the state capitals, where the
day-to-day work of education and welfare reform is actually done.
Of the 36 governorships up for election Tuesday, 24 were held by
Republicans, including most of the nation's largest 10 states,
prompting GOP loyalists to constantly refer to the mantra that 75
percent of the population live in a state with a Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the most important race of the night, Democrats captured the
California governorship for the first time in 16 years, with
Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis defeating state Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, Democratic challengers
defeated incumbent Republican governors in South Carolina and
Alabama. A Democrat also won election in Iowa for the first time in
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, who had presided
over a strong economy but had no effective proposal to counter
Hodges' plan for a state lottery to fund wholesale education
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a state lottery proposal to finance his education reforms,
and defeated incumbent Republican Governor Fob James Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, popular Republican governors won in many of the nation's
largest states, including including the Bush brothers in Texas and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won reelection in Texas by an overwhelming
margin, in a race that could catapult him towards a run for the
White House in the 2000 campaign. In Florida, Jeb Bush, who lost
his first bid for the office four years ago, defeated Democratic
Lt. Governor Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Republican incumbents won in Kansas, Michigan,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Arkansas and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly odd race, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a
former professional wrestler running as a Reform Party candidate,
was poised to capture the governorship of Minnesota -- a
particularly notable feat because he was running against Democratic
state Attorney General Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, the son of
the former vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republican Governor George S. Pataki also coasted
to an easy reelection over Democratic New York City Councilor Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton told reporters that he felt good
about Democratic prospects on the sixth anniversary of his election
as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   While pundits predicted that the election results would
determine the fate of his presidency, the president sounded
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my sixth anniversary, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``They
have been six very good years _ very good years for our country.
Even the bad days are good. It's an honor to serve, and my
gratitude today is immense to the American people for giving me two
chances to do this.''

died fighting World War I. It killed at least 20 million worldwide
and possibly as many as 40 million, more than died in World War II.

D'AMATO CONCEDES SENATE RACE TO SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Edits thruout; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Alfonse M. D'Amato, the feisty ``Senator
Pothole'' of the GOP, it is apparently the end of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat, Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn congressman who
spent nearly as much as the three-term Republican in his challenge
and more than matched his tenacity, was projected as the winner
seconds after the polls closed at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m. with two-thirds of the ballots counted and Schumer
leading, 54-45, D'Amato phoned his challenger and conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore each came here
twice to campaign for Schumer. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at
Schumer rallies four times, most recently before an enthusiastic
union group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are popular in New York and Schumer, who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee, which could vote on impeachment
later this year, has defended the president in crisis, saying he
should be punished but not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has famously chaired the Senate Banking Committee's
Whitewater hearings, which went nowhere, but not before D'Amato
lambasted the Clintons, especially Hillary, who is particularly
admired here.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an important ethnic group in any New York election, and
D'Amato, who pulled in 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his last
race. Exit polls Tuesday showed his support among Jews was down to
24 percent against Schumer, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, D'Amato made a possibly fatal blunder a few weeks
ago when, speaking to a small group of Jewish supporters, he
referred to Schumer as a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism that
apparently offended many Jews, not so much as an ethnic slight as
for its crudity.
</P>
<P>
   Every preelection poll painted this contest as a statistical
dead heat, with Schumer way ahead in New York City, D'Amato
somewhat ahead upstate, and the two virtually tied in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this equation, D'Amato was thought to have an edge
because, in recent elections, a smaller percentage of residents of
New York City, Schumer's stronghold, have actually turned out to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, exit polls Tuesday suggested a higher-than-usual
turnout in New York City, with the vast majority of the extra
voters pulling the lever for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., more people had voted in the city than had voted all
day in the Democratic primary two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer was expected to attract two-thirds of the city's
voters, the exit polls showed him winning 78-22 in the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   William Lynch, a prominent black Democrat, said turnout was
unusually high in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of Brooklyn,
the Bronx, Harlem, and Washington Heights, where nearly all
residents are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer &UR;  &LR; did well with senior citizens, too, winning 59 percent
of their vote in exit polls. In the exit polls, a quarter of his
supporters cited Social Security and Medicare as the most important
issue. Schumer has played up his support of these programs, while
painting D'Amato as having voted for Representative Newt Gingrich's
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was also able to repel D'Amato's efforts, early in the
campaign last September, to paint him as a ``liberal.'' The
Democrat emphasized his record as a tax-cutter and a crime-fighter.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato picked up momentum when he shifted gears and started
denouncing Schumer for missing votes in the House while he was out
campaigning. He turned this into his main theme the last few weeks,
saying Schumer's absenteeism showed he put his political goals
above his public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   In the other major race, Republican Governor George S. Pataki
handily won reelection. With two-thirds of the votes counted, his
opponent, , Peter Vallone, the speaker of the New York City
Council, was trailing 55-31 percent.

MURRAY WINS RE-ELECTION TO SENATE IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., apparently scored a substantial
victory over Republican challenger Linda Smith Tuesday, in a
mid-term election in which Democrats across the nation won
surprising victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press and television networks, using surveys of
voters as they left polling places, projected Murray's re-election
less than two minutes after the polls closed across Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking victory for an incumbent national Republican
leaders had labeled a do-nothing senator and targeted for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 48, a soft-spoken champion of ``bringing people
together,'' was running strongly in Puget Sound population centers
and among women voters in her race against Smith, a feisty
Christian conservative who said she would vote for President
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, who campaigned with Murray across western
Washington, said the senator's re-election indicates voters ``are
not focusing on President Clinton's personal problems, but on the
future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The meanness of the campaign put on by the Republicans turned
a lot of people off,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state Republican chairman Dale Foreman wasn't ready
to concede anything, but did acknowledge that Republicans' airing
of anti-Clinton ads on the weekend before the election was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Murray will return to a Senate in which Republicans had hoped to
build a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority. They will likely keep
control by the same 55-45 margin from the last Congress, or at most
gain one seat.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had much to celebrate, however, defying fears that
President Clinton's travails would lead to losses at the polls.
They were projected to make small gains in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   It would mark the first time since 1934 that a party holding the
White House has made gains in Congress' lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast was scene of several of the Democrats' greatest
victories Tuesday. Murray and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., winners
in a 1992 election dubbed the ``Year of the Woman'' were
re-elected. So was Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Democrat Gray Davis was
elected governor of California, ending 16 years of Republican rule
in the country's largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great night for Democrats across the country,'' said
Locke, watching Davis' victory as well as the easy triumphs of
incumbent Democratic Govs. John Kitzhaber in Oregon and Tony
Knowles in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   But one Democratic victor in the ``Year of the Woman,'' Sen.
Carol Moseley Braun, D-Ill, apparently was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race in Washington revolved around Smith's
in-your-face style and public statements as much as Murray's
record.
</P>
<P>
   A two-term congresswoman from Clark County, Smith was an
outspoken opponent of abortion, a foe of free trade, and sponsor of
the first impeachment resolution introduced against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's dynamism drew thousands of contributors, dubbed
``Linda's army'' by the candidate. But her views were anathema to
liberal Seattle voters, and failed to attract enough support among
moderate suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   In TV ads and a last-minute mailing to women voters, Murray's
campaign sought to depict Smith's views as extreme. The theme
seemed to resonate with urban voters leaving the polls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lewis, 42, who works at the on-line bookseller Amazon.com,
described her reaction to Smith, saying: ``It's kind of like
walking through a cemetery and you know nothing can hurt you, but
you're scared anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters say that particularly in the past year, however,
Murray has build a record of effectiveness in the Senate that
played to her benefit last night.
</P>
<P>
   She was chief sponsor of legislation to pay for hiring 100,000
new teachers in the nation's primary schools, which became
Clinton's bottom-line demand in budget negotiations with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   She prodded the U.S. Department of Energy to agree on a major
acceleration of its cleanup of high-level radioactive waste at the
Hanford Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   And she won key gains for environmentalists in a major
federal-private land exchange in the central Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Taking place against the backdrop of a booming economy, the 1998
election defied the ``six year itch'' of American politics. In its
sixth year of office, the party holding the White House has
historically lost an average of six Senate seats and 46 House
seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, voters mostly favored incumbents of both
parties, who had the additional advantage of outspending their
opponents in America's first $1 billion election.
</P>
<P>
   Members of ``Linda's army'' gathered at the Pearson Air Museum
in Vancouver, Wash. Initially they were unanimous on two points _
belief that their candidate would defy the pollsters and beat
Murray, but also belief that Smith's grassroots populism would
continue even if Murray were to win.
</P>
<P>
   Several Smith volunteers announced themselves ready to go back
to work if she decides to mount a gubernatorial campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be a good possibility, in two years we'll
be looking for a new governor,'' said Gerald Porter, 64, a retired
Army officer and Vancouver native who had known Smith since before
her first election to state office.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tom Mielke said he would look forward to a Smith
gubernatorial campaign. ``Absolutely, I would support that,'' he
said.

VOTE POINTS UP GOP'S PRECARIOUS STATUS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For Massachusetts Democrats, Tuesday night's
heart-breaking loss at the top of the ticket will spur agonized
talk of what might have been, while for Republicans, the razor-thin
win is a reminder of just how precarious is the party's hold on
political viability.
</P>
<P>
   A basic rule of politics is that it's hard to oust an incumbent
in prosperous times. That Democratic nominee Scott Harshbarger came
as close as he did is more attributable to a late-breaking national
Democratic wave than to the attorney general's own strength as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has long been one of the nation's biggest boosters
of Bill Clinton. Tuesday, the voting seemed more like an
anti-Republican rush to the president's defense than a studied
consideration of the two men running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   That's perfectly understandable. For voters grown accustomed to
high-octane intellect and verbally nimble candidates, this was a
match between two political plodders, a let-down substantively and
rhetorically from the last few marquee races.
</P>
<P>
   There was little of the artful thrust and parry of the 1990 race
between Bill Weld and John Silber in 1990 or the superb strategic
contest between Weld and John Kerry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three debates, which deteriorated into raucous shouting
matches, were the most public symbol of the devolution. But the
rest of the campaign wasn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   What Macaulay said of poet John Dryden could be said equally
well of the both Cellucci and Harshbarger: ``His imagination
resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him to run, though
not to soar.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Cellucci, though never airborne, ran faster
throughout. For the first few weeks of the general election
campaign, Harshbarger couldn't even jog without stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   From his first post-primary event, things went awry.
</P>
<P>
   A party breakfast designed to serve up a message of unity
instead highlighted Democratic disarray when both House Speaker
Thomas Finneran and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino expressed
reservations about the man their party had nominated.
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger, who had cruised to an easy primary victory,
seemed unprepared for general-election combat, Cellucci, who had to
stave off a strong intra-party challenge from Treasurer Joseph D.
Malone, was ready to pounce. With a week of Democratic and labor
endorsement, Cellucci underscored the idea of Democratic disarray.
Meanwhile, he quickly tagged Harshbarger as spend-and-taxer,
claiming his campaign proposals were so expensive they would result
in another fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no one-if-by-land, two-if-by-sea
uncertainty about this attack. It was so predictable that even
Harshbarger's brother anticipated it from his distant vantage point
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew it was coming. They should have countered it from
the beginning,'' rued Dohn Harshbarger on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as late as the third and final debate, when Cellucci
put a slight twist on his no-new-tax pledge by exempting the
tobacco tax, the attorney general still hadn't found a convincing
way to reassure voters that he wasn't a crypto-taxer.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also managed to knock his opponent off-balance on two
other issues, blasting his rival for wanting to change the workfare
requirement in the state's new welfare law and, somewhat more
problematically, for a supposed reluctance to crack down on
incompetent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Harshbarger's muddled offense never found focus.
His attempt to make an issue of the state's indebtedness, which he
disingenuously labeled ``the Cellucci debt tax,'' was so abstruse
it took an accountant to follow -- and such a stretch some of
Harshbarger's own supporters disavowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when it came to Cellucci's $700,000 personal debt,
Harshbarger played the reluctant street fighter, willing to
unsheath the knife, but not to wield it himself.
</P>
<P>
   His half-hearted attacks kept Cellucci's finances in the news --
but only at the cost of freezing Harshbarger's efforts to push his
own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of jumped at the low hanging fruit without looking
at the big picture,'' said one Cellucci strategist.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cellucci's argument that his personal debt shouldn't
be an issue seemed to prevail with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Harshbarger come so close?
</P>
<P>
   The late-breaking vote clearly went his way. In no small part
that seemed to reflect an attempt to rebuke national Republicans.
Exit polls show that voters who cast their votes for Congress
because they support Clinton backed Harshbarger over Cellucci 74
percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As US Representative Barney Frank said Tuesday night, voters
clearly wanted to send Congress's Republican leadership a message.
In doing so, they also singed Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's intense efforts also helped buoy Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before last, the labor troops dropped 600,000 pieces
of Harshbarger literature in the state's 20 largest cities. This
past weekend, they distributed 40,000 pieces in Boston alone. And
they were part of the Democratic Party's effort to call 700,000
people in the last 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Both factors helped close a gap that had widened to 10 points by
the weekend, putting a deep scare into the incumbent's camp. In the
end, the Republican renaissance that began in 1990 survived
extinction by only two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a mandate in such a narrow win, for Tuesday
night, Cellucci was not so much victor as survivor.
</P>
<P>
   But either way, the title is now governor -- and however
narrowly, the Massachusetts Republican Party has renewed its lease
on life.

37-YEAR GOP HOLD ON KANSAS' 3RD DISTRICT BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrat Dennis Moore broke a 37-year Republican hold on Kansas'
3rd Congressional District by upsetting incumbent congressman Vince
Snowbarger on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vote with 100 percent of precincts reporting was Moore,
102,299, and Snowbarger, 92,801. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is not about me but about returning representation
to the moderate majority in Johnson County,'' Moore said as results
showed him nearing victory.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also reminisced about a campaign for Congress waged years
ago by his father, Warner Moore, in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad ran for Congress back in 1960 and lost by about 1
percent,'' Moore said. ``So I think Dad would be proud if he could
be here tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the speech, Moore said he was pleasantly
surprised he had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost overwhelmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Kansas between Snowbarger and Moore was billed for
weeks as ``too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger, an Olathe Republican, defeated Moore by 7,109 votes
in voter-rich Johnson County. But Moore stayed close enough to his
rival there to benefit from a landslide in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Moore supporters said they needed to capture at least 45 percent
of the Johnson County vote to win. They got 47.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Moore got 72 percent of the Wyandotte County vote for a
12,000-vote margin, he had enough for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   For years politicians have said that Moore had the best chance
of any Democrat to break the GOP tradition in the district. Tuesday
night, he lived up to that optimistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Moore supporters packed his Tuesday night victory party at the
St. Andrews Golf Club in Overland Park. As results trickled in, the
crowd roared their approval.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away at the Doubletree Hotel, Snowbarger, with his
wife, Carolyn, and their two sons at his side, entered the
Doubletree Hotel ballroom to loud applause. He did not concede the
victory to Moore during a brief speech, but acknowledged, ``We see
trends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is too close to call,'' Snowbarger said. ``I'm not
going to say anything other than thank you to all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said he learned a lesson in how to accept defeat from
his son, Matt, a senior football player at Olathe South High
School. A late-season loss to Olathe North cost South a berth in
the state playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life, there is life after politics,'' Snowbarger told
supporters. ``There ought to be in yours, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger declined to answer reporters' questions after the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Yowell, Snowbarger's campaign manager, said the decision
not to concede came on the advice of the Republican National
Campaign Committee because of the possibility of contesting the
results.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, political experts said that few people were going to
the polls and that the Clinton scandal would demoralize Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was good, Congress was getting high marks and few
people were mad at their elected representative.
</P>
<P>
   That was the common wisdom, and it wasn't lost on either the
Moore or Snowbarger camps.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying likely Republican and Democratic voters and then
trying to get them to vote became a central focus of both
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Esposito, Moore's campaign manager, said the campaign had
a database of 1,000 volunteers and that 25 to 30 worked each day
since August to turn out voters who said they would vote for Moore.
</P>
<P>
   That effort, he said, would cost more than $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson County, Moore focused on about 50 precincts with a
high number of Democrats or people who tended to vote for
Democrats. Wyandotte County, rich with Democratic voters, was a
primary target of the Moore forces.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was simple: Keep Moore close in Republican-dominated
Johnson County and win it in Wyandotte, Douglas and Miami counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowbarger plan also was simple: Keep Republican voters from
straying to the Moore banner. The results Tuesday indicated that
this effort fell far short of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to define Dennis for what he is,'' Snowbarger had
said, ``a Democrat who runs like a Republican at home and votes
like a Democrat in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Moore stressed his credentials as a
``tough but fair'' prosecuting attorney, even though he had been
out of the Johnson County district attorney's job for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans countered with ads suggesting that Moore was
soft on crime because he now is a criminal defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Moore hit hard, especially in the last two weeks of the
campaign, on the Social Security issue. Commercials presented the
message that Snowbarger was a threat to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It was an allegation that Snowbarger had to answer and did in
several commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was one that Esposito said meant the most to
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was the single most important issue in this race,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yowell said the Moore camp used issues such as Social Security
to scare people.
</P>
<P>
   He said seniors were getting calls Monday from someone
suggesting that their January Social Security check might be in
jeopardy if Snowbarger won. Election night, Yowell said a major
effort by organized labor made the difference for Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, they must make voters fear and hate Vince,'' Yowell
had said earlier. ``Dennis followed the DNC (Democratic National
Committee) script from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Polling for both camps showed the race was tight, but in early
October it showed some softness among Democratic voters. That's
when Moore brought out his Social Security attack.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said momentum began building after that decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of Snowbarger's media time was spent responding to
issues raised by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to seize control of the issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps also knew that they would have to raise a lot of
money and did _ about $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Moore raised the most early and was on television first on Sept.
21. About three weeks later, Snowbarger's television started.
</P>
<P>
   Yowell said he was waiting for the public's attention to turn
from the Clinton scandal to local politics. Esposito said
Snowbarger didn't have the money to buy television time any
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University
of Kansas, said Snowbarger made the mistake of not raising enough
money early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also credited Moore with bringing in a professional team from
Washington to manage and direct his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days, Loomis said the momentum seemed to swing to
Moore.

COYOTES STARS SHOW THEY CAN PLAY TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preseason consensus was that Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick
could not survive together on the same line.
</P>
<P>
   Each player needs the puck too much for the match-up to succeed,
so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics are so far eating their words, because Tkachuk
and Roenick, who have reputations of being slow starters, are off
to fast starts.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the two Coyotes stars have played extremely well
together. Their starts, however, are not abnormally fast. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   Roenick has averaged 4.9 goals, 6.7 assists and 11.6 points
after 10 games in his nine full seasons in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   In eight games this year, he leads the team in scoring with four
goals, five assists and nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk has averaged 5.3 goals, 6.2 assists and 11.5 points
after 10 games for his six full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   After eight games, he has five goals, three assists and eight
points, which ties him for second on the team with Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they're both pretty much on a normal pace,
although their production shoots early holes in theories that they
can't play together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing pretty well or you wouldn't be asking the
question,'' Tkachuk said. ``We're winning, and we're clicking as a
line. We have two pretty good lines instead of one, and I think
we're playing pretty darned good together.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Roenick, who underwent a rugged off-season
conditioning program as well as a lifestyle change, if he's pleased
with getting off to such a quick start, he replies: ``It's not good
enough, yet. If we were 8-0 and our power play was up in
efficiency, stuff like that, I'd be a lot more pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually end up going through a period where I get
(expletive) during the year, so I'm just trying to maintain a
certain level and have a clean focus of what I'm trying to do _
keep a strong pace and play well together with Keith so we flourish
together. I'm feeling strong. My hope is the conditioning will pay
off in the middle of the season, when that lull usually occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask a similar question of Tkachuk and he replies, ``I don't
think I'm playing my best yet. There still is a long way to go, and
I have to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attitudes are reflected in their early-season play, which
has escalated greatly in areas away from the puck and the
scoreboard. Tkachuk, for instance, leads the NHL in plus/minus
category with a plus 10 (Roenick is plus 7), and after eight games
he has an amazingly low four penalty minutes (Roenick has six).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is much stronger away from the puck,'' Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said. ``One reason, I think in particular, is that Keith
and Jeremy have a strong conviction to have a strong season and
carry it into postseason, and I don't think they're waiting for the
playoffs to get it going.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, along with the rest of the team, are thinking our best
opportunity is to push our best play to higher limits during the
regular season, and the proof has been in their play. They're
having a strong start and because of it, the team is having a
strong start. Their conviction is a team conviction _ the team is
going to do well this year and they're going to see to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk's start is especially solid considering he placed
himself in a pressure pot with a protracted contract dispute that
kept him out of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of pressure on me from management and fans, but I
put more on myself. Most athletes do,'' Tkachuk said. ``I'm my
worst critic. I don't like to play average. I like to be the best
player every time I step on the ice. I think when you go on the ice
with that attitude and work hard, the game comes a little
easier.'' &QL;

WASHINGTON MEASURE TO END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WINS APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Initiative 200, the anti-affirmative action measure that sharply
divided Washington state voters over how far government should go
to provide opportunities for minorities and women, was easily
approved Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend in early returns holds, Washington will become the
second state in the nation after California to abolish
government-sponsored preference programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will eliminate state and local programs that give
women and minorities ``preferential treatment'' when they compete
for contracts and jobs or apply for admission to a public
university.
</P>
<P>
   It could take several years for state courts to determine how
the measure will be reconciled with the hundreds of affirmative
action programs and policies in place across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there will be plenty of litigation,'' Jim Ferris, a
senior assistant attorney general, said last night.
</P>
<P>
   But once I-200 is enacted, University of Washington and Western
Washington University officials expect to see a marked drop in the
number of blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 4,600 small companies owned by women and minorities
that have benefited from billions of dollars from public
contracting programs will suffer, state officials say. And the
number of minorities and women being hired and promoted in county
and city governments, ports and school districts will decrease,
state officials have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's abolition of the affirmative action programs begun
three decades ago to remedy historic discrimination was seen
Tuesday as a pivotal victory for a burgeoning national movement to
end programs that use give advantages to racial minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of that movement, Ward Connerly, poured about
$750,000 into the I-200 campaign through the two organizations
dedicated to that goal _ the American Civil Rights Institute, and
its political arm, the American Civil Rights Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On hand for a victory celebration last night in Bellevue,
Connerly said he expects to see similar initiatives spring up in
several other states in 2000, including Michigan and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I genuinely think the American people are beginning to rethink
the whole question of race and affirmative action,'' said Connerly,
who led California's Proposition 209 campaign. ``The three main
rationales for affirmative action _ compensation for the
discrimination of the past, current discrimination, and diversity _
aren't acceptable to people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   I-200's passage was a damaging blow to a $1.6 million opposition
campaign led by Democratic Gov. Gary Locke that focused on
convincing white women they had the most to lose if the measure
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest's corporate powerhouses _ including Microsoft,
Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, Starbucks and Costco _ women's groups,
teachers and labor unions, the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Unions
contributed generously to the opposition effort.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently not enough women were moved by predictions that
passage of the initiative would roll back progress they have made
in getting ``equal pay for equal work.''
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the initiative Tuesday blamed deceptive language for the
measure's passage. The carefully worded ballot title did not
mention ``affirmative action,'' but instead asking voters if they
wanted to prohibit the state from discriminating or granting
preferential treatment on the basis of sex, race or national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, we were dealing with deceptive ballot
language which looks at first glance like it promotes equality when
it in fact does the opposite,'' said Sue Tupper, the chief
political consultant for the NO! 200 campaign. ``We really had to
work day and night to clarify what kinds of programs would go away
if this initiative passed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Thurston County judge ruled last spring that I-200's ballot
title and summary accurately reflected the measure's intent.
</P>
<P>
   And John Carlson, the Internet talk show host and chairman of
the I-200 campaign, has insisted throughout the campaign that
voters knew exactly what what they were voting on.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the state's preference programs began in March
of 1997, when state Rep. Scott Smith, a 35-year-old Graham
Republican, and Eyman, a 32-year-old small business owner from
Seattle filed the Washington State Civil Rights Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, united in opposition to programs they said promote
underqualified minorities and women at the expense of whites, were
introduced to each other through Connerly's institute.
</P>
<P>
   Eyman and Smith circulated petitions through the summer, but by
the fall, the two had only 17,000 signatures in hand and little
money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Connerly tapped Carlson, at that time a
provocative KVI-AM radio host, to take over the campaign. The
institute's political action committee helped pay hired
signature-gathers to get the measure on the ballot. By January,
they had collected 280,000 signatures, and the measure qualified
easily for the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled legislature then had the option of
simply making the measure law. But lawmakers instead sent the
measure to people for a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, about $2.8 million has been poured into a divisive
campaign over the measure. The NO! 200 campaign raised $1.6 million
on its own and benefited from a separate $212,000 newspaper
advertising campaign run by Seattle Times Publisher Frank Blethen.
</P>
<P>
   The I-200 campaign raised only about a third as much money as
the opposition campaign, with $484,670 in its coffers on Monday.
But the campaign got a boost from Connerly's institute, which spent
about $500,000 on ``educational ads'' about the initiative's
effect.

INCUMBENTS TIERNEY, DELAHUNT HOLD ON TO HOUSE SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN LAIDLER   AND ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First-term Representatives John F. Tierney, James P.
McGovern, and William D. Delahunt won reelection easily in US House
races late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Somerville Mayor Michael E. Capuano, meanwhile, trounced his
foes in the race to succeed Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II,
who is vacating his seat.
</P>
<P>
   In what emerged as the most closely watched congressional fight
in the state, Tierney, of Salem, defeated former Republican
representative Peter G. Torkildsen of Danvers and Independent
Randal C. Fritz of Manchester-by-the-Sea. &UR;  &LR; Tierney ran strongly
across the district, both in traditional blue-collar cities such as
Peabody and Lynn and in suburbs such as Marblehead, where
Torkildsen had previously run well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of what we've done tonight and throughout this
election,'' a hoarse Tierney said at his celebration gathering in
Salem. Crediting the win to the hard work of his volunteers, he
said, ``I'm proud we ran a clean campaign, with no distortions, no
character assassinations, no lies, no dirt, no negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Torkildsen offered his concession to supporters at the King's
Grant Inn in Danvers at about 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised you two years ago we wouldn't have another recount
tonight. We are not going to have a recount, but not for the
reasons we had hoped,'' said Torkildsen.
</P>
<P>
   After Tierney lost to Torkildsen in 1994, Tierney unseated him
by 371 votes in 1996, requiring a recount.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGovern ran strongly across the district, including
in the cities of Worcester, Fall River, and Attleboro, in defeating
Republican state Senator Matthew J. Amorello of Grafton and
Libertarian George Phillies of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the voters of our district sent a clear and strong
message: Truth matters,'' McGovern told about 500 supporters at the
Holiday Inn ballroom in Worcester, in reference to Republican ads
that attacked his record.
</P>
<P>
   Amorello said Tuesday night, ``We ran a good campaign. It was
our first time running for an office of this size and I think we
did what we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt of Quincy defeated Republican Eric V. Bleicken of
Yarmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano, who won a 10-way Democratic primary, &UR;  &LR; coasted against
Republican Philip Hyde of Somerville and Boston Independents Andrea
Morell and Anthony A. Schinella.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see the numbers we've seen. It looks like an
overwhelming victory, which is nice,'' Capuano said from his
election night party in Charlestown. ``And I'm pleased to be seeing
what I'm seeing across the country. People want to talk about
issues and not pointless investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Massachusetts incumbents facing challenges Tuesday were
reelected by wide margins. &UR;  &LR; . Representative Edward J. Markey, a
Malden Democrat, defeated Lexington Republican Patricia H. Long.
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, defeated
Methuen Democrat David E. Coleman. Representative John W. Olver, an
Amherst Democrat, defeated Leominster Republican Gregory L. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th race was hot from the start because of the established
electoral rivarly between Tierney and Torkildsen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their previous two meetings, however, it was Torkildsen
who took the offensive, assailing Tierney's record over his two
years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Torkildsen at first focused his attacks on Tierney's decision
not to serve on the House National Security Committee, which
Torkildsen claimed left the district without an advocate for
defense dollars. But later he shifted ground, portraying himself as
a champion of such traditionally Democratic issues as education and
saving Social Security, and accusing Tierney of being ineffective
on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Tierney, who made those issues the focus of his term,
countered that Torkildsen had done nothing to address them during
his two terms in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being centered in Washington on congressional business
until late in the campaign, Tierney had a number of advantages in
his favor, including greater finances and a more seasoned
organization than he had two years ago. He also had the strong
support of all but one of the region's six Democratic mayors,
including Peter Torigian of Peabody, who had been neutral the last
two elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Torkildsen, a former state representative and Weld
administration official, has high name recognition in the district.
And in the final days of the campaign, he received active help from
the state and national Republican party, which sent extensive
mailings into the district attacking Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   The 3d District race had stirred interest because of the recent
conflicting electoral currents in the district _ Peter Blute, a
Republican, unseated the Democratic incumbent Joseph Early in 1994,
only to lose to the Democrat McGovern two years later. The district
also drew the national spotlight last summer when President Clinton
visited Worcester at McGovern's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Amorello attacked McGovern for being an out-of-touch liberal on
federal spending, abortion, and other issues. He also tried to
paint McGovern as ineffective in delivering funds for the district.
But McGovern cited accomplishments in his first term, including
leading the fight to restore cuts to home health care programs. And
he accused Amorello of being the extremist in the race, pointing,
for example, to the latter's vote against an assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano was virtually assured victory in the race in the 8th,
which is one of the most heavily Democratic districts in the
country. The five-term Somerville mayor's real battle was fending
off nine other contenders in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In that contest, Capuano bested former Boston mayor Raymond L.
Flynn, former state senator George Bachrach, environmental activist
John O'Connor, and former state representative and talk-show host
Marjorie Clapprood, who were all in close contention. Capuano won
with fewer than 20,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, Hyde, campaigned largely on a proposal to
shorten the work week. The Independent, Schinella, promised to
slash defense spending and end corporate welfare. But the numbers
were stacked against both hopefuls in the district, which has sent
such Democratic luminaries as John F. Kennedy and Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill to Congress.

SENATOR FROM MISSOURI WINS RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, who campaigned as a seasoned
lawmaker who got things done for Missouri, defeated Democrat Jay
Nixon on Tuesday after a bruising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who won surprising support from black voters, captured 53
percent of the vote compared to Nixon's 43 percent with most of the
state's precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled with the results,'' he said. Bond told
reporters in St. Louis that voters clearly preferred his more
upbeat campaign message to Nixon's searing criticism of Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually won votes from people who might not have voted for
me'' if not for Nixon's negative ads, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, the two-term Missouri attorney general, also was hampered
by having to spend months wooing black leaders, usually a key
Democratic base. He had alienated some blacks in recent years with
his aggressive efforts to end Missouri's desegregation lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said late Tuesday that Bond ``ran a tough and aggressive
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we fought the tough fight,'' the Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess his defeat, Nixon said no U.S. senator from
Missouri has been defeated in his lifetime. Nixon lost to
Republican U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers generally considered the match between Bond
and Nixon one of the ugliest Missouri contests in years. It
featured nearly three months of hard-hitting television commercials
and countless nasty exchanges in five debates over crime, tobacco,
taxes and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bond all but called Nixon a liar in several of those debates.
Nixon tried to paint Bond as a politician whose time had passed and
who failed to become a key player on national debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, 59, portrayed himself as quietly effective, in part
because he is chairman of a subcommittee of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, 42, painted Bond as a politician who had run out of
steam. The Democrat said he had the energy to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Three other contenders ran almost invisible campaigns:
Libertarian Tamara Millay of St. Louis, Reform Party nominee James
F. Newport of Blue Springs and U.S. Taxpayers contender Curt
Frazier of Springfield. Millay collected 2 percent of the vote, the
most of any third party contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bond won with the most decisive margin of his three Senate
races. In the past he won by dangerously slim margins, including
his 1992 victory with 51.8 percent of the vote over little-known
Democrat Geri Rothman-Serot.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor enjoyed several advantages throughout this
year's race. He was a two-term incumbent senator in a midterm
election that generally favors the party out of power, in this case
Republicans such as Bond.
</P>
<P>
   He raised upward of $6 million to just over $2 million for
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also benefited from a rift between Nixon and key black
leaders, who alleged that the Democrat tried to score political
points with suburban and rural voters by trying to end school
desegregation lawsuits in Kansas City and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, a lifelong Democrat, all but
publicly endorsed Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon denied that he tried to use the desegregation issue to
advance his career and said the lawsuits had gone on long enough.
He finally garnered support late in the campaign from his critics,
including the Kansas City political club Freedom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls done Tuesday by Voter News Service for The Associated
Press and five national television stations showed Nixon led Bond
55-45 among black voters, well below the margins Nixon needed to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon tried to make up ground by running a campaign that was
either aggressive or dirty, depending on whose backers provided the
description.
</P>
<P>
   One Nixon TV ad showed Bond in a confrontation with a television
reporter at a Colorado ski resort, an effort to portray Bond as
arrogant and out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most serious allegation of the campaign, Nixon
pointed out that Bond had commuted the sentences of hundreds of
prison inmates in his two terms as governor. Nixon said that showed
Bond was soft on crime. Nine of those inmates later committed
crimes that put them on death row, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said that he, like other governors at that time, followed
commutation recommendations of state corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon suggested that Bond voted against federal legislation to
curb teen smoking in exchange for financial support from the
tobacco industry. Bond denied the allegation and said he opposed
the anti-tobacco bill because it raised taxes by $515 billion. Ads
financed by the tobacco industry to help senators like Bond did air
in Missouri in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said it was a disgrace that Nixon hired 36 lawyers to
handle Missouri's anti-tobacco lawsuit and that they could make up
to $429 million for one year's work. Firms where those attorneys
worked had contributed $180,000 to Nixon campaigns, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon countered that the state had to act because Congress
failed to pass an anti-tobacco bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Splitting their tickets with practiced skill, New Yorkers picked
Rep. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, for their new senator while
overwhelmingly endorsing the Republican governor, George Pataki,
for a second term. The great drama of the night, however, was Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato's fall. It seemed to epitomize the surprising
difficulties his party found in holding onto the congressional
majority, and suggest a public verdict on the bare-knuckle style of
Republicanism that has become the fashion in Washington since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato was famous for his ability to shift positions with the
political winds. But he could not undo his own fatal attraction to
big-money special interests, his alliance with the most
conservative elements in his party or his abrasive style. He earned
a place in the book of famous political blunders by calling Schumer
a ``putzhead,'' but that slip merely epitomized a long history of
nasty remarks and vitriol. The voting blocs in which D'Amato lost
ground this year included Jews and Latinos, two groups of voters
that have an unhappy familiarity with the wounding power of slurs.
</P>
<P>
   But blunders and a record of nastiness do not fully explain
D'Amato's loss. Schumer carried the battle to him, matching
D'Amato's spending and also going negative to counter a spurious
but effective attack on his attendance record. What New Yorkers
gained by electing Schumer is a senator who will make his mark with
expertise on key issues rather than with noise, patronage and pork.
On the tactical level, Schumer won more than a Senate seat. He,
too, gets a page in the political record books as a mild-mannered
but lethal slayer of giants.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato began 1998 as the undisputed kingmaker of New York
politics. In the national GOP he was a force too, known as a
hard-headed fixer and deal-maker and one of the most effective
money-raisers in Washington. In New York, D'Amato molded the state
Republicans into an aggressive and very well-heeled fighting
machine. He lifted Pataki from an obscure state Senate seat into
the governor's office, on the hunch that a Democratic and liberal
state like New York could be won over by a moderate Republican with
a conciliatory style.
</P>
<P>
   The huge victory margins won Tuesday night by Pataki and
Connecticut's Republican governor, John Rowland, suggest that
D'Amato foresaw a future he could not join. The senator's own
downfall lay in his inability to remake himself along the same
lines. Both Pataki and Rowland have been cultivating a brand of
Republicanism that combines tight money management with a concern
for the environment and education, a middle-of-the-road position on
abortion rights and a world view that sees the poor and the cities
as a rightful focus of government concern. In Texas and Florida,
George Bush and his brother Jeb won similarly impressive victories
with a similar brand of compassionate, if somewhat more
conservative, Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional results suggest that this style may be a
better bet for the Republican future than the bare-knuckle approach
of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's team. The House Republicans
gambled that they could expand their control in the House and
Senate by calling out their hard-right base and ignoring the more
moderate voters. But instead of empowering the conservative troops,
the Republicans' attempts to capitalize on the issue of President
Clinton's misbehavior with Monica Lewinsky seem to have energized
angry Democrats, particularly the black voters who have always been
among Clinton's most reliable supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The weak Republican showing in House races is likely to shake
Gingrich's grip on the leadership. It may also force a new approach
to the impeachment crisis. The speaker's late-blooming effort to
make the election a referendum on Clinton's future met a chilly
reception from the voters. The day after the election dawns with an
improved chance for a negotiated resolution of the Lewinsky matter
built around what the public seems to want _ an admission by the
president that he lied under oath, a congressional censure and a
shift to other business.
</P>
<P>
   We congratulate Pataki and Rowland, whom we endorsed, and hope
that the lessons of this election persuade them to stay their
present course. That is particularly true for Pataki, who seems to
harbor national ambitions that may tempt him to flirt with the hard
right. We also endorsed Schumer, who promised to work with the
Republicans to produce reform in areas like energy, health care and
gun control. We trust him to support campaign finance reform, as
D'Amato would not, and to continue his support for abortion rights
and limits on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in New York appear to have come out in larger numbers
than expected. Perhaps all that was needed to get them involved was
a race in which the outcome did not seem inevitable. The idea that
American citizens are ready to turn out when needed, and are likely
to vote on broad, basic principles that have nothing to do with
spin is so old-fashioned it seems brand new.

A LITTLE BETTER HERE, THERE  
 HALFWAY THROUGH SEASON, CARDINALS IN PLAYOFF HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  CARD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playoff contenders in the NFL don't get outscored 71-24 in their
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   They don't get blown out, 34-7, against an under-.500 team in
their biggest game in years.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have rushing performances of 45, 49 and 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Cardinals, in the thick of the NFC East title chase,
already have as many victories (four) as last year and more road
wins (two) than all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   They are 4-4, their best record entering the second half of the
season since 1991, despite playing only three games at home. But
what a strange trip it has been.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were ranked last in the league in offense until
Philadelphia was shut out Monday night by Dallas. Only rookie
quarterback Peyton Manning of Indianapolis and three-time Most
Valuable Player Brett Favre of Green Bay have thrown more
interceptions than Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer. Yet no team
has forced their opponents into more turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   After eight games, the Cardinals have a league-high 25
takeaways, five more than they had last season, and as many as
Coach Vince Tobin's team had in his first year (1996).
</P>
<P>
   So if the Cardinals are going to make a playoff run, the defense
will have to carry the team. But as the 28-point loss to the Dallas
Cowboys and the 27-point loss to the New York Giants showed, the
defense can get worn down.
</P>
<P>
   At some point the offense, loaded with skill position talent but
burdened by an overmatched line, is going to have to step up and
win games for the team to remain in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an evaluation of the team at midseason: &QL; 
Quarterback
</P>
<P>
   Plummer doubters are cropping up everywhere. They say he doesn't
have a strong enough arm. They say he doesn't have the brains to
execute the complex West Coast offense. Hogwash. One problem has
been that expectations always were out of whack, fueled by
ridiculous predictions from former San Francisco 49ers Coach Bill
Walsh. Still, any way you cut it, Plummer has struggled. He has
made several bonehead plays and at times has looked bewildered. But
he's also resilient and should have a better second half. He needs
a running game to take off some of the pressure. Grade: C-. &QL; 
Running back
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most improved positions on the team, but the
numbers don't show it. Adrian Murrell had put together three solid
games in a row, including 145 yards against Philadelphia, before
suffering a calf strain that has limited him to one carry the past
two games. Mario Bates could start for many teams. Michael Pittman,
while underused, has shown toughness unexpected in a rookie. Larry
Centers continues to be one of the best pass-catching backs in the
league. Grade: C+. &QL; 
Wide receiver
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the second half of Sunday's victory over the Lions,
the Cardinals tried to stretch the field some and use the talents
of Rob Moore and Frank Sanders. It's ridiculous that they had
combined for only two touchdowns before Sunday. Sure, Moore was
slowed because of a hamstring injury earlier in the season, but
they still could have thrown down the field more. Eric Metcalf,
expected to add excitement and zest, has been a disappointment. He
has 15 catches and no scores, but he also has been underutilized.
Grade: C. &QL; 
Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the sacks are down. The team is on pace to give
up 58 instead of a league-high 78 a year ago, second most in NFL
history. But this remains the weakest part of the team. Too often,
Plummer is running for his life. Too often, there is nowhere to
run. Last Sunday, the Cardinals had third and one and their
short-yardage package in. The line didn't get a surge; Bates was
tackled for a 4-yard loss. Grade: D. &QL; 
Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the team's strength and would have been
dominant from the outset had first-round pick Andre Wadsworth
signed before the eve of the season opener. Then, just when
Wadsworth, Simeon Rice, Eric Swann and Mark Smith were getting used
to playing together, Swann was lost for a month because of
arthroscopic knee surgery. Still, they've combined for 16 sacks.
Rashod Swinger filled in nicely for Swann against the Lions, and
Smith, Rice and Wadsworth stepped up their games. Grade: B+. &QL; 
Linebacker
</P>
<P>
   No one imagined Ronald McKinnon, his first full year playing
middle linebacker, could be this good. He has five interceptions,
unheard for an inside 'backer. Despite playing with a dislocated
wrist, Jamir Miller has established himself as one of the league's
best outside linebackers. Second-year pro Tony McCombs has been a
big surprise after playing little as a rookie. Grade: A-. &QL; 
Defensive back
</P>
<P>
   Each week, All-Pro Aeneas Williams shadows the opponent's best
receiver and shuts down most. Rookie free safety Pat Tillman, the
seventh-round pick from Arizona State, is one of the hardest
hitters on the team but makes mistakes in the passing game. Strong
safety Tommy Bennett is steady but not spectacular. The other
cornerback spot continues to be a problem. Tom Knight, first-round
pick a year ago, hasn't played for four games because of hamstring
problems, and he's testing the organization's patience. J.B. Brown
has had one bad outing in replacing him. Grade: C. &QL; 
Special teams
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf was supposed to bring big-play potential in the return
game. He's not ranked in the top 10 in the NFC in kick or punt
returns, and the Cardinals are ranked 21st in kickoff returns and
29th in punt returns. He needs to have a breakout game and a strong
second half to get re-signed. Joe Nedney showed against the Lions
he has the leg to kick 50-yard field goals and has improved his
accuracy from beyond 45 yards. Punter Scott Player is not going to
make the Pro Bowl as Jeff Feagles did, but he has been an adequate
replacement. Grade: C-. &QL; 
Coaching
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time before fans forgive Tobin for the chaos
at the end of the Oakland game that kept Nedney from trying a
potential game-tying field goal. He also gets ripped for not being
a better motivator. The team wasn't emotionally ready against the
Giants and was outcoached. But he's also an innovative defensive
coach. Along with defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis, he has put
together one of the best, young defenses in the league. The unit
has been more aggressive than in previous years, never having
blitzed as often. Offensively, Marc Trestman had a rocky first
half. Plummer seemed inhibited at times in running a short,
controlled passing game. He can't be bottled up and still be Jake
``The Snake.'' If the second half of the Lions game was any
indication, Trestman is expected to take the shackles off Plummer
and open up things. Grade: C. &QL; 
Overall
</P>
<P>
   A 4-4 record is as average as can be. Grade: C.

INCUMBENTS TIERNEY, DELAHUNT HOLD ON TO HOUSE SEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN LAIDLER   AND ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First-term Representatives John F. Tierney, James P.
McGovern, and William D. Delahunt won reelection easily in US House
races late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Somerville Mayor Michael E. Capuano, meanwhile, trounced his
foes in the race to succeed Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II,
who is vacating his seat.
</P>
<P>
   In what emerged as the most closely watched congressional fight
in the state, Tierney, of Salem, defeated former Republican
representative Peter G. Torkildsen of Danvers and Independent
Randal C. Fritz of Manchester-by-the-Sea. &UR;  &LR; Tierney ran strongly
across the district, both in traditional blue-collar cities such as
Peabody and Lynn and in suburbs such as Marblehead, where
Torkildsen had previously run well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of what we've done tonight and throughout this
election,'' a hoarse Tierney said at his celebration gathering in
Salem. Crediting the win to the hard work of his volunteers, he
said, ``I'm proud we ran a clean campaign, with no distortions, no
character assassinations, no lies, no dirt, no negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Torkildsen offered his concession to supporters at the King's
Grant Inn in Danvers at about 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised you two years ago we wouldn't have another recount
tonight. We are not going to have a recount, but not for the
reasons we had hoped,'' said Torkildsen.
</P>
<P>
   After Tierney lost to Torkildsen in 1994, Tierney unseated him
by 371 votes in 1996, requiring a recount.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGovern ran strongly across the district, including
in the cities of Worcester, Fall River, and Attleboro, in defeating
Republican state Senator Matthew J. Amorello of Grafton and
Libertarian George Phillies of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the voters of our district sent a clear and strong
message: Truth matters,'' McGovern told about 500 supporters at the
Holiday Inn ballroom in Worcester, in reference to Republican ads
that attacked his record.
</P>
<P>
   Amorello said Tuesday night, ``We ran a good campaign. It was
our first time running for an office of this size and I think we
did what we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt of Quincy defeated Republican Eric V. Bleicken of
Yarmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano, who won a 10-way Democratic primary, &UR;  &LR; coasted against
Republican Philip Hyde of Somerville and Boston Independents Andrea
Morell and Anthony A. Schinella.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see the numbers we've seen. It looks like an
overwhelming victory, which is nice,'' Capuano said from his
election night party in Charlestown. ``And I'm pleased to be seeing
what I'm seeing across the country. People want to talk about
issues and not pointless investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Massachusetts incumbents facing challenges Tuesday were
reelected by wide margins. &UR;  &LR; . Representative Edward J. Markey, a
Malden Democrat, defeated Lexington Republican Patricia H. Long.
Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, defeated
Methuen Democrat David E. Coleman. Representative John W. Olver, an
Amherst Democrat, defeated Leominster Republican Gregory L. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th race was hot from the start because of the established
electoral rivarly between Tierney and Torkildsen.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their previous two meetings, however, it was Torkildsen
who took the offensive, assailing Tierney's record over his two
years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Torkildsen at first focused his attacks on Tierney's decision
not to serve on the House National Security Committee, which
Torkildsen claimed left the district without an advocate for
defense dollars. But later he shifted ground, portraying himself as
a champion of such traditionally Democratic issues as education and
saving Social Security, and accusing Tierney of being ineffective
on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Tierney, who made those issues the focus of his term,
countered that Torkildsen had done nothing to address them during
his two terms in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being centered in Washington on congressional business
until late in the campaign, Tierney had a number of advantages in
his favor, including greater finances and a more seasoned
organization than he had two years ago. He also had the strong
support of all but one of the region's six Democratic mayors,
including Peter Torigian of Peabody, who had been neutral the last
two elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Torkildsen, a former state representative and Weld
administration official, has high name recognition in the district.
And in the final days of the campaign, he received active help from
the state and national Republican party, which sent extensive
mailings into the district attacking Tierney.
</P>
<P>
   The 3d District race had stirred interest because of the recent
conflicting electoral currents in the district _ Peter Blute, a
Republican, unseated the Democratic incumbent Joseph Early in 1994,
only to lose to the Democrat McGovern two years later. The district
also drew the national spotlight last summer when President Clinton
visited Worcester at McGovern's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Amorello attacked McGovern for being an out-of-touch liberal on
federal spending, abortion, and other issues. He also tried to
paint McGovern as ineffective in delivering funds for the district.
But McGovern cited accomplishments in his first term, including
leading the fight to restore cuts to home health care programs. And
he accused Amorello of being the extremist in the race, pointing,
for example, to the latter's vote against an assault weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano was virtually assured victory in the race in the 8th,
which is one of the most heavily Democratic districts in the
country. The five-term Somerville mayor's real battle was fending
off nine other contenders in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In that contest, Capuano bested former Boston mayor Raymond L.
Flynn, former state senator George Bachrach, environmental activist
John O'Connor, and former state representative and talk-show host
Marjorie Clapprood, who were all in close contention. Capuano won
with fewer than 20,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican, Hyde, campaigned largely on a proposal to
shorten the work week. The Independent, Schinella, promised to
slash defense spending and end corporate welfare. But the numbers
were stacked against both hopefuls in the district, which has sent
such Democratic luminaries as John F. Kennedy and Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill to Congress.

PATAKI WINS SECOND TERM BY HEFTY MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update.)  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Pataki swept to a second term as governor of
New York Tuesday, defeating his weak and splintered opposition by
one of the largest margins in history, a victory so resounding that
it is certain to raise his national profile.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's triumph capped a remarkable transformation from a
little-known state senator waging an uphill fight for governor in
1994, to a governor who has shifted the state markedly rightward on
crime, welfare and taxes, and has made himself its most popular
political figure. Four years ago, he narrowly defeated Gov. Mario
Cuomo, with considerable help from Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. This year,
it was the senator who, in an ultimately unsuccessful bid for a
fourth term, turned to Pataki for help, and the governor spent more
energy in the final weeks stumping for his onetime patron than for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With 60 percent of the voting precincts reporting, Pataki, a
Republican who was also the candidate of the Conservative Party,
had 55 percent of the vote, to 32 percent for his Democratic
challenger, Peter Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker, who
was also nominated by the newly founded Working Families Party.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Golisano, the Independence Party candidate making his
second run for the office, was a distant third, with 8 percent, and
Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, the Liberal Party nominee, trailed
with 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old split in New York's state Legislature appeared
to hold fast, with Republicans easily retaining control of the
state Senate, and Democrats keeping a strong hold on the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The polls indicated that the Liberal Party had survived the
near-death experience of nominating Ms. McCaughey Ross, then
watching her husband, financier Wilbur Ross, withdraw much of her
financial backing. She appeared to have topped the 50,000 votes a
party needs in a gubernatorial election to maintain an automatic
place on New York ballots for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pataki's triumph, the Republican ticket's Election Night
crowd was remarkably subdued, mindful of D'Amato's defeat. The
governor appeared at 9:50 p.m., less than an hour after the polls
closed, to declare victory before a crowd of supporters at the New
York Hilton Hotel on the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we were going to change this state and put in place
new policies that would free the spirit of the people of New York
from an oppressive government,'' he said. ``Well, it's four years
later, and let me tell you something, this is a better state than
it was four years ago. We have kept our word in making this a safer
state, making this a healthier state, making this a state with more
environmental opportunities for our children and the children of
the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone gave his concession speech at 9:30 p.m., just half an
hour after the polls closed, before a surprisingly upbeat group of
supporters at the New York Marriott East Side hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really not cause for sorrow or complaint,'' Vallone
said, flanked by his family, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and
former Mayor David Dinkins. ``We knew from the start that this was
going to be an uphill race. The odds were long. The campaign
dollars were always a little short. But there was a need to be
filled, an obligation to be met.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign did not present much of a test for Pataki, who
campaigned sparingly, ignored his opponents and refused to debate
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the defeat of D'Amato leaves his former protege, the
governor, as the undisputed leader of the state Republican Party
and clearly the most powerful figure in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, as polls showed him running away with this
race, Pataki and his aides grew so elated that they began to talk
openly about the prospect of his running for national office in
2000. Like the last Republican elected New York's governor, Nelson
Rockefeller, Pataki might be favored by moderate Republicans, but
is widely considered a dark horse, especially with the larger body
of conservative GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this year, as in much of the country, the election
season lacked defining issues or ideological chasms. There was none
of the economic unrest that animates some contests, and local
fights were overshadowed by President Clinton's troubles, though
they did not cut clearly one way or another with voters. In such an
atmosphere, voters were content mostly to return incumbents to
office, even if it meant ignoring party lines and splitting their
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was headed for the third-largest winning margin in
a gubernatorial race in state history, in both percentage terms and
in raw votes, and the largest ever by a Republican. The biggest
margins were set by Cuomo in 1986 and 1990; he won each time by 32
percent, and 1.4 million and 1.3 million votes, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki appeared to have won a higher percentage of the vote than
any Republican candidate for Governor since Thomas E. Dewey was
elected to a second term with 57 percent in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not outpoll Vallone in the city, as some of his
advisers had hoped, but the breadth of his victory was still
remarkable. Pataki led Vallone 2-to-1 in the downstate suburbs, and
more than 3-to-1 upstate. And voter polls showed that one-fourth of
the people who voted for Democratic candidate Charles Schumer for
senator also voted for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The governor carried 58 of the state's 62 counties _ all but
Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said little about what he would do in a second term,
beyond continuing to cut taxes and toughen criminal penalties, but
the magnitude of his victory could allow him to claim a mandate for
whatever his second-term agenda may hold. If the economy slows,
however, Pataki's plans could be overtaken by budget woes,
precisely the opposite of the circumstances that he has enjoyed for
the last four years, as the economic expansion and Wall Street boom
allowed the governor to do what he promised and more,
simultaneously cutting taxes and raising spending.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's victory brings to statewide politics a new face, that
of Mary Donohue, his running mate for lieutenant governor. Ms.
Donohue, a former judge and prosecutor from the Albany area, takes
on a purely ceremonial post, but would become governor if her boss
were elected to national office.
</P>
<P>
   And the election may mark the end of the political career of Ms.
McCaughey Ross, the Republican-turned-Democrat whose brief, odd
sojourn in politics had alienated her from both major parties.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the race's many subplots, Golisano's showing was close
to capturing for the four-year-old Independence Party the third
position on the ballot for the next four years. Positions are
assigned in order of gubernatorial vote, and Golisano was running
close to the number of votes that Pataki garnered on the line of
the Conservative Party, which has been listed third since the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki took office in 1995 determined to cut not only taxes but
also state spending on health care, education, mass transit and
other areas, a quest that won him a legion of enemies and made him
widely unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, he began his political resurrection by forging an
alliance of some of his harshest critics, including labor unions
and environmentalists, in support of his $1.75 billion
environmental bond act. The campaign for the measure was, as much
as anything else, a campaign for Pataki, one that raised his
popularity and softened his image. Voters approved the act.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Pataki was raising spending on popular programs,
and he was widely seen as unassailable. The two men considered his
strongest potential challengers, Schumer and state Comptroller Carl
McCall, decided not to challenge him.
</P>
<P>
   That left Vallone, virtually unknown outside New York City, as
the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination. Not since 1966
had the Democrats nominated someone of so little stature for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic primary campaign, the mercurial Ms.
McCaughey Ross drew much of the attention, and after she finished
second to Vallone, she continued running on the Liberal Party line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Golisano's ever-present advertisements drowned out
Vallone's own meager media campaign. And he and Ms. McCaughey Ross
both threatened to fragment whatever anti-Pataki vote there was.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, those were little more than distractions from
Vallone's deeper problems: The governor was too popular, the voters
were too complacent, Vallone was too uninspired a campaigner, and
he had too little money to prevent a rout. In the most expensive
gubernatorial race in New York state's history _ and one of the
most costly in any state _ Pataki spent $20 million, Golisano may
have matched that total, and Vallone spent just $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has faced speculation all year that his true aim in this
race was to position himself to run for mayor of New York City in
2001, but Tuesday, as he has all along, he declined to discuss that
subject. ``We'll talk about that in the next millennium,'' he said.

VOTE POINTS UP GOP'S PRECARIOUS STATUS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For Massachusetts Democrats, Tuesday night's
heart-breaking loss at the top of the ticket will spur agonized
talk of what might have been, while for Republicans, the razor-thin
win is a reminder of just how precarious is the party's hold on
political viability.
</P>
<P>
   A basic rule of politics is that it's hard to oust an incumbent
in prosperous times. That Democratic nominee Scott Harshbarger came
as close as he did is more attributable to a late-breaking national
Democratic wave than to the attorney general's own strength as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has long been one of the nation's biggest boosters
of Bill Clinton. Tuesday, the voting seemed more like an
anti-Republican rush to the president's defense than a studied
consideration of the two men running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   That's perfectly understandable. For voters grown accustomed to
high-octane intellect and verbally nimble candidates, this was a
match between two political plodders, a let-down substantively and
rhetorically from the last few marquee races.
</P>
<P>
   There was little of the artful thrust and parry of the 1990 race
between Bill Weld and John Silber in 1990 or the superb strategic
contest between Weld and John Kerry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The three debates, which deteriorated into raucous shouting
matches, were the most public symbol of the devolution. But the
rest of the campaign wasn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   What Macaulay said of poet John Dryden could be said equally
well of the both Cellucci and Harshbarger: ``His imagination
resembled the wings of an ostrich. It enabled him to run, though
not to soar.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Cellucci, though never airborne, ran faster
throughout. For the first few weeks of the general election
campaign, Harshbarger couldn't even jog without stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   From his first post-primary event, things went awry.
</P>
<P>
   A party breakfast designed to serve up a message of unity
instead highlighted Democratic disarray when both House Speaker
Thomas Finneran and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino expressed
reservations about the man their party had nominated.
</P>
<P>
   If Harshbarger, who had cruised to an easy primary victory,
seemed unprepared for general-election combat, Cellucci, who had to
stave off a strong intra-party challenge from Treasurer Joseph D.
Malone, was ready to pounce. With a week of Democratic and labor
endorsement, Cellucci underscored the idea of Democratic disarray.
Meanwhile, he quickly tagged Harshbarger as spend-and-taxer,
claiming his campaign proposals were so expensive they would result
in another fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no one-if-by-land, two-if-by-sea
uncertainty about this attack. It was so predictable that even
Harshbarger's brother anticipated it from his distant vantage point
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew it was coming. They should have countered it from
the beginning,'' rued Dohn Harshbarger on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as late as the third and final debate, when Cellucci
put a slight twist on his no-new-tax pledge by exempting the
tobacco tax, the attorney general still hadn't found a convincing
way to reassure voters that he wasn't a crypto-taxer.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also managed to knock his opponent off-balance on two
other issues, blasting his rival for wanting to change the workfare
requirement in the state's new welfare law and, somewhat more
problematically, for a supposed reluctance to crack down on
incompetent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Harshbarger's muddled offense never found focus.
His attempt to make an issue of the state's indebtedness, which he
disingenuously labeled ``the Cellucci debt tax,'' was so abstruse
it took an accountant to follow -- and such a stretch some of
Harshbarger's own supporters disavowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when it came to Cellucci's $700,000 personal debt,
Harshbarger played the reluctant street fighter, willing to
unsheath the knife, but not to wield it himself.
</P>
<P>
   His half-hearted attacks kept Cellucci's finances in the news --
but only at the cost of freezing Harshbarger's efforts to push his
own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of jumped at the low hanging fruit without looking
at the big picture,'' said one Cellucci strategist.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Cellucci's argument that his personal debt shouldn't
be an issue seemed to prevail with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Harshbarger come so close?
</P>
<P>
   The late-breaking vote clearly went his way. In no small part
that seemed to reflect an attempt to rebuke national Republicans.
Exit polls show that voters who cast their votes for Congress
because they support Clinton backed Harshbarger over Cellucci 74
percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As US Representative Barney Frank said Tuesday night, voters
clearly wanted to send Congress's Republican leadership a message.
In doing so, they also singed Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's intense efforts also helped buoy Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before last, the labor troops dropped 600,000 pieces
of Harshbarger literature in the state's 20 largest cities. This
past weekend, they distributed 40,000 pieces in Boston alone. And
they were part of the Democratic Party's effort to call 700,000
people in the last 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Both factors helped close a gap that had widened to 10 points by
the weekend, putting a deep scare into the incumbent's camp. In the
end, the Republican renaissance that began in 1990 survived
extinction by only two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find a mandate in such a narrow win, for Tuesday
night, Cellucci was not so much victor as survivor.
</P>
<P>
   But either way, the title is now governor -- and however
narrowly, the Massachusetts Republican Party has renewed its lease
on life.

MCCOY'S TALENT GOING TO WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The night of the scheduled opener, America West Arena was dark,
the doors locked tight.
</P>
<P>
   No lights. No cameras. No fans. No Gorilla. No dancers. No
Timberwolves. No Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Ainge stayed home. So did NBA referees. With no fouls to
call, they absently twirled their whistle lanyards around one
finger, killing time.
</P>
<P>
   Al McCoy heaved a fluttering sigh. With no Suns games to
broadcast, you wonder about Al. How is he dealing with the labor
dispute that wiped out Tuesday's opener and the first month of the
season and has left a huge void in his life?
</P>
<P>
   Resting on McCoy's desk is a replica of an old-time radio
microphone. The item, mounted on a wooden stand, looks like the
trophy a sportscasters bowling team might have awarded him for
posting the league's best average.
</P>
<P>
   But the gold microphone is a symbol of one man's dedication to
his craft and to decades of loyalty to the Suns. The brass
engraving reads: ``Al McCoy Phoenix Suns Voice President.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy and the Suns are synonymous. Al has been around as long as
soap. His melodious voice, like Ivory, is still 99.44 percent pure.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall, we have no team. The Suns exist in name only.
McCoy must feel like the lifelong pumpkin farmer who learns they've
canceled Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Al is unaccustomed to the silence of his own voice. During 26
years with the Suns, he has missed only three games. His string _
well over 1,000 _ ended in April 1989 in Seattle when he lost his
voice during the pre-game show. Suffering some kind of allergic
reaction, McCoy's throat just shut down. Sort of like the NBA
today.
</P>
<P>
   So what's he doing?
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, players have to stay in shape. How does a
broadcaster do that?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of wind sprints maybe Al does vocal exercises every
morning. ``Mi mi mi mi mi,'' he intones, clearing his throat in the
manner of an opera tenor warming up his pipes in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Does Al sip herbal tea? Massage his Adam's apple? Spray his
vocal chords?
</P>
<P>
   You picture McCoy, seated in a fancy restaurant, suddenly
blurting out play-by-play from an old Suns game, just to reassure
himself he still has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``KJ out front . . . Goes to Manning on the left side . . .
Manning backing, backing down now . . . Manning turns and shoots.
``ZZZZZZing go the'' ``strings!!!''''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Mrs. McCoy puts down her soup spoon. ``Al,''
she whispers through clenched teeth, ``people are ``looking.''''
</P>
<P>
   Al, just what ``are'' you doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid growing up on the farm in Iowa, I used to sit on a
fence post and pretend I was broadcasting games,'' McCoy said, a
smile in his voice. ``Now I sit by the pool, ``still''
pretending.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy has seen it all in the NBA. He was there the night in
Boston Garden during the 1976 Finals when Garfield Heard made the
shot that sent the game into the third overtime. A drunken Celtics
fan passed out in Al's lap.
</P>
<P>
   He has come to expect the unexpected. But not this. ``Never.''
Not in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   So Al sits and bides his time. From his home, he does two
morning newscasts on KTAR.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NBA owners and the players union reconvene across a
table, separated by more than the distance between them, and feel
each other out, like the human resources director who at the end of
a job interview asked the graduate what salary he expected if
hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, in the neighborhood of $150,000,'' the candidate said
matter-of-factly. ``Depending on the benefits package.''
</P>
<P>
   The HR director replied, ``What would you say to a benefits
package of five paid weeks of vacation, 14 paid holidays, full
medical and dental, a retirement fund with a 50 percent company
match and a company car _ say, a '98 red convertible BMW?''
</P>
<P>
   The applicant sat up, beaming. ``Are you kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' the director replied. ``But you started it.'' &QL;

JENKINS' OLD JAB STILL IRKS COUGARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It sounds as if Washington State has decorated its
bulletin board with an old remark made by Arizona quarterback
Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona's narrow, 35-34, loss in overtime at Washington
State last year, Jenkins was quoted as saying that the Cougars
wouldn't have a chance against cross-state rival Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those Rose Bowl-bound Cougars went on to prove Jenkins wrong
with a 41-35 victory over the Huskies. The victory is all but
forgotten. But not the remark. It appears to be a source of
motivation for the Cougars this week as they prepare for Saturday
night's game at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things, obviously, were said about us by the Arizona
players that we found offensive,'' Washington State Coach Mike
Price said Tuesday in a conference call from Pullman, Wash. ``You
know, it was stuff in the press about us not being that great.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Smelly state &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars have fallen far in one season. Last year's Pac-10
champions are 0-5 in conference play this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the king on Poop Island right now,'' Price said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The BCS state &QL; 
 &QL; 
With three games against unranked opponents left, Arizona probably
faces a difficult hurdle in an attempt to climb higher than its
current spot, No. 10, in the Bowl Championship Series rating.
</P>
<P>
   Strength of schedule is a heavily weighted factor in the BCS
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best I understand it, if you don't have a lot of games
against ranked opponents, you're going to have a hard time,'' said
Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, whose remaining schedule also includes
California on Nov. 14 and Arizona State on Nov. 21. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still growing &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's an intriguing question:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona seems to be improving while UCLA is beginning to
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona's 38-3 rout of Oregon and UCLA's 28-24 escape at
Stanford last Saturday is a signpost, the Wildcats and Bruins are
going in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona lost to the Bruins, 52-28, a month ago. But the Wildcats
have been maturing in the four weeks since the Bruins wiped them
out within a brief stretch during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Would the result be any different if UCLA was at Arizona Stadium
this Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love that,'' said defensive lineman Keoni Fraser, a
freshman from Hawaii who has emerged as a consistent starter and
potential star since Arizona's lone loss to UCLA. ``It would be a
different story, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey agrees that his young team has matured beyond
expectations. Predictably, however, Tomey also is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you win, the harder it is to win,'' Tomey said of
pressures that accompany success. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly ... &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Mike Robertson is doubtful for Washington State.
He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test on a shoulder that
was injured against Oregon. Tomey said there has been no
improvement in Robertson's condition. The junior college transfer
was a key to Arizona's effective rush on Ducks quarterback Akili
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Some numbers: Tomey's overall record against Washington State is
7-4. Price's record against Arizona is 3-6. The 1998 Wildcats (8-1)
are the 12th team in school history to win eight games. Tomey has
coached four of them. &QL;

REDMOND ONLY 50-50 FOR CAL 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-NOTES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.R. Redmond is used to doing things quickly, but his comeback
from an ankle injury is going slower than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy tailback had just two carries for no yards against
Washington State last week in the Sun Devils' 38-28 victory, and it
was presumed the rest would do him good. But Redmond was a limited
participant in Tuesday's practice, and a somewhat puzzled Coach
Bruce Snyder said the chance of Redmond playing against California
this week is 50-50 at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took him out of most team work,'' Snyder said. ``I don't
see much difference between today and last Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't see the improvement. Wouldn't you think . . . ?''
Snyder said, letting the question trail off.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond left the practice field without talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, offensive tackle Thomas Schmidt didn't practice and
is doubtful, Snyder said. The good news is that safety Christon
Rance was back at nearly full speed. And a pleasant surprise was
the return of guard Randy Leaphart, who suffered ligament damage to
his right knee against Brigham Young in the second game of the
year. Leaphart might see some action on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought his career was over,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kept the faith,'' said Leaphart. &QL;  &QL; 
Rushing to a title?
</P>
<P>
   No ASU player has ever led the Pac-10 in rushing, but Redmond
has a chance if he gets to play. He currently leads the league with
an average of 92.8 yards a game. Ken Simonton of Oregon State is
right behind at 92.0, followed by Southern California's Chad Morton
(90.3) and Arizona's Trung Canidate (84.3).
</P>
<P>
   California is seventh in the Pac-10 in rushing defense, yielding
156.6 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Rueben Droughns would be leading the Pac-10, but he's
out for the season with an ankle injury and doesn't have enough
games to qualify. Droughns gained 824 yards overall and was
averaging 164.8 when he got hurt Oct. 17 against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Simonton, who has played four more games than Droughns, is the
only player with more yardage (828). &QL;  &QL; 
Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   Should Redmond return for his senior year, next season's opener
will be billed as a battle between Heisman Trophy candidates. ASU's
first opponent in 1999 is Texas Tech on Sept. 4 at Sun Devil
Stadium. Tech's Ricky Williams is fifth in Division I in rushing
(146.1), and his 1,315 yards trail only the ``other'' Ricky
Williams, the senior from Texas. &QL;  &QL; 
Senior Day
</P>
<P>
   Among the seniors playing their final game at Sun Devil Stadium
on Saturday are wide receivers Kenny Mitchell, Lenzie Jackson and
Creig Spann, quarterback Steve Campbell, fullback Jeff Paulk,
offensive linemen Troy Davis, Grey Ruegamer and Leaphart, tight end
Matt Cercone, defensive linemen Derrick Ford and Albrey Battle,
linebacker Joe Cesta and safety Mitchell Freedman. &QL;  &QL; 
Hall of Famers
</P>
<P>
   Former quarterback Jeff Van Raaphorst and Verl Heap, the
great-uncle of freshman tight end Todd Heap, will be inducted into
the ASU Hall of Fame on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst played from 1983-86 and was the most valuable
player of the 1987 Rose Bowl, the Sun Devils' only Rose Bowl win.
Verl Heap played basketball in 1942 and 1945-48.
</P>
<P>
   Other inductees are golfer Billy Mayfair (1985-88), Olympic
medalist discus thrower Leslie Deniz (1981-83), baseball player
Fred Nelson (1967-68) and swimmer Andy Astbury (1979-83). &QL;  &QL;

MUURSEPP, MILIC PLAY OVERSEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night they were supposed to tip off the 1998-99 season,
the Suns were sitting idle.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of players with ties to the Suns are not gathering
rust.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Milic, a free-agent swingman who finished the season with
the Suns, is playing with Fenebahce, a club in Istanbul, Turkey.
Milic, a Slovenian, has a clause in his contract with the Turkish
club that will allow him to return to the NBA when _ or if _ the
league lifts its lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Muursepp, a 6-foot-9 forward the Suns obtained in a
draft-day trade that sent Steve Nash to Dallas, is in Israel, where
he is seeking a similar arrangement with Maccabi Tel-Aviv, an
Israeli League club.
</P>
<P>
   Because Muursepp is under contract to the Suns _ a contract
recognized by FIBA, the governing body of European basketball _
Muursepp must return unless the Suns choose to release him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maccabi has had on-and-off interest in Martin for months,''
said Marc Fleisher, Muursepp's agent. ``First, they wanted him to
become an Israeli citizen, and he has gone through that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Muursepp has played in Israel before and is married to an
Israeli woman. By becoming a citizen, Muursepp would not count
against the Tel-Aviv club's limit of foreign players. However, he
hasn't been granted that status yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They signed another player at his position, and now they're
considering releasing him,'' Fleisher said. ``I think they're
interested in having him play until the lockout ends, and then he
would obviously have to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke with Maccabi yesterday, but I can't talk to them about
anything beyond the lockout because I don't know yet how Phoenix
feels about wanting to keep him. They might want to free up money
to sign Scottie Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said he cannot comment on
what Muursepp and Milic are doing because of a league-imposed gag
order associated with the lockout. But the league's policy is to
allow players to work in Europe, at the risk of endangering their
NBA careers if they suffer an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Tel-Aviv already has signed guard Oded Katash, whom the New York
Knicks plan to sign after the lockout, and the Israeli club may be
reluctant to sign another player it will have to give up when the
lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
   Readers interested in tracking players in Europe can find them
via the Internet at www.EuroBasket.com. &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making noise &QL;  &QL; 
Suns free-agent forward Antonio McDyess sounds as if he's seriously
considering signing with the Houston Rockets. Reportedly, he is
atop the Rockets' wish list, and he is building a house in the
Sugarland, Texas, area.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess took part in a charity game involving a number of NBA
stars working out in Houston, and told the Houston Chronicle that
the Suns, Rockets and Chicago Bulls are the three teams he'll
consider when the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Houston) is one of the three cities I'll consider to
play in,'' McDyess said. ``I'll feel good if I come here to play.
It would just be like home to me. It's a great city. It's a great
place to work out. There's so much competition up here in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three teams I'm considering. I don't want to put any
one first. But if I play here, I'll be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches, players and the city are my three main
objectives. I want to be comfortable in the atmosphere. I want
someplace like here. I feel at home here. I just want to come in
and fit in right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Something to consider &QL;  &QL; 
While most of the NBA's 400 players may be working out some, few
are really going to be prepared for a quick start-up of the season
should the lockout end.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns and every other NBA team may find themselves chasing,
appropriately, the Indiana Pacers. Veterans Reggie Miller and Mark
Jackson have organized formal workouts, and 10 of the club's 12
players have been showing up regularly, including center Rik Smits
_ a free agent.

BOXER, MURRAY FEND OFF GOP CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Edits thruout; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of the endangered women Tuesday night
turned into the election of some empowered women.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington state, who rode a feminist ``Year of the Woman'' wave
into Washington in 1992 but looked like possible victims of a voter
backlash in 1998, turned away strong GOP opponents and won second
six-year terms Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat, lost her seat
to conservative state Senator Peter Fitzgerald, but narrowly, and
not before she battled back from a double-digit deficit in the
polls and made it, for a time, a race too close for network
pollsters to call.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boxer and Murray fended off charges by their opponents that
they were hypocrites for being silent on President Clinton's sex
scandal while being vocal six years ago about sexual harassment
allegations made against the Supreme Court nominee, Clarence
Thomas. Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned hard for both senators.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defeated Republican California State Treasurer Matt Fong
in a negative and costly race. Murray overcame Representative Linda
Smith, a maverick Republican, in an equally nasty contest.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first African-American
woman elected to the Senate, was dogged by questions about her
character, ethics, and judgment. She was investigated for
campaign-spending irregularities and criticized for repeated visits
in Nigeria with the late dictator Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth female senator seeking re-election _ Democrat Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland _ swept to an easy victory and a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, the notable difference this decade in the way
men and women vote, was a big factor in elections again, according
to exit polls conducted by the Voter News Service, and it appeared
to help Democrats particularly. Moseley-Braun garnered 54 percent
of the women's vote, compared with 45 percent for Fitzgerald,
according to figures late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrat Charles E. Schumer upset incumbent Alfonse
M. D'Amato as women gave Schumer 61 percent of their vote,
according to exit polls. In North Carolina, Democrat John Edwards
defeated Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth with 59 percent of the
women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap is damn well determining these very significant
Democratic victories,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, a women's rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to close the gender gap this year by
campaigning on issues women say are important to them _ education,
health care, and Social Security. But poll conducted in the last
week of October for The New York Times found that GOP candidates
were not winning over voters on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Blanche Lambert, Lincoln of Arkansas, elected as the
only newcomer to the Senate sisterhood, got 59 percent of the
women's vote Tuesday in defeating Fay Boozman, an ophthalmologist
and state senator who sponsored the state's 1997 bill to ban
late-term abortions. Lincoln had retired from the US House in 1997
because she was pregnant with twins.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen got twice
as many votes from women as did her opponent, Jay Lucas, and easily
was elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Women did not give Republican challenger Ellen Sauerbrey the
boost she needed in her rematch with Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening. In fact, 60 percent of the women voters Tuesday
supported Democrat Glendening and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, his
running mate, according to exit polls, compared to 57 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerbrey was one of 10 women running for governor this fall,
and for weeks polls showed her contest with Glendening a dead heat.
It looked as if it could produce a replay of 1994, when voters
delivered such a squeaker that Sauerbrey challenged the results in
court. What was different this time, however, was Sauerbrey's style
and issues. Trying to close the gender gap, she softened her
conservative edge, downplayed her opposition to gun control and
abortion, and highlighted her credentials as a former schoolteacher
and a friend of working families.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, voters returned Republican Jane Dee Hull as
governor, while Democrats Barbara Kennelly in Connecticut, Myrth
York in Rhode Island, and Laura Boyd in Oklahoma lost their
gubernatorial bids. Republican Ruth Dwyer lost to Governor Howard
Dean in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   A record 121 women ran for the US House, including 28 who
opposed each other and, for the first time, three who declared that
they are lesbians. Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who is gay, held a wide
lead Tuesday night over Republican Josephine Musser for an open
seat in Wisconsin. The other gay women _ Democrats Christine Kehoe
of San Diego and Margarethe Cammermayer of Seattle _ ran against
Republican incumbents in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Voters re-elected two Democratic incumbents who had been on the
endangered list, Julia Carson of Indianapolis and Corrine Brown of
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are nine women in the Senate, and Tuesday's election
results produce no net gain. It's likely, with women leading in
governors' races in Colorado and Hawaii, that the current number of
three women governors will grow. Women now hold 54 seats in the
House, though three won't be returning, and late Tuesday night only
two female newcomers appeared headed for the 106th Congress.

ASTROS OFFER A `SERIOUS MESSAGE' TO JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after Diamondbacks Managing General Partner
Jerry Colangelo met with free agent Randy Johnson, Houston Astros
officials made the pitcher a contract offer at his Valley home on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in the Houston Chronicle, the Astros, who
as Johnson's most recent employer are the only club eligible to
talk money until Thursday night under major league rules, offered
the left-hander a three-year deal for between $33 million and $36
million.
</P>
<P>
   Houston General Manager Gerry Hunsicker confirmed a multiyear
offer, but said the dollar figure was off base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not appropriate,'' Hunsicker told the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker told the Chronicle that the offer was created ``to
send a serious message to Randy and his family about just how
important we feel he is to this franchise. It's more than we've
ever offered a player, and it shows that re-signing Randy is our
Number 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jeff Bagwell's $8 million tops the Houston
payroll. Boston's Pedro Martinez, in the second season of a
six-year, $75 million deal, averages $12.5 million a year, and Greg
Maddux of Atlanta averages $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson met with Texas Rangers officials Tuesday and possibly
could meet with other teams this week. After all of his visits have
been completed, the Diamondbacks might have the last shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo has a reputation for striking quickly, but the process
might go beyond the weekend, perhaps as long as two or three weeks.
It is uncertain how far the Diamondbacks are willing to go on the
monetary scale, but Johnson is expected to demand at least $10
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson just turned 35, but it might not be as much of a factor
as one might think, according to Diamondbacks Manager Buck
Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that about Nolan Ryan, too, and look what he did,''
Showalter said. ``Randy had that one back problem a few years ago,
but other than that, he has kept himself in pretty good shape.'' &QL;  &QL; 
The waiting game &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks likely will bring New York Yankees center
fielder Bernie Williams in for a visit sometime next week, and that
has put a possible agreement with center fielder Devon White, the
team's MVP, on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devo still has considerable value,'' General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other free agent, infielder Andy Stankiewicz, filed on
Monday. The team has some interest in bringing him back, but will
not make an immediate move. &QL;  &QL; 
Winter watch &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their seven-man contingent in the Arizona Fall
League, the Diamondbacks have five players from their minor league
system in winter leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Three are in the Venezuelan Winter League. They are outfielder
Garry Maddox (Pastora), right-handed starter Jason Crews (Pastora)
and catcher Ramsey Koeyers (Magallanes). Outfielder Mike Stoner is
with Licey in the Dominican (Republic) Winter League and infielder
Jarrod Patterson is with Guasave of the Mexican Pacific Winter
League.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks instructor Rafael Landestoy is the general manager
of the Licey club. Pitching instructor Royal Clayton and Greg
Barber, trainer of Arizona's South Bend affiliate, are assigned to
Pastora. &QL;  &QL;

CARDS SAVIORS OF DISAPPOINTING NFC EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals are saving the NFC East from further
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The division, once considered the NFL's best, is 5-17 (a .227
winning percentage) against teams outside their division.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the victories have been posted by the Cardinals, who
have beaten St. Louis, Chicago and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which plays the Cardinals on Sunday in Sun Devil
Stadium, and Philadelphia are winless outside the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Division-leading Dallas has beaten Carolina (1-7), and the New
York Giants have defeated San Diego (3-4). So no NFC East teams
have beaten teams with winning records. &QL;  &QL; 
Deadline passed &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the last day teams could re-sign players and have
the contracts count against this year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being $3 million under the cap, the Cardinals failed to
redo or extend any contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything imminent,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have several players whose contracts will be up at
the end of the season, making them free agents. Among those who
will be unrestricted free agents are linebacker Jamir Miller,
offensive tackle Lomas Brown, wide receivers Rob Moore and Eric
Metcalf and defensive tackle Bernard Wilson. &QL;  &QL; 
Healing process &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The merry-go-round at the left guard position could be over if
second-year pro Chris Dishman has recovered from a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Dishman would start Sunday, health permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started and played pretty well when he was in there, but he
has missed a lot of time,'' Tobin said of Dishman, who has missed
the past four games.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Daniels has replaced Dishman but was benched for Matt
Joyce early in last Sunday's 17-15 victory over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin also is hopeful that starting running back Adrian Murrell
and cornerback Tom Knight are able to return this week.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell was a late scratch last Sunday because of a calf injury
that has caused him the miss most of the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Knight hasn't played since Sept. 27 because of a hamstring/knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's close to being ready,'' Tobin said of Knight,
who went to Atlanta a week ago to get a second opinion on his
slow-healing injury. &QL;  &QL; 
Short shots &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The magnetic resonance imaging on cornerback Aeneas Williams'
strained neck showed no damage, and he is expected to practice
today.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he thought starting strong safety Tommy Bennett
played his best game of the season in the victory over the Lions.
Bennett had five tackles and stopped Lions running back Barry
Sanders for a 2-yard loss on third and 2 at the Cardinals' 42
midway through the fourth quarter. The Lions decided to punt on
fourth down, setting up the Cardinals' game-winning drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' TV blackout streak will continue. They have sold
41,165 tickets for Sunday's game against the Redskins.

FOR SCHUMER AND N.Y. DEMOCRATS, A GIDDY NIGHT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was an impossibly gaudy crystal chandelier
above him, a who's who of prominent New York Democrats around him
and hundreds of wildly clapping, hoarsely cheering supporters at
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing captured the significance or heady thrill of the
moment for Rep. Charles Schumer _ soon to be Sen. Charles Schumer _
as much as his smile. It seemed too broad to be contained by his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying a jammed ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan
that just so happened to be the place where his Republican rival in
the Senate race, Alfonse D'Amato, formally announced his bid for
re-election earlier this year, Schumer bounced up and down, swayed
back and forth and leaned down to plant a kiss on the forehead of
his wife, Iris Weinshall Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made a vow, saying he would show his gratitude for being
given this joy and this opportunity by working to deserve a place
among a pantheon of Democratic senators from New York that included
Robert Kennedy, Jacob Javits and Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do my best to be a senator worthy of New York,''
Schumer promised, ``and worthy of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's poignant, roughly 15-minute speech _ which began just
a few minutes after 11 p.m., in time to be carried live by local
television newscasts _ capped and consummated a victory party as
euphoric as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ballroom, at least 300 campaign workers, supporters
and Democratic loyalists hugged tightly and gave each other
high-fives. Many hundreds more, unable to fit into the ballroom,
filled the entire lobby of the Waldorf.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable size of the turnout and the expansive spirits of
those who came underscored how long and how much Democrats had
wanted to oust D'Amato, whose wily political survival over three
terms in the Senate had frustrated them to no end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to see Schumer in,'' Steve Ludsin, 50, a lawyer
from East Hampton, said. ``But it's great to see D'Amato gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this was technically Schumer's night, there were any
number of other agendas at play inside the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of interest groups serving gays and lesbians,
the environment and organized labor roamed the ballroom, ferreting
out reporters and explaining why the constituents their
organizations represented, and the issues their organizations
pushed, turned the election in Schumer's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York State Democratic
Committee, discoursed on the party's efforts to get out the vote
and how pivotal that drive had been.
</P>
<P>
   And Democratic politicians like New York City Public Advocate
Mark Green, who opposed Schumer in the Democratic primary in
September, and New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who is
expected to run for mayor in 2001, made bee lines for the thicket
of television cameras at one end of the room and basked in the
reflected glow of Schumer's accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   They portrayed the significance and explanation of that
accomplishment in terms that went far beyond Schumer himself.
``This is probably the biggest win for Democrats in years, if not
decades, in this state,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi expressed similar sentiments, then suddenly caught
himself, remembering that it was still before 10 p.m. and that
neither D'Amato nor Schumer had publicly acknowledged a definitive
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If D'Amato ends up winning tonight,'' he told several
reporters who were furiously scribbling notes, ``would you rip out
those pages and burn everything I said?''

BOXER, MURRAY FEND OFF GOP CHALLENGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign of the endangered women Tuesday night
turned into the election of some empowered women.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray
of Washington state, who rode a feminist ``Year of the Woman'' wave
into Washington in 1992 but looked like possible victims of a voter
backlash in 1998, turned away strong GOP opponents and won second
six-year terms Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat, lost her seat
to conservative state Senator Peter Fitzgerald, but narrowly, and
not before she battled back from a double-digit deficit in the
polls and made it, for a time, a race too close for network
pollsters to call.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boxer and Murray fended off charges by their opponents that
they were hypocrites for being silent on President Clinton's sex
scandal while being vocal six years ago about sexual harassment
allegations made against the Supreme Court nominee, Clarence
Thomas. Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned hard for both senators.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer defeated Republican California State Treasurer Matt Fong
in a negative and costly race. Murray overcame Representative Linda
Smith, a maverick Republican, in an equally nasty contest.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, who in 1992 became the first African-American
woman elected to the Senate, was dogged by questions about her
character, ethics, and judgment. She was investigated for
campaign-spending irregularities and criticized for repeated visits
in Nigeria with the late dictator Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth female senator seeking re-election _ Democrat Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland _ swept to an easy victory and a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap, the notable difference this decade in the way
men and women vote, was a big factor in elections again, according
to exit polls conducted by the Voter News Service, and it appeared
to help Democrats particularly. Moseley-Braun garnered 54 percent
of the women's vote, compared with 45 percent for Fitzgerald,
according to figures late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Democrat Charles E. Schumer upset incumbent Alfonse
M. D'Amato as women gave Schumer 61 percent of their vote,
according to exit polls. In North Carolina, Democrat John Edwards
defeated Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth with 59 percent of the
women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gender gap is damn well determining these very significant
Democratic victories,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Feminist Majority, a women's rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to close the gender gap this year by
campaigning on issues women say are important to them _ education,
health care, and Social Security. But poll conducted in the last
week of October for The New York Times found that GOP candidates
were not winning over voters on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Blanche Lambert, Lincoln of Arkansas, elected as the
only newcomer to the Senate sisterhood, got 59 percent of the
women's vote Tuesday in defeating Fay Boozman, an ophthalmologist
and state senator who sponsored the state's 1997 bill to ban
late-term abortions. Lincoln had retired from the US House in 1997
because she was pregnant with twins.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen got twice
as many votes from women as did her opponent, Jay Lucas, and easily
was elected to a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Women did not give Republican challenger Ellen Sauerbrey the
boost she needed in her rematch with Maryland Governor Parris
Glendening. In fact, 60 percent of the women voters Tuesday
supported Democrat Glendening and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, his
running mate, according to exit polls, compared to 57 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sauerbrey was one of 10 women running for governor this fall,
and for weeks polls showed her contest with Glendening a dead heat.
It looked as if it could produce a replay of 1994, when voters
delivered such a squeaker that Sauerbrey challenged the results in
court. What was different this time, however, was Sauerbrey's style
and issues. Trying to close the gender gap, she softened her
conservative edge, downplayed her opposition to gun control and
abortion, and highlighted her credentials as a former schoolteacher
and a friend of working families.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, voters returned Republican Jane Dee Hull as
governor, while Democrats Barbara Kennelly in Connecticut, Myrth
York in Rhode Island, and Laura Boyd in Oklahoma lost their
gubernatorial bids. Republican Ruth Dwyer lost to Governor Howard
Dean in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   A record 121 women ran for the US House, including 28 who
opposed each other and, for the first time, three who declared that
they are lesbians. Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who is gay, held a wide
lead Tuesday night over Republican Josephine Musser for an open
seat in Wisconsin. The other gay women _ Democrats Christine Kehoe
of San Diego and Margarethe Cammermayer of Seattle _ ran against
Republican incumbents in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   Voters re-elected two Democratic incumbents who had been on the
endangered list, Julia Carson of Indianapolis and Corrine Brown of
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are nine women in the Senate, and Tuesday's election
results produce no net gain. It's likely, with women leading in
governors' races in Colorado and Hawaii, that the current number of
three women governors will grow. Women now hold 54 seats in the

 FEINGOLD, wHO REJECTED PARTY MONEY, RE-ELECTED IN WISCONSIN   By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETON, Wis. _ Sen. Russell Feingold, who defied conventional
political wisdom and the wishes of his own Democratic Party by
sharply limiting the campaign money he would accept, was re-elected
Tuesday in one of the country's most closely watched races.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin voters handed the senator a second term, rejecting the
Republican candidate, Mark Neumann, a two-term congressman from
Wisconsin's First District.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Wisconsin senate race had come to be seen as a
referendum on campaign finance reform, even if individual Wisconsin
voters did not always see it that way. Still, regardless of the
motivation, turnout was high in a state where voters can register
to vote on Election Day. In some counties precincts ran out of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold is the co-author, along with Republican Sen. John
McCain, of a campaign finance reform bill that would prevent local
or national political organizations from spending money on behalf
of individual candidates, the ``soft money'' that has flooded into
campaigns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was determined to stick to his principles, even it
meant sacrificing his career, Feingold refused to allow the
national Democratic Party to spend money to run ``issue ads'' on
his behalf, commercials that praise or criticize candidates but do
not explicitly call for their election or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann took no such pledge and millions of dollars of soft
money poured into his campaign, fueling a series of television ads
that began in August, a full month before Feingold countered with
his own commercials. Neumann's commercials and those paid for by
groups supporting him drilled at Feingold, who was initially about
10 to 15 points ahead in the polls. One humorous commercial
featured a cow and accused Feingold of supporting a wasteful study
on bovine flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann's advertising blitz was so effective, analysts believe,
that for weeks, polls have shown the two candidates have been in a
virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
tried to circumvent Feingold's dictum by running its own campaign
commercials on his behalf. He objected vociferously and persuaded
the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, to put a stop to the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, 44, a conservative former math teacher and real-estate
developer from Janesville who is championed by groups like the
Christian Coalition, has claimed that Feingold also benefited from
issue ads run by outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who campaigned with the unusual approach of showing
charts and bar graphs on an overhead slide projector, sought to
make the election about other issues, trying to appeal to several
different constituencies. He reached out to conservative
Republicans with hard-hitting ads highlighting his support for an
amendment to ban flag-burning and his opposition for the late-term
abortion procedure that opponents call ``partial birth abortion.''
And he made a play for Democratic votes with talk about shoring up
the Social Security system and with a commercial suggesting that
Feingold had voted against Wisconsin's senior senator, the popular
Democrat, Herb Kohn.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, a 45-year-old lawyer and former Rhodes scholar from
Middleton, whose father was an organizer for Wisconsin's
reform-minded Progressive Party, is often described as a political
maverick. He tends to be liberal on social issues and moderate on
fiscal issues, occasionally staking out an iconoclastic position
completely out of sync with his party. He believes banning flag
burning would infringe on the right to free speech and supports the
right to late-term abortions in some circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Feingold has run an unconventional
campaign. In 1992, running against an incumbent who outspent him,
Feingold ran humorous advertisements in which he was endorsed by
Elvis Presley, traced the map of Wisconsin on the back of his hand
and opened his closet to find no skeletons. He also painted a set
of promises on his garage door, pledging to be present for every
Senate vote and to visit every Wisconsin county once a year. By all
accounts, he kept those promises.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates sparred over the issue of ``soft money,''
they both agreed to limit direct or ``hard money'' spending, making
their race the only statewide campaign in the country to adopt such
limits. Both agreed to limit donations from political action groups
to10 percent of the total campaign money; to raise no more than 25
percent of their money from out of state, and to put a $2,000 cap
on the personal money a candidate could spend on the campaign. They
also agreed to limit overall spending to $1 for each registered
voter, about 3.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of campaign finance reform feared that if Feingold
lost, the movement would not only lose one of its leaders, but
future candidates would be reluctant to follow his example. But
despite the national attention paid to the campaign finance issue,
for many Wisconsin voters, that subject seemed to have little
impact on how they voted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, I really didn't think about it that much,'' said Joan
Reinke, 53, who works at a convenience store in Middleton and voted
for Feingold because she likes ``his persona, his attitude, his
walk, his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinke said that ``everyone said there was something wrong
with'' taking soft money, ``but the bottom line is who have - if
you like them, then you don't care much about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hughes, a 34-year-old lawyer in Middleton, also voted for
Feingold, and said the campaign finance issue only affected his
decision ``marginally _ I guess I hadn't spent a lot of time
thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes' vote may have been indirectly affected by the
candidates' differing approaches to campaign finance. He said that
one reason he voted for Feingold was his disgust with Neumann's
blizzard of advertising, which he said ``misrepresented Feingold.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Betty Petersen, a 57-year-old nurse from Lodi,
said she paid no attention to the issue of ``outside money as long
as they were supporting the right issues.'' But she said she
decided to vote for Neumann at the last minute today because she
recalled the message of his commercials, which she said were ``very
visible.''
</P>

TURNING THE CORNER  
 ABL FUTURE IS BRIGHT, CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   The American Basketball League planned for a publicity spurt at
the end of its third season.
</P>
<P>
   But the funny thing is that it's getting a boost at the start of
the season, and the gusher comes courtesy of its competition, in so
far as the NBA bankrolls the rival WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the NBA lockout and cancellation of games through at
least November, the women's ABL has a corner on professional
basketball in the United States. The only other outlet for the pro
game is the minor-league Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL continues to market itself as Real Basketball in real
basketball season, in a futile slap at the WNBA's summer success.
Now it has the season to itself, though it's not without real
competition _ from the likes of pro and college football, the NHL
and college basketball. Not to mention the school-year commitments
and restrictions that inhibit weekday attendance among women's
basketball target audience of family and youth.
</P>
<P>
   Still for a league that was pummeled by the WNBA in college
signings, forced to fold its Los Angeles metro franchise and impose
10 percent front-office pay cuts, has only two games on major
network TV and lost another all-leaguer to the WNBA, the forecast
is no worse than partly cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to say that the league is well-funded and we
certainly anticipate being around for a long, long time,'' said
Gary Cavalli, ABL chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-team league has sold operating rights in San Jose (to
Joe Lacob), Portland (Rodger Rickard) and a third city yet to be
announced; set an average attendance goal of 5,500-6,000; and is
heading toward profitability, which Cavalli predicts will come by
2000-01, if not a season before.
</P>
<P>
   Tip-off Thursday, with the first of 11 games to be nationally
televised by cable Fox Sports Net, is two weeks later than in
previous years. That brings the 44-game regular season to a close
on March 25, a day before the NCAA Women's Final Four semifinals in
an ABL city, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL playoffs will continue through at least April 24 and
perhaps two games beyond that, giving the league prime exposure
while Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw and other college seniors are
deciding where to cast their future.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, Tennessee's first three-time Kodak All-America, is
the key player in the ABL/WNBA tussle. She is the Cheryl Miller of
her generation, and the direction she goes with her pro choice is
the way the wind will be perceived to blow.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Noise is one of two expansion teams in the ABL,
which allows each of its team to have one territorial draft pick.
Common thinking, though, is that Holdsclaw wants to return to her
native New York City. Not so coincidentally, the ABL is negotiating
to place a team in Long Island, Manhattan or Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a city that a certain college player has shown some
interest in who we are interested in recruiting,'' Cavalli said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the WNBA operating committee assigned the league's
No. 1 1999 draft pick to the 3-27 Washington Mystics. For the New
York Liberty to have a shot at Holdsclaw likely would require a
rules change to allow for multiplayer trades, such as the blue-sky
rumor of Rebecca Lobo, Sophia Witherspoon and Kym Hampton to
Washington for Holdsclaw.
</P>
<P>
   With New York in the ABL's future and LA, specifically the
runner-up Long Beach StingRays, in its past, the major market du
jour is Chicago. The Condors have a Bulls lineage, beginning with
General Manager Allison Hodges, whose husband, Craig, played for
the Bulls and Suns, and Coach Jim Cleamons, a former Bulls
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The Condors and the Portland Power were big winners in April,
when league MVP Natalie Williams invoked a clause in her contract
forcing a trade to her hometown Long Beach team. In return, MVP
runner-up Yolanda Griffith went from Long Beach to Chicago, her
hometown, and Portland received the No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   That pick was spent on Danielle McCulley, a 6-3 forward from
Western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus, which rallied at home from a two-game deficit to take
out Coach Maura McHugh's StingRays and repeat as champions, is
favored again.
</P>
<P>
   But the Quest is without forward Valerie Still, two-time MVP of
the league championship series who tore up her right knee in an
exhibition game. And Coach Brian Agler is scouring the WNBA for one
of its five vacant coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, the former Arizona State coach who lives in Phoenix, is
working in the ABL player personnel department while designated as
the league's coach-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL also tips off without point guard Dawn Staley, who
skipped to the WNBA to join crossovers Nikki McCray and Cindy
Brown, but has re-signed 81 of 85 players whose contracts expired
after years 1 or 2. And its reputation as a players league _ with
an average salary of $80,000, _ was only reinforced by the election
of Philadelphia guard Teresa Edwards to the league board of
directors. &QL;

WNBA PLAYERS ON VERGE OF JOINING NBA UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Votes are due today and expected to be counted Thursday in
balloting to determine whether WNBA players will form the first
women's pro sports union.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of those voting approve the NBA Players
Association as their representative, the union would begin its
existence in the giant shadow of the lockout that is threatening
the NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Players Association collected signed union cards from
more than 100 of 120 WNBA players during the summer, which the
league requested to have verified via formal election.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute about the timing of the election ensued, with the
National Labor Relations Board siding with the players in not
delaying the vote until May, thereby preventing any union impact
until after the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   NBA Players Association Executive Director Billy Hunter and WNBA
President Val Ackerman have exchanged salvos in lobbying for and
against NBAPA approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the players, Ackerman called the men's union
``extreme and destructive'' and said the league would be willing to
accept another bargaining group, thought to be a spinoff from the
Women's Basketball Coaches Association, without an NLRB-supervised
election.
</P>
<P>
   That option would allow the players to turn down the NBA Players
Association yet have its union go forward before another season
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give the WNBA credit,'' said agent Bruce Levy, who
represents 34 WNBA players, including the Mercury's Bridget Pettis,
Toni Foster and Andrea Kuklova. ``They did a very, very, very smart
and aggressive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levy thinks the NBAPA will receive approval by about
two-thirds of the players. If so, the next step is election of
player representatives, hiring of union staff to work with the
women and bargaining with the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union will take a moderate stance,'' said Levy, who
believes a 400 to 500 percent increase in the average salary to
$125,000 is reasonable. The league's definition of reasonable is
more likely to be in the range of doubling of 1998 salaries, with a
$125,000 maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential starting point in negotiations is using the
1998 maximum salary ($62,500) as a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he estimates that players are receiving 6.5 to 9.5
percent of basketball related income and should get 40.
</P>
<P>
   How would such a proposal be received by the league,
particularly in light of the NBA lockout going into its fifth
month?
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine they would just get angry,'' Levy said. ``Then we'd
go to the books. That's why I'm so optimistic, because the books
will show they're doing one of the ultimate exploitation jobs, and
they couldn't have that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaries, which average $30,000, compared to $80,000 in the
American Basketball League, health benefits and pension are the key
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABL has been as fair as possible to the players,'' Levy
said. ``I don't see any reason for them to have a union. I wish the
ABL had the WNBA's money or the WNBA has the ABL's mentality. If we
could do a transplant, it'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   All players who participated in the WNBA inaugural season must
be re-signed before next year _ including the Mercury's Jennifer
Gillom, Michele Timms, Pettis, Umeki Webb, Foster and Marlies
Askamp.
</P>
<P>
   Five 1998 Phoenix rookies _ Michelle Griffiths, Kristi Harrower,
Kuklova, Brandy Reed and Maria Stepanova _ are under league
contract for '99. &QL;

WASHINGTON STATE VOTERS APPROVE INITIATIVE LIMITING AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs byline and subs story for updating and rewriting throughout)  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK and B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Giving a major boost to critics of affirmative action,
Washington state voters Tuesday night appear to have soundly
approved an initiative that would ban most state-supported forms of
the policy. They did so two years after California voters made
theirs the first state in the nation to do so, and the vote is
almost certain to spur efforts in other states.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 percent of precincts reporting, the measure known as
Initiative 200 was running ahead, 60 percent to 40 percent. Under
the measure's wording, the state ``shall not discriminate against,
or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the
basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin'' in
education, employment or contracting.
</P>
<P>
   The language was similar to that used in the Civil Rights Act of
1964, but critics of the measure, including the state's popular
governor, Gary Locke, a Democrat, warned that the measure had
``hidden consequences'' and would roll back gains made in programs
that expand opportunities for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In votes on other major initiatives, Washington voters gave
broad support to a measure that would legalize the use of marijuana
for medical purposes and voted down a proposal to criminalize the
late-term abortion procedure that critics call ``partial-birth
abortion.'' In Colorado, a similar abortion measure was evenly
split with 40 percent of precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, early returns suggested that that state was poised to
become the first in the nation to do away entirely with polling
booths: if trends continue and the measure passes, the state will
conduct all future elections entirely by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan voters Tuesday soundly rejected a proposal to legalize
physician-assisted suicide. At 11:50 p.m., with 56 percent of
precincts reporting, the measure was losing 70 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In California, exit polls and early returns indicated that
voters were broadly supporting a measure to expand casino gambling
on Indian tribal lands. The battle between the Indian tribes and
Nevada casinos led to campaign spending of almost $100 million, by
far the most money ever spent on an initiative in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record was $57.5 million for a 1996 securities
fraud measure in California.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, voters backed a campaign-finance reform plan
that would provide for public financing of most state election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the more closely fought initiatives and
proposed constitutional amendments on state ballots around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians were asked to decide whether to remove a
103-year-old passage in their constitution that forbids marriage
between a white person and a black person, a provision that the
U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled unenforceable. With 80 percent
of precincts reporting Tuesday night, 62 percent of voters were in
favor of removing the language, while 38 percent voted not to
remove it.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, where supporters of the assisted-suicide initiative
hoped to follow the success of a similar movement in Oregon, voters
were rejecting the idea by a better than 2-to-1 margin. Support for
the measure foundered in recent weeks when the nation's best-known
advocate of physician-assisted suicide, Dr. Jack Kevorkian,
announced that he opposed the initiative: he said it imposed too
many restrictions and too much bureaucracy on the process.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have allowed terminally ill patients to
petition the state for the right to take lethal drugs. In the first
nine months of the Oregon program, state officials announced
earlier this year, 10 people in that state were given the right to
take such drugs: eight died after taking the medication and two
others died before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, two years after voters in California and
Arizona passed measures providing for the medical use of marijuana,
residents passed a similar measure Tuesday, according to exit
polls. Voters in Nevada, Oregon and Alaska were also considering
such measures Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits and objections by the Clinton administration have
blocked the Arizona and California measures from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Washington, exit polls indicated that voters had
rejected a proposal to criminalize the late-term abortion procedure
that critics call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Abortion-rights
supporters condemned the measure, saying its terminology was overly
vague and might open the way for banning abortion in general. The
question before the voters was: ``Shall the termination of a fetus'
life during the process of birth be a felony crime except when
necessary to prevent the pregnant woman's death?''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, with 11 percent of precincts reporting, the
measure to provide for public financing of campaigns was ahead, 66
percent to 34 percent. Massachusetts would join Maine and Vermont,
which have similar policies already in place, while Arizona voters
were also considering such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, opponents of affirmative action were
claiming victory in the fight over Initiative 200, the measure to
ban many affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that America is taking a great step forward to
looking beyond race and minimizing its importance, rather than
dwelling on it and magnifying its importance,'' said John Carlson,
chairman of the group sponsoring the initiative. ``It also, I
think, will hasten the transition of affirmative action from a
program based on race and ethnicity and occasionally gender to a
program that is based on people's circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Early results also suggested that voters were inclined to
approve many of the roughly $27 billion municipal bond issues on
ballots around the country. The proposals were mostly for
education, environmental and infrastructure projects. In North
Carolina, for instance, voters appeared to have backed a $1 billion
plan to repair decrepit water and sewer lines and to extend natural
gas lines in rural areas.

GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS TAKES AIR OUT OF IMPEACHMENT BALLOON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: UPDATES and minor edits throughout.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A better-than-expected election for Democrats
Tuesday night is good news for President Clinton in his battle
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed that even though Democrats would not retake
the House, they would hold their own and might even pick up a seat
or two. The Senate, now 55-45 Republican, looked to change little.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed most voters turned their backs on GOP efforts
to make the impeachment scandal an electoral centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 in 10 voters said the impeachment inquiry now underway
had nothing to do with their vote for House candidates. The
remaining 40 percent were about equally divided between those
expressing opposition to Clinton and those showing support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air is out of that balloon,'' Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado,
general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (voters) are saying to Congress is: Wrap this up, finish
it off, get back to business,'' Romer added. ``The majority of
voters feel impeachment is not justified even though they don't
approve (of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky) at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans brushed off losses of incumbents such as GOP Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina.
``The important thing for us is to get this election behind us and
focus on issues for next year,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The House is poised to hold impeachment hearings later this
month on Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky, the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Republican leaders, many pundits and academic
specialists had cast the election as a referendum on whether the
House should impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But in the exit polls, almost 60 per cent approved of his job
performance, said he shouldn't resign and said they disapproved of
how Congress is handling the impeachment matter. About two thirds
said they don't want Clinton impeached.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, ``this is a very important symbolic victory,
although clearly in raw numbers, it doesn't amount to very much,''
said Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were some unsettling signs for Democrats. Almost
two thirds of those polled said Clinton's ability to lead has been
hurt. As expected, education, taxes, Social Security and the
economy ranked high on the list of voter concerns. But about a
fifth said moral and ethical values were the top issue. Only
education rated that high.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta noted that with
the lame-duck lawmakers still in Congress, the impeachment process
``is going to go forward'' in the coming weeks. But he added that
``the election takes some of the sting out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic incumbents, particularly in the South and rural
areas, feared the scandal might work against them. For the most
part, those fears proved groundless.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C., held back GOP challenger Dan Page,
who ran campaign ads accusing ``liberal Bob Etheridge'' of standing
side-by-side with an immoral president and his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert ``Bud'' Cramer, D-Ala., defeated Republican opponent
Gil Aust, who won headlines early in the campaign by running an ad
calling on Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   And in Texas, Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, fought off a tough
challenge by Republican challenger Rudy Izzard in his conservative
central Texas district.
</P>
<P>
   To inoculate themselves politically, all three of these
Democrats had voted for the House Republican resolution Oct. 8
authorizing an impeachment inquiry against Clinton with neither
time nor subject-matter limits.
</P>
<P>
   However, several Democrats in tight races who voted against the
Republican resolution also survived. In Ohio, Rep. Ted Strickland,
D-Ohio, defeated his GOP opponent, Ohio Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister.
Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., and Rep. Vic Snyder, D-Ark., also
emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats had voted for a Democratic impeachment
resolution that would have limited the inquiry to the Lewinsky
matter and set a Dec. 31 deadline. That resolution was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one Democratic incumbent who voted against the GOP
resolution lost. Rep. Jay Johnson, D-Wis., was beaten by state
representative Mark Green in a conservative district surrounding
Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic challengers had hoped that public weariness with
the scandal would help them win against GOP incumbents. But that
was not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky's third district, Democratic House challenger Chris
Gorman ran ads attacking what he called Republicans' obsession with
scandal, but he lost to Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., a one-term
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C., Democratic
challenger Ralph Neas ran a similar ad but lost to incumbent GOP
Rep. Constance Morella.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Jersey, freshman Rep. Mike Pappas, R-N.J., was
defeated by Democratic challenger Rush Holt, a Princeton physicist
who linked Pappas to the ``months and millions'' spent on
investigating Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results are likely to mean that the House impeachment
inquiry envisioned by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill, will be conducted with dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is expected to announce, perhaps this week, a timetable for
the inquiry. Some reports suggest that hearings will begin in
mid-November and wind up before Christmas, with a limited witness
schedule that may include key players such as presidential
secretary Betty Currie, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan and maybe
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One Judiciary Committee member who supported Clinton, Rep.
Melvin Watt, D-N.C., survived a fierce challenge by GOP challenger
Scott Keadle, a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   At least two members will leave the committee in the new
Congress. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., moves to the Senate after
vanquishing D'Amato in New York, and Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., lost
his bid to unseat Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's late-inning, $10 million ad campaign targeting the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal failed to generate an edge for Republicans
in conservative states where it ran.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered with ads characterizing Republicans as
scandal-obsessed and stressing such themes as education, health
care and saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from Clinton's sex scandal was also blunted somewhat
by disclosures that prominent congressional Republicans such as
Reps. Hyde, Dan Burton of Indiana and Helen Chenoweth of Idaho also
had committed adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Then last weekend the scientific journal Nature reported that
DNA tests showed that President Thomas Jefferson had fathered at
least one child by his slave Sally Hemings. The disclosure further
reduced any lingering moral shock stemming from Lewinsky's
involvement with President William Jefferson Clinton.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a cautious career politician
once dismissed as an uncharismatic underdog, gave the Democrats the
single biggest prize of this midterm election, defeating state
Attorney General Dan Lungren on Tuesday, to become the 37th
governor of California, according to surveys of voters leaving the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' victory over Lungren, a 52-year-old Republican former
congressman from Long Beach, marked only the fourth time this
century that a Democrat has won the governship. It put the
Democrats in control of all three branches of government in
Sacramento _ and thus control of legislative and congressional
redistricting _ for the first time since Jerry Brown left office 16
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was as Brown's chief of staff that Davis began his public
career in 1975. He has, by his own account, spent the last two
decades in a single-minded struggle to move a few feet down the
hall of the state Capitol to the governor's chair, first serving
four years in the Assembly from a district that included part of
Beverly Hills, then four years as controller before winning the
lieutenant governor's seat four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, the prevailing wisdom on Davis was that his first
name summed up his personality. Despite years of tireless fund
raising and base-building, this election year began with most
political professionals deeply doubting his chances of succeeding
Gov. Pete Wilson, the two-term Republican incumbent who was barred
by law from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Davis made his final campaign swing around the
state, with polls showing him with a double-digit lead over
Lungren, he took gleeful note of the doubters by dubbing the trip
his ``road-kill comeback tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a 55-year-old Vietnam veteran who won a Bronze Star,
pieced together a broad coalition of voters by methodically
portraying Lungren _ who tried to run as a Reaganesque conservative
_ as an extremist outside the mainstream of a fundamentally
moderate and increasingly Hispanic electorate on issues from
abortion to the environment. Davis neutralized Lungren's
crime-fighting credentials with his own longtime support of the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters leaving the polls found Davis, the first white
male to win his party's nomination since Brown, racking up
majorities among almost all voter groups, except white men,
Republicans and Protestants, and taking about six in 10 votes from
those describing themselves as moderates. Lungren won only about 20
percent of Hispanic voters, about half of what Wilson won in his
first election in 1990, before his stands against affirmative
action and illegal immigration alienated many minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mervin Field, the dean of California poll-takers, said of Davis,
``He's riding the tide of what I'd call contented apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to turn back welfare reform,'' Field said.
``He's not going to try to do anything about overturning capital
punishment. He's not going to do anything real about re-instating
affirmative action. He's going with the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly eight in 10 voters said the state's economic
condition was good or excellent, and nearly half said it would stay
about the same in the coming year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last winter, Davis was all but written off by much of the
state's Democratic establishment, which considered him too
phlegmatic to take on Lungren, the two-term attorney general. In
fact, Davis' very blandness seemed to work in his favor, as he
slipped past two self-financed millionaire rivals, Al Checchi and
Rep. Jane Harman, to decisively win the Democratic nomination in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi, former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, and Ms.
Harman together spent more than $55 million, most of it on dueling
television advertisements. Davis, who still managed to tie the old
spending record of $9 million for a primary, lacked enough money to
go on the air early and emerged unscathed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Lungren, a vocal Catholic and staunch
opponent of abortion, was whether he would be seen as too
conservative for swing voters in a state that is among the most
supportive in the nation of abortion rights. In his first
one-on-one debate with Davis this summer, Lungren emphasized how
little say a governor has over the matter, and managed to rattle
Davis by questioning the Democrat's past support for the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers later said that Davis had not prepared enough
for that first encounter, but he consistently dominated the
campaign dialogue from then on. Public opinion polls showed that he
was regarded as better than Lungren on the No. 1 issue of
education, along with health care, environmental protection and
abortion and Lungren holding a significant advantage only on the
issues of crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lungren never seemed able to move much beyond his
law-and-order background. Wary of opposition to his main
educational proposals _ vouchers that would let parents of public
school children send them to private and parochial schools instead
_ he seldom mentioned them on the stump. That disappointed some
campaign advisers, who believed the issue offered him a chance to
contrast his own ideas with Davis' reluctance to take on the
powerful teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the campaign, according to the polls, Davis was
drawing the support of fully half of voters who identified
themselves as moderate Republicans, a vital part of Wilson's
winning coalitions and the key to any victory in a state where
partly loyalty is fairly evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gray has always been underestimated, because he was in
Jerry's shadow for so many years, and because they thought of the
stereotype and didn't go much deeper than that,'' said Stephen
Rivers, who managed Davis' first campaign for state Assembly in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always, `Oh, he's gray, and not very exciting.' All
that superficial stuff missed how tenacious he is. He's an
incredibly focused person. He takes his job both as an elected
official and a politician very seriously. He's methodical and he's
unrelenting.''

NORTHRIDGE FREE SAFETY SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ It's Cal State Northridge's final home game
of the season _ barring playoffs _ but one of the most flamboyant
Matadors won't be on the field.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said Tuesday starting free safety Jeremy
Golden has been suspended for Saturday's game against Portland
State for a violation of team rules.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, a sophomore from Westlake High, is the Matadors' leading
tackler with 76. Ponciano said freshman Hassan Abdul-Malik was
slotted into the starting spot. Golden will return to the team
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big suspension because he has a lot of people that care
for him coming to the games, and it hurts him bad,'' Ponciano said.
``Our whole thing is we want to teach our kids etiquette in
society. That's a big thing for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano wouldn't go into detail on the incident, but other
players said the disciplinary action was taken after Golden was
involved in an argument with a professor.
</P>
<P>
   He is the second player in two weeks suspended by Ponciano.
Running back Melvin Blue, who returned to the team Sunday, was
suspended for CSUN's 26-10 win at Weber State last week for a
violation of team rules. A deciding factor in that was an argument
Blue had with running backs coach Keith Borges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big blow. It's huge,'' said CSUN strong safety Vito
Clemente, who is Golden's roommate on road trips. ``The people
behind (Golden), they haven't had a lot of repetition. Biggest game
of the year and it's the worst possible time for it to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he let down his team and he let down his family. One
thing he was saying was, `I have to go tell my mom I'm not
playing.' How much more disappointing can that be.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (5-3, 4-2 Big Sky) and Portland State (5-3, 4-2) are tied
with Montana for second in the conference. The loser of this
matchup will see its playoff aspirations evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano reaction: The buzz across campus Tuesday wasn't the
suspension of Golden, but rather the resignations of athletic
director Paul Bubb and associate athletic director Judy Brame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day, no question. I feel like I lost two friends,''
Ponciano said. ``I'm fond of them, so to put it lightly, it's a big
blow.... Even with the bad press, we've made great strides in the
last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Scouting Portland State: Portland State quarterback Jim
Blanchard leads the the country with a 169.67 passing efficiency
rating, but reports out of Oregon say he won't play against CSUN
because of mononucleosis. A break? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Tyson Parsons is fifth in the country with a
158.83 rating, and Ponciano has called running back Charles Dunn
(151 yards per game) the most talented rusher in the Big Sky
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Also, wide receivers Art Williams (44 catches) and Orshawante
Bryant (46) have combined for 19 touchdown receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be one of those Big Sky shootouts,'' Ponciano said.
``Both teams have to play phenomenon defense for it not to be.''

BOXER HOLDING OFF FONG FOR CALIFORNIA SENATE SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Haunted by low standing in polls during her
six-year term, incumbent Barbara Boxer capped a strong campaign by
surging to an early lead Tuesday over Republican Matt Fong in one
of the most closely watched Senate races in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   After battling Republican Fong in almost a dead heat, according
to opinion polls, Boxer pulled ahead aided by a strong Democratic
get-out-the-vote effort and appearances by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand their daily lives are impacted by who sits
in the U.S. Senate seat,'' Boxer said in an interview on election
night, adding that she believed a large voter turnout helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had targeted the feisty and outspoken Boxer, 57, who
was viewed as vulnerable this year in her first statewide bid for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer narrowly won her Senate bid in 1992 against Bruce
Herschensohn, a more conservative candidate than Fong. GOP
strategists, and even some Democrats, believed she would have a
harder time this year against a more moderate rival.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the final weeks of the campaign, the Republican
National Committee reportedly pulled back on some of its funding
promises as Boxer surged to a lead in public opinion polls and Fong
showed weakness in developing his own fund-raising base.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer seemed tireless in her campaigning in the final weeks,
traveling throughout the state trying to build support and get her
supporters to the polls while running an attack campaign against
Fong for his positions on the environment and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, 44, the son of one the state's most popular politicians _
former Secretary of State March Fong Eu _ experienced some
difficulty coming out of a tough GOP primary in June, where he
overcame an expensive challenge from San Diego businessman Darrell
Issa.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and a
graduate of the Air Force Academy, also found himself mired in a
number of controversies in the final weeks of the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was the disclosure that he made a $50,000
contribution to the conservative Traditional Values Coalition,
which angered some of his more moderate supporters _ particularly
gays and lesbians in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, he signed a pledge to support gay rights
issues, which angered some conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   A main tactic Fong used in his campaign was to emphasize the
idea that he would provide a more moderate voice in the Senate than
Boxer and be more capable of working with other members.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was seen as vulnerable, partly because of her voting
record and partly because of the scandals involving President
Clinton and Boxer's quiet criticism of him compared to her past
vocal criticism of Republicans involved in sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of those issues, and with the race appearing to be a
virtual dead heat according to some opinion polls, the Boxer-Fong
contest drew national attention and national fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has appeared at several Boxer fund-raisers in
October, as has first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's daughter is married to the first lady's brother.
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, as news coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
affair has waned, the public's interest in it also seemed to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republican efforts to boost it as a campaign issue
seemingly have backfired, with private opinion polls suggesting
that it might even be encouraging more people to vote, particularly
women and political moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also was seen as benefiting from various get-out-the-vote
efforts, particularly by Latinos and organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Boxer moved to the San Francisco Bay
Area in 1965 with her husband and became active in politics as a
volunteer in the anti-Vietnam War movement.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected to the San Marino Board of Supervisors and then
went on to Congress, where she gained attention for her criticism
of the Department of Defense and its spending.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ran on the same ballot
and benefited from the ``year of the women'' sentiment following
controversies involving former Republican Sen. Robert Packwood of
Oregon and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Fong came to politics from a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   His adoptive mother was a popular Democratic Assemblywoman from
the Bay Area and he remembers campaigning for her in different
elections, being paid 25 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she became California's secretary of state and, still
later, took the post of U.S. ambassador to Micronesia. Although she
won statewide office as a Democrat, her son registered as a
Republican in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to a vacancy on the state Board of Equalization
by Gov. Pete Wilson. In 1994, he won statewide election to his
current post of state Treasurer.

MISSOURI CASINO BOATS APPEAR TO BE SAFE IN MOATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boats will stay in their moats.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri voters, by a comfortable 56 percent to 44 percent tally
Tuesday, approved Amendment 9 that retroactively legalizes games of
chance aboard 10 of the state's 15 riverboat casinos that operate
from off-river, man-made ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard to get the vote out,'' John Finamore, vice
president and general manager for Station Casino Kansas City, said
Tuesday. ``I think the fairness issue hit home with a lot of
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   It did with Cliff and Shirley Hedges, who said they drive to
Kansas City from Stover, Mo., about 10 times a year to visit
friends _ and the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave them a permit to build this place,'' Cliff Hedges
said Tuesday at the Flamingo Hilton Casino. ``It makes absolutely
no sense whatsoever to say they can't stay open.... It just doesn't
seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Taylor, a spokesman for the statewide anti-gambling group
Show Me the River Inc., said ``Missourians decided to bail out
these facilities, which have circumvented the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be a tight race. They turned it into a
referendum on jobs...they spent $10 million...45 percent of the
people said `No.' We're not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Gaming Commission was scheduled to meet at 9 a.m.
today to discuss the election returns and other matters, including
a proposal for the state's 16th casino in Ste. Genevieve.
</P>
<P>
   The results mean that voters have overturned last year's
Missouri Supreme Court ruling that declared illegal all off-river
slot machines and other games of chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission eventually is expected to cancel its
scheduled disciplinary hearings on the boats in moats issue that
could have resulted in orders to the affected casinos to unplug
their lucrative slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. casino gambling industry also was watching the Missouri
returns.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of expansion into 26 states, Missourians were the
first voters in the nation given an opportunity to de-legalize
their casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against
Legalized Gambling, said before the election that an anti-casino
vote in Missouri would likely embolden gambling foes to push for
similar rescission votes in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said early Tuesday evening that money was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The casino industry outspent its opponents $10 million to
$160,000 _ about a 100 to 1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said he likely wouldn't undertake another rescission battle
like Missouri's without a sizable war chest _ in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The churches (in Missouri) fought a good fight,'' Grey said.
``But $10 million to $200,000? If you've got the money you can get
your message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political establishment of Missouri has tolerated
gambling,'' Grey added. ``What they've got now is gambling embedded
in Missouri. It will be very, very difficult to root it out. It
will be difficult to contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats in moats came about as the industry sought a way to shed
itself of the inconvenience, expense and danger of actually
cruising the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission, the General Assembly and voters in 1994
all approved the general framework of rules and regulations that
allowed the casinos to move up to 1,000 feet inland, in large part
for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Supreme Court, however, ruled late last year that
the move inland was unconstitutional regarding games of chance,
including slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Games of skill such as blackjack and poker weren't affected
because of the peculiar wording of Missouri's constitutional
amendment authorizing riverboat gambling.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the Supreme Court ruling, the affected casinos
mounted a petition drive and put Amendment 9 on the ballot. For
those casinos _ including all but the Argosy Riverside Casino in
the Kansas City area _ the issue was a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Without income generated by slots, the industry said in the
campaign, affected boats would be forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I lose my job I can't just go out an find another one
tomorrow,'' said Ali Marz, a 24-year-old marketing department
employee at Station Casino Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The recent University of Missouri-Columbia graduate said she's
getting married next year and wants to ``put down roots'' in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown of the riverboats, however, probably would have sent
her back home to Reno, Nev., for work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the fourth time Missourians cast a vote on gambling.
But it was the first time they drew on four years of experience
with riverboat casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, voters legalized slot machine gambling with 53.8
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, voters were presented with a
bottom-line problem that forced them to decide whether $170 million
in annual casino taxes and 10,000 casino jobs were worth the price
of gambling addiction and the social and economic ills opponents
said it brings.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by Show Me the River, based in Ballwin, Mo., said
that the presence of casinos and troubled gamblers costs Missouri
communities millions of dollars each year in lost business and
brings more crime, welfare and bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The riverboat industry disputed the extent of those negative
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters did not believe the fiction of the anti-gaming
lobby that was meant to confuse the real facts,'' Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they tried to take the focus off the fairness issue
with all their rhetoric on the evils of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The casinos' main argument to voters was that the casinos
followed all the state's rules when they invested more than $1
billion to build their Missouri casinos. Then the Supreme Court
changed the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairness,'' said Duncan McKenzie, president of both the
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City and the Missouri Riverboat
Gaming Association. ``That's what this is about. We obtained all
the approvals before we proceeded to build this $110 million
facility and hire 838 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back to business as usual.''

CHANGE LONG OVERDUE AT NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Paul Bubb resigned on Tuesday, Cal State
Northridge pressured him to do so, and what a shame. I thought they
were made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge was an athletic program trying to be something it
wasn't _ popular, respectable, big-time. Bubb was a first-time
athletic director trying to be something he wasn't _ personable,
respected, professional.
</P>
<P>
   It was a match made in heaven, or in the Big Sky Conference,
anyway. And now, splitsville.
</P>
<P>
   Painful, these things, but all a part of growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what this brief episode is about, if university
president Blenda Wilson and the rest of the Northridge
administration learn the proper lessons from it.
</P>
<P>
   On its way to maturity, Northridge was bound to make mistakes,
and in retrospect the promotion of Bubb 2{ years ago was a big one.
Bubb was not an AD.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been the Monmouth College (Illinois) director of alumni and
parent relations and ``director of annual giving.'' In plainer
words, a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been the ``director of athletic development'' at Southern
Illinois and Drake universities. In plainer words, a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   And, in his early years at Northridge, he'd been the director of
athletic development and associate athletic director for external
affairs. In plainer words, a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   That's a nice resume for an athletic director if you're a
third-rate sports school that plays football on a glorified high
school field and basketball in a doghouse. But if you're
Northridge, aspiring to be a (begin ital)second(end ital)-rate
sports school, you have to do better.
</P>
<P>
   So this time, hire a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bad publicity that befell the Matadors in the past
two years could have been avoided or at least muted by an AD with
the experience, the wits and the political skill to handle a
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, 41, didn't have the support he needed from his superiors.
I mean, at a school like Northridge, where the coaches aren't
particularly in demand, the AD should not be paid less than the
basketball coach and his own chief assistant; he was.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb didn't have the respect he needed from his subordinates. At
an athletic-department retreat in June, coaches at the back of the
room were observed quietly mocking the AD as he addressed the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb seemed to be strangely uninvolved in some of the
department's most important projects, as when he seemed to learn
about the timetable for construction of a new softball diamond from
a recent Daily News article.
</P>
<P>
   And in his crucial role as the authoritative spokesman for the
athletic department, he was routinely evasive or worse, provoking a
suspicious press. Which led to his final, fatal failing, his lie to
reporters last week following the arrest of women's basketball
coach Michael Abraham on cocaine-distribution charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb said he never had an inkling about Abraham's involvement
with drugs. In fact, it turned out, some of Abraham's players
expressed concern to Bubb two years ago about the coach's behavior.
With misjudgments like that, little problems turn into big
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not the first time something like that has
happened on Bubb's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was suspended by the university after the
football coach was found to have covered up the shooting of a
player, saying the young man was out of action because of an
appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bubb, the Matadors' first reaction to any probing question
was to deny, even when there seemed to be no advantage in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the case last spring in which the athletic department's
attempts at secrecy about the investigation of academic cheating
against a women's volleyball player turned a one-day story into a
dragged-out embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   See, at Northridge, even the corruption is small-time.
</P>
<P>
   So this time, hire a professional.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a successful small-college AD, or a talented
administrator wasting away in a windowless office at a major sports
university, who's dying for a chance to run an athletic department
that has nowhere to go but up.

PRODUCTION DECLINES AS STUDIO GROWTH FLATTENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles County saw a sharp falloff in
production outside studio lots during the past two months as the
industry apparently took a breather from the heavy pace of recent
years, sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Activity by film crews shooting on local streets fell by 25.7
percent in September and 18.1 percent in October compared with the
year-ago periods. The drop was due largely to back-to-back plunges
of 41 percent and 44 percent in days of movie production, according
to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we're seeing is a flattening out of the activity
because we had so much growth so quickly in the last few years that
it could not keep up the same level,'' said Patti Stolkin
Archuletta, director of the California Film Commission. ``We're
also seeing Orange, Riverside and Ventura counties increasing
activity. And there's no question that low-cost production in
Canada is eroding our base.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent declines have pulled county production, which grew by
a supercharged 78 percent between 1994 and 1997, down by 5.6
percent for the first 10 months of this year to 37,953 production
days. Movie production is down 12.6 percent, commercials have
fallen by 6.8 percent and TV has slid 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Cluff, head of the EIDC, said he was not alarmed. ``I
certainly wish the numbers were better, but you have to remember
we're comparing the numbers to a record year that came at the end
of three years of expansion,'' he said. ``The industry sometimes
goes through these cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said he expected film production to pick up next year,
while TV will remain strong and commercials may continue to decline
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Archuletta said Canadian film commissions have become
particularly aggressive in pursuing Hollywood producers, especially
for movies of the week and commercials. ``Recent weaknesses in the
Canadian dollar, coupled with labor incentives offered to
California producers are making it incredibly cheap to film in
Canada,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Production on property owned by the state of California was up 2
percent through September after a 14 percent gain last year, while
days of filming for the first nine months of the year slid 2
percent after surging 26 percent last year. Archuletta said the
United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Mexico have been emulating
Canada's efforts to lure Hollywood producers.
</P>
<P>
   Debi Hausdorfer, managing director of the Orange County film
commission, said economic activity related to production is up 30
percent this year in the country while requests for permits have
doubled. ``We're seeing growth in all areas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Archuletta also said Ventura County's production has surged and
noted it may be close to formally creating a film commission. Jim
Thompson, head of the Real to Reel location services in Van Nuys,
said Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Piru have seen extensive
activity in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The figures from the EIDC, which issues permits for off-lot
location shoots, do not reflect production on studio lots. But two
of Hollywood's major studios _ Disney and Warner Bros. _ have
trimmed the number of releases from their schedules and other
studios have tried to put the brakes on spending for big-budget
projects.
</P>
<P>
   More modest spending translates to fewer production days.
Additionally, the pace of production may have been sped up
artificially late last year and early this year because of the
threat of a strike by actors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is no panic in Hollywood over a crash in production
activity. Thompson said activity is particularly strong in TV and
commercials, and he forecast that any slowdown will be over during
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of requests for warehouses with offices
in them in the (San Fernando) Valley that can be used for three to
six months,'' he said. ``We've already started to get work orders
for next year's feature films.''

ABL CONFIDENCE STILL HIGH DESPITE WNBA'S RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Still battling from their headquarters on opposite
coasts, the American Basketball League and the Women's National
Basketball Association are in overtime now.
</P>
<P>
   And the ABL, which opens its third season Friday when the
Seattle Reign visits the Colorado Xplosion, appears to be trailing
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were preaching last year that we had the better talent,''
said Brian Agler, coach of the ABL champion Columbus Quest. ``This
year we don't sign any of the top players. We got our butts kicked.
If we have another year like this one, we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL is not as financially fit as the WNBA, which plays a
summer season and performs one-handed push-ups largely because of
the infusion of cash from its sugar daddy, the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But the ABL keeps pushing its grass-roots movement, experiencing
measurable progress and believing that its way is the right way.
The ABL is functional, not glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the ABL signed eight of 10 college All-Americans,
including Kara Wolters (New England) and Kate Starbird (Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, this year's draft was a WNBA coup, the summer
league grabbing seven of the eight All-Americans who were seniors,
including Old Dominion's Ticha Penichiero and Stanford's Kristin
Folkl.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is even hitting on Agler, attempting to woo him like it
did one of his former players, Nikki McCray. After acquiring McCray
last year, the WNBA picked up ABL all-star Dawn Staley this year.
Marketing was the magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ABL offers better salaries and benefits on average,
it lags behind the WNBA in exposure, which for some of the best
players translates into endorsement opportunities and supplemental
income.
</P>
<P>
   There are similarities _ both leagues feature the world's top
women's basketball players and have two-time champions, the ABL's
Quest and WNBA's Houston Comets. Both are losing money but
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are many, oftentimes in areas where the ABL is
attempting to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the leagues compare:
</P>
<P>
   TV OR NOT TV
</P>
<P>
   With its NBA backing and leverage, the WNBA thrives, appearing
in your face on television, in person at big arenas. The ABL is the
person you meet but can't remember their name. The WNBA is
Hurricane Mitch, a force with leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a gun we can put to someone's temple,'' ABL
commissioner Gary Cavalli said. ``The WNBA does. There's a real
sense that there's a `You want Michael Jordan, you take Rebecca
Lobo too' type thing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA president Val Ackerman said the WNBA's success with its TV
contract is due to timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never entertained the thought of having a league in the
winter with all of the other sports,'' she said. ``We felt there
wasn't room for another league. We saw an opportunity in the summer
for live prime-time TV over the duration of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said that TV drives fan and sponsor interest. Last year
there were 40 nationally televised WNBA games and 60 on local TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsors like the window in the summer,'' Ackerman said. ``It
created another advertising vehicle for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the WNBA is tied in with NBC, ESPN and ABC, the ABL has
only CBS as a major network possibility. It landed a gig with CBS
but comics have longer routines. CBS will televise two games of the
ABL finals after negotiating a deal in which the ABL buys the air
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to do well with those two games,''
Cavalli said. ``We have to demonstrate we can get good ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL sugar-coats its take on this year's TV contracts. There
are 18 national games scheduled this season, counting playoffs,
down from 24 last year. But Cavalli notes that the games are
positioned for better distribution, shown live instead of on a
delay. Three will be shown on holidays _ Thanksgiving, Christmas
and New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   To this point, there are no regional games scheduled on Fox
affiliates such as Fox Sports Northwest. Cavalli hopes that will
change when Fox seeks alternative programming because of the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The TV situation is an ABL concern. WNBA games are beamed across
the country twice weekly on ESPN and NBC. Exposure turns into name
and product recognition. The ABL does not want to become the
Alternate Basketball League. Corporate America is wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to attract national sponsors, and that is directly
tied to a national TV package,'' said Jim Weyermann, the ABL's
chief operating officer and former general manager of the Reign.
</P>
<P>
   THROW ME A LIFELINE
</P>
<P>
   In the ABL offices, team operating rights are known as TORs. It
is another acronym for SOS. This could be considered an ABL
distress signal.
</P>
<P>
   A team operator keeps all local revenue but pays an annual
assessment to the league to help cover ABL expenses. It's a way in
which the ABL can raise capital while strengthening franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion is that if you put the right operators together and
give them all of the local revenue streams, then they're going to
invest more in the team than the league can,'' Weyermann said.
</P>
<P>
   The operating rights to Portland and San Jose have been sold for
$1.5 million each. An announcement regarding another team is
expected within a week. Seattle could soon follow as the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups _ one from Seattle, another from Tacoma and a third
from California _ are jockeying to buy operating rights for the
Reign. A deal involving Seattle city councilwoman Tina Podlodowski
fell through last year.
</P>
<P>
   But now the operating rights price tag has dropped from $4.5
million because the package no longer includes equity in the
league. That has rekindled the Seattle group's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is a real diamond in the rough,'' Weyermann said.
``Not many people understand its potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Reign fielded the second-worst team in the league
last year, it nonetheless was the second-most-profitable franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli plans to meet with at least one group on Monday after
attending the Reign's home opener against San Jose Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the answer for the ABL,'' Cavalli said.
</P>
<P>
   RISING ATTENDANCE
</P>
<P>
   Growth in both leagues has been phenomenal, particularly in the
WNBA, where even Cavalli admits the attendance figures are
impressive. The WNBA averaged 10,729 fans to the ABL's 4,333.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., where the expansion Mystics were 3-27, an
average of 15,898 went to 15 games at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington symbolized what we were able to achieve in terms of
reaching out to a new audience and tapping into fan-readiness,''
Ackerman said. ``It's not just about basketball, it's part of a
show. What fans enjoy most is the enthusiasm of the players. The
players are so available. You can reach out and touch them, and
they touch back. It's an antidote for what fans see in other
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance was up 11 percent in the WNBA, 23 percent in the ABL.
ABL ticket sales are up 30 percent this year. Cavalli has a goal of
5,500 fans per game this season, which is unattainable in Seattle.
One game will be played at 17,072-seat KeyArena, the other 22 at
4,509-seat Mercer Arena. The Reign averaged 3,321 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL is starting its season two weeks later this year to
avoid a conflict with the World Series, hoping to boost attendance.
The NBA lockout should also help.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THE WORD OUT
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the value of advertising, the ABL reduced
front-office salaries by 10 percent and used some of the savings to
beef up its advertising budget to $5 million. In the first year,
the budget was $1.6 million, and last year $2.6 million. In
comparison, the WNBA budget has been estimated to be $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   A four-page insert is running this week in USA Today. Cavalli
said other ads will appear in glossy magazines. A TV campaign
criticizing the NBA lockout and promoting the freshness of the ABL
is up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are basically designed to remind people that while
the NBA isn't playing, there's still a great alternative,'' Cavalli
said. ``We don't have players choking coaches. We don't have
players on strike. We have players who love their fans.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   The ABL still promises better average salaries than the WNBA _
$80,000 to $35,000. It offers basketball during the ``real'' season
_ fall and winter. It has year-round health benefits, 401k plans
and stock options. It lets the players be involved, recently naming
Philadelphia's Teresa Edwards to its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put it on paper, face value for what each player gets,
the benefits are tremendous,'' Edwards said. ``We believe in the
ABL. We had an original concept. ... The goals are still out there
to be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the ABL does not have pompons and fanfare. In many
ways, the blue-collars can't match up with the white-collars,
trailing in exposure and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   A week after joining the WNBA, McCray signed a million-dollar
endorsement deal with Fila. Staley said her decision to leave the
ABL was based on health reasons, that her knees will hold up longer
playing a shorter 32-game WNBA schedule than 44 in the ABL.
Undoubtedly, however, a player with Staley's pizazz will garner
additional income in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli acknowledges the loss of McCray and Staley but said the
ABL has managed to re-sign 81 of the 85 players whose contracts
have expired in the past two years. Cavalli has not engaged in a
bidding war for WNBA players because he doesn't want to jumble the
ABL salary scale.
</P>
<P>
   A looming key confronts both leagues next year when Chamique
Holdsclaw of Tennessee, the most prominent college player of the
decade, is eligible for pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ABL's interest in expanding to New York City is that
it is Holdsclaw's hometown. The ABL is also looking at Dallas, St.
Louis, Kansas City, Baltimore and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA already has a franchise in New York, and Ackerman said
the league would someday like a franchise in every NBA city, which
includes Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Two professional women's basketball teams in Seattle? Not
likely. But for now, both leagues are surviving, if not thriving.
The WNBA reportedly lost $7 million last year but dropped
considerably less this season.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL has gone from a $5 million loss in 1996-97 to $3 million
last year. Cavalli estimated that the ABL will lose just under $1
million or break even this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely will be profitable in year five,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA is also on an upward cycle, increasing its schedule
from 30 games to 32 and adding 1999 expansion teams in Minnesota
and Orlando. The league also will hold its first All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA and ABL continue to co-exist, roommates who are staying
out of each other's way and actually profiting from the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got kids who are playing more basketball than ever
before ... simply because they can say, `Not only can I go to
college now and get a scholarship and play in front of big crowds
and compete at the NCAA championship level, but down the road I can
make money and play against great players in big-time arenas,'''
University of Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma told the Star-Tribune
of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL hopes that its mistakes are in the past, that the new
franchises in Chicago and Nashville will be more successful than
the one in Long Beach, which was disbanded after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like any other 3-year-old company,'' Weyermann said.
``We've got a lot of guts and inspiration, but we're
undercapitalized and undermanned. We're constantly up against the
wall in the allocation of resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the league is undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you give me an obstacle, I'll have to find a way to
knock it down or go around it,'' Edwards said. ``You know, until
it's drop-dead gone, I don't see any reason to stop.''

GOP KEEPS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL BUT SUFFERS EMBARRASSING LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New 11th graf with gay House member elected.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans kept control of Congress in the Tuesday
elections but faced an embarrassing loss of House seats and the
failure to achieve big gains in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats knocked off two incumbent senators, including a
breath-taking victory in New York where Rep. Charles E. Schumer
defeated Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato in a bitter, expensive
race that saw the candidates spend a total of about $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also scored a major upset in North Carolina where
challenger John Edwards defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a first-term
Republican conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans currently hold a 55 to 45 majority
over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Republicans have a 22 vote margin over the
Democrats, 228 to 206. CNN projected that Republicans were likely
to lose three seats, cutting their margin to 19. The anemic
Republican showing raised questions about House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's job security.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said it would be ``astounding'' if House Republicans
actually lost seats. Tony Blankley, Gingrich's former press
secretary, predicted recriminations against the House leadership as
a result of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told ABC News that he doesn't see any challengers for
his job and argued that his House Republican leadership team was
the only such team that has been reelected since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In the gender category, the ranks of Democratic women remained
constant in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer defeated Republican
challenger Matt Fong. In Washington state, self-proclaimed
``mom-in-tennis-shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray swatted away a challenge
by Republican Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, who was also elected in the 1992 Year
of the Woman and has been caught up in scandals ever since, lost
her seat to state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald. Democrat Blanche Lincoln,
a former House member, won the open Senate seat created by the
retirement of Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of openly gay House members grew from two to three
when Democratic lawyer Tammy Baldwin, an outspoken lesbian and
former Wisconsin state representative, was elected to the seat
vacated by Republican Rep. Scott Klug.
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched Senate race, Democratic Sen. Ernest M.
Hollings eked out victory for a sixth-term over Republican
challenger Rep. Bob Inglis, a three-term conservative House member.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana also nabbed the seat
vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coates.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely predicted victory for Republicans, GOP Gov. George
Voinovich claimed the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. John
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats actually gain House seats, it would be an historic
reversal. The party controlling the White House customarily faces
an uphill battle in mid-term elections. Since 1918, the party
holding the White House has suffered an average loss of 27 seats in
the House and six seats in the Senate in mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the president's party did not lose seats was in
1934, just as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was
launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee had predicted a gain of 10 to 15 House
seats for the GOP. His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, forecast that Democrats would pick up seats in the House,
but questioned whether they would get the 11 seats they need to get
back into the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer, the general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the Democrats' strong showing was a message to
Republicans that they should quickly wrap up their impeachment
proceedings and ``get back to business'' because voters don't think
President Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky warrants his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
strong showing by Democratic candidates in the House ``really means
people are saying let's get back to the kitchen-table issues
everybody cares about'' and finish up the impeachment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight the people are saying to do it fairly but do
it quickly,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College, said the election was not a referendum on the Lewinsky
scandal, but rather was indicative of other factors such as a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent stock market turmoil, the U.S. economy continues
to show surprising perkiness. The gross domestic product grew at a
stronger-than-expected 3.3 percent rate in the third quarter,
interest rates are low and unemployment hovers at a low 4.6
percent. Inflation has been almost invisible at less than 2
percent.

COACHING DUO WEDDED TO THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ One morning this past summer, Mike Daugherty woke up
at 4 a.m. He was in a Colorado Springs hotel room, in the middle of
a recruiting trip. A bolt of inspiration had struck him.
</P>
<P>
   He had it _ an offensive scheme that the University of
Washington women's basketball team could use to pour on the scoring
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty scribbled it down on hotel stationery, all the fine
points about this up-tempo, motion offense. And after the sun rose,
he knew he better call the head coach, who also happens to be his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an early riser, so I knew he was into it,'' June
Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the Huskies' head coach can trust this particular
assistant coach with stuff as important as her team's offense _ no
small matter, considering one tiny but significant flaw in Mike
Daugherty's resume:
</P>
<P>
   He never saw his wife play basketball. Not once. Never.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mike and June met on the basketball court at Ohio
State, and even though she knows just how good he was, Mike
neglected to attend any of June's games, even though she twice led
the Buckeyes to Big Ten championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the men always had prime-time practice sessions,
then they would just wait around for their dinners to be brought to
them or something, so they would be around us and we all got
along,'' June said, staring a hole through her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, heck no, he never came to see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Mike said, laughing sheepishly. ``It's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, somewhere over the 10 years the Daughertys have worked
together as head coach and assistant (seven years at Boise State
before getting the call three years ago from Washington), June has
managed to forgive her husband for this transgression, though she
seems intent to never let him forget.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in addition to their marriage, their 4-year-old twins
and the other ties that bind, Mike and June share basketball
bloodlines. They talk the same language.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, when the couple met at Ohio State, June was an
All-American forward and Mike was a defensive standout at guard.
And both had their solid basketball foundations laid in Columbus,
thanks to the legendary Fred Taylor, a coach who influenced a
basketball generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that Fred Taylor did was he broke the game down into
fundamentals and did a great job of getting the game into the
triple threat; how to get your feet moving defensively,'' June
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those things are lost in the game as we become more
athletic. We see that in both the men's and women's game, the best
players are still the ones who can execute the fundamentals. That's
why Michael Jordan is so phenomenal, besides being such an
incredible athlete. He played for a coach who stressed
fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's basketball acolytes include none other than Indiana's
Bobby Knight, who in turn has inspired the offspring of some great
college coaches, including Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Stanford's
Tara Vanderveer.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderveer and June Daugherty met during one of Taylor's camps,
which helps explain how Daugherty served as a Stanford assistant
for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Taylor's legacy has made its way to the Husky women's
program, thanks to Mike Daugherty's predawn vision of a five-man
motion offense.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why the Huskies are able to employ this kind
of offense is that June Daugherty and her staff have finally
recruited enough players with the skill to make this system work.
Daugherty has waited three years for this day, for this kind of
Husky team to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the kinds of players who are successful in the ABL and
WNBA. They are the versatile, 6-foot-2 types who can play a variety
of spots on the floor,'' Daugherty said, adding that those are the
types of athletes she is recruiting to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Once a defensive-minded program under Chris Gobrecht, Washington
is on the verge of a breakout season. Expect a cascade of
3-pointers and 90-point games out of Hec Ed this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can be anywhere on the floor,'' Mike Daugherty
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, you knew where to find everyone on the floor, but
this time, it's going to be different. This is a five-man motion
game out of two-guard set. Everyone is going to touch the ball.
It's about back picks and down screens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Passing and ball-handling will be the key to success.
Penetrating on the dribble, drawing the double-teams and then
finding the open player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't that radical. Everything in basketball has been
done before, but it's how you put it together,'' Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is not the first time Mike's had a
middle-of-the-night brainstorm. He's been the offensive
coordinator. He watches a lot of teams, a lot of games,'' June
said.
</P>
<P>
   And with such a basketball-heavy lifestyle, it is indeed
difficult for this couple to enjoy Saturday night dinner dates or
trips to the movie theater. Luckily, the Daughertys have grown used
to the dynamics of their basketball partnership, especially since
basketball is how they met and how their marriage came about in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   After Ohio State, Mike went to South America, where he played
professionally in Brazil and Argentina. June, meanwhile, played for
several teams in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my second year of playing pro ball, Mike was running
these road races. One of my friends ran into him at a 5K and she
started talking to him. She always thought we would make a good
couple, so she gave him my number,'' June said.
</P>
<P>
   They met and hung out that summer in Columbus, but soon Mike was
off to Brazil and June went back to France. And they became pen
pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't real serious, seeing other people,'' Mike said.
``But then things went to hell in Argentina. The Falklands. The
dollar went out the window, so I came home and June said, `why
don't you just come with me to Europe,' so I went and met her
there. And that's probably where it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' June said, rolling her eyes. ``He's being shy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a train tour. Bought a Eurail pass,'' Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of paychecks. Saw several countries. He came
over right at the end of the season,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still had never seen her play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still hasn't seen me play,'' June said. ``And he's older. Put
that in there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The joking was good-natured, but serious. It is similar to the
coaching mindset over there at Montlake.

GOP KEEPS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL BUT SUFFERS EMBARRASSING LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New 11th graf with gay House member elected.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans kept control of Congress in the Tuesday
elections but faced an embarrassing loss of House seats and the
failure to achieve big gains in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats knocked off two incumbent senators, including a
breath-taking victory in New York where Rep. Charles E. Schumer
defeated Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato in a bitter, expensive
race that saw the candidates spend a total of about $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also scored a major upset in North Carolina where
challenger John Edwards defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a first-term
Republican conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans currently hold a 55 to 45 majority
over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Republicans have a 22 vote margin over the
Democrats, 228 to 206. CNN projected that Republicans were likely
to lose three seats, cutting their margin to 19. The anemic
Republican showing raised questions about House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's job security.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said it would be ``astounding'' if House Republicans
actually lost seats. Tony Blankley, Gingrich's former press
secretary, predicted recriminations against the House leadership as
a result of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told ABC News that he doesn't see any challengers for
his job and argued that his House Republican leadership team was
the only such team that has been reelected since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In the gender category, the ranks of Democratic women remained
constant in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer defeated Republican
challenger Matt Fong. In Washington state, self-proclaimed
``mom-in-tennis-shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray swatted away a challenge
by Republican Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, who was also elected in the 1992 Year
of the Woman and has been caught up in scandals ever since, lost
her seat to state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald. Democrat Blanche Lincoln,
a former House member, won the open Senate seat created by the
retirement of Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of openly gay House members grew from two to three
when Democratic lawyer Tammy Baldwin, an outspoken lesbian and
former Wisconsin state representative, was elected to the seat
vacated by Republican Rep. Scott Klug.
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched Senate race, Democratic Sen. Ernest M.
Hollings eked out victory for a sixth-term over Republican
challenger Rep. Bob Inglis, a three-term conservative House member.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana also nabbed the seat
vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coates.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely predicted victory for Republicans, GOP Gov. George
Voinovich claimed the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. John
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats actually gain House seats, it would be an historic
reversal. The party controlling the White House customarily faces
an uphill battle in mid-term elections. Since 1918, the party
holding the White House has suffered an average loss of 27 seats in
the House and six seats in the Senate in mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the president's party did not lose seats was in
1934, just as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was
launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee had predicted a gain of 10 to 15 House
seats for the GOP. His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, forecast that Democrats would pick up seats in the House,
but questioned whether they would get the 11 seats they need to get
back into the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer, the general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the Democrats' strong showing was a message to
Republicans that they should quickly wrap up their impeachment
proceedings and ``get back to business'' because voters don't think
President Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky warrants his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
strong showing by Democratic candidates in the House ``really means
people are saying let's get back to the kitchen-table issues
everybody cares about'' and finish up the impeachment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight the people are saying to do it fairly but do
it quickly,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College, said the election was not a referendum on the Lewinsky
scandal, but rather was indicative of other factors such as a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent stock market turmoil, the U.S. economy continues
to show surprising perkiness. The gross domestic product grew at a
stronger-than-expected 3.3 percent rate in the third quarter,
interest rates are low and unemployment hovers at a low 4.6
percent. Inflation has been almost invisible at less than 2
percent.

OREGON QUARTERBACK LIFTS MENTAL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Akili, your move.
</P>
<P>
   To make him one of the elite football players of the Pacific-10
Conference, Oregon could have exhorted, cajoled or pestered its
sleek, multi-dimensional quarterback to fling more than his share
of passes throughout the offseason months. The Ducks could have
asked him to lift weights excessively, watch film obsessively.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they pulled out a checkerboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went, wow, what the heck is going on?'' Akili Smith recalls
in his deep, jagged voice. ``But after we got going with it,
everything was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   King me.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend in Eugene, the Washington Huskies will try to keep
from getting backed into a corner and doubled up by the 6-foot-3,
220-pound San Diego native. Smith beat them a year ago, almost
single-handedly, throwing three touchdown passes in a 31-28
decision at Husky Stadium, including the game-winner in the closing
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was the raw, instinctive Smith at the controls. Now he is
the devious, calculating Smith, a more complete player whose blend
of physical skills and ever-increasing football smarts have the
pros paying close attention and had the 6-2 Ducks on the threshold
of a magical season before a slew of injuries took their toll in
last weekend's 38-3 loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is checkers, according to Smith. Three times a
week, new offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford pulled them out. Red
was offense, black defense. This piece was a free safety, that one
a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The best teachers find ways to get the message across. Other
coaches prefer to use a chalkboard or overhead monitor. Checkers
put Tedford and Smith on the same play-calling page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want this to sound racial, but when you're from the
inner city, sometimes kids need a visual demonstration instead of
straight talk,'' Smith's father, Ray, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that with all the quarterbacks; it's just a simple way,
a very visual way,'' Oregon coach Mike Bellotti intoned.
</P>
<P>
   Said Akili Smith: ``I'm just so much more mentally prepared,
it's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Results are there. The Duck quarterback has been among the NCAA
leaders in passing efficiency all season (he's seventh now, at
159.9). His 62-yard scoring dash on a fourth-quarter option play
sent USC to a 17-13 defeat. His last-second touchdown pass forced
overtime in an eventual 41-38 loss to league leader UCLA. He threw
four first-half TD spirals in a 48-14 win over Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford coach Ty Willingham has called Smith the best
quarterback in the Pac-10, heady praise considering that Cade
McNown and Brock Huard also fill the position. Arizona coach Dick
Tomey says Smith is the league's most versatile signal-caller since
Mark Brunell ran and passed Washington to three Rose Bowls. School
publicists have been pushing him for the Heisman Trophy, an Oregon
first.
</P>
<P>
   Some skepticism over Smith persists. Joel Buchsbaum, a
Brooklyn-based NFL draft analyst for Pro Football Weekly, projects
Smith as a second-tier quarterback prospect, behind Kentucky's Tim
Couch, Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper and Syracuse's Donovan
McNabb. Translated, that means the Oregon player is a probable
second-rounder come next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very athletic and big and fast, but he's not Tim Couch as
a passer,'' Buchsbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. The most celebrated Oregon quarterback in
school history, for instance. Dan Fouts views Smith as a wise
long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be a great pro,'' said Fouts, a Pro Football
Hall of Famer who played 15 seasons for the San Diego Chargers. ``I
don't think right away. Maybe give him two or three years. Let him
develop behind someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouts, who works as an ABC-TV college football analyst and makes
his home in Sisters, Ore., has no problem with Smith's arm
strength. He sees refinement needed only in the touch passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start with a strong arm, and he does have that,'' Fouts
said. ``He struggles with the short passes, and sometimes that's
real glaring. But you take his throwing motion and it's as pure as
can be. He holds the ball high and, unlike other quarterbacks, when
he throws, his arm never goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a catcher's throw to second _ it's a real
beautiful delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Smith used to throw out runners for San
Diego's Lincoln High School. He was good enough as a catcher to get
drafted in the seventh round by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1993,
sign for $125,000 and spend three years trying to make it as a pro
baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, the Pirates moved Smith to the outfield. In three
seasons of Rookie and A ball, he hit .200, .174 and .125.
Understandably, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a qualifying SAT score helped Smith pick baseball
over a football scholarship from hometown San Diego State. The cash
didn't hurt either. He bought a 1995 Honda Accord, which he still
drives, and gave funds to his family, which paid for a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all along coming out of high school, I was a football
player,'' Smith said. ``To be quite frank, I took the money and
gave baseball a shot. It was a tough sport, a mental sport. I don't
think I was strong enough mentally to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father encouraged him to pursue baseball, for very personal
reasons. Ray Smith was a first baseman at the same Lincoln High who
was drafted by the California Angels in 1973. He lost his dreams in
an unsettling way, spending 3{ years in prison on a robbery charge.
</P>
<P>
   Revitalizing his football career and turning down an offer by
the San Diego Padres, Akili Smith turned to Grossmont College, a
two-year school south of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was rusty and sat out the first three games his first
year. He didn't have a grasp for the offense. He struggled. But he
was determined to play football and got some momentum going when he
won a game with a last-play, 40-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys would have quit,'' Grossmont coach Dave Jordan
said. ``He hung in there. It wasn't pretty. I was shaking whenever
he took a snap. But he knew when he got his chance, he would do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   By his second year, Smith had settled in. He threw for 32
touchdowns and 3,212 yards, and was a first-team JC All-America
selection. Suddenly, he was a hot commodity. Intent on playing in
the Pac-10 and angering locals, he chose Oregon over San Diego
State, as well as California, Michigan State and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once with the Ducks, Smith split time as a junior with Jason
Maas, starting seven games, then beat him out this fall. In
between, Smith got caught up in a couple of highly publicized
incidents; he was arrested for a tavern fight with bouncers and
cited for allegedly driving while intoxicated. He was acquitted of
assault charges in the first instance. And, though several
breathalyzer tests showed him under the legal limit for the driving
offense, he avoided prosecution in the other by agreeing to take an
alcohol diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   Smith publicly admitted to making bad choices. He served a
seven-month team suspension, took the diversion class and assured
Bellotti he would demonstrate better leadership qualities. Still,
he was surprised that his reputation suddenly had become a hot
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was targeted a little bit, but it's OK,'' the
quarterback said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up idolizing Randall Cunningham and John Elway when
they were nimble and daring. Now he is attempting to join them in
the NFL before they retreat into retirement. Another win over
Washington would help push him in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't forgotten the feeling he took away from Husky Stadium,
a place that has entertained a lot of future pro quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a definitely a coming-out party for me,'' Smith said.
``I was really relaxed. That game just really settled me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Oregon continues to push him for the Heisman, which he
doesn't think he'll win. His choice is Texas running back Ricky
Williams, another San Diego product and a good friend. Smith just
wants a trip to New York, to rub elbows with the other great ones.
</P>
<P>
   King me.

CHALLENGER AHEAD IN RACE WITH DEAD INCUMBENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lee Baca took an early lead over the late Sherman
Block in Tuesday's balloting for sheriff of Los Angeles County,
less than a week after Block died while running for a fifth
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Block's supporters insisted on carrying on the campaign through
Election Day, in spite of his death Thursday from a brain
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   For voters, it was a choice between Baca, 56, or voting for
Block with the knowledge that if he won, by law, the county Board
of Supervisors would select a successor as sheriff to fill the
position until the November 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   If early indications prevail, Baca, a former regional chief in
the Sheriff's Department, would be sworn in Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Before Block's death, the election was expected to be a
referendum on his four-term leadership of the 13,000-employee
department, which operates the largest jail system in the nation
and provides law enforcement services to 40 cities and the county's
unincorporated area. After his death, it turned into a vote on
public confidence in the surviving candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Baca was in the top echelon of department leaders in June when
he and two other hopefuls ran against Block in the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   Block finished the primary in first place with 36 percent of the
vote, but Baca trailed him by only 4 percentage points and forced
the sheriff into the first runoff of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   For Block, who had been sheriff since 1982, it suddenly became
the most critical campaign of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Long a popular public official and never seriously threatened
for his job, Block went out on the campaign trail in the runoff and
faced questions about inefficiency in his department, mistaken
releases of prisoners and other management criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The event that turned out to be the final campaign debate of
Block's nearly 17-year career occurred in Studio City on Oct. 23 as
the two men faced each other at a forum of the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Block, 74, fell at his West Hills home and hit his
head, requiring 10 stitches and hospitalization for dizziness and
disorientation, followed by surgery to remove a blood clot in his
brain. He died only days later, still in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Before losing consciousness, Block asked his supporters not to
give up the political battle regardless of what happened to him,
according to his campaign leaders. As the runoff campaign
lengthened, Block increasingly had questioned Baca's integrity,
ethics and leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
   Baca resigned from the department shortly after the primary,
saying it would enable him to campaign full time. Afterward, Block
openly questioned the job performance of his onetime subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent issue for Baca's campaign, during the primary
and most of the runoff battle, was Block's age and health. The
sheriff had been undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week
after twice defeating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the race, however, Baca began criticizing his former
mentor's management, particularly of the jails.
</P>
<P>
   Until stricken Oct. 24, Block insisted he was in good health
despite his age and the dialysis treatments. He said he was still
the best man for the job of reducing crime, still the one most
likely to reduce his constituents' fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Baca cast himself as a man with the energy, vision and hands-on
management style needed to steer the department into a new era.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was hindered by allegations that he had offered
Block a deal to quit the race, including the title of sheriff
emeritus with a staff car and driver as well as continued official
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baca insisted the offer was not meant as a shady deal, but
rather as an effort to keep Block in the department while avoiding
a bitter race that could divide the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department has a $1.25 billion budget and 13,000
employees, including about 8,000 deputies. It serves 2.5 million
people in the unincorporated portions of the county and in 40
cities that contract with the department for law enforcement
services. The sheriff also runs the county's vast jail system,
America's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Block won the endorsement of unions representing the
rank-and-file deputies as well as the sergeants and lieutenants.
Also backing him were many of the region's political heavyweights,
including all five county supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years in the department, Baca rose through the
ranks to division chief in charge of six stations and the anti-gang
bureau. He has a doctorate in public administration from the
University of Southern California.

DEMOCRAT DAVIS WINS CALIFORNIA GOVERNORSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breaking a 16-year Republican grip on the
California Governor's Office, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis swept to an easy
victory on Tuesday over Attorney General Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the culmination of a more than 20-year dream for
Davis, who began his political career as chief of staff to former
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and had to overcome long odds to win his
party's nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   A beaming Davis declared victory shortly after 10 p.m., pledging
to take ``a moderate path to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this great victory tonight is more than just electing a
candidate for governor,''Davis said. ``It is a clear affirmation
that Californians want to take a moderate path to the future. That
is how I ran and that is how I will govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a governor for all the people of the state. I pledge
to you the issue of wedge politics of divisive issues are behind
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said his first priority will be changing the state's
education system. ``We must challenge the orthodoxy and find a new
way of doing business in our schools because nothing less than the
future of our kids is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren conceded shortly after Davis' speech, offering his
congratulations to his opponent for his ``tremendous achievement''
in winning election.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Davis remained focused on trying to build a
broad-based centrist coalition of support throughout the state on
issues ranging from the environment to education.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic tide appeared to be stunning in its scope
Tuesday. Sen. Barbara Boxer and Democratic candidates for
lieutenant governor, controller, treasurer and superintendent of
public instruction also were winning.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' strong showing was particularly sweet for the White House
and the Democratic National Committee, which contributed time and
money toward his victory in a state that is seen as critical to the
nation's political future.
</P>
<P>
   In Davis and Lungren, California voters had the choice between
two well-seasoned politicians who waged relatively low-key
campaigns compared with past gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes were high for both parties as Davis worked to
break the GOP's 16-year lock on the executive office. With the
state's economy booming, Democrats are looking to fund programs
that have been held up either by Gov. Pete Wilson or his
predecessor and fellow Republican George Deukmejian.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the governor makes hundreds of appointments to the
judicial bench, state agencies and commissions. Even more important
will be the next governor's influence over reapportionment _
drawing new political boundaries after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates spent great amounts of money _ estimated
at $60million for both the primary and general elections _ to get
their message to voters, the campaign was marked more by the
absence of sharp personal attacks or any overriding issues such as
in past campaigns involving immigration or affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it became a battle for the middle ground, with Lungren
saying Davis is too liberal to lead the state as Davis called
Lungren more conservative than House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 52, won a tough fight to secure the Democratic
nomination. In the primary, he successfully battled two
multimillionaires _ Beverly Hills businessman Al Checchi and U.S.
Rep. Jane Harman of Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   But the work he needed to accomplish in that primary _ by
organizing labor unions and other longtime supporters _ helped him
in the days leading up to Tuesday's election by giving him a lead
in public opinion polls. Also, surveys indicated a backlash of
voters upset with Republicans over the attention paid to President
Clinton and his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren tried to use the Lewinsky affair during the early part
of the campaign when he raised character as an issue for political
leaders. He later dropped that from his commercials and as an
issue, even as he said he believed Clinton should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lungren emphasized the law enforcement credentials
gained in his eight years as attorney general, turning to other
issues such as education in the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, in contrast, ran a campaign that told of his support for
tough criminal laws, but also dealt with education _ a top concern
of voters, according to opinion polling _ as well as abortion, the
economy and the environment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lungren, 52, is a lifelong Republican who was born and raised in
Long Beach, the son of the physician to former President Nixon. His
earliest political memories are as a youngster walking precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Exempted from military service during the Vietnam War because of
a knee injury from playing football, Lungren is a graduate of the
University of Notre Dame and Georgetown Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   After one unsuccessful attempt for Congress in 1976, Lungren
went on to serve in the House for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   His political mentor, Deukmejian, tried to appoint him as state
treasurer in 1988. Blocked by two votes in the state Senate,
Lungren went on in 1990 to win the job of attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general, he generally kept a low profile, but also
took credit for a dramatic drop in crime in the state over the past
five years _ a drop that also has occurred across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a graduate of Stanford University and Columbia University
Law School, served in the Army in Vietnam, rising to the rank of
captain and receiving the Bronze Star, a medal awarded for
meritorious service in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' political roots go back to the early 1970s as a
fund-raiser for various Westside groups, where he came to the
attention of Brown, who was running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown's victory, Davis became his chief of staff and now
takes credit for helping Brown change the face of state government
through the hiring and appointment of more women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Davis left Brown's staff to run for an open Assembly seat in
West Los Angeles and used that position to run for state
controller, a post he held for two terms before winning the job of
lieutenant governor in 1994. &QL;

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
THEY are eight games into a schedule that has been about as
difficult a test as trying to the read the top line on an eye
chart.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And what we know about the Cowboys is they can at least squint
and make out the big ``E'' when it's staring them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through his first season as head coach, Chan Gailey is
still feeling his way along. He has introduced new offensive sets _
i.e., five wide receivers _ and is trying to find a way to get
Chris Warren into the regular mix at running back.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have an offensive line that, while not back to
dominating, is at least doing the job. A rejuvenated Emmitt Smith
has run for 709 yards and showed with that fourth-quarter burst
into the end zone Monday night that he still can make those slick
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin finally came off the missing-in-action list by
catching his first TD pass of the season. Troy Aikman came off the
shelf and, though skittish in the pocket, showed few ill throwing
effects from that broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Leon Lett appears in the best shape of the past
couple of years, pursuing the football all over the field. And
Deion Sanders, when he's not taking punts all the way to the end
zone as a Most Valuable Player candidate, blankets his portion of
the secondary even as Kevin Smith and Omar Stoutmire are
victimized.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds up to one thing: Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably depends on who you ask, to be honest,'' Aikman
said. ``Personally, I think it would be a little out of place for
me or anybody else in our locker room to be talking about the Super
Bowl when last year we went 6-10 and didn't make the playoffs. I
think that might be a little presumptuous on all of our parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumptuous. Strange. Shocking, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But why not Dallas? Somebody has to represent the dog-ugly NFC
in Miami, and the Cowboys get a leg up on the competition with a
chance to fatten up like hungry vultures on the carrion that is the
NFC East. They have been through each of their divisional foes once
over the first half of the season and have devoured them for four
wins to pad their 5-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the second half of this cupcake schedule brings the Giants,
Redskins and Eagles to Texas Stadium with only a trip to the
Arizona desert presenting the slightest challenge to an 8-0 run of
the division table. After all these years of playing in the NFL's
most rugged neighborhood, the Cowboys _ even at less than optimum _
finally are benefiting from living on the kind of pushover block
that has kept the 49ers near the top of the heap for most of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, examine the rest of the schedule, where the Thanksgiving
Day meeting with the Vikings (7-1) is the Cowboys' only game
against a team with a record above .500. Kansas City, Seattle and
New Orleans are 4-4, and each has its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that as things stand _ having survived their
five-game stretch when Jason Garrett filled in for the injured
Aikman _ the Cowboys have virtually wrapped up the NFC East title
and are just one game behind the 49ers (6-2) in the race for
securing a first-round playoff bye and a second-round home game.
</P>
<P>
   But if all they accomplish between now and January is to take
the NFC East, it would send Dallas _ as the third-best division
winner _ into the wild-card round of the playoffs with the
home-field advantage, where they certainly could win that game.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, say it sends the Cowboys into a
second-round date at Minnesota. Is that really an impossible
situation? Will the reborn Randall Cunningham still be hotter than
a blowtorch by January? Will there be a real quarterback
controversy with Brad Johnson by then? Will Dennis Green, as usual,
eventually find a way to screw up this team?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Cowboys _ with a healthy Aikman, Irvin and Smith, with
Deion cutting a rug on special teams, with Gailey calling the shots
instead of Barry Switzer _ win one meaningful road game? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Under that same scenario, Green Bay would enter the playoffs as
a wild-card team, weaker than in the recent past but dangerous with
Brett Favre in control. Could the Packers go into San Francisco and
beat the 49ers? Why not? They always do.
</P>
<P>
   Which would bring the Cheeseheads and the NFC Championship Game
to Texas Stadium, and we know how that story turns out every time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys in the Super Bowl. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask me how they'll beat the Broncos. We're talking
long shots here, not miracles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Free-agent third baseman Ken Caminiti hopes to decide on a new
team as early as this weekend, and it would suit him just fine if
the new team were his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, who started for the National League champion San Diego
Padres, said Tuesday, ``I'd definitely like to come back'' to
finish his career where it began _ in Houston. But the 35-year-old
switch hitter said several teams have expressed interest, and he
wants to take the next few days to sort things out with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have exclusive negotiating rights with Caminiti
through Thursday, but after that the Astros _ among other teams _
can make an offer if they choose to do so. Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker has inquired about Caminiti through the player's
agent, Tommy Tanzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is going to get first choice,'' said Caminiti, who
resides in Richmond. ``She's probably not going to want me to be
too far away from home. I'd like to get this done as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A weekend agreement might be a bit soon for the Astros, who have
tabbed re-signing Randy Johnson as their top priority. Caminiti,
the NL's Most Valuable Player in 1996, made $3.5 million with the
Padres last season, but it's uncertain how much the Astros would be
willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially, the Astros are probably going to be on the lower
end,'' Caminiti said. ``I know what I'd like to do. It's going to
be a family decision. We'll just have to see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   If Caminiti were to sign with the Astros, he would be reunited
with good friends Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell. The three were
cornerstones of the Astros' rebuilding project in the early 1990s
before Caminiti was traded to San Diego along with Steve Finley,
Andujar Cedeo, Roberto Petagine and Brian Williams in exchange for
Derek Bell, Ricky Gutierrez, Doug Brocail, Phil Plantier, Craig
Shipley and Pedro Martinez (not the one who currently plays for the
Red Sox).
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Biggio and Bagwell were pushing him to sign with the
Astros, Caminiti said: ``Oh, yeah.``
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and the Chicago Cubs also are believed to be interested
in Caminti, who hit .252 with 29 home runs and 82 RBIs for the
Padres in 1998.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
In a scene that has become common at the Dallas Cowboys' training
facility, Deion Sanders strolls through the locker room, kindly
encouraging teammates to join him for weekly Bible study.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Brothers, come one, come all. Last call, last call. Most of
you know all about last call. But we don't charge you $10 for a
table dance. We give you the word.''
</P>
<P>
   His recently published autobiography, Power, Money &AMP; Sex (he has
been autographing and distributing copies to teammates), does not
celebrate those topics but warns of their dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As somebody who has had more than his share of all three,'' he
said, ``I can tell you this: In themselves, those things will not
make you happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Cowboys, among them star running back Emmitt Smith, heed
his call. The way Sanders' life is going these days, it would not
be surprising if many more follow him. And who's to say a dose of
old-fashioned religion isn't good for a team with a history of
misadventures with the law?
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys traveled to Philadelphia for their Monday-night
game, they were greeted by a newspaper pullout ridiculing them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the jokes at their expense: ``If Michael Irvin, Leon Lett
and Erik Williams are riding in a car, who's driving? The cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one: ``Who is the new Cowboys defensive coordinator?
Johnnie Cochran.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders as their spiritual leader and a creditable
midseason candidate for NFL Most Valuable Player, the Cowboys are
creating hope that they've reformed _ on the field as well as off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there will be no more scandals involving Williams,
alcohol and topless dancers, or Irvin and Lett on drugs, or Irvin
slashing a teammate _ ``Scissorgate,'' the preseason caper in which
Cowboys guard Everett McIver suffered a gash frighteningly close to
his jugular.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever influence Sanders may have, the team has stayed out of
trouble since he started offering directions to the path of the
righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Not that religion and football are entirely compatible.
Turn-the-other-cheek and love-your-enemies are hardly NFL mantras.
Jerry Glanville, the coach-turned-broadcaster, used to cringe when
he saw Christianity invading the locker room. ``What we need is
less praying and more hitting,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys are getting both. They're 5-3, atop the saggy
NFC East. They had their most dominating game of the season when
they downed the clip-winged Philadelphia Eagles 34-0 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Cowboys are doing well enough at the season's
midpoint to talk Super Bowl. Guard Nate Newton said, ``We've got to
get on an eight-game tear and win the whole shebang.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who returned to action Monday after
seven weeks of recovery from a broken collarbone, believes the
Super Bowl hype is premature.
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded, ``I think if we can go out and continue to get
better, we can make a real impact in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rhodes, coach of the 1-7 Eagles, observed: ``All of their
guys who had off years have come back and played well. You look at
Emmitt, Erik Williams. These guys are playing extremely well.
Emmitt's running hard and doing the things he did a couple of years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had his fourth 100-yard rushing day of the season, while
Aikman completed 14 of 26 passes against Philadelphia for 171 yards
and two touchdowns, with no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The multidimensional Sanders contributed a key pass reception on
the game-opening drive. It was an 11-yarder on third-and-10, and it
led to a Richie Cunningham field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Sanders provided broken-field magic that
has typified his season. He ran back a punt 69 yards _ his second
punt-return score of the year _ giving the Cowboys a decisive 17-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that punt return, they had all the momentum,'' Eagles
cornerback Troy Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, Sanders almost had his second
interception touchdown of the year. He ran 21 yards with a Bobby
Hoying pass before the quarterback hauled him down by the back of
the jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Smith believes the newfound religion of Sanders has helped lift
his All-Pro level of play to yet a higher plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``His religion has made him much more at peace with who he is
and what he can do,'' Smith said. ``He's shifting some of his
energy and channeling it to the higher source and taking from a
higher source.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer does Sanders glory in his own performance. When he
speaks of ``the light,'' he doesn't mean Neon Deion. He now refers
to himself as ``Prime Time'' only in connection with his Bible
study, ``Prime Time Tuesdays.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to deflect attention from himself and concludes every
media conference with ``God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether this Moses of the gridiron can lead his team to the
promised land is highly questionable. Aside from Sanders, the
Dallas defensive backs do not provide much coverage, and the
Cowboys have yet to beat a good team.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they may not have to, until they reach the playoffs.
Of their remaining regular-season adversaries, only Minnesota (on
Thanksgiving Day) has a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   And with Sanders a threat to turn any opponent's pass play or
punt into a Dallas touchdown, nobody can feel secure about facing
this team. People can keep joking about the Cowboys, but Sanders,
speaking ever so softly, may get the last word. And the last call.

BUSH WINS LANDSLIDE RE-ELECTION IN TEXAS 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush won a landslide victory
Tuesday, becoming the first Texas governor in 25 years to win
re-election to consecutive terms of office and setting the stage
for a presidential bid in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 90 percent of the state's precincts reporting,
Bush led Democratic challenger Garry Mauro 69 percent to 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate,
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place,'' Bush
said, with his wife, Laura, and daughter Jenna at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today's election says something more. It says that a
leader who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender
gap, can open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and
new voices,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush's devastating defeat of Mauro
triggered Republican victories of most statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry eked out a narrow victory over Democrat
John Sharp in the lieutenant governor's race, while Republicans
also won races for attorney general, land commissioner, agriculture
commissioner and railroad commissioner. The GOP also swept the
Court of Criminal Appeals and won all races for the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The race for comptroller, between Republican Carole Keeton
Rylander and Democrat Paul Hobby, was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep this year on the heels of the Republican tidal wave
of 1996 would leave Democrats without a single statewide
officeholder by January. The Democrats would be shut out of the
highest levels of state government for the first time since
Reconstruction ended 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent size of Bush's victory likely will enhance his
position as a possible candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000. Bush said he will spend time with his family
over Christmas discussing whether to make such a bid and would give
a first signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Texans during the campaign that I didn't know and
I'd make up my mind when the election was over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I intend to spend private time thinking about the
commitment and whether or not I want to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro congratulated Bush in a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him elections are partisan, but governing is bipartisan
and I was willing to do anything to help make Texas the proudest
place in the world'' Mauro told supporters shortly after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly proud of the way he and I conducted our
campaigns. We differed on the issues, but we never got personal,
never,'' Mauro said. ``I'm proud we ran a campaign of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President Bush of Houston.
Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, won election Tuesday as the governor of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say something to the newly elected governor of
Florida: Good going, brother!'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote in 1988
on his road to the White House, and he carried Texas by 40.5
percent in his 1992 national re-election loss to Democrat Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro announced for governor last year, many considered his
campaign to be an impossible task, taking on a highly popular
incumbent governor. Nothing Mauro tried ever caught hold against
Bush, ranging from attacks on Bush's positions on health care,
education, crime _ even his possible presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned Mauro in passing in his acceptance speech but not
by name: ``I want to commend my opponent for fighting the good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In early returns, Bush led Mauro on Tuesday in every region of
Texas, including the traditionally Democratic strongholds of East
Texas and South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wanted to win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote this year,
breaking the previous Republican record of 36 percent set by
attorney general candidate Roy Barrera in 1986. Bush said such a
vote would prove the Republican conservative message could appeal
to Hispanic voters so long as it was inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned as a ``compassionate conservative'' who wanted
to bring more Hispanic voters into the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A mis amigos Hispanos, gracias por su appoyo' _ thank you
for your support,'' Bush said ``to his Hispanic friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the major television networks and The
Associated Press showed Bush carried 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a major jump over the 28 percent he received in 1994 in his
successful effort to unseat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush would fulfill a goal of
carrying El Paso County.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Mauro was running strong with liberals,
supporters of President Clinton and among African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first Texas governor to win re-election to
consecutive four-year terms. Republican Gov. Bill Clements won
election to office in 1978 and then lost the 1982 election, coming
back to win office again in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Dolph Briscoe was the last governor to win
re-election to consecutive terms. Briscoe won in 1974, with 61
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. John Connally, who later became a Republican,
won re-election to a two-year term in 1964 with 84 percent of the
vote and then again in 1966 with 73 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The top Republican vote-getter in modern Texas was President
Nixon, who received 66 percent of the vote in his 1972 re-election
victory. President Reagan got 63.6 percent in 1984; U.S. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, 60.8 percent in 1994; and U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm,
60 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate nominee Hugh Parmer is the previous Democratic low
vote-getter in a modern election, receiving 37 percent against
Gramm in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned for office with the argument that he had
fulfilled most of is 1994 campaign promises. He also made a series
of pledges for his second term in office.
</P>
<P>
   A $2 billion public-school property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Give $1.6 billion to public schools for classroom instruction,
reading programs, textbooks and facility construction.
</P>
<P>
   A $400 million sales tax cut, made by eliminating the tax on
over-the-counter medicines and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the franchise tax for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Crack down on welfare cheats.
</P>
<P>
   End the automatic ``social promotion'' of elementary school
students who are not academically prepared to advance to the next
grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, in this defeat, ended 16 years of service as Texas' land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters enthusiastically cheered and applauded when Mauro
took the stage at the Driskill Hotel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, what would y'all have done if I got 40 percent? If I'd
gotten 50, y'all'd have torn the place apart,`` Mauro said, with
early returns showing him with less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was helped in this campaign from Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mauro has known both of them since they
worked together on the 1972 Texas campaign of Democratic
presidential nominee George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons held fund-raisers for Mauro, which raised far less
than expected; both campaigned with Mauro in Texas, as did Vice
President Al Gore, who many expect to be the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of a healthy state economy and Bush's $15
million campaign swamping Mauro's $5 million effort, Mauro was
never able to break through. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans across the nation suffered stunning
setbacks Tuesday as they faced a slew of Democratic upsets in
congressional and gubernatorial contests. Voters signaled that the
scandal swirling around the White House is not playing outside of
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign where no unifying national themes emerged and
negative advertising pierced the airwaves, Democrats benefited from
a humming economy and strong turnout among their core supporters,
particularly African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, Democrats were projected to gain a few
seats in the House, where the GOP now holds a slim 22-seat
majority. If that happened, it would be the first time since 1934
that the party that controls the White House did not lose seats in
a nonpresidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters elected their first Democratic governor in
16 years as Lt. Gov. Gray Davis easily topped GOP contender Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most bitterly fought contests in the nation, New
York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer ousted longtime GOP incumbent
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who headed the probe into the Clintons'
Whitewater land dealings.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Carolina, Democratic Senate challenger John
Edwards, a political novice and telegenic trial lawyer, defeated
incumbent Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth, who has been harshly
critical of the Clintons over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In the best news for Republicans, the two Bush brothers
continued the family's political dynasty with Jeb Bush declared the
victor in the governor's race in Florida and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a possible presidential contender, cruising to re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, commenting on the success of his sons,
said: ``I cannot possibly begin to express the joy that Barbara and
I have in our hearts, nor the pride we have in George and Jeb. Both
are in politics for the right reasons. They want to make life
better for people in their states, and they want to serve with
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the campaign season was dominated by news of the
Clinton scandal, exit polls showed that most voters did not view
the election as a referendum on the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have argued that if Republicans failed to gain
many seats or even lost some in the House, that would undercut
their effort to pursue a lengthy and aggressive investigation into
the president's conduct. A House committee is expected to commence
an impeachment inquiry later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials were clearly pleased by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't just do well, we did well against history and
against dollars,'' said Roy Romer, general chairman of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy that appeared to have backfired for the GOP, party
officials launched a last-minute, $10 million ad blitz in an
attempt to link the Clinton scandal to the congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   As the results poured into Republican headquarters, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, acknowledged that ``impeachment
was not a big issue in campaigns around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the outcomes were ``based on needs of individual
districts or personality of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaigns, Democrats stressed Social Security,
education and managed care restrictions, while Republicans talked
about tax cuts and banning late-term abortion. But often local
issues and personalities dominated individual contests.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Democrats appeared to defeat GOP incumbents in
Kansas and New Mexico and picked up open seats in Mississippi and
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where 34 races were up for grabs, the GOP fell
far short of their goal of picking up enough seats to give it the
60-member, filibuster-proof cushion it had sought.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans not only lost key races in New York and
North Carolina, but may end up with no net gain over their current
55 seats as a number of endangered Democrats survived tough
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin incumbent Democrat Russell Feingold, who limited his
campaign contributions, clinched a tough contest against a
better-funded GOP opponent, Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   In California, incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer staved off a
spirited challenge by Republican Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   But in Illinois, Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, the only
African American in the Senate, was unable to survive a challenge
by GOP businessman Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Democrats' ability to remain viable in the
increasingly Republican South, Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings of
South Carolina managed to eke out a victory over GOP challenger Bob
Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   And in a major upset, South Carolina Republican Gov. David
Beasley was defeated by Democrat Jim Hodges, who campaigned on a
platform of creating a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In another GOP Southern stronghold, Alabama Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Donald Siegleman defeated incumbent
Republican Fob James, who has appealed to Christian conservatives
but alienated the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six governorships were up for grabs and Republican
candidates were headed to wins in a number of states, including
Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats captured the biggest prize, California, where
Davis, bolstered by strong showing among Democrats and independent
moderates, glided to victory over Lungren, the state's attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   The California win is particularly significant since the
governor will be instrumental in determining the shape of
congressional districts for 2000 in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the election had seesawed. Earlier this year,
congressional Democrats had high hopes that they could take back
the House.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes were dashed when the president admitted in
August that he had an affair with White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans boasted that they would garner big gains after the
release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment report
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, pundits were forced to reassess that view
as polls showed Democrats increasingly upset about the House
investigation of Clinton and more likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, led by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, have barnstormed the country
trying to rally the party faithful, particularly African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, has remained largely on the
sidelines, appearing only at restricted fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls saying otherwise, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said that the election results will be interpreted as a
referendum on the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a president who faces an impeachment inquiry. How
is it possible to maintain that this is not at least in some
respect a referendum on him?'' said Lockhart. &QL;

BUSH WINS LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN TEXAS 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush won a landslide victory
Tuesday, becoming the first Texas governor in 25 years to win
re-election to consecutive terms of office and setting the stage
for a presidential bid in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate,
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place,'' Bush
said, with his wife, Laura, and daughter Jenna at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today's election says something more. It says that a
leader who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender
gap, can open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and
new voices,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic challenger Garry Mauro congratulated Bush in a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him elections are partisan, but governing is bipartisan
and I was willing to do anything to help make Texas the proudest
place in the world,'' Mauro told supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly proud of the way he and I conducted our
campaigns. We differed on the issues, but we never got personal,
never,'' Mauro said. ``I'm proud we ran a campaign of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush's devastating defeat of
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro may trigger Republican victories
of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp were in a
neck-and-neck race for lieutenant governor, while Republicans in
early returns were leading in the races for comptroller and for
seats on the state Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals. But
all of those races were still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won races for attorney general, land commissioner,
agriculture commissioner and railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep this year on the heels of the Republican tidal wave
of 1996 would leave Democrats without a single statewide
officeholder by January. The Democrats would be shut out of the
highest levels of state government for the first time since
Reconstruction ended 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent size of Bush's victory likely will enhance his
position as a possible candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000. Bush said he will spend time with his family
over Christmas discussing whether to make such a bid and would give
a first signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Texans during the campaign that I didn't know, and
I'd make up my mind when the election was over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I intend to spend private time thinking about the
commitment and whether or not I want to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President George Bush of
Houston. Bush's brother, Jeb, won election Tuesday as the governor
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say something to the newly elected governor of
Florida: Good going, brother!'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote in 1988
on his road to the White House, and he carried Texas by 40.5
percent in his 1992 national re-election loss to Democrat Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro announced for governor last year, many considered his
campaign to be an impossible task, taking on a highly popular
incumbent governor. Nothing Mauro tried ever caught hold against
Bush, ranging from attacks on Bush's positions on health care,
education, crime _ even his possible presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned Mauro in passing in his acceptance speech but not
by name: ``I want to commend my opponent for fighting the good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in early returns led Mauro on Tuesday in every region of
Texas, including the traditionally Democratic strongholds of East
Texas and South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wanted to win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote this year,
breaking the previous Republican record of 36 percent set by
attorney general candidate Roy Barrera in 1986. Bush said such a
vote would prove the Republican conservative message could appeal
to Hispanic voters so long as it was inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned as a ``compassionate conservative'' who wanted
to bring more Hispanics voters into the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A mis amigos Hispanos, gracias por su appoyo' _ thank you
for your support,'' Bush said ``to his Hispanic friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the major television networks and The
Associated Press showed Bush carried 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a major jump over the 28 percent he received in 1994 in his
successful effort to unseat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated Bush would fulfill a goal of carrying El
Paso County.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Mauro was running strong with liberals,
supporters of President Clinton and among African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first Texas governor to win re-election to
consecutive four-year terms. Republican Gov. Bill Clements won
election to office in 1978 and then lost the 1982 election, coming
back to win office again in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Dolph Briscoe was the last governor to win
re-election to consecutive terms. Briscoe won in 1974 with 61
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. John Connally, who later became a Republican,
won re-election to a two-year term in 1964 with 84 percent of the
vote and then again in 1966 with 73 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The top Republican vote-getter in modern Texas was President
Richard Nixon, who received 66 percent of the vote in his 1972
re-election victory. President Reagan got 63.6 percent in 1984;
U.S. Sen. Kay Hutchison, 60.8 percent in 1994; and U.S. Sen. Phil
Gramm, 60 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate nominee Hugh Parmer is the previous Democratic
low-vote getter in a modern election, receiving 37 percent against
Gramm in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned for office arguing that he had fulfilled most of
is 1994 campaign promises. He also made a series of pledges for his
second term in office:
</P>
<P>
   A $2 billion public-school property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Give $1.6 billion to public schools for classroom instruction,
reading programs, textbooks and facility construction.
</P>
<P>
   A $400 million sales tax cut, made by eliminating the tax on
over-the-counter medicines and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the franchise tax for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Crack down on welfare cheats.
</P>
<P>
   End the automatic ``social promotion'' of elementary school
students who are not academically prepared to advance to the next
grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, in this defeat, ended 16 years of service as Texas' land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters went wild when Mauro took the stage at the
Driskill Hotel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, what would y'all have done if I got 40 percent. If I'd
gotten 50, y'all'd have torn the place apart,`` Mauro said, with
early returns showing him with less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was helped in this campaign from President Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mauro has known both of them
since they worked together on the 1972 Texas campaign of Democratic
presidential nominee George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons held fund-raisers for Mauro, which raised far less
than expected; both campaigned with Mauro in Texas, as did Vice
President Al Gore, who many expect to be the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of a healthy state economy and Bush's $15
million campaign swamping Mauro's $5 million effort, Mauro was
never able to break through. &QL;

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ With a tropical sun occasionally piercing
the lingering clouds of a storm called Mitch, Central America on
Tuesday dug out from beneath the rubble, recovered bodies of
victims and struggled to aid those who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which hovered off Honduras for much of last week and then
cut a deadly path across the impoverished waist of Central America
over the weekend, killed at least 7,000 people in the region. Some
officials have estimated that as many as 9,000 may have died.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras alone, officials have placed the death toll at 5,000
to 7,000, though the bodies of only a fraction of those have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Starkman, Honduras' minister of planning and foreign
cooperation, said that 11,000 people remain missing and that at
least 1.9 million Hondurans have lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, all we have at this point are estimates'' of
the number of dead, Starkman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, up to 2,400 people are feared dead, and 1,338
deaths have been confirmed. El Salvador has reported 222 deaths,
and Guatemala has said that 157 there died. Costa Rica, Panama,
Mexico and Jamaica also have reported Mitch-related deaths. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On Tuesday, after being downgraded to a tropical depression and
moving through Guatemala and southern Mexico, Mitch re-formed into
a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 45
mph. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it was moving
toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In what seemed to be another cruel trick of nature, the Cerro
Negro volcano _ located about 22 miles from the site of a
Mitch-triggered mudslide that killed up to 2,000 people in
Nicaragua _ erupted Tuesday, authorities said. No damage or
casualties were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Central American officials say they fear many of those reported
missing in the aftermath of Mitch may, in fact, be dead. But
Mitch's final human toll may never be known.
</P>
<P>
   Though search and rescue workers continued to recover bodies on
Tuesday, many victims remained buried beneath tons of mud.
Officials said many were swept away by swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that as much as 80 percent of Honduras' crops
_ which account for half the country's $4 billion annual economy _
have been destroyed. In Nicaragua, officials believe that as much
as 30 percent of the country's coffee crop and a huge proportion of
its grain fields have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua on Tuesday, rescue teams burned many bodies where
they found them in an effort to prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Mitch's victims in Nicaragua died Saturday, when the
rain-filled crater of a dormant volcano burst its seams, unleashing
a mudslide a few miles wide and many feet high that obliterated
four villages. Only a handful of the 4,500 people who lived in
those villages have been found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anywhere to run,'' a middle-aged man who
survived but lost his family to the mud told Nicaraguan television
from his hospital bed Tuesday. ``It was higher than our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Nicaraguan officials have suggested that the site of the
landslide, at the foot of Casitas Volcano near the northwestern
agricultural center of Chinandega, should be turned into a
``national cemetery'' and the bodies buried in mud there left
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Entire sections of Central America remain cut off by
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, overland travel remains extremely difficult due to
gasoline shortages, collapsed bridges and washed-out roads. Tree
trunks litters many of the north-coast highways. The Honduran
capital of Tegucigalpa remains virtually cut off from the important
industrial and agricultural centers of the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to reconstruct the entire road system of
the country,'' Starkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Along Honduras' northern coast, at least 41 bridges have been
washed out. In the Sula Valley, the country's breadbasket, 95
percent of the crops and 90 percent of the cattle herds have been
wiped out, according to government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch wreaked havoc on nearly every piece of Nicaragua _ one of
the poorest countries in the hemisphere, where the U.S. government
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support a civil war
against the socialist Sandinista government throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population's situation is tragic,'' Alfonso Ortega Urbino,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations, said at a New York
news conference broadcast on television here. He said his country
needs at least $50 million in immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
   At a telethon held Tuesday in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
to collect money, food and clothing for storm victims, President
Ricardo Aleman announced that ``massive'' aid from the United
States and Latin American countries would begin arriving by plane
Wednesday. The United States has pledged $6.5 million in aid to
countries devastated by Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors of Prostestant churches along Nicaragua's isolated
Caribbean coast said that the flooded Coco River, which forms the
border with Honduras, has cut off entire villages. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In one village, 1,200 people have been without food or water
since the weekend, one pastor said at the Managua telethon. In
another, nearly 1,000 people have taken refuge in a Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help the flood victims, thousands of Managua
residents flocked to the gym of an elite Roman Catholic high
school, where Tuesday's telethon was held. People carried money,
medicine, bags of food, truckloads of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During a long afternoon filled with pleas for help from civic
leaders, politicians and clergy, people donated more than $500,000
in cash as well as tons of food and other goods.

JEB BUSH WINS FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE BY WIDE MARGIN 

</HEADLINE>

By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Jeb Bush became the second son of former President
Bush to claim a governor's mansion, winning his race in Florida by
a wide margin &UR;  &LR; while brother George W. rolled to an easy
re-election in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Two brothers haven't served as governor at the same time since
the term of Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller of Arkansas overlapped that
of his brother Nelson Rockefeller of New York from 1967 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush called his win a ``victory of inclusion rather than
exclusion'' and made a point of lining up many of his black
supporters on the stage behind him as he announced that Democratic
Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay had conceded the race.
</P>
<P>
   The victories for both Bush brothers were a bright spot in an
otherwise disappointing evening for Republicans, particularly in
the South, where incumbents in Alabama and South Carolina lost
their jobs to Democratic challengers.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans lost the biggest prize of the day in California,
with Democrat Gray Davis defeating Republican Dan Lungren to
replace outgoing Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. It marks the end of
16 years of GOP governors in the nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   But the race with the most entertainment value had to be in
Minnesota, where former professional wrestler Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, an independent, held a slight lead against Democrat Hubert
Humphrey III and Republican Norm Coleman with about one-third of
the vote counted.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton had dismissed Ventura's bid for governor
as a ``sideshow.'' Ventura answered with, ``If I were her, I'd be
more concerned about leaving Bill alone in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In spite of the upsets, Tuesday's balloting did not threaten
to dislodge the firm hold overall that Republicans have on the
nation's governor's mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were choosing a governor in 36 states Tuesday. Before
balloting, Republicans held 24 of those seats, Democrats had 11 and
an independent governed Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Republican Governors Association, South
Carolina's David Beasley, lost to state House Minority Leader Jim
Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley had to defend himself against eleventh-hour allegations
that he'd had an affair with his former press secretary _ something
he, his wife and the woman in question denied.
</P>
<P>
   And in a state where unregulated video poker has been a big bone
of contention, Beasley accepted money from the industry in 1994 and
then later opposed the game. Subsequently, the well-heeled gaming
interests backed Democrat Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, threw out its incumbent Republican governor, Fob James,
in favor of Democrat Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman. James, 64, was first
elected as a Democrat and then switched parties. He was extremely
popular with Christian conservatives, championing school prayer and
a controversial display of the Ten Commandments in a Gadsden
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   James' opponent, Siegelman, pledged to bring a lottery to
Alabama to help fund education improvements.
</P>
<P>
   With 80 percent of the Florida vote counted, Jeb Bush had 56
percent to MacKay's 44 percent. It was Bush's second attempt,
having narrowly lost to incumbent Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the best parents in the world by far,'' Bush
sibling said in a nod to the ex-president and Barbara Bush, who'd
flown to Florida to share the victory.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush called his brother about an hour after the
Florida polls had closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one excited person, as I'm sure you can imagine,'' said
the Texas governor. ``Mother and Dad flew over to Miami to surprise
him, and he was in quite a state of shock when Mother and Dad
walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great tribute to them. And it's obviously a
tribute to the way he ran his campaign, and the fact that he got
beat four years ago and it didn't deter his enthusiasm. He came
back and won a big victory.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay's campaign suffered from a late start and poor
organization, in spite of his 30 years of political experience.
Bush, 45, jumped to the head of the polls in the early days of the
campaign and never wavered, but padded his already large GOP base
by courting traditionally Democratic minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was remarkable since Bush alienated many minority
voters in 1994 when he was asked what he would do for black voters,
and glibly answered, ``Probably nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overtures to minority Democrats fanned fears that those
who left the party in the governor's race will stay away when it
comes time to elect a president in 2000 _ particularly if the GOP
nominee is the Florida governor's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has similar fears in California, where lame duck Gov.
Pete Wilson had alienated much of the state's Republican base long
before Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   In other governor's races, New York Republican George Pataki was
headed to a second term with one of the largest margins in history.
Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland won a rematch with
Republican Ellen Sauerbrey, and Democratic incumbents won in New
Hampshire and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Republicans Frank Keating in Oklahoma, &UR;  &LR;  Gary Johnson
in New Mexico, Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan
and Tom Ridge in Pennsylvania won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbents also won in Arkansas, Arizona,
Connecticut, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM SCHUMER'S AND D'AMATO'S SPEECHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: With ELN-NY-RDP)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REP. CHARLES SCHUMER:
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from Charles Schumer's victory speech
Tuesday night, as transcribed by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. Senator
D'Amato graciously called me a few minutes ago to congratulate me
on being the next senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now I want to thank you. I want to thank you, New York. You have
honored me with your trust. And I promise all New Yorkers that as
hard as I fought to win this election, I'll fight even harder for
everyone in this state and for the country that we all love.
</P>
<P>
   During this campaign, I've traveled throughout this state again
and again. I have learned the hopes and the concerns of families
from one end of this diverse and beautiful state to the other. From
Buffalo to Brooklyn, from Syracuse to Setauket, from Mineola to
Manhattan, the desires and dreams and needs of the people of this
state are the same. And I want to be a senator who will work to
bring unity to our state and bring our state together.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we enter the 21st century and face ever-increasing
global competition, competition that can make or break America, we
cannot afford division, whether it's between race, sexual
orientation, geographic region or ideology.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd like to say a word to the young people of America, many
of whom are probably not watching tonight. But I hope to get this
message through over the next six years in the senate. I know, I
say to you young people of New York and America, that there's a lot
of cynicism about politics and about government.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs to remind me or my family that campaigns can be
hard on those running and on those watching at home. Campaigns more
often than not must focus on the things that divide us. But
government and public service must focus more on the causes that
unite us. I want to tell the young people of New York and America
that they should not confuse the rough and tumble of a campaign
with the rewards and the importance of public service.
</P>
<P>
   I entered public service at the age of 23 because I believed
then that government should be a calling to make people's lives
better and the world a better place. Today, at the age of 47, I am
about to enter the Senate with the same belief, strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   SEN. ALFONSE D'AMATO
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the concession speech Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato delivered Tuesday night at his campaign headquarters at the
Hilton Towers in New York City, as transcribed by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   I want to tell you, to all of my New Yorkers. I am deeply
grateful to each and every New Yorker who has given me the
opportunity to do that which I've loved the most: to work and to
fight and to attempt to make a difference for the people of our
great state.
</P>
<P>
   And we've come a long way. And we've had a lot of triumphs. And
I have to tell you that tonight in your vote there was a
reaffirmation of that by the election of our great governor, George
Pataki. Because he's going to continue to work to make this state a
better place for all of our citizens _ Republicans, Democrats,
liberals, conservatives, people of every stripe.
</P>
<P>
   And I have to tell you that's what it's about. I've been
honored, honored. Never, never in my wildest dreams would I ever
have thought when I graduated Syracuse Law School and came back
home to the little village of Island Park, my hometown, and the
people who've supported me and who I love, never, when my Mama went
out campaigning me for the first time did I think that I would ever
have the privilege of serving the people for 18 years. ...
</P>
<P>
   I did call Congressman Schumer to _ to congratulate him for a
hard-fought, wonderful victory _ no, no, he is our senator and we
want him to be as effective as he can for all the people of this
great state. Now remember that. That's the key. Doing the business
of the people. And our governor is going to need the help of all of
the members from our New York delegation. And so is our mayor,
because that's what it's about. We had the battle. The battle is
over. I am proud of having carried the torch. And now that
leadership will go into the hands of someone else. And we want this
state to have the kind of leadership that will continue it to be
the great state that it is and can be.
</P>
<P>
   And I tell you, from the bottom of my heart, I thank you, I love
you. The people of New York, thank you so very, very, very much.

GOP HOLDS HOUSE MAJORITY, BUT DEMS MAY ADD A FEW SEATS 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans held their majority in Congress on
Tuesday, but early returns indicated that the Democrats would add
seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appeared to favor incumbents over challengers for the
most part and Democrats over Republicans in some key areas of the
country where House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., had predicted
solid GOP victories.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago Republicans had confidently predicted a gain of
20 to 40 seats. But Democrats, thanks to incumbent Republican
losses in New Mexico and Kansas and tight races in Pennsylvania,
Louisiana and other states, looked to be on their way to picking up
three to seven congressional seats, which would mark the first time
since 1934 that the party holding the White House added to its
numbers in a mid-presidential term election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even or even pick up one seat, it would be a
historical election. This would be a historic reversal,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged by the turnout,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of
California, chairman of the Democratic conference in the House, who
attributed the stunning Democratic showings around the country to a
larger than expected voter turnout. He predicted that the
Democratic victories would set up the party to retake control of
Congress in the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great ramp-up to the year 2000,'' a delighted Fazio
said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the election the Republicans held a majority of 228
seats in the House to 206 for the Democrats. One member is an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
said he was still hopeful that when all the results were in
Wednesday that the Republicans would still pick up a few seats.
What matters, he added, is Republicans still control the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first time in 70 years that we kept control
for three elections in a row. That's the good news,'' Gingrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even a handful of new members would still be a
disappointment for Republican leaders who had hoped that the Monica
Lewinsky scandal would help drive voters to their party. In fact,
early exit polls Tuesday showed that about one in 20 voters listed
the president's relationship with the young woman as a deciding
factor in how they voted. Most ranked the candidates' positions on
education, the economy and Social Security as more important than
the Lewinsky matter, although they indicated that ethics and morals
do matter in their political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press also reported that six out of 10 voters
questioned at polling places said they did not approve of the way
the Republican leadership in Congress had handled the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going exactly how Republicans had hoped.
This has been a bad election for Republicans any way you look at
it,'' former Gingrich press secretary Tony Blankley said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, casting his ballot Tuesday in his home district of
Marietta, Ga., where he was elected to an 11th term, said he was
still confident despite the early exit polls that the election
represented the ``ongoing, slow-motion collapse of the Democratic
majority that Franklin Roosevelt created.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no intrigue, we're going to win an election today,''
Gingrich said, fighting off questions about whether GOP gains would
fall short of his earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   All together there were 94 incumbent House members _ 39
Democrats and 55 Republicans _ running for re-election this year
unopposed. But there were plenty of other members who were forced
to spend money fending off challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early winners was Republican Rep. Dan Burton, of
Indiana, who once called Clinton a ``scumbag'' and is leading an
investigation into Democratic campaign finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, the Republican Ernie Fletcher won an open
Democratic seat, but Democrat Ken Lucas picked up an open seat left
vacated by Republicans. The GOP had predicted that it would win
both those seats with little problem.
</P>
<P>
   In another hard-fought Kentucky contest, Republican Rep. Anne
Northup was ahead of her Democratic challenger Chris Gorman in
early returns.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the Republicans lost an effort to defeat incumbent
Rep. Julia Carson, D-Ind. Carson had been targeted by Republicans
as one of the most vulnerable Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, early polling reports showed that incumbents likely
would retain their seats, leaving the delegation's current makeup
of 17 Democrats and 13 Republicans intact.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to knock off conservative Democrat Charles
Stenholm in the 17th District of West Central Texas. But in early
returns, Stenholm was well ahead of GOP challenger Rudy Izzard.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in mid-presidential term elections the party with
control of the White House ends up losing at least two dozen or
more seats in the House. That's one reason the GOP had predicted
such big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain what happened, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, said as returns were still coming in that it was
``too early'' for Republicans to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long night. When it's all over we're going to have more
Republicans in the House, more Republicans in the Senate,'' he said
on CNN.

GOP KEEPS ITS MAJORITY IN SENATE, BUT REPUBLICANS FALL SHORT OF
FILIBUSTER-PROOF MARGIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans held their majority in the Senate in
elections Tuesday but lost two of President Clinton's most vocal
critics _ Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   They also fell short in efforts to unseat two West Coast
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In closely watched campaigns, Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of
California and Patty Murray of Oregon turned back strong Republican
challenges, according to exit polls and early returns.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP partially offset the losses by knocking off Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, an Illinois Democrat and the first black woman
elected to the Senate. Republican Peter Fitzgerald, a state senator
and banking heir, was elected, according to early returns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Jim Bunning, a six-term House member and member
of the baseball Hall of Fame, was in a very close race with
Democrat Scotty Baesler for the Kentucky Senate seat being vacated
by the chamber's No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Wendell Ford. With most votes
counted, less than a hundred votes separated the two, with Baesler
leading.
</P>
<P>
   When all votes are counted, the current 55-44 Republican
majority in the Senate is expected to remain unchanged. The final
Senate outcome came down to Kentucky and a close race in Nevada,
seats currently held by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has not held more than 55 Senate seats since 1931 when
the chamber was occupied by 56 Republicans. History was on the side
of the GOP for boosting its Senate majority. Since World War II,
the party not holding the White House has picked up an average of
four seats in each midterm election. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &UR;  &LR; Dealing a fatal blow to Republican chances of boosting their
Senate majority this year was D'Amato's loss in New York to
Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, an eight-term House member from
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched D'Amato-Schumer race was expensive and
nasty, with the two candidates trading public insults and
accusations. The two spent more than $32 million in what is
expected to be the most expensive such race in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Faircloth was ousted by Democrat John
Edwards, a trial lawyer who was making his first run for political
office. Edwards dominated early stages of the campaign and fought
off a late challenge from Faircloth, who switched his party
affiliation from Democrat to Republican before running for the
Senate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Also crippling Republican chances of building on their Senate
majority was veteran Sen. Ernest Hollings' easy win over Republican
challenger Bob Inglis, a three-term member of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings, who has served 32 years in the Senate, currently is
the only Democrat holding statewide office in South Carolina,
arguably the most Republican state in the South until Tuesday. Not
only was Hollings returned to office, South Carolina voters elected
Democrat David Hodges to replace incumbent GOP Gov. David Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate races on the ballot, most of the other
incumbents were expected to win re-election easily. Five of the
seats up for election had no incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed Democrat Evan Bayh winning a seat
previously held by the GOP in Indiana and George Voinovich winning
a seat held by a retiring Ohio Democrat, astronaut John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Democrat Blanche Lambert Lincoln won the Senate
seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat.
Lincoln quit the House after two terms following the birth of twin
sons, then re-entered politics this year, easily defeating
Republican Fay Boozman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Nevada, early returns showed Democratic incumbent Sen.
Harry Reid leading Republican challenger John Ensign.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold turned back a
challenge from Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. Feingold, the
incumbent Democrat who fought unsuccessfully in the Senate for
campaign finance reform, promised to limit his re-election campaign
spending to $3.8 million. It robbed him of the fund-raising
advantage normally enjoyed by incumbents, but he pulled out a
narrow victory on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Boxer and Murray _ two of the Democratic
women elected to the Senate in 1992's Year of the Woman _ were
re-elected, according to exit polls and early returns.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer had come under fire from her opponent, state Treasurer
Matt Fong, for her liberal voting record and her political and
personal ties to Clinton. Boxer is married to Hillary Rodham
Clinton's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Murray held a slight lead over Rep. Linda Smith in the only
all-female Senate race in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among those re-elected to six-year terms were Sens. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader; John McCain,
R-Ariz., a potential 2000 presidential contender; and Sens. John
Breaux, D-La.; Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.; and Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Also returning to the Capitol will be Sens. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the Senate's No. 2 Republican; Judd Gregg, R-N.H.; and
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who won a fourth term. Sens. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.; Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; Richard Shelby, R-Ala.; and
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., were re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Also re-elected were Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Leahy swamped GOP challenger Fred Tuttle,
a 79-year-old dairy farmer who gained celebrity after starring in a
1996 film spoofing congressional politics and who admitted he had
no interest in being elected. &QL;

ELECTORATE SETS COURSE FOR CENTER; ATTACK ADS PROVE INEFFECTIVE FOR
GOP 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
C.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The broad middle of American politics held Tuesday.
And to the relief of Democrats, that's where enough of their
candidates had positioned themselves to thwart Republican designs
on gains in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Well-rehearsed Republican cries of ``liberal, liberal, liberal''
were insufficient to strengthen the GOP hold on the Senate or to
maintain their current count in the House, where they may have,
surprisingly, lost seats. And last-minute Republican chants of
``liar, liar, liar,'' as they attempted to focus voter attention on
President Clinton's sex scandal, were either ineffective or
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The marginal shifts in party dominance on Capitol Hill,
reflected in returns and exit polls, point to an electorate that
remains content with narrow majority control in Congress and with
clearly divided government in Washington overall.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the apparent results mean at least two more
years of government by niggling, as Clinton on one end of
Pennsylvania Avenue and Republican leaders on the other cobble
together compromises when they think the voters demand it and
berate each other unceasingly the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have grown strangely accustomed to, if not fond of,
this act. They're willing to tolerate it as long as the economy is
bouncing along, and an amazing 84 percent of respondents in CNN's
early exit polling said they viewed the national economic picture
as excellent or good.
</P>
<P>
   The results also lay out a very interesting landscape on which
the 2000 presidential campaign _ both in the primaries and in the
fall _ will be waged.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the modest GOP showing nationally
actually could be good news for a mainstreamer such as Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas. With a broad center-right appeal that celebrated
his state's diversity, Bush showed that a Republican can be
triumphant in a basically conservative state without kowtowing to
what his ex-president father once called the ``extra chromosome''
wing of the party. That should be an important lesson for
Republicans nationally, although there is no certainty they will
learn it.
</P>
<P>
   For Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, the
election was a sign that at this point at least he need not fear
his close association with Clinton _ not that he could do much to
shake it.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's voting was a referendum on Clinton and impeachment,
which is arguable, then the president won, sort of. Voters were not
so disturbed by the sex scandal that they decisively strengthened
the Republican hold on Congress, nor were they so committed to
cutting off the Republican move toward impeachment that they
delivered either house into Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his supporters will take great heart, and glee, from
the defeat of first-term Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the North Carolina
Republican who has been one of the president's chief tormentors.
Faircloth's television ads sought to tie Democratic challenger John
Edwards to Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have voted repeatedly on Clinton's character,
beginning in 1992 when they elected him with full knowledge that he
was a flawed but engaging figure. That view held up not only in his
1996 re-election but in poll after poll during the unfolding sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters (55 percent) do not want Clinton impeached,
according to CNN's exit surveys. That only slightly &UR;  &LR; lags behind
the general public's opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Given these consistent numbers, Republicans were delusional in
their belief that there was political profit in the last-minute
television ads attacking Clinton. Only slightly less daft was the
idea of some Democrats that there was a big advantage in lashing
themselves to the president.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties these final gambits were always about juicing
up their base, and it appears to have worked less well than might
have been expected for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Republicans' problems was that their plans for a
low-turnout election appear not to have materialized. That was a
key factor in some Democratic victories, especially in the South,
where Democrats showed surprising strength and defeated at least
two incumbent GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   In several close races, an increased black vote fueled narrow
Democratic victories. That is a reversal from 1994, when low black
turnout was one of the reasons that Republicans won control of both
houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Republicans should have done much better in
congressional races nationally in the second mid-term election of a
Democratic president's administration _ even given the fact that
Clinton's Democrats lost control of Congress in the 1994 midterm
election.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans, especially in the House, reflect on their less
than stellar showing, some might be chagrined enough to wonder if
they still have the right leader in Speaker Newt Gingrich. A big
question is whether that mood would make it easier for Gingrich to
decide it's time to move on and launch a serious presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats considering a challenge to Gore for their party's
presidential nomination, there was little to hang their hat on. &QL;

CHALLENGER CLAIMS WIN IN RACE AGAINST DEAD INCUMBENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Updates with victory statement, quotes.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Lee Baca claimed victory over the late Sherman
Block in Tuesday's balloting for sheriff of Los Angeles County,
less than a week after Block died while running for a fifth
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Block's supporters insisted on carrying on the campaign through
Election Day, in spite of his death Thursday from a brain
hemorrhage, in hopes of denying Baca the office.
</P>
<P>
   Baca, wearing a yellow rose in his lapel, gave a victory speech
to supporters early in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County has become a victorious, wonderful place of
inclusion ... because of what's going on tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take great pride that this has been a campaign about
decency, this has been a campaign about fairness. That this
campaign was about inclusion of everybody, not just some
powerbrokers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear ... We have won this campaign. I am ready
to become your sheriff for the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   For voters, it was a choice between Baca, 56, or voting for
Block with the knowledge that if he won, by law, the county Board
of Supervisors would select a successor as sheriff to fill the
position until the November 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   If early indications prevail, Baca, a former regional chief in
the Sheriff's Department, will be sworn in Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Before Block's death, the election was expected to be a
referendum on his four-term leadership of the 13,000-employee
department, which operates the largest jail system in the nation
and provides law enforcement services to 40 cities and the county's
unincorporated area. After his death, it turned into a vote on
public confidence in the surviving candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Baca was in the top echelon of department leaders in June when
he and two other hopefuls ran against Block in the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   Block finished the primary in first place with 36 &UR;  &LR; percent of
the vote, but Baca trailed him by only 4 &UR;  &LR; percentage points and
forced the sheriff into the first runoff of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   For Block, who had been sheriff since 1982, it suddenly became
the most critical campaign of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Long a popular public official and never seriously threatened
for his job, Block went out on the campaign trail in the runoff and
faced questions about inefficiency in his department, mistaken
releases of prisoners and other management criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The event that turned out to be the final campaign debate of
Block's nearly 17-year career occurred in Studio City on Oct. 23 as
the two men faced each other at a forum of the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Block, 74, fell at his West Hills home and hit his
head, requiring 10 stitches and hospitalization for dizziness and
disorientation, followed by surgery to remove a blood clot in his
brain. He died only days later, still in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Before losing consciousness, Block asked his supporters not to
give up the political battle regardless of what happened to him,
according to his campaign leaders. As the runoff campaign
lengthened, Block increasingly had questioned Baca's integrity,
ethics and leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
   Baca resigned from the department shortly after the primary,
saying it would enable him to campaign full time. Afterward, Block
openly questioned the job performance of his onetime subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent issue for Baca's campaign, during the primary
and most of the runoff battle, was Block's age and health. The
sheriff had been undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week
after twice defeating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the race, however, Baca began criticizing his former
mentor's management, particularly of the jails.
</P>
<P>
   Until stricken Oct. 24, Block insisted he was in good health
despite his age and the dialysis treatments. He said he was still
the best man for the job of reducing crime, still the one most
likely to reduce his constituents' fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Baca cast himself as a man with the energy, vision and hands-on
management style needed to steer the department into a new era.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was hindered by allegations that he had offered
Block a deal to quit the race, including the title of sheriff
emeritus with a staff car and driver as well as continued official
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baca insisted the offer was not meant as a shady deal, but
rather as an effort to keep Block in the department while avoiding
a bitter race that could divide the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department has a $1.25 &UR;  &LR; billion budget and 13,000
employees, including about 8,000 deputies. It serves 2.5 &UR;  &LR; million
people in the unincorporated portions of the county and in 40
cities that contract with the department for law enforcement
services. The sheriff also runs the county's vast jail system,
America's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Block won the endorsement of unions representing the
rank-and-file deputies as well as the sergeants and lieutenants.
Also backing him were many of the region's political heavyweights,
including all five county supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years in the department, Baca rose through the
ranks to division chief in charge of six stations and the anti-gang
bureau. He has a doctorate in public administration from the
University of Southern California. &UR;  &QL;

SCANDAL ISN'T PLAYING OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY 
 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans across the nation suffered stunning
setbacks Tuesday as they faced a slew of Democratic upsets in
congressional and gubernatorial contests. Voters signaled that the
scandal swirling around the White House is not playing outside of
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign where no unifying national themes emerged and
negative advertising pierced the airwaves, Democrats benefited from
a humming economy and strong turnout among their core supporters,
particularly African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, Democrats were projected to gain seats
in the House, where the GOP now holds a slim 22-seat majority. If
that happened, it would be the first time since 1934 that the party
that controls the White House did not lose seats in a
nonpresidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters elected their first Democratic governor in
16 years as Lt. Gov. Gray Davis easily topped GOP contender Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most bitterly fought contests in the nation, New
York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer ousted longtime GOP incumbent
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who headed the probe into the Clintons'
Whitewater land dealings.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Carolina, Democratic Senate challenger John
Edwards, a political novice and telegenic trial lawyer, defeated
incumbent Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth, who has been harshly
critical of the Clintons over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In the best news for Republicans, the two Bush brothers
continued the family's political dynasty with Jeb Bush declared the
victor in the governor's race in Florida and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a possible presidential contender, cruising to re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush, commenting on the success of his sons
said: ``I cannot possibly begin to express the joy that Barbara and
I have in our hearts, nor the pride we have in George and Jeb. Both
are in politics for the right reasons. They want to make life
better for people in their states, and they want to serve with
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the campaign season was dominated by news of the
Clinton scandal, exit polls showed that most voters did not view
the election as a referendum on the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have argued that if Republicans failed to gain
many seats or even lose some in the House, that would undercut
their effort to pursue a lengthy and aggressive investigation into
the president's conduct. A House committee is expected to commence
an impeachment inquiry later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials were clearly pleased by the early results
trending their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't just do well, we did well against history and
against dollars,'' said Roy Romer, general chairman of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy that appeared to have backfired for the GOP, party
officials launched a last-minute, $10 million ad blitz in an
attempt to link the Clinton scandal to the congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   As the results poured into Republican headquarters, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, acknowledged that ``impeachment
was not a big issue in campaigns around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the outcomes were ``based on needs of individual
districts or personality of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaigns, Democrats stressed Social Security,
education and managed care restrictions, while Republicans talked
about tax cuts and banning late-term abortion. But often local
issues and personalities dominated individual contests.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Democrats appeared to defeat GOP incumbents in
Kansas and New Mexico and possibly Pennsylvania and picked up an
open seat in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where 34 races were up for grabs, the GOP fell
far short of their goal of picking up enough seats to give it the
60-member, filibuster-proof cushion it had sought.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans not only lost key races in New York and
North Carolina, but may end up with a net loss of one seat as a
number of endangered Democrats survived tough challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin incumbent Democrat Russell Feingold, who limited his
campaign contributions, clinched a tough contest against a
better-funded GOP opponent, Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   In California, incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer staved off a
spirited challenge by Republican Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   But in Illinois, Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, the only
African-American in the Senate, was unable to survive a challenge
by GOP businessman Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Democrats' ability to remain viable in the
increasingly Republican South, Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings of
South Carolina managed to eke out a victory over GOP challenger Bob
Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   And in a major upset, South Carolina Republican Gov. David
Beasley was defeated by Democrat Jim Hodges, who campaigned on a
platform of creating a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In another GOP Southern stronghold, Alabama Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Donald Siegleman defeated incumbent
Republican Fob James, who has appealed to Christian conservatives
but alienated the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six governorships were up for grabs and Republican
candidates were headed to wins in a number of states, including
Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats captured the biggest prize, California, where
Davis, bolstered by strong showing among Democrats and independent
moderates, glided to victory over Lungren, the state's attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   The California win is particularly significant since the
governor will be instrumental in determining the shape of
congressional districts for 2000 in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the election had seesawed. Earlier this year,
congressional Democrats had high hopes that they could take back
the House.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes were dashed when the president admitted in
August that he had affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans boasted that they would garner big gains after the
release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment report
detailing his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, pundits were forced to reassess that view
as polls showed Democrats increasingly upset about the House
investigation of Clinton and more likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, led by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, have barnstormed the country
trying to rally the party faithful, particularly African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, has remained largely on the
sidelines, appearing only at restricted fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls saying otherwise, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said that the election results will be interpreted as a
referendum on the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a president who faces an impeachment inquiry. How
is it possible to maintain that this is not at least in some
respect a referendum on him?'' said Lockhart. &QL;

ANALYSIS: A COUNTRY HAPPY WITH ITS LOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for substantial rewriting in grafs 3 through 6 and for
tightening throughout)   (mk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The votes Americans cast in Tuesday's midterm elections will
inevitably have an impact on the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton and hence on the remaining months of his
presidency. But according to a survey of voters leaving the polls,
that was not what most had on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will have an effect on Clinton's future,'' said
Ferrel Guillory of the University of North Carolina, one of the
swing states in the balloting. ``But that doesn't mean Clinton's
past had much effect on this election. Everything I've seen and
heard suggests the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the Democrats fared better than expected, bucking
historical precedent, some of the steam is likely to go out of the
impeachment process. And one major reason, the polls suggested, was
broad public disapproval of the way Republican leaders in Congress
have handled the Clinton investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ohio River Valley, Democrats won close House races in
three states. They turned out two incumbent Republican senators,
Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina,
both of whom waged harsh, negative television campaigns that were
devised by Arthur Finkelstein, a prominent New York media
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings Jr. of South Carolina, one of the last
Democratic survivors of the one-party South, won re-election in the
face of a stiff challenge, and Democrats defeated Republican
governors in Alabama and South Carolina. Another Democrat, Sen.
Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, one of the chief backers of campaign
finance reform, survived a multimillion-dollar onslaught of
television attacks financed by its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans took a Democratic seat in Illinois, and other
Senate races appeared headed for photo finishes, reflecting a close
partisan division that also showed up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, nearly six voters in 10 said their votes had
been cast neither in support of nor in opposition to Clinton, but
for other reasons. About two in 10 told interviewers for a
consortium of five television networks and The Associated Press
that they were expressing backing for the president, and about the
same number said they were expressing disapproval of him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, preliminary tallies suggested that the Democrats may have
succeeded in stimulating a sizable black voter turnout with
last-minute efforts including a visit by Clinton to a black church
in Baltimore on Sunday and a television spot that concluded: ``Next
Tuesday, vote Democratic. And tell Congress we're ready to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   If the vote did not turn upon the president, it may have been
substantially affected by resentment of the tactics of Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel, and the Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee. The weaker-than-expected Republican showing
will mean not only fewer anti-Clinton votes in the House and
Senate, but also less zealous pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Among those elected were all 435 of the representatives who will
be called upon next year, if the process unfolds as expected, to
vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' on articles of impeachment. Also chosen, in
an election in which fewer than four of 10 eligible voters
participated, were a third of those who will sit as jurors if the
House sends the case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither Republican efforts to demonize the president
for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky through a late flurry of
ads in pivotal districts, nor Democratic efforts to picture
congressional Republicans as mindless partisans determined to
savage Clinton, succeeded in making the election a referendum on
the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, in fact, a referendum at all. Unlike the Republican
sweep of four years ago, this was a typical midterm election in the
sense that people tended to respond to the candidates themselves
and to issues that seemed important locally rather than to national
imperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a Seinfeld election,'' said Curtis Gans, who heads a
group that monitors voter turnout. ``He said his show wasn't about
anything and neither was this election.''
</P>
<P>
   When people were pressed to say what issue mattered most in
their voting decisions, almost a quarter mentioned either the
Lewinsky matter or ``moral and ethical issues,'' which might be
taken to mean the same thing. But more than three-quarters
mentioned other issues like education or Social Security and jobs
or taxes, with education at the head of the list. Schools were
featured in television commercials, handbills and stump speeches in
a number of the hardest-fought contests this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the exit poll confirmed the findings of
dozens of surveys the last six months. Voters expressed approval of
Clinton's performance as president _ two-thirds gave him a
favorable rating _ disapproval of his personal conduct and
disappointment at the Republican Congress' performance. Most said
they would just as soon see the impeachment matter dropped,
although voters were divided, the exit poll found, on whether
Congress should censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed robust confidence in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the country is happy with its lot,'' a Republican
strategist said last weekend. ``No winds of discontent, no tidal
waves of change.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors favoring the status quo. Only 34
members of the House and only five senators, far fewer than
average, are retiring this year, and most seats change party hands
when they are open. Incumbents also had a strong advantage in
raising money this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No president's party in this century has made a net gain in the
House midway through a second presidential term, though the
Democrats still stood a chance of doing that late Tuesday night.
Clinton's travails led to predictions a month or so ago of at least
modest gains by Republicans, but that view softened as Election Day
neared.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the apparent backlash against the Republicans,
another factor in the improved Democratic showing may have been a
string of successes for Clinton. While Vice President Al Gore _
increasingly introduced to audiences as ``the next president of the
United States'' _ barnstormed through more than a dozen states,
Clinton, by most impartial accounts, bested the Republican
leadership in the budget deal; played midwife to a Middle East
land-for-peace agreement; worked within the G-7 group of
industrialized nations to stabilize the global economy, and grabbed
a few rays of the limelight when Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, returned
to space.
</P>
<P>
   One result must have comforted Gore, whose political style is
sometimes so wooden that he once compared himself to an oak plank.
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis of California, the Democratic victor in the
gubernatorial race, is even less colorful than Gore, but that did
not hurt him much in a race against a strongly ideological rival,
Attorney General Dan Lungren, a Republican. Gore may face a
right-wing Republican in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Or he may face Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a studiously
pragmatic politician re-elected by a sizable majority. Bush and his
younger brother Jeb, projected as the victor in the Florida
governor's race by exit polls, would be strongly placed in the
struggle for the Republican presidential nomination as governors of
two of the four biggest states.
</P>
<P>
   It looked, in fact, like a good election for moderates, with
possible victories for Davis, the two Bushes, Republican Gov.
George Voinovich of Ohio in a Senate race and several other
centrist congressional candidates compared with the avalanche of
right-wing triumphs only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This was particularly noticeable in gubernatorial races. As more
power has moved from Washington to statehouses, voters have seemed
eager to keep the blatant partisanship that has characterized
Washington out of governments closer to home.

<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush won a landslide victory
Tuesday, becoming the first Texas governor in 25 years to win
re-election to consecutive terms of office and setting the stage
for a presidential bid in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 75 percent of the state's precincts reporting,
Bush led Democratic challenger Garry Mauro 69 percent to 31
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate,
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place,'' Bush
said, with his wife, Laura, and daughter Jenna at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today's election says something more. It says that a
leader who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender
gap, can open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and
new voices,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush's devastating defeat of Mauro
triggered Republican victories of most statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry eked out a narrow victory over Democrat
John Sharp in the lieutenant governor's race, while Republicans
also won races for attorney general, land commissioner, agriculture
commissioner and railroad commissioner. The GOP also swept the
Court of Criminal Appeals and won all races for the state Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The race for comptroller, between Republican Carole Keeton
Rylander and Democrat Paul Hobby, was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep this year on the heels of the Republican tidal wave
of 1996 would leave Democrats without a single statewide
officeholder by January. The Democrats would be shut out of the
highest levels of state government for the first time since
Reconstruction ended 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent size of Bush's victory likely will enhance his
position as a possible candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000. Bush said he will spend time with his family
over Christmas discussing whether to make such a bid and would give
a first signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Texans during the campaign that I didn't know and
I'd make up my mind when the election was over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I intend to spend private time thinking about the
commitment and whether or not I want to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro congratulated Bush in a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him elections are partisan, but governing is bipartisan
and I was willing to do anything to help make Texas the proudest
place in the world'' Mauro told supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly proud of the way he and I conducted our
campaigns. We differed on the issues, but we never got personal,
never,'' Mauro said. ``I'm proud we ran a campaign of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President Bush of Houston.
Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, won election Tuesday as the governor of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say something to the newly elected governor of
Florida: Good going, brother!'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote in 1988
on his road to the White House, and he carried Texas by 40.5
percent in his 1992 national re-election loss to Democrat Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro announced for governor last year, many considered his
campaign to be an impossible task, taking on a highly popular
incumbent governor. Nothing Mauro tried ever caught hold against
Bush, ranging from attacks on Bush's positions on health care,
education, crime _ even his possible presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned Mauro in passing in his acceptance speech but not
by name: ``I want to commend my opponent for fighting the good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In early returns, Bush led Mauro on Tuesday in every region of
Texas, including the traditionally Democratic strongholds of East
Texas and South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wanted to win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote this year,
breaking the previous Republican record of 36 percent set by
attorney general candidate Roy Barrera in 1986. Bush said such a
vote would prove the Republican conservative message could appeal
to Hispanic voters so long as it was inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned as a ``compassionate conservative'' who wanted
to bring more Hispanic voters into the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A mis amigos Hispanos, gracias por su appoyo' _ thank you
for your support,'' Bush said ``to his Hispanic friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the major television networks and The
Associated Press showed Bush carried 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a major jump over the 28 percent he received in 1994 in his
successful effort to unseat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush would fulfill a goal of
carrying El Paso County.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Mauro was running strong with liberals,
supporters of President Clinton and among African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first Texas governor to win re-election to
consecutive four-year terms. Republican Gov. Bill Clements won
election to office in 1978 and then lost the 1982 election, coming
back to win office again in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Dolph Briscoe was the last governor to win
re-election to consecutive terms. Briscoe won in 1974, with 61
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. John Connally, who later became a Republican,
won re-election to a two-year term in 1964 with 84 percent of the
vote and then again in 1966 with 73 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The top Republican vote-getter in modern Texas was President
Nixon, who received 66 percent of the vote in his 1972 re-election
victory. President Reagan got 63.6 percent in 1984; U.S. Sen. Kay
Hutchison, 60.8 percent in 1994; and U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, 60
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate nominee Hugh Parmer is the previous Democratic low
vote-getter in a modern election, receiving 37 percent against
Gramm in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned for office with the argument that he had
fulfilled most of is 1994 campaign promises. He also made a series
of pledges for his second term in office:
</P>
<P>
   A $2 billion public-school property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Give $1.6 billion to public schools for classroom instruction,
reading programs, textbooks and facility construction.
</P>
<P>
   A $400 million sales tax cut, made by eliminating the tax on
over-the-counter medicines and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the franchise tax for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Crack down on welfare cheats.
</P>
<P>
   End the automatic ``social promotion'' of elementary school
students who are not academically prepared to advance to the next
grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, in this defeat, ended 16 years of service as Texas' land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters enthusiastically cheered and applauded when Mauro
took the stage at the Driskill Hotel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, what would y'all have done if I got 40 percent. If I'd
gotten 50, y'all'd have torn the place apart,'' Mauro said, with
early returns showing him with less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was helped in this campaign from Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mauro has known both of them since they
worked together on the 1972 Texas campaign of Democratic
presidential nominee George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons held fund-raisers for Mauro, which raised far less
than expected; both campaigned with Mauro in Texas, as did Vice
President Al Gore, who many expect to be the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of a healthy state economy and Bush's $15
million campaign swamping Mauro's $5 million effort, Mauro was
never able to break through. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn with a
tenacious political spirit and a huge campaign war chest, won
election to the U.S. Senate Tuesday night, toppling Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato and ending his reign as one of the most imposing figures
New York Republicans have produced in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat from Park Slope, adopted many of D'Amato's
own political techniques, from relentless fund raising to a
take-no-prisoners style of television advertising, to achieve a
goal that has eluded Democrats since 1980, when D'Amato slipped
into office in a race that was split three ways. In the process,
Schumer, 47, who has served nine terms in Congress, provided the
national Democratic Party with one of its biggest victories of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Schumer had
2,332,401 votes, or 54 percent. D'Amato had 1,901,978 votes, or 44
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, won the kind
of easy re-election that would have seemed unthinkable when Pataki,
an unknown state Senator from Peekskill in northern Westchester
County, defeated Mario Cuomo four years ago. He easily defeated
Peter Vallone, a Democrat and the New York City Council speaker,
with B. Thomas Golisano, a wealthy businessman from Rochester
running as the Independence Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, on the Liberal Party line, trailing far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dennis Vacco was in a tight contest with Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat and former state prosecutor in New York City.
And in a fourth statewide race, Comptroller Carl McCall, a Democrat
and the first black statewide elected official in New York history,
was re-elected, defeating Bruce Blakeman, the majority leader of
the Nassau County Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the outcome of the Senate race that in a single
evening altered New York's political landscape, eclipsing one of
the country's most ferocious political personalities and ending an
era in Republican politics in the state. It was a rare moment of
good news for New York Democrats in what has been a barren decade,
and it immediately established Schumer as the state party's
presumptive political leader.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato called Schumer at his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
to concede at 10:45 p.m. Schumer, moving to the song ``Simply the
Best,'' by Tina Turner, declared victory 25 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you, New York,'' Schumer said. ``You have
honored me with your trust. And I promise all New Yorkers that as
hard as I fought to win this election, I'll fight even harder for
everyone in this state, for the country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the bitter campaign, Schumer said, ``Campaigns more
often than not must focus on the thing that divides us. But
government and public service must focus more on the causes that
unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato conceded at 11:32 p.m. His speech was delayed, he said
to a murmur of laughter, by one last problem: His overcrowded
elevator got stuck between floors of the hotel. He congratulated
Schumer and wished him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the battle,'' he said in a six-minute speech. ``The
battle is over. I am proud of having carried the torch. And now the
leadership is going to go into the hands of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you from the bottom of my heart,'' he said. ``I love
you, the people of New York, thank you very much.'' Then the band
played the music from ``Rocky,'' his campaign theme, one more time.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Schumer with congratulations about
9:30, a half hour after polls closed. Clinton's gesture reflected
White House ebullience at the result; the president had campaigned
twice in the state with Schumer, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
the state four times to campaign against D'Amato, who ran the
Senate investigation into the Clintons' Whitewater business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer ran one of the most efficient and relentless campaigns
by a Democrat in New York in years, and certainly the most intense
challenge D'Amato faced during his 18 years in statewide politics.
Even D'Amato's friends came to view his campaign as a faltering and
uncertain effort that often seemed unable to adjust to a pugilistic
and nimble challenger and to a political climate that had changed
since D'Amato first came upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The formula that had served D'Amato so well for so many years _
a combination of heavy spending and an emphasis on his attention to
voters' local concerns _ apparently failed this time to erase
doubts about his ideology and his integrity. His attempts to
discredit Schumer first as a liberal and a New York City partisan,
a strategy that brought D'Amato victory in 1986 and 1992, did not
work this time. A mid-campaign course correction in which D'Amato
began to attack Schumer for missing votes in Congress in order to
run for Senate failed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, interviews with voters leaving the polls throughout the
state suggested that it was Schumer who had set the tone of this
campaign, even as D'Amato outspent him nearly two to one, with
relentless emphasis on a single campaign attack: ``Too many lies
for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of voters surveyed said that they did not
consider D'Amato honest or trustworthy. And about 60 percent said
they thought D'Amato had, after 18 years, been in office too long.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly striking finding in the exit poll, D'Amato
received the support of only one in four Jewish voters _ about half
as well as he did with the same group of voters in 1986 and 1992.
That figure strongly suggested that D'Amato had been hurt both by
his decision to enlist Holocaust survivors to attack Schumer's
record on Jewish issues, an effort that Schumer and other Jewish
leaders denounced as inappropriate. He may also have been damaged
by his later use of a Yiddish vulgarism to describe Schumer, who is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The fall-off in support explains why D'Amato spent so many hours
at the end of the campaign in conservative Jewish communities,
speaking to voters who presumably should have been solidly in his
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pataki did extremely well Tuesday, his success was
tempered by D'Amato's loss. It was D'Amato who paved the way for
Pataki's victory four years ago, and Pataki tried to repay the
favor this week, appearing constantly with D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of D'Amato, Pataki is now the dominant Republican
in New York, but there are clearly limits to his influence with
voters, and that might complicate any effort by Pataki's promoters
to present him as a figure of national potential in 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The twin events of Pataki's victory and D'Amato's loss presented
a difficult moment Tuesday night for the small group of Republicans
who ran both campaigns. Both men's supporters gathered at the same
midtown hotel Tuesday night, and so the same stage was the site
first of Pataki's victory speech and then of D'Amato's concession.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato did not appear with Pataki when he came down to declare
victory, but the Republican governor paid tribute to the senator,
without making mention of what had befallen the man most
responsible for Pataki's rapid rise in state politics. ``He will
always be a great senator for the people of New York state,''
Pataki said to applause from an emotionally conflicted crowd at the
Hilton Towers that had by then seen the television projections of
his loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican crowd was at once exhilarated and mournful, torn
between Pataki's victory and the loss of a man who had been a
fixture in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we lost something _ part of the fabric of New York
_ to not be able to say, `Senator Al D'Amato,''' said Bernadette
Castro, the state Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation, who was her party's candidate for Senate against
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But even Castro suggested some concern about the way D'Amato had
run this campaign. ``I know what the senator's done, his substance,
the breast cancer research,'' Castro said. ``As a senator he
accomplished so much, and I wish he had talked more about all the
things he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   The race's $33 million price tag _ $20 million for D'Amato, $13
million for Schumer _ made it the most expensive campaign in New
York history and the second most expensive Senate campaign ever.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, turnout seemed about the same as in 1994: 38
percent of the state's voting age population.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's victory was larger than many Democrats and Republicans
had expected, and appeared to reflect the extensive
get-out-the-vote effort Democrats made. Schumer won three-quarters
of the vote in New York City. In the suburbs, Schumer won almost
half the votes and upstate, the part of New York where the Brooklyn
Democrat was considered weakest, he won about 45 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's supporters burst into applause when he and his family
emerged. Schumer did not take the stage until after he got a call
from D'Amato, though, in an unusual move, he did not wait for
D'Amato to concede before giving his 13-minute acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent most of the past year excoriating D'Amato as
untrustworthy and a political extremist, and when he first
mentioned D'Amato's name, the crowd responded with a low chorus of
boos.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer raised his hands to quiet his supporters. ``Senator
D'Amato and I have often held very different views,'' he said.
``But there is one area where I believe we can all agree on Senator
D'Amato's tenure in public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always been a hard worker. He has always fought hard
for the causes he believes in. I respect his tenacity, and his
family should be proud of his service.''

 (SUBS to update)  (lh)

<P>
   Democrats roared back in the midterm elections Tuesday, winning
impressive victories in crucial Senate and gubernatorial races
around the country despite months of dire predictions by both
Republicans and Democrats that President Clinton's scandal would
drag down his party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans maintained control of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, the Democrats' strong showing, in an off-year
election when the party in the White House typically loses seats,
made it far less likely that the Congress would move ahead
aggressively with its impeachment inquiry of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not come close to the goals publicly stated by
party leaders to win a magic 60 Senate seats, the number needed to
cut off filibusters by Democrats blocking Republican legislation,
or to substantially widen the party's narrow 11-seat edge in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   As House races were still being tallied Tuesday night, with four
incumbent Republicans losing, Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman
of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, predicted that
his party would defy expectations and even pick up ``a couple of
seats _ at least.'' No president's party in this century has made a
net gain in House seats midway through a second presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republicans had hoped to
transform the campaign into a public outcry for Clinton's
impeachment. But as the returns came, many party leaders appeared
to be backing off from the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich sought Tuesday night to change the subject from
impeachment, insisting, ``Republicans have never been particularly
fixated on the issue of impeachment.'' And he play down the
disappointing performance of many Republicans by focusing on the
long view. ``This will be the first time in 70 years that the
Republicans have kept control of the House for a third term,'' he
said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, said the voters' message about impeachment
could not be clearer: ``Wrap this up. Get it off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most coveted single prize of the day, Gray Davis, the
lieutenant governor of California, defeated Dan Lungren, the
Republican attorney general, to become the first Democrat elected
governor of the state in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   But since Davis had outpaced Lungren in the polls for months,
Democrats were celebrating surprising triumphs in races that had
been viewed as excruciatingly close. Many Democrats were relieved
that Sen. Barbara Boxer of California had fought off a spirited
challenge from state Treasurer Matt Fong, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest upset of the day was the ouster of Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., by Rep. Charles Schumer. In another major
upset, John Edwards, a Democratic trial lawyer, defeated Sen. Lauch
Faircloth of North Carolina. And Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a
leading advocate of campaign finance reform who significantly
limited his spending, still defeated Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   The election was also marked by a resurgence of Democrats in the
Deep South, spurred in part by better-than-expected turnout among
black voters. In South Carolina, Jim Hodges, a former Democratic
state representative, ousted Gov. David Beasley, a rising star in
his party who was chairman of the Republican Governors Association.
That state's Democratic senator, Ernest Hollings, turned back a
vigorous challenge from Rep. Bob Inglis, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat, toppled Gov. Fob
James, a Republican. And in a race to replace Gov. Zell Miller of
Georgia, a Democrat, Roy Barnes, a Democratic state legislator,
defeated Guy Millner, a Republican businessman.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Gov. Parris Glendening, a Democrat, fought off a
tough challenge in a rematch with Ellen Sauerbrey. The Maryland
contest was so competitive that Clinton, in his last political trip
of the campaign, traveled to Baltimore on Sunday to implore
Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans did pile up some important wins Tuesday.
In Illinois, Peter Fitzgerald, a wealthy state senator, ousted Sen.
Carol Moseley-Braun, a Democrat who was captapulted to Washington
in the year of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also maintained their domination of governorships
around the country. Jeb Bush, the younger son of former President
George Bush, won the Florida governorship in his second try for the
office, building something of a political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was re-elected by a
wide margin, solidifying his position as the early favorite among
many in his party for the Republican presidential nomination in
2000. It was the first time in 24 years that a governor of either
party had been re-elected to a consecutive term in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other incumbent Republicans who were re-elected governors of
major states _ some of whom also have presidential ambitions _ were
George Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Voters were hard-pressed to describe an overarching issue on
which they based their vote. In interviews as they left their
polling stations, voters cited many issues that moved them to vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marked contrast to four years ago, when voters rebelled
against incumbents and handed control of the House to Republicans
for the first time in 40 years. Two years ago, Clinton was
re-elected, and some voters said they were disturbed by what they
viewed as the extremism of Gingrich and the new Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Many races were so close that they were not decided into well
past midnight. While Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
was a subtext for the entire election season, voters leaving the
polls said they were not particularly driven by the scandal one way
or another. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader,
insisted Tuesday night that impeachment had never ignited as an
issue. ``If it was,'' he said, ``we should be winning a lot more
seats right now.'' Lott added: ``There wasn't really a national
theme. It depended on issues at the local level, personalities, and
what kind of campaign they ran.''
</P>
<P>
   In other returns, former Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat, recaptured
a Senate seat from Indiana that had been held by Republicans since
his father, Birch Bayh, was defeated for re-election in 1980. But
Republicans also grabbed a Democratic seat in Ohio. Gov. George
Voinovich was elected to succeed Sen. John Glenn, who was orbiting
Earth this week aboard the shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators who were re-elected included Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland; Bob Graham of Florida; Patrick Leahy of
Vermont; Christopher Dodd of Connecticut; John Breaux of Louisiana,
and Byron Dorgan of South Dakota. Republicans who were re-elected
included the party's whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma; Judd Gregg of
New Hampshire; Sam Brownback of Kansas; Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania; Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado; Christopher Bond
of Missouri, and John McCain of Arizona. Sen. Richard Shelby of
Alabama was re-elected in his first race since he switched to the
Republican party in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors who were elected to new terms included these
Democrats: Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Howard Dean of
Vermont. Among Republican governors, Frank Keating romped to
victory in Oklahoma, as did John Rowland in Connecticut, Bill
Graves in Kansas, Lincoln Almond of Rhode Island and Don Sundquist
in Tennessee. Mike Huckabee won his first full term in Arkansas. He
had taken office when his predecessor resigned after a Whitewater
conviction. In Maine, Angus King, an Independent, also won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had been concerned about spotty turnout in both
parties. In the end, fewer than four in 10 of adults of voting age
population went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In some heavily black precincts, which tend to be overwhelmingly
Democratic, turnout among voters was reported as impressive. In
Rep. Elijah Cummings' largely urban Baltimore district, turnout
among black voters was heavier than in past races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went today, folks were lined up,'' said Cummings,
a two-term Democrat. In one inner-city precinct, 187 people had
voted by noon, nearly four times the turnout at midday at the same
precinct in 1994, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings attributed the surge to Clinton's appeal in the
district on Sunday. ``This was the first time African-Americans had
the opportunity to do something in support of the president,''
Cummings said. ``People are fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters were largely approving of Clinton, confident about the
economy, resentful of the impending impeachment hearings and
disappointed in Congress' performance, according to a survey of
voters leaving polling places around the country. Voters said the
issues that mattered to them most were education, taxes, Social
Security, jobs and ethical and moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lewinsky affair loomed over the entire campaign
season, 6 in 10 voters surveyed said they did not think the
president should be impeached, did not approve of the way Congress
has handled the matter, and did not even want the House to hold
impeachment hearings. Voters were divided on whether, as a lesser
punishment, Congress should censure Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation into the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton has been buoyed by a high job approval
rating, and voters Tuesday said they liked the way he was running
the country. More than half said they approved of the job he was
doing, even though most had a negative view of his personal
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute television blitz by the Republican Party
to remind Americans of Clinton's conduct during the inquiry, 6 in
10 voters surveyed said they disapproved of the way Republicans in
Congress had handled the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews with voters also help explain why Clinton and
other prominent Democrats invoked Gingrich in their drives to move
people to the polls. More than half the voters said they did not
have a favorable view of Gingrich; those people voted largely for
the Democratic House candidates in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp contrast to the midterm elections four years ago,
voters said overwhelmingly that the nation's economy was strong and
that they fully expected it to stay that way. People also
registered contentment with their own lives. Most voters said their
family's finances had either improved in the last two years, or at
least not deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts described the elections as a competition
between the most extreme wings of both parties, half the voters
Tuesday described themselves as moderates. The survey of voters
also found a gender gap of about 7 percentage points, roughly what
it was in the 1994 elections; men voted more heavily for
Republicans while women favored Democrats.

SMOOTH SAILING FOR NEW YORK'S CONGRESSIONAL INCUMBENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All 27 of the incumbents seeking re-election to the House of
Representatives from New York state sailed to victory Tuesday, and
four open seats went to two Republicans and two Democrats, leaving
the makeup of the delegation unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Joseph Crowley, D-Queens, who has spent 12
years in the state Assembly, easily defeated James Dillon, a
Republican. Crowley will replace Rep. Thomas Manton, a Democrat who
is stepping down after seven terms in Congress. Crowley, who was
handpicked by Manton to run, will represent the 7th Congressional
District, which covers parts of Queens and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m.
Wednesday, the vote was: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crowley: 45,082 (67 percent) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dillon: 18,167 (27 percent)
</P>
<P>
   In the 9th Congressional District, Anthony Weiner, D-Brooklyn,
easily won the seat that Rep. Charles Schumer is giving up after 18
years. He did not face a serious challenge from his Republican
opponent, Louis Telano, because the district, which encompasses
parts of Brooklyn and Queens, is overwhelmingly Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m.
Wednesday, the vote was: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weiner: 63,774 (66 percent) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telano 23,065 (24 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat who won her seat after her husband
was killed in the 1992 Long Island Rail Road shootings, defeated
Gregory Becker, a Republican, in what turned out to be a tight race
in the 4th Congressional District, in Nassau County. Early returns
showed Becker ahead, but by 12:10 a.m. Wednesday, with 92 percent
of election districts reporting, Mrs. McCarthy had 53 percent of
the vote, compared with 47 percent for her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Two seats being vacated by powerful Republicans _ Gerald Solomon
of Glens Falls, who is serving his 10th term, and Bill Paxon of
Amherst, who is serving his fifth _ were won by close allies of
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. John Sweeney, a Republican who worked as
deputy secretary to Gov. George Pataki and as executive director of
the Republican State Committee, won Solomon's seat. He will
represent the 22nd Congressional District, which stretches from the
Adirondacks to the mid-Hudson Valley, covering parts of nine
counties. His Democratic challenger was Jean Bordewich.
</P>
<P>
   With all election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday,
the vote was: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney: 100,257 (55 percent) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bordewich: 76,029 (42 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reynolds, minority leader of the Assembly for the last
three years, captured Paxon's seat in the 27th Congressional
District in western New York. Reynolds is a former insurance and
real estate broker who won his Assembly seat in 1988. He and
Sweeney both support lowering taxes, but Reynolds is more
conservative on social issues, opposing abortion rights and gun
control. He faced opposition from Bill Cook, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   With 85 percent of election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m.
Wednesday, the vote was: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds: 83,658 (58 percent) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cook: 61,285 (42 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-Saugerties, who was considered one of
the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress, defeated two
challengers in the 26th Congressional District: William Bud Walker,
a Republican apple farmer, and Randall Terry, a founder of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue who ran on the Right to Life
Party line.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 percent of election districts reporting at 12:30 a.m.
Wednesday, Hinchey had 98,141 votes, or 62 percent; Walker had
48,168, or 31 percent, and Terry had 11,239, or 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The race in the 26th District, which sprawls from Newburgh
through Binghamton to Ithaca, was emblematic of the struggle
between moderate and conservative forces in the Republican Party.
Terry railed against the party during his campaign, saying it had
failed true conservatives by tolerating abortion, excessive taxes
and homosexuality. Most party leaders supported Walker, but Terry's
candidacy undoubtedly helped Hinchey win.

`POTHOLEVILLE' LAMENTS LOSS OF THE ISLAND PARK SENATOR
</HEADLINE>
 (See also: ELN-NY-D'AMATO, ELN-NY-SCHUMER, ELN-NY-STATE,
ELN-NY-RDP, ELN-NY-SCHUMER-SCENE) 
(nk) 
By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAND PARK, N.Y. _ As soon as the clock on the wood-paneled
wall struck 9 Tuesday night _ marking the close of polling across
the state _ the volume of the television set at the American Legion
hall here rose, and the nervous murmuring of the gathered D'Amato
faithful died. This just in: The 18-year tenure of Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, Island Park's favorite son, had just ended.
</P>
<P>
   The more breathlessly the reporter on the fuzzy screen talked,
the angrier the people in the hall became. Referring to D'Amato's
opponent as ``Senator-elect Chuck Schumer'' really annoyed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot,'' some muttered; others used words that the
occasionally profane D'Amato might have echoed. When the station
returned to its regularly scheduled programming, few in the room
knew what to say, so they just stared at a show called ``Just Shoot
Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Papatsos, the village's mayor, tapped a Styrofoam cup
on a table. Edwin (Doc) McGann, the local Republican leader and a
close friend of the senator's, stood frozen in the center of the
room; hearing his nightmare being broadcast had left him
temporarily paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   When a young Republican jokingly asked whether he could still
make some calls to potential voters, no one laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the end, the people at the American Legion hall had
done what they had been trained to do by the Nassau County
Republican Committee operation, often called the best and most
disciplined in the country: They got out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With voter registration lists spread across fold-out tables,
they drew red lines through the names of those who had voted and
telephoned those who had not. Car rides were offered, as well as
gentle reminders to do the right thing and vote. The village is so
small, the practice so routine, that these phone conversations were
often conducted on a first-name basis.
</P>
<P>
   Since this village of almost 5,000 is linked so inextricably to
the senator that it is sometimes called D'Amatoville, their efforts
might appear to be little more than Election Day busy work; after
all, everyone knows that Island Park will vote D'Amato. The senator
grew up here, began his political career here, still has family
here. A large measure of his pothole-filling image comes from the
attention he pays to Island Park and Long Island's southwestern
shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call it nervous energy,'' said Michael McGinty, a local
Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   And so they worked into the night, blocking out the unsettling
``too close to call'' reports coming from the television, hearing
in every train's wail the potential for more D'Amato voters about
to be disgorged at the Long Island Rail Road station a few hundred
feet away. They fueled themselves with chicken-and-salad dinners,
sweetened by Entenmann's cakes and wines that pour from a box.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the friends and foes of D'Amato took comfort
in whatever information they could glean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to him this morning,'' Anthony Cornachio, a lawyer
for the village and a close D'Amato ally, said at noon. ``He's on a
high.''
</P>
<P>
   But Annette Snow, perhaps D'Amato's most persistent critic, said
she heard that the senator was seen crying in Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., the senator was spotted on Long Beach Road in the
back seat of a town car, on a telephone, looking grim.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later, McGann announced to those at the American
Legion hall that he had just talked with the senator. ``He can't
understand it,'' he said. ``His numbers show that he's 2 points up.
We have to just sit and hope and pray. It's not dead yet!''
</P>
<P>
   People cheered. But then, one by one, they filed out of the
hall, seeking comfort from one another in remembrances of previous
races that D'Amato had won against predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just got to have faith,'' said Robert Tice, a red D'Amato
hat resting on his head. ``But if the senator does lose, it'll be a
black day for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   With an envelope stuffed with computerized election results from
Island Park, McGann left the hall at 10:30 to report to Republican
headquarters in Westbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over, I guess,'' he said. ``It's so hard figuring out.''
</P>

N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for updating)  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The race for attorney general of New York state hung on a
razor-thin margin early Wednesday morning, with the Democratic
challenger, Eliot Spitzer, holding a lead of 33,000 votes out of
3.6 million cast over the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   With 95 percent of the state's precincts reporting at 1 a.m.,
the vote was:
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer: 1,882,236 (48%)
</P>
<P>
   Vacco: 1,849,401 (47%)
</P>
<P>
   State election officials, however, said that 184,225 absentee
ballots had been mailed in by voters, only about 22 percent of
which were from the heavily Democratic area around New York City.
It could be a week before those ballots are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the strong showing by Spitzer, a Democrat, stunned the
state's political establishment, and was at least partially
attributable to the unexpectedly strong vote for Rep. Charles
Schumer in the U.S. Senate race. ``Eliot will gleefully ride on
those coattails,'' said Steven Goldstein, Spitzer's spokesman. He
later added: ``I'm nervous as hell and my feet are jelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the coattails, campaign officials said one of the biggest
factors in Spitzer's surge was an incident in the last week of the
campaign in which Vacco reportedly referred to ``banditos'' outside
``bodegas'' in a discussion of criminals affected by the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco denied using the word ``bandito,'' but the report outraged
Hispanic leaders around New York City. It occurred just as voters
were beginning to pay attention to a race that had never been at
the top of the news, and did not create a favorable impression of
an incumbent that few voters had come to know. Spitzer capitalized
on the comment, and also stressed Vacco's opposition to abortion,
accusing him of fostering an environment that led to the recent
killing of a Buffalo abortion doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the race, Vacco certainly did a lot to revive
our campaign,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant who was an
adviser to Spitzer. ``His record on abortion was certainly a
factor, and the bandito gaffe was another major factor. We thought
it could go either way, based on our last poll, but it turned out
to be a surprise even to the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's internal polls never showed him winning the race,
staffers said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the evening, the momentum appeared to be with
Spitzer, who took an early lead. But Vacco drew closer as midnight
approached, occasionally pulling ahead and then dropping back, and
the race remained tight long after other major candidates had
finished their victory and concession speeches and headed home.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial factor in the tight race was the presence on the
ballot of state Sen. Catherine Abate, who lost the Democratic
primary to Spitzer but appeared as an Independent Party candidate.
She got 2 percent of the vote, which would probably have gone to
Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, 39, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer and former prosecutor
who won the Democratic primary this year after coming in last four
years ago, vigorously assailed Vacco for the same reasons some
newspapers' editorial pages failed to endorse the incumbent:
Vacco's decision to fire more than 100 experienced lawyers on his
staff, who had been hired by his Democratic predecessors, and
replace them with younger, inexperienced lawyers with ties to the
Republican and Conservative Parties. Because of the firings, many
of his office's cases were thrown into disarray, and several judges
complained publicly about the competence of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's frequent attempts to remind voters of Vacco's
opposition to abortion were somewhat defused when a lawyer for
several abortion clinics said Vacco's office had actually been
helpful in securing court decisions that set up protective barriers
around the clinics. But Spitzer raised the issue at every debate
and at most campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   As he did four years ago, Vacco, 46, sought to make the election
a referendum on crime-fighting, playing on the common misimpression
among voters that New York's attorney general, like his federal
counterpart, has a major role in criminal law enforcement. In fact,
the state office mostly defends New York state in civil lawsuits
and enforces laws not given to local district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently said at campaign events that his top priority was
to protect citizens from crime, and often pointed to the falling
crime rates around the state as evidence of his success over the
last four years.

DEMOCRAT BOXER SURGES TO SENATE VICTORY CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 
(Updates with Boxer victory) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
and TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Haunted by low standing in polls during her
six-year term, incumbent Barbara Boxer capped a strong campaign by
surging to victory Tuesday over Republican Matt Fong in one of the
most closely watched Senate races in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   After battling Republican Fong in almost a dead heat, according
to opinion polls, Boxer pulled ahead aided by a strong Democratic
get-out-the-vote effort and appearances by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are wonderful,'' Boxer told enthusiastic supporters on
Election Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we couldn't do it. They said I was a fluke of
history. They said I was too progressive. They said I was too
supportive of the president. They said I was too feisty,'' she said
of her critics. ``They missed the deep support I have here in the
greatest state of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had targeted the outspokenly liberal Boxer, 57, who
was viewed as vulnerable this year in her first statewide bid for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer narrowly won her Senate bid in 1992 against Bruce
Herschensohn, a more conservative candidate than Fong. GOP
strategists, and even some Democrats, believed she would have a
harder time this year against a more moderate rival.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the final weeks of the campaign, the Republican
National Committee reportedly pulled back on some of its funding
promises as Boxer surged to a lead in public opinion polls and Fong
showed weakness in developing his own fund-raising base.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer seemed tireless in her campaigning in the final weeks,
traveling throughout the state trying to build support and get her
supporters to the polls while running an attack campaign against
Fong for his positions on the environment and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, 44, the son of one of the state's most popular politicians
_ former Secretary of State March Fong Eu _ experienced some
difficulty coming out of a tough GOP primary in June, where he
overcame an expensive challenge from San Diego businessman Darrell
Issa.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve and a
graduate of the Air Force Academy, also found himself mired in a
number of controversies in the final weeks of the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was the disclosure that he made a $50,000
contribution to the conservative Traditional Values Coalition,
which angered some of his more moderate supporters _ particularly
gays and lesbians in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, he signed a pledge to support gay rights
issues, which angered some conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   A main tactic Fong used in his campaign was to emphasize the
idea that he would provide a more moderate voice in the Senate than
Boxer and be more capable of working with other members.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer was seen as vulnerable, partly because of her voting
record and partly because of the scandals involving President
Clinton and Boxer's quiet criticism of him compared to her past
vocal criticism of Republicans involved in sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of those issues, and with the race appearing to be a
virtual dead heat according to some opinion polls, the Boxer-Fong
contest drew national attention and national fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton appeared at several Boxer fund-raisers in
October, as did first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's daughter is married to the first lady's brother.
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, as news coverage of the Monica Lewinsky
affair has waned, the public's interest in it also seemed to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republican efforts to boost it as a campaign issue
seemingly have backfired, with private opinion polls suggesting
that it might even be encouraging more people to vote, particularly
women and political moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also was seen as benefiting from various get-out-the-vote
efforts, particularly by Latinos and organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Boxer moved to the San Francisco Bay
Area in 1965 with her husband and became active in politics as a
volunteer in the anti-Vietnam War movement.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors and
then went on to Congress, where she gained attention for her
criticism of the Department of Defense and its spending.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ran on the same ballot
and benefited from the ``year of the women'' sentiment following
controversies involving former Republican Sen. Robert Packwood of
Oregon and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Fong came to politics from a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   His adoptive mother was a popular Democratic Assemblywoman from
the Bay Area and he remembers campaigning for her in different
elections, being paid 25 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she became California's secretary of state and, still
later, took the post of U.S. ambassador to Micronesia. Although she
won statewide office as a Democrat, her son registered as a
Republican in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to a vacancy on the state Board of Equalization
by Gov. Pete Wilson. In 1994, he won statewide election to his
current post of state Treasurer.

CSUN ATHLETIC DIRECTOR, AIDE QUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Moving in the ``a'' national news file, the ``s'' sports news file
and in the ``n'' California news file.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California State University, Northridge Athletic
Director Paul Bubb and his top assistant, Judy Brame, resigned
under pressure Tuesday a week after the arrest of the women's
basketball coach on federal cocaine trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations followed an internal probe ordered by
university President Blenda Wilson into women's basketball coach
Michael Abraham's arrest. Questions had been raised about whether
Bubb and Brame had been warned by student athletes about Abraham's
possible drug use up to two years ago and whether they handled the
situation properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is troubling to us that we're not able to understand the
full details of this arrest, but all of us have an obligation to be
sensitive and watchful of those in authority over young people,''
Wilson said at a news conference Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it (involves alcohol, drugs or mental illness) ...
it's something that should be fairly understood. Any behavior that
does not create a positive environment for students should be of
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the resignations, she said in a statement: ``I
respect the personal responsibility both have taken ... and thank
them for their years of service to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, the athletic director since 1995, and Brame failed to
inform _ according to Wilson _ senior university officials of
allegations of alleged drug use by Abraham, which were made to Bubb
by members of the team following the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bubb and I) had talked Monday night about the
circumstances,'' Wilson said. ``The content was that there was a
seriousness to the conclusion of the internal investigation about
prior knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations are effective Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, 41, is leaving the university while Brame, a tenured
professor, is being reassigned to an academic post within the
kinesiology department, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Brame, senior associate athletic director, became acting women's
basketball coach following Abraham's arrest and also has resigned
from that post.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson ordered the internal investigation, conducted by Mary Ann
Cummins-Prager, assistant vice president of student affairs,
Thursday after learning Bubb had been approached by the players in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb said publicly Oct. 28 that he ``never'' heard anything
linking Abraham with drugs but later admitted players had voiced
concerns to him about Abraham's erratic behavior. The internal
investigation found Bubb subsequently told Brame, 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``As information about Michael Abraham has been reviewed over
the past week by the university, my judgment has been questioned in
regards to confidential information I received from
student-athletes in February 1997,'' Bubb said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I found some of the issues the student-athletes brought
to me to be true and I addressed those issues with coach Abraham, I
did not have information presented to me during my review which
could confirm drug use by coach Abraham.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb said he spoke with members of California State University,
Northridge's athletic department, student-athletes and senior
members of Oregon State's athletic department, Abraham's former
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, I confronted coach Abraham and asked if he was
using drugs and he denied the allegation,'' Bubb said. ``I
considered the matter closed and did not forward any further
information to the vice president or president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb was visibly shaken and needed to pause during his
statement. He had been with CSUN since 1990 and was the school's
athletic director since July 1995. Wilson said at no point did she
ask Bubb to resign, saying it wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Both positions will be filled on an interim basis later this
week, Wilson said. National searches are to take place for
permanent replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who met with the women's team Tuesday afternoon, said
players and assistants are expected to meet and discuss candidates
to take over the women's program for now. A senior women's coach
could oversee the basketball program, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Wilson wants a current coach to fill the athletic
director's job on an interim basis. One candidate is men's
basketball coach Bobby Braswell, sources said, and Fred Strache,
associate vice president of student affairs, also is expected to
make a push for the interim athletic director spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult time for our university,'' Braswell
said. ``People have been hurt. Student-athletes, staff, the school,
and it was probably the right thing for Paul and Judy to do at this
time. It's hard. It's hard for me because of my relationship with
Paul. Both Judy and Paul have done a lot for this school.''
</P>
<P>
   Brame declined comment but did release a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I care deeply about Cal State Northridge athletics and
my effectiveness in this area, I have concluded that it is in the
best interest of the program for me to resign my administrative
responsibilities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My various roles in the athletic department for the past 24
years have constituted the major part of my professional career,
and I have found it rewarding. I look forward to returning to an
academic career.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The news of Bubb's resignation was expected among the coaches
after a Tuesday morning meeting with Wilson, but news of Brame's
resignation from the athletic department was met with surprise and
regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really shocked with the day's events,'' said softball
coach Janet Sherman. ``They've both given their hearts to the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   During the morning meeting, Wilson said many coaches suggested a
voluntary drug-testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, who earns $86,700 a year, was hired in 1990 by the
University Foundation, CSUN's independent fund-raising arm, as the
director of athletics development. He became interim director of
athletics in July 1995 and was appointed permanent director the
following April following a nationwide search.
</P>
<P>
   Brame, who earns $90,400 annually, started at the university in
1974 as a physical education professor. She was promoted in 1978 to
associate professor and became a full professor in 1982. She became
senior associate director of athletics, her most current title, in
July 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have come down on the athletic department, so
someone's got to feel the burden,'' said football player Vito
Clemente. ``I guess it's got to be at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is the question of what happens should Abraham
be cleared of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was arrested the night of Oct. 27 by the FBI. He was
charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to
distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. He has been placed on
paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bubb knew what was going on and still let Abraham work,
then that was doing a disservice not only to the students, but to
CSUN as a whole,'' said Jacque Wilson, a 22-year-old music major
from Chatsworth.

ELECTION AFTERMATH: `NOT A CHANCE' FOR IMPEACHMENT  
 (ANALYSIS)
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rarely had so much been at stake for a president
whose name didn't even appear on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's Democratic Party held its ground in Congress
in Tuesday's elections, bucking an historical trend that usually
sees the chief executive's party lose dozens of seats in the middle
of his term.
</P>
<P>
   In battling Republicans to a surprising standstill, the
Democrats may have thwarted any realistic possibility the GOP has
of impeaching Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal,
according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have virtually sent Bill Clinton a green
light to start dating again,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia political scientist. ``After this, there is not a chance
in the world of getting 67 votes in the Senate (required for
impeachment),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans began the night with an 11-seat
advantage, but Democrats appeared headed for a net gain of several
seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans previously had 55 Senate seats to the
Democrats' 45, and ended up with a margin of 55-44, with one race
(Nevada) undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six governorships were up for a vote, and Democrats
seemed likely to hold Republicans to a stalemate or pick up one.
The GOP controlled 32 governorships going in.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike football, a tie in this election, at least for Clinton,
was as good as a win.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of an anti-Clinton mandate will leave congressional
Republican leaders in the precarious position of trying to placate
the president's critics in the conservative wing without seeming to
ignore voters who want the scandal to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything close to a status quo election would have been a huge
victory for Bill Clinton, and there are two reasons why,'' said
Allan Lichtman, an American University historian.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that ``second-term presidents in midterm elections
usually take huge drubbings. And two, like it or not, this election
had to be interpreted as a referendum on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Every midterm election but one (1934) since the Civil War has
seen the party of the president lose ground in the House. Over the
past 60 years, the losses have averaged 32 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans spent $10 million on a late flurry of television ads
spotlighting the Clinton scandal and his subsequent credibility
problems. But voters said in exit polls that they were far more
interested in such issues as education, the economy and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters also expressed disapproval with the GOP's plans for
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters may say, `We didn't vote on impeachment,' but that
itself is a message,'' Lichtman said. ``The dog didn't bark in this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results are not likely to derail the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment inquiry, scheduled to begin this month.
Many of the panel's members said they plan to decide the issue on
its own merits, regardless of the election results.
</P>
<P>
   But the electoral outcome certainly increases the chances that
Congress will speed up the inquiry and negotiate some sort of
lesser reprimand, analysts said. Impeachment momentum in the House
will be blunted because there is a diminished chance of ever
gaining enough Senate votes to actually oust Clinton, said Arthur
Miller, a University of Iowa political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will now be very difficult for Congress to move ahead and
vote the articles of impeachment,'' Miller said. ``This may propel
a number of very respected Republican leaders to come out and say,
`We understand what the American public is saying here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's House elections were particularly surprising, given
that losses are normally severe for presidents in the position
Clinton finds himself: the second year of a second term. For
example, Franklin Roosevelt's Democrats lost 71 House seats in that
situation in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the din of the election were complaints from
several public-interest groups that, for those voters who bothered
to turn out Tuesday, comparatively few real choices were avalable.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause, a government watchdog group, said congressional
incumbents raised so much money that most challengers couldn't
compete because the playing field was not level.
</P>
<P>
   House incumbents enjoyed a 10-1 advantage over their opponents
in funding from political action committees through Sept. 30, and a
9-1 advantage in cash on hand, Common Cause said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1998 elections show that as far as big money is concerned,
we don't have a Democratic or Republican Party, but an incumbents'
party,'' said Common Cause President Ann McBride.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's U.S. House members all raised significantly more money
during the campaign than their election opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Voting and Democracy, a non-partisan educational
group, ranked Arizona below the national average in staging truly
competitive House campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 through 1996, only four out of 43 elections for the
U.S. House in Arizona saw margins of victory of less than 10
percent, the center said. &QL;

NAPOLITANO LEADS MCGOVERN IN AG RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney Janet Napolitano, a Democrat who sold
voters early on her experience, was leading a tight race with
Republican Tom McGovern for Arizona attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to pull this one out,'' Napolitano said
late Tuesday as she held a 2 percentage-point lead with about 90
percent of the vote tallied.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, 39, a former insurance lawyer, declined to comment. He
was waiting for final results, which will include 40,000 ballots
that remained uncounted in Republican-dominated Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   State Elections Director Jessica Funkhouser said the ballots
were sent to early voters but not mailed back to the County
Elections Department. Instead, they were turned in at various
polling places on Election Day, which is legal.
</P>
<P>
   County election workers must verify that these voters cast
ballots nowhere else before their votes can be counted. The tally
was expected to be completed today.
</P>
<P>
   A Napolitano victory would be a rare prize for Democrats, who
saw virtually all of the state's top offices fall to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran a very straightforward race,'' Napolitano said as
incomplete election results reflected her lead in polls taken late
in the race. ``The message was experience. I stayed very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern started the general election race at a disadvantage but
built up an early lead in the polls. He had won a bruising primary
over Sen. John Kaites, R-Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Muddied and broke, McGovern readily joined Napolitano in a
clean-campaign pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Unopposed in the primary election and armed with a $250,000 war
chest, Napolitano was able to get on television first with a
message to early voters. She touted her experience as a prosecutor
and support from firefighters and police.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rallied for a fund-raiser Oct. 15, allowing McGovern
to launch a $100,000 TV blitz. It reminded voters that Napolitano
was appointed by President Clinton as a federal prosecutor _ in
contrast to McGovern's background as a special assistant to current
Attorney General Grant Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates appeared together more than a dozen times and
kept personal attacks to a minimum. Mostly, they clashed on
abortion, child abuse and a multibillion-dollar state lawsuit
against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern promised to appeal federal rulings against state laws
to ban some late-term abortions and require consent of parents when
minors want to end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano, 40, a former Planned Parenthood board member, said
she would seriously consider dropping those appeals. The
Legislature should redraft the laws to comply with U.S. Supreme
Court decisions on women's privacy rights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern said he would assign assistant attorneys general to
represent abused children directly instead of advising the
Department of Economic Security in hearings on separating these
children from their families.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano said the plan made no sense. She promised to review
thousands of child abuse cases personally, assigning priorities to
ensure that the most vulnerable children are protected first.
</P>
<P>
   While McGovern vowed to represent Arizona personally in a
federal-court trial over the health care costs of tobacco,
Napolitano said she would leave the litigating to contract lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   She vowed personal supervision of the 300 attorneys employed by
the Attorney General's Office to handle everything from acquiring
highway right of way to imposing the death penalty. &QL;

STATE LOTTERY STAYS, COCKFIGHTING GOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK, KATHLEEN INGLEY   
 and RUSS WILES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona voters want their elections clean, their desert
preserved and their gambling via the state Lottery, not over
cockfights.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow vote, Arizonans Tuesday passed Proposition 200,
joining three other states in a revolutionary move to provide
public money for candidates in future state elections.
</P>
<P>
   But in overwhelming numbers, voters passed Proposition 304,
which will retain the Lottery, and Proposition 201, which will
outlaw cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the more confusing decisions, voters approved
Proposition 303, which will provide up to $220 million for
preserving land from development. But it also will forbid the
Legislature from approving laws requiring local governments to
restrict development. &QL; 
Proposition 200 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Proposition 200, the Citizens Clean Election Act,
hope this measure will minimize the influence of special interests
in future elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are fed up with abuses involving money and politics,''
said Kaia Lenhart, political director of Arizonans for Clean
Elections, which supported the measure. ``This proposition sends a
message to legislators that people want campaign-finance reform and
will vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona becomes the fourth state to pass a so-called
clean-elections measure, following Maine in 1996, Vermont in 1997
and Massachusetts earlier Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lenhart said it was significant that conservative Arizona joined
the more liberal Northeastern states in approving the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The law calls for a new voluntary system of funding candidates'
runs for state offices. It would:
</P>
<P>
   Give public funds to participating candidates if they collected
a minimum number of $5 contributions from voters in their district.
</P>
<P>
   Give those candidates a designated sum set by the commission for
both the primary and general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Limit the amount of personal money that candidates could use in
the campaign and prohibit them from receiving other contributions,
except in emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
   Provide public campaign funds from a combination of surcharges
on certain civil and criminal fines, a $100 annual fee for
for-profit lobbyists and voluntary taxpayer contributions, with tax
credits of up to $500. &QL; 
Proposition 303
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 303 was touted by Gov. Jane Hull and the development
community as a measure that would save the desert by providing up
to $220 million over the next 11 years for the purchase of open
space.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists, principally the Sierra Club, the Arizona
Center for Law in the Public Interest and the Southwest Center for
Biological Diversity, said the law was a sham, designed to prevent
regulation of sprawl and enable builders to continue the
acre-an-hour destruction of the Sonoran landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, which included developers, banks and utilities,
poured more than $700,000 into a campaign that included glossy
brochures and television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 201
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 201 would outlaw cockfighting in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights activists from across Arizona and the nation
pushed for this initiative, which would outlaw the practice of
cockfighting. The proposition makes cockfighting a Class 5 felony,
which can result in a fine of up to $150,000 and two years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ken White, executive director of the Arizona Humane Society,
said he was doubly pleased that a similar measure appeared to be
passing in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like both Missouri and Arizona have banned
cockfighting, making 47 states that have declared this an
abomination and something that should be against the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting remains legal in Louisiana, Oklahoma and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of cockfighting were ``very disappointed and upset,'' said
Warren Glick, a Phoenix resident who has kept game chickens all his
life. He maintained that voters didn't realize the issue was
actually about control over the use of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 304
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 304 will continue the Arizona Lottery through July
1, 2003. Voters originally approved it in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery originally was established to help local governments
pay for street improvements ($23 million annually) and public
transportation ($7 million annually) and provide additional
revenues for state government.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, voters have approved additional mandates
for Lottery revenues. &QL;

CHALLENGER CLAIMS WIN IN RACE WITH DEAD INCUMBENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Updates with concession of incumbant's campaign chairman) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lee Baca claimed victory over the late Sherman
Block in Tuesday's balloting for sheriff of Los Angeles County,
less than a week after Block died while running for a fifth
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Block's campaign chairman, Jay Grodin, conceded the race around
11 p.m., wishing Baca well as the new sheriff. The Block campaign
had insisted on carrying on the campaign through Election Day, in
spite of Block's death Thursday at age 74 from a brain hemorrhage,
in hopes of denying Baca the office.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a yellow rose in his lapel, Baca gave a victory speech
to supporters early in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County has become a victorious, wonderful place of
inclusion ... because of what's happened tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take great pride that this has been a campaign about
decency, this has been a campaign about fairness. That this
campaign was about inclusion of everybody, not just some
powerbrokers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clear ... We have won this campaign. I am ready
to become your sheriff for the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Block's campaign chairman, Grodin, made the concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish him well as he begins his new journey ...'' Grodin
said. ``The department is bigger than any leader, and it will
support the new administration as it always has.''
</P>
<P>
   Grodin also read a statement from Block's widow, Alyce. It said
in part: ``Now that the results are in, we hope the department
continues in the spirit Sherman and his predecessors established.''
</P>
<P>
   For voters, it was a choice between Baca, 56, or voting for
Block with the knowledge that if he won, by law, the county Board
of Supervisors would select a successor as sheriff to fill the
position until the November 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results were indicating Baca, a former regional chief in
the Sheriff's Department, was the voters' choice. If those results
prevail, he will be sworn in Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Before Block's death, the election was expected to be a
referendum on his four-term leadership of the 13,000-employee
department, which operates the largest jail system in the nation
and provides law enforcement services to 40 cities and the county's
unincorporated area. After his death, it turned into a vote on
public confidence in the surviving candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Baca was in the top echelon of department leaders in June when
he and two other hopefuls ran against Block in the June primary.
</P>
<P>
   Block finished the primary in first place with 36 percent of the
vote, but Baca trailed him by only 4percentage points and forced
the sheriff into the first runoff of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   For Block, who had been sheriff since 1982, it suddenly became
the most critical campaign of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Long a popular public official and never seriously threatened
for his job, Block went out on the campaign trail in the runoff and
faced questions about inefficiency in his department, mistaken
releases of prisoners and other management criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The event that turned out to be the final campaign debate of
Block's nearly 17-year career occurred in Studio City on Oct. 23 as
the two men faced each other at a forum of the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Block, 74, fell at his West Hills home and hit his
head, requiring 10 stitches and hospitalization for dizziness and
disorientation, followed by surgery to remove a blood clot in his
brain. He died only days later, still in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Before losing consciousness, Block asked his supporters not to
give up the political battle regardless of what happened to him,
according to his campaign leaders. As the runoff campaign
lengthened, Block increasingly had questioned Baca's integrity,
ethics and leadership ability.
</P>
<P>
   Baca resigned from the department shortly after the primary,
saying it would enable him to campaign full time. Afterward, Block
openly questioned the job performance of his onetime subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-eminent issue for Baca's campaign, during the primary
and most of the runoff battle, was Block's age and health. The
sheriff had been undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week
after twice defeating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the race, however, Baca began criticizing his former
mentor's management, particularly of the jails.
</P>
<P>
   Until stricken Oct. 24, Block insisted he was in good health
despite his age and the dialysis treatments. He said he was still
the best man for the job of reducing crime, still the one most
likely to reduce his constituents' fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Baca cast himself as a man with the energy, vision and hands-on
management style needed to steer the department into a new era.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was hindered by allegations that he had offered
Block a deal to quit the race, including the title of sheriff
emeritus with a staff car and driver as well as continued official
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baca insisted the offer was not meant as a shady deal, but
rather as an effort to keep Block in the department while avoiding
a bitter race that could divide the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department has a $1.25 billion budget and 13,000
employees, including about 8,000 deputies. It serves 2.5 million
people in the unincorporated portions of the county and in 40
cities that contract with the department for law enforcement
services. The sheriff also runs the county's vast jail system,
America's largest.
</P>
<P>
   Block won the endorsement of unions representing the
rank-and-file deputies as well as the sergeants and lieutenants.
Also backing him were many of the region's political heavyweights,
including all five county supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years in the department, Baca rose through the
ranks to division chief in charge of six stations and the anti-gang
bureau. He has a doctorate in public administration from the
University of Southern California.

RESULTS ARE IN: 1998 IS YEAR OF THE WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVEN WILLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona made history last night.
</P>
<P>
   Not just state history, but in all likelihood, national history.
</P>
<P>
   It elected four women to the state's top five offices. If
Democrat Janet Napolitano prevails in the attorney general's race,
it's five for five. Neither has ever happened anywhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the possible lineup: Gov. Jane Hull will begin her first
term in January as the state's elected chief executive. Ditto for
Secretary of State Betsey Bayless in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano was struggling early this morning to become the first
Democrat elected to the state's top law enforcement office since
Bruce Babbitt in 1976. State Sen. Carol Springer won the treasurer
post outright in the September primary. And Lisa Graham Keegan
glided to a second term as state school superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the order of succession per the Arizona Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, there were two other statewide offices on the
ballot Tuesday: corporation commissioner, which is one-third of a
three-member panel, and mine inspector. They will continue to be
held by men.)
</P>
<P>
   With a Napolitano victory, this would be truly phenomenal.
Without it, it's still historic.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the election, no state in the nation had five women
holding statewide elective office, let alone ``the top five'' state
offices, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Five states looked close but really weren't, with four women
serving in statewide elected positions. These states were Delaware,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Washington. But here's the
kicker: None has a woman governor.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. There haven't been that many in history _ a grand
total of 15, to be exact, according to the Center for the American
Woman in Politics at Rutgers University. (Only 10 of them were
elected in their own right.)
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, there were three _ New Jersey's Republican
Christine Todd Whitman, New Hampshire's Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and
Arizona's Republican Hull _ though Democrat Gail Schoettler in
Colorado was making a run late Tuesday night to become No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as of Tuesday morning, no state had ever elected women
to its top two positions at the same time, let top four, according
to the National Governor's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona did.
</P>
<P>
   So, while 1992 was heralded nationally as the Year of the Woman
(a bit prematurely, I might add, since many of the gains women made
that year have since been erased), 1998 is clearly the Year of the
Woman in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean to the daily lives of Arizonans?
</P>
<P>
   Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   I confess it's exciting to see the reins of state government
placed so firmly in the hands of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' I find myself thinking. ``Now, we'll show
them how it's done!''
</P>
<P>
   But such chortling, really, is premature. It also can be
foolish. The fact is, women are vulnerable to the same weaknesses
of character as men. Men have no monopoly on ego. The corruptive
intoxication of power knows no gender. Such human frailties can
extinguish a woman's promise as surely as a man's.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting all in Arizona to suddenly go right because of the Y
chromosome count in its leadership lineup is about as realistic as
expecting the Mideast peace agreement to produce a permanent truce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I have high hopes for these women _ as, I suspect, do
many other men and women in this state. We have a right to such
high hopes. This is a pretty impressive bunch of people. Each is
smart, well-motivated, energetic and principled. Several have
advanced degrees. Each has worked very hard to get where she is
today.
</P>
<P>
   These women, as a collective, are just plain different from
their predecessors. And let's face it: Based on the conduct of some
of those predecessors _ an ex-governor felon comes immediately to
mind _ this alone makes them cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, these women all actually speak to one another.
That's a novel concept among Arizona elected officials of the same
party, let alone different ones.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive me a little glee as we enter a new era of political
leadership in Arizona. As Golda Meir noted at one point in her long
life, ``Whether women are better than men, I cannot say. But I can
say they are certainly no worse.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Proposition 5, the American Indian gaming
initiative, held a solid lead Tuesday after one of the most hotly
contested and costliest battles in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Other state propositions that held leads were measures that
involved tax protection for toxic cleanup, transportation funding,
animal trapping and horse slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Other state measures _ on presidential primary elections,
electric utilities and air quality tax credits _ were losing.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives on a cigarette tax, and local tax-revenue sharing
were locked in close fights.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of Proposition 5 would permit gambling devices and
lotteries at tribal casinos, including slot machines and banked
card games, as well as providing funds for tribes with no gaming
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Proposition 5 argued that it would allow
unregulated and untaxed gambling and would even result in
environmental damage by enabling casinos to operate outside state
environmental oversight.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the initiative mounted a highly visible ad
campaign and promoted the measure as a matter of fairness toward
American Indians who have been trying to improve their lot.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents also cited the $120million generated annually in
state and local taxes by Indian gaming, and hailed the proposition
as a key to increasing self-reliance by American Indians. &UR;

SCHOOL BOND ISSUE PASSING
</HEADLINE>

   SACRAMENTO _ The biggest school bond issue in the nation's
history, $9.2 billion Proposition 1A on the statewide ballot, was
winning approval Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a second education measure _ Proposition 8, which would
implement sweeping reforms favored by Gov. Pete Wilson _ was facing
defeat in statewide balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 1A would allocate $6.7 billion for new school
construction and rehabilitation of deteriorating school facilities
from kindergarten through high school, and $2.5 billion for
higher-education campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased voters are validating 1A; it's a thoughtful,
planned approach to building schools in the state,'' said Larry
McCarthy, president of the California Taxpayers Association. ``It
will protect taxpayers and at the same time benefit children,
communities and schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Propositions 1A and 8 both required a simple majority to pass.
Because it called for general obligation bonds that would be repaid
by state government, Proposition 1A did not require the two-thirds
approval needed for bonds that would have been repaid only by
property owners.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was endorsed by business leaders and educators who
said it was necessary to prepare for the expected increase in
enrollment throughout the state as well as updating facilities to
ensure a well-educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Finance estimates that the number of
K-12 public school students will grow by 300,000 over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District officials were counting on
voter approval of the bond measure to provide about $1billion for
the district, which _ combined with money from Proposition BB, the
LAUSD's voter-approved $2.4 billion bond measure _ would pay for
building 51 new schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bond financing is a type of long-term borrowing commonly used by
governments to raise money for specific purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Proposition 1A, the dollars would be parceled out over
four years, with principal and interest payments to be repaid over
20 years through the state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure argued that bond financing is the most
expensive way to pay for new construction and costs taxpayers in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time for voters to recognize that every
time they take out a bond issue it's a tax increase,'' said
Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, who led the opposition
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said it would not increase taxes paid by Californians
and also contained provisions to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hauk, president of the California Business Roundtable and
co-chairman of the Yes on 1A campaign, said construction costs will
be kept down through new technology and standardized, predesigned
school plans mandated by a new state law.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms called for on the other school initiative, Proposition
8, included establishing parent and teacher councils empowered to
make budget and curriculum decisions, competency tests for teachers
and permanent class size-reduction funding.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversial was the creation of a chief inspector's
office to rank the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   With the measure behind in returns, Mitch Zak, a spokesman for
the Yes on Proposition 8 campaign, said it was outspent by $7
million by a coalition of education associations and unions and
that money had ``drowned out the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of money,'' he said, ``there won't be
accountability in education.''

PROP. HH TOO CLOSE TO CALL
</HEADLINE>
 
(Updates throughout) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Repeating for those needing.) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The fate of a ballot proposal to give the Los
Angeles City Council unprecedented power over the departments that
run the city's harbors, airports and utilities was too close to
call Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Three other proposed changes to the City Charter led with clear
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were also backing a proposed bond issue to refurbish the
Los Angeles Zoo. A proposal that would build new city libraries and
renovate existing ones hovered close to the two-thirds majority
needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Other bond measures were losing, including plans for a special
tax for sidewalk repairs and a bond to spruce up Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' city ballot measures received relatively
little &UR;  &LR; attention. But they held broad implications for taxes and
the shape of local government.
</P>
<P>
   Four bond and tax issues sought to raise money for sidewalk
repairs, library construction and renovations at Exposition Park
and the Los Angeles Zoo. Taken together, the measures would add
about $32 to the annual property tax bill of an average
1,200-square-foot home worth $162,000.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bond or tax measures on the city ballot had to win
two-thirds of the vote to pass. Amendments to the charter required
just a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed amendments to Los Angeles' charter called for extending
city pensions to police and firefighters hired from other public
agencies and setting hiring requirements for employees brought into
the city from other government agencies. And one, Charter Amendment
HH, called for giving the City Council power over the
semi-independent departments that run Los Angeles' airports and
harbors and deliver the city's water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Amendment HH provoked a mutiny among city officials
after the council placed it on the ballot. Originally billed as a
way to help the Los Angeles Police Department absorb the airport
police force, the amendment's broad language also would allow the
council to reorganize city departments now run by citizen
commissions and general managers appointed by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan and City Attorney James Hahn complained
that the measure would destroy the independence of those
departments, which generate significant revenue and operate much
like businesses. City Councilwoman Laura Chick, who signed the
ballot argument in favor of the measure, later withdrew her
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charter Amendment HH is a classic example of good intentions
gone awry,'' Riordan said, adding that a vote against the measure
would ``allow our proprietary departments to continue operating in
an atmosphere of integrity, focus and consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the other amendments on Tuesday's ballot seemed
to be relatively simple adjustments to the city charter, the
immense blueprint for Los Angeles government:
</P>
<P>
   _ Amendment FF extended pension benefits to public safety
officers hired into the city from other agencies. The charter
requires that police and firefighters work 20 years with the city
before they became eligible, regardless of prior experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amendment GG allowed the city's Civil Service Commission to
set job requirements for employees of an outside agency being
absorbed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amendment II allowed firefighters and police officers hired
between July 1 and Dec. 31, 1997, to apply for a pension plan that
would let them retire after working 10 years with the city and
reaching age 50. The amendment was designed to cover former
Metropolitan Transportation Authority police and Long Beach Naval
Shipyard firefighters hired by the city last year.
</P>
<P>
   The largest spending proposal, for a $769.4 million special tax
to fund sidewalk repairs, drew the opposition of the mayor, several
council members and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money that will be carried by the property-tax
payers,'' said Joel Fox, president of the taxpayers group. ``In
some instances, the tax will be paid by those who don't have
sidewalks for people who do have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that the money was needed to repair an estimated
4,600 miles of damaged sidewalks in the city. Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas said the city spends about $2 million annually to
settle lawsuits by people injured by tripping on broken sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have sidewalks look like little mountains as you walk along
is unsafe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While split over sidewalks, city leaders were more united in
support of a ballot measure to upgrade the Los Angeles Zoo. The
$47.6 million raised if the measure passed would help replace a
cramped sea lion exhibit and the 30-year-old reptile house and
build a new tropical rain forest exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition specified that the money, raised through a bond
issue, would not be spent on administrators' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a proposition that would provide $178.3 million for
library construction and renovation also found broad backing. If
passed, Proposition DD would build, renovate or replace 28
libraries _ including 12 in the San Fernando Valley _ and build
four branches in communities with none.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our communities need safe places that are well-stocked
with computer technology and well-stocked with books where our
children and families can go to further their education and broaden
their minds,'' said Councilwoman Chick, who formed her own
committee to campaign for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion was mixed on the ballot's last bond issue, a measure
that would raise $46.5 million to renovate and expand Exposition
Park, site of the California Science Center and the Natural History
Museum. If it passed, the money would have helped revamp the Rose
Garden and Olympic swimming stadium and partly fund construction of
an Environmental Science Learning Center.

 &HT;    ABL hopes to hang on
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teresa Edwards lost a team but also shed a demanding dual role
and has found renewed energy as the American Basketball League tips
off its third season Thursday. However, the speculation is greater
than ever that its short life is nearly at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, traded from the now-dissolved Atlanta Glory in the
off-season to the Philadelphia Rage, continues to preach the
virtues of the player-oriented league that she helped found but
that has endured significant financial problems in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   She signed a three-year contract before reporting to training
camp and last week was voted to the ABL's board of directors. Even
as the rival WNBA continues to attract top players, the former
University of Georgia star and four-time Olympian is more
interested in the ABL's uphill struggle than the glitz and glamor
of summertime basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give me an obstacle, I'll have to find a way to knock
it down or go around it,'' said Edwards, 33, who was the Glory's
player/coach last season. ``Until it's drop-dead gone, I don't see
any reason to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she makes her Rage debut at New England, although
in a backcourt that's missing Dawn Staley, who fled this fall for
the WNBA, which has lured four ABL players and is starting to
attract the best collegiate talent. Of the seniors on last year's
Kodak All-America team, only former N.C. State center Chasity
Melvin chose the ABL, which still pays an average salary of around
$80,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL has had a tumultuous off-season. The Glory and Long
Beach, which reached the league finals, both were shut down because
of poor attendance. In order to shave $2 million in losses, the
league cut staff salaries 10 percent, although players were not
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion franchises were created in Chicago and Nashville, but
ticket sales have been slow. A weak television package has barely
improved. Coach Brian Agler of Columbus, which has won both league
titles, has been given permission to interview for WNBA job
openings. Katrina McClain, a teammate of Edwards at Georgia, the
Olympic team and the Glory, is mysteriously holding out of
Chicago's training camp and has been suspended for failing to abide
by the terms of her contract.
</P>
<P>
   But league officials are boasting about a 30 percent increase in
ticket sales across the league and expect to reach attendance of
between 5,500 and 6,000 a game, buoyed by an expanded operating
budget of $5 million. That's far below the average attendance of
10,000 per game generated in each of the WNBA's first two seasons.
ABL officials are growing weary of the comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is well-funded and we certainly anticipate being
around for a long, long time,'' ABL co-founder and chief executive
officer Gary Cavalli said. ``I think we're starting to get
established as part of the American sports scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The ABL has re-signed 81 of 85 players whose contracts have run
out in the last two years. And it has the perfect opportunity to
take advantage of the ongoing NBA lockout. Ads running in several
national newspapers _ ``Lookin' for pro hoops? We're playin''' _
have generated at least one angry call to Cavalli from an NBA team
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that will benefit the ABL,'' Cavalli said. ``We're
happy to be playing in basketball season. We plan to exploit this
opportunity as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the ABL is still hard to find on the
television dial. The only nationally televised contests this season
are two playoff games on CBS in April. The ABL had to purchase the
air time with the network, and Cavalli said he hasn't had much
success thus far in getting the interest of television executives
who might be looking for non-NBA programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have more games than last year, but I think that
will come,'' Cavalli said. ``Sometimes it takes time to prove
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the league might be running out of time, not to mention
money. Without offering specifics, Cavalli insists that the ABL can
turn a profit in the next two years. He's also looking at expansion
possibilities, including in the New York area, presumably to seek
the services of Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw, who appears headed
for the WNBA next summer.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonnette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: About quarterback Doug Flutie, who led the Buffalo Bills to a
30-24 win over the Miami Dolphins Nov. 1with three touchdown
passes: Is it true that he once was believed to be too short by the
National Football League, so he went to the Canadian Football
League to build up his reputation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that the 5-foot-9 Flutie, a Heisman Trophy winner
in his Boston College days, was deemed too short by most NFL teams.
So in 1990, after an unsatisfying three-year stint with the New
England Patriots, he signed with the British Columbia Lions of the
CFL. He went on to play in the CFL for the Calgary Stampeders and
the Toronto Argonauts and was voted the league's most valuable
player five times. He signed with the Bills earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once heard that Clark Gable washn't the only contender to
play Rhett Butler. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: After independent producer David O. Selznick paid $50,000 for
the screen rights in July 1936, only four actors were considered
for the role, according to Magill's Survey of Cinema: Gable, who
was under contact to MGM; Gary Cooper, under contract to Samuel
Goldwyn; Errol Flynn, under contract with Warner Bros.; and Ronald
Colman. Colman was mentioned only in the early weeks of casting
before being eliminated. Flynn was a relatively strong contender,
and for a while it looked as though Warner Bros. and producer
Selznick might work out a package deal for him and Bette Davis, but
negotiations and interest bogged down. Discussions with Cooper went
nowhere. That left Gable, the almost-unanimous favorite of the
public anyway. Selznick was able to work out an arrangement to get
him and partial backing from MGM in exchange for distribution
rights and 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Magill's, by the way, also shoots down the story that Margaret
Mitchell had Gable in mind for Rhett while she was writing the
novel. That wasn't possible, the book notes, because she wrote the
bulk of her masterpiece betwen 1926 and 1929 when he was an obscure
stage actor. He didn't come into his own in films until 1931-32.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the upshot of the mysterious disappearance of an Air
Force jet over Colorado a year or so ago? Were its bombs ever
found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Despite months of recovery efforts on the craggy 13,300-foot
Gold Dust Peak near Eagle, Colo., where Capt. Craig Button's A-10
Thunderbird crashed April 2, 1997, searchers never found the
plane's four 500-pound bombs. Many, but not all, of the jet's
munitions, and about two-thirds of the plane, were found last
summer and fall. Air Force officials said the bombs may have
dropped without detonation during the flight. They also may have
fallen into crevasses or been covered by sliding boulders near the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Eight live 30-mm shells and other debris were recovered as
recently as mid-August. Forest Service officials planned to post
signs at trailheads showing hikers what the unexploded ammunition
looks like and advising them not to touch it, but instead to notify
authorities. Anne Huebner, Eagle district ranger for the White
River National Forest, said the crash site has been reopened to the
public in August. But she added that she didn't expect many
souvenir hunters, because the site is so treacherous. The danger
isn't just from unexploded ordnance, she added, but also from
avalanches and rock slides.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force investigators ultimately concluded that Button had
committed suicide by breaking formation on a training run over the
Barry Goldwater bombing range in southern Arizona and flying a
zig-zag route into Colorado, where his plane crashed. No motive was
ever established.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read about the newly opened Vietnam Era
Educational Center in New Jersey. Who decided on its exhibits and
other content?
</P>
<P>
   A: A 25-member planning committee was responsible for putting
the exhibits together, said Kelly Watts, executive director of the
$3.8 million center, and the nearby Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, at
Holmdel, 20 miles south of Newark. About three-fourths of the
planning committee members were Vietnam veterans, with the
remainder academics, historians, museum experts and others chosen
for their expertise in the subject matter. ``We were very careful
to be sure it had a majority of veterans,'' Watts told Q&AMP;A. The
committee's choices then were approved by the center's 18-member
board, which includes 13 veterans. ``People always ask if veterans
were a part of the process, and absolutely that was the case,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the center, dedicated Sept. 27, was
financed primarily by donations of $250,000 byeach of Atlantic
City's 11 casinos, as well as private donations. It is the nation's
first museum dedicated to the Vietnam War. The center sits a few
hundred yards from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, a black granite
arena bearing the names of 1,553 New Jersey residents killed or
missing in action in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``church key'' when referring
to a bottle opener? I was told that it began in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no doubt that it means bottle or can opener, and it
was commonly used in military circles before the days of screw-off
caps and pop-top rings, but the origin isn't totally known. Morris
&AMP; Morris Word &AMP; Phrase Origins II says the expression is old in the
brewing business. It goes on to say that openers ``perhaps'' got
that nickname because they resembled the top end of the kind of
heavy, ornate key used to unlock church doors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who wrote ``O Canada,'' the Canadian national anthem, and
what are the words?
</P>
<P>
   A: The music was composed by Calixa Lavallee; French lyrics to
accompany the music were written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier.
Many English versions have appeared over the years. The version on
which the ``official'' English lyrics are based was written in 1908
by Justice Robert Stanley Weir. The English lyrics are not a
translation or rendering of the French lyrics, which remain
unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   These are the official English lyrics:
</P>
<P>

   Q: Is NASA paying John Glenn to be aboard the space shuttle
Discovery?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The senator already draws a $133,644 federal salary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A list of hurricane names for 1998 included Lisa. But the one
I heard about starting with L was Lester. Why was Lisa omitted?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't. There are two lists of names, one for
Atlantic/Caribbean tropical cyclones, the other for eastern Pacific
tropical cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa swirled around the eastern Caribbean before turning north,
and on Oct. 6 was centered about 710 miles east of the Leeward
Islands, posing no threat to land. By Oct. 10 it was about 1,800
miles east-northeast of Boston. It dissipated in the cold waters of
the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Lester was one of two storms (the other was Madeline)
threatening Mexico's Pacific coast. Lester, which churned off the
coast of Oaxaca state Oct. 18, initially was moving parallel to the
coast and was aimed at Zihuatenejo. But then it changed direction
and moved out into the Pacific, where it died. Farther south,
Madeline started the day Oct. 19 as a hurricane, then dwindled into
a tropical depression before fizzling as it headed northwest into
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the policy in pro football when a ball lands in the
stands? Can the fan who gets it keep it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The policy of the National Football League is for the ball to
be returned. But every attempt is made to avoid the situation from
occurring in the first place. Nets are hoisted behind the goal
posts before field goal and extra point attempts to prevent the
ball from going into the stands. The important factor is crowd
control, said Atlanta Falcons spokesman Rob Jackson. They don't
want fans fighting over a $100 football.

<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals has begun a
foundation for sexually abused children and has given $1 million of
his own money. Do you have any details about it? How can the public
make contributions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mark McGwire Foundation for Children is a private
organization designed to raise awareness for physically and
sexually abused children. McGwire actually committed $3 million of
his baseball salary to the cause: $1 million a year for the
duration of his three-year contract. When he launched the
foundation in September 1997, the home run king said this: ``Some
of the most neglected people in society are children. I just
thought it was time that I do something for abused children.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation donates funds to organizations based in St. Louis
and in Southern California, and researches homes and shelters
``that have a good reputation for treating abused children.'' Funds
donated to the foundation by outside parties are used also to help
other causes nationwide. Because it's a 501-(c)(3) foundation, it
is prohibited from soliciting funds. It can, however, accept
unsolicited donations. Those interested can send contributions to:
Mark McGwire Foundation for Children, 6615 East Pacific Coast
Highway, Suite 270, Long Beach, CA 90803. Information:
562-626-8121.

<P>
   Q: I remember reading about vitamin C possibly being harmful to
the human body. Can you refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to a British study in which researchers
at the University of Leicester concluded that daily 500-milligram
supplements of vitamin C could promote free radicals _ certain
molecules in the body that can damage cells and lead to cancer and
other health problems _ as well as eliminate them, possibly causing
cellular genetic damage. Those findings were refuted by vitamin C
advocates who argued that it's perfectly fine to take daily
supplements of 500 milligrams or more of the vitamin.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is known to prevent the once-common
disease scurvy, and is widely thought to help stave off or shorten
the duration of colds. Many believe the vitamin also boosts general
health because of its antioxidant properties. Antioxidants
eliminate free radicals. Leading scientists said the British study
ignored the substantial body of past research indicating that
vitamin C's antioxidant properties far outweigh its possible
oxidant effects.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has Neil Armstrong, the former astronaut, been doing
since leaving NASA?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't hear much about the 68-year-old Armstrong _ who on
July 20, 1969, became the first man to walk on the moon, during the
Apollo 11 mission _ because he prefers to stay out of the
limelight. Described by NASA officials as an ``intensely private
person,'' he resigned from NASA in August 1971 to become a
professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.
In 1979, he left Cincinnati to join the Cardwell International
Corp. in Lebanon, Ohio, as board chairman. He left Cardwell in 1982
to become chairman of Computing Technologies for Aviation Inc.,
based in Charlottesville, Va. When Q&AMP;A called Computing
Technologies on Wednesday to confirm whether Armstrong is still its
chairman, a spokeswoman said she could not release any information
about him.
</P>
<P>
   His avoidance of publicity is well known. He shunned appearances
for many years after his lunar walk, but he made an exception
several times last year: In January, he was on hand to help observe
the 50th anniversary of the first commercial flight at the
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. He contributed
a bound copy of a speech he made in 1988 to be put into the
cornerstone of Terminal 1 until the airport's 100th anniversary.
Then, three months later, he attended the launch of the space
shuttle Columbia from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, but he didn't
give any interviews. And a month after that he took part in the
National Museum of Naval Aviation's annual symposium in Pensacola,
Fla. News reports said Armstrong shared memories, explained space
hardware in detail, and displayed a subtle wit during a panel
discussion with four other lunar explorers speaking before an
audience of military personnel and civilians. There has been no
publicity about any appearances by him in public since then.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The old Walt Disney movie ``Song of the South'' is one of my
favorites. It hasn't been out for years. Will it ever be
rereleased, either on video or at theaters?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not likely, but Disney officials won't say for sure. The
1946 film, a mixture of animation and live action, was said to be
the fulfillment of Walt Disney's childhood dream of bringing the
Uncle Remus tales, written by Joel Chandler Harris, to the screen.
It was a moneymaker when first released, and in subsequent
rereleases in 1971 and 1986. But increasing sensitivity within the
Disney studio, and compaints about the film's Uncle Tom-isms in the
character of Uncle Remus, along with the supposed depiction of
``happy slaves'' (despite the story being set after the Civil War),
are keeping it from seeing the light of day _ perhaps permanently.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't been released on video in the United States,
it's said to be available on laser disk in Japan, and information
on the Internet reports that a company in Florida is selling copies
of a VHS-format video version originally released in England. But
those would not be official videos released by the Disney studios.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About baseball's Gold Glove awards: What is the criteria for
a player's selection, and who decides who gets them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rawlings Gold Glove awards, presented annually since
1957, are made to 18 players _ nine in each league _ judged and
selected as the best fielding players at their respective positions
by the Major League managers and coaches. They may not select
players from their own team, and vote only for players in their own
league. Decisions are made before the end of the regular baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV news report about John Glenn mentioned Sputnik, the
Soviet satellite that started the space race. Is it still up there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sputnik was a series of unmanned space satellites launched by
the Soviet Union. Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite,
lasted only a few months after it went into orbit Oct. 4, 1957.
Ohio State University radio telescope director John Kraus reported
that it broke into three parts in late December 1957. Those three
parts began to split further Jan. 2-5, 1958, Kraus reported, with
eight fragments detected a few days later. When the fragments
dropped into the denser layers of Earth's atmosphere, friction
caused them to burn up, the Tass news agency reported that same
month. Sputnik 1 circled Earth once every 96 minutes at a speed of
18,000 mph. By the time it was destroyed, it had traveled some 37
1/4 million miles in circling Earth about 1,400 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union also launched nine much larger Sputniks between
November 1957 and March 1961. Sputnik 2, by the way, carried Laika,
a dog, the first space traveler. Unfortunately, the Russian
scientists didn't have a way for her to get back safely. She died
in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Betty Currie still working at the White House as President
Clinton's personal secretary, after all the turmoil surrounding her
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you publish a list of all of Oprah's Winfrey's book
selections?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent choice for Oprah's Book Club, for October, is
Atlanta playwright Pearl Cleage's debut novel, ``What Looks Like
Crazy on an Ordinary Day.'' Others: ``I Know This Much Is True,''
by Wally Lamb; ``She's Come Undone,'' Lamb; ``Breath, Eyes,
Memory,'' Edwidge Danticat; ``Black and Blue,'' Anna Quindlen;
``Here on Earth,'' Alice Hoffman; ``Paradise,'' Toni Morrison;
``Song of Solomon,'' Morrison; ``The Meanest Thing to Say,'' Bill
Cosby; ``The Treasure Hunt,'' Cosby; ``The Best Way to Play,''
Cosby; ``Ellen Foster,'' Kaye Gibbons; ``A Virtuous Woman,''
Gibbons; ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' Ernest J. Gaines; ``Songs in
Ordinary Time,'' Mary McGarry Morris; ``The Heart of a Woman,''
Maya Angelou; ``The Rapture of Canaan,'' Sheri Reynolds; ``Stones
from the River,'' Ursula Hegi; ``The Book of Ruth,'' Jane Hamilton;

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonnette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: About quarterback Doug Flutie, who led the Buffalo Bills to a
30-24 win over the Miami Dolphins Nov. 1with three touchdown
passes: Is it true that he once was believed to be too short by the
National Football League, so he went to the Canadian Football
League to build up his reputation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that the 5-foot-9 Flutie, a Heisman Trophy winner
in his Boston College days, was deemed too short by most NFL teams.
So in 1990, after an unsatisfying three-year stint with the New
England Patriots, he signed with the British Columbia Lions of the
CFL. He went on to play in the CFL for the Calgary Stampeders and
the Toronto Argonauts and was voted the league's most valuable
player five times. He signed with the Bills earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once heard that Clark Gable washn't the only contender to
play Rhett Butler. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: After independent producer David O. Selznick paid $50,000 for
the screen rights in July 1936, only four actors were considered
for the role, according to Magill's Survey of Cinema: Gable, who
was under contact to MGM; Gary Cooper, under contract to Samuel
Goldwyn; Errol Flynn, under contract with Warner Bros.; and Ronald
Colman. Colman was mentioned only in the early weeks of casting
before being eliminated. Flynn was a relatively strong contender,
and for a while it looked as though Warner Bros. and producer
Selznick might work out a package deal for him and Bette Davis, but
negotiations and interest bogged down. Discussions with Cooper went
nowhere. That left Gable, the almost-unanimous favorite of the
public anyway. Selznick was able to work out an arrangement to get
him and partial backing from MGM in exchange for distribution
rights and 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Magill's, by the way, also shoots down the story that Margaret
Mitchell had Gable in mind for Rhett while she was writing the
novel. That wasn't possible, the book notes, because she wrote the
bulk of her masterpiece betwen 1926 and 1929 when he was an obscure
stage actor. He didn't come into his own in films until 1931-32.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the upshot of the mysterious disappearance of an Air
Force jet over Colorado a year or so ago? Were its bombs ever
found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Despite months of recovery efforts on the craggy 13,300-foot
Gold Dust Peak near Eagle, Colo., where Capt. Craig Button's A-10
Thunderbird crashed April 2, 1997, searchers never found the
plane's four 500-pound bombs. Many, but not all, of the jet's
munitions, and about two-thirds of the plane, were found last
summer and fall. Air Force officials said the bombs may have
dropped without detonation during the flight. They also may have
fallen into crevasses or been covered by sliding boulders near the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Eight live 30-mm shells and other debris were recovered as
recently as mid-August. Forest Service officials planned to post
signs at trailheads showing hikers what the unexploded ammunition
looks like and advising them not to touch it, but instead to notify
authorities. Anne Huebner, Eagle district ranger for the White
River National Forest, said the crash site has been reopened to the
public in August. But she added that she didn't expect many
souvenir hunters, because the site is so treacherous. The danger
isn't just from unexploded ordnance, she added, but also from
avalanches and rock slides.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force investigators ultimately concluded that Button had
committed suicide by breaking formation on a training run over the
Barry Goldwater bombing range in southern Arizona and flying a
zig-zag route into Colorado, where his plane crashed. No motive was
ever established.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read about the newly opened Vietnam Era
Educational Center in New Jersey. Who decided on its exhibits and
other content?
</P>
<P>
   A: A 25-member planning committee was responsible for putting
the exhibits together, said Kelly Watts, executive director of the
$3.8 million center, and the nearby Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, at
Holmdel, 20 miles south of Newark. About three-fourths of the
planning committee members were Vietnam veterans, with the
remainder academics, historians, museum experts and others chosen
for their expertise in the subject matter. ``We were very careful
to be sure it had a majority of veterans,'' Watts told Q&AMP;A. The
committee's choices then were approved by the center's 18-member
board, which includes 13 veterans. ``People always ask if veterans
were a part of the process, and absolutely that was the case,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the center, dedicated Sept. 27, was
financed primarily by donations of $250,000 byeach of Atlantic
City's 11 casinos, as well as private donations. It is the nation's
first museum dedicated to the Vietnam War. The center sits a few
hundred yards from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, a black granite
arena bearing the names of 1,553 New Jersey residents killed or
missing in action in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``church key'' when referring
to a bottle opener? I was told that it began in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no doubt that it means bottle or can opener, and it
was commonly used in military circles before the days of screw-off
caps and pop-top rings, but the origin isn't totally known. Morris
&AMP; Morris Word &AMP; Phrase Origins II says the expression is old in the
brewing business. It goes on to say that openers ``perhaps'' got
that nickname because they resembled the top end of the kind of
heavy, ornate key used to unlock church doors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who wrote ``O Canada,'' the Canadian national anthem, and
what are the words?
</P>
<P>
   A: The music was composed by Calixa Lavallee; French lyrics to
accompany the music were written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier.
Many English versions have appeared over the years. The version on
which the ``official'' English lyrics are based was written in 1908
by Justice Robert Stanley Weir. The English lyrics are not a
translation or rendering of the French lyrics, which remain
unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   These are the official English lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   O Canada! Our home and native land!
</P>
<P>
   True patriot love in all thy sons command.
</P>
<P>
   With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
</P>
<P>
   The True North strong and free!
</P>
<P>
   From far and wide,
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   God keep our land glorious and free!
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is NASA paying John Glenn to be aboard the space shuttle
Discovery?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The senator already draws a $133,644 federal salary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A list of hurricane names for 1998 included Lisa. But the one
I heard about starting with L was Lester. Why was Lisa omitted?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't. There are two lists of names, one for
Atlantic/Caribbean tropical cyclones, the other for eastern Pacific
tropical cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa swirled around the eastern Caribbean before turning north,
and on Oct. 6 was centered about 710 miles east of the Leeward

<P>
   Q: What is the policy in pro football when a ball lands in the
stands? Can the fan who gets it keep it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The policy of the National Football League is for the ball to
be returned. But every attempt is made to avoid the situation from
occurring in the first place. Nets are hoisted behind the goal
posts before field goal and extra point attempts to prevent the
ball from going into the stands. The important factor is crowd
control, said Atlanta Falcons spokesman Rob Jackson. They don't
want fans fighting over a $100 football.

of a VHS-format video version originally released in England. But
those would not be official videos released by the Disney studios.

   Q: About baseball's Gold Glove awards: What is the criteria for
a player's selection, and who decides who gets them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Rawlings Gold Glove awards, presented annually since
1957, are made to 18 players _ nine in each league _ judged and
selected as the best fielding players at their respective positions
by the Major League managers and coaches. They may not select
players from their own team, and vote only for players in their own
league. Decisions are made before the end of the regular baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV news report about John Glenn mentioned Sputnik, the
Soviet satellite that started the space race. Is it still up there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sputnik was a series of unmanned space satellites launched by
the Soviet Union. Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite,
lasted only a few months after it went into orbit Oct. 4, 1957.
Ohio State University radio telescope director John Kraus reported
that it broke into three parts in late December 1957. Those three
parts began to split further Jan. 2-5, 1958, Kraus reported, with
eight fragments detected a few days later. When the fragments
dropped into the denser layers of Earth's atmosphere, friction
caused them to burn up, the Tass news agency reported that same
month. Sputnik 1 circled Earth once every 96 minutes at a speed of
18,000 mph. By the time it was destroyed, it had traveled some 37
1/4 million miles in circling Earth about 1,400 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union also launched nine much larger Sputniks between
November 1957 and March 1961. Sputnik 2, by the way, carried Laika,
a dog, the first space traveler. Unfortunately, the Russian
scientists didn't have a way for her to get back safely. She died
in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Betty Currie still working at the White House as President
Clinton's personal secretary, after all the turmoil surrounding her
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you publish a list of all of Oprah's Winfrey's book
selections?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most recent choice for Oprah's Book Club, for October, is
Atlanta playwright Pearl Cleage's debut novel, ``What Looks Like
Crazy on an Ordinary Day.'' Others: ``I Know This Much Is True,''
by Wally Lamb; ``She's Come Undone,'' Lamb; ``Breath, Eyes,
Memory,'' Edwidge Danticat; ``Black and Blue,'' Anna Quindlen;
``Here on Earth,'' Alice Hoffman; ``Paradise,'' Toni Morrison;
``Song of Solomon,'' Morrison; ``The Meanest Thing to Say,'' Bill
Cosby; ``The Treasure Hunt,'' Cosby; ``The Best Way to Play,''
Cosby; ``Ellen Foster,'' Kaye Gibbons; ``A Virtuous Woman,''
Gibbons; ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' Ernest J. Gaines; ``Songs in
Ordinary Time,'' Mary McGarry Morris; ``The Heart of a Woman,''
Maya Angelou; ``The Rapture of Canaan,'' Sheri Reynolds; ``Stones
from the River,'' Ursula Hegi; ``The Book of Ruth,'' Jane Hamilton;
and ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' Jacquelyn Mitchard. On the

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonnette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: About quarterback Doug Flutie, who led the Buffalo Bills to a
30-24 win over the Miami Dolphins Nov. 1with three touchdown
passes: Is it true that he once was believed to be too short by the
National Football League, so he went to the Canadian Football
League to build up his reputation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that the 5-foot-9 Flutie, a Heisman Trophy winner
in his Boston College days, was deemed too short by most NFL teams.
So in 1990, after an unsatisfying three-year stint with the New
England Patriots, he signed with the British Columbia Lions of the
CFL. He went on to play in the CFL for the Calgary Stampeders and
the Toronto Argonauts and was voted the league's most valuable
player five times. He signed with the Bills earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I once heard that Clark Gable washn't the only contender to
play Rhett Butler. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: After independent producer David O. Selznick paid $50,000 for
the screen rights in July 1936, only four actors were considered
for the role, according to Magill's Survey of Cinema: Gable, who
was under contact to MGM; Gary Cooper, under contract to Samuel
Goldwyn; Errol Flynn, under contract with Warner Bros.; and Ronald
Colman. Colman was mentioned only in the early weeks of casting
before being eliminated. Flynn was a relatively strong contender,
and for a while it looked as though Warner Bros. and producer
Selznick might work out a package deal for him and Bette Davis, but
negotiations and interest bogged down. Discussions with Cooper went
nowhere. That left Gable, the almost-unanimous favorite of the
public anyway. Selznick was able to work out an arrangement to get
him and partial backing from MGM in exchange for distribution
rights and 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Magill's, by the way, also shoots down the story that Margaret
Mitchell had Gable in mind for Rhett while she was writing the
novel. That wasn't possible, the book notes, because she wrote the
bulk of her masterpiece betwen 1926 and 1929 when he was an obscure
stage actor. He didn't come into his own in films until 1931-32.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the upshot of the mysterious disappearance of an Air
Force jet over Colorado a year or so ago? Were its bombs ever
found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Despite months of recovery efforts on the craggy 13,300-foot
Gold Dust Peak near Eagle, Colo., where Capt. Craig Button's A-10
Thunderbird crashed April 2, 1997, searchers never found the
plane's four 500-pound bombs. Many, but not all, of the jet's
munitions, and about two-thirds of the plane, were found last
summer and fall. Air Force officials said the bombs may have
dropped without detonation during the flight. They also may have
fallen into crevasses or been covered by sliding boulders near the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Eight live 30-mm shells and other debris were recovered as
recently as mid-August. Forest Service officials planned to post
signs at trailheads showing hikers what the unexploded ammunition
looks like and advising them not to touch it, but instead to notify
authorities. Anne Huebner, Eagle district ranger for the White
River National Forest, said the crash site has been reopened to the
public in August. But she added that she didn't expect many
souvenir hunters, because the site is so treacherous. The danger
isn't just from unexploded ordnance, she added, but also from
avalanches and rock slides.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force investigators ultimately concluded that Button had
committed suicide by breaking formation on a training run over the
Barry Goldwater bombing range in southern Arizona and flying a
zig-zag route into Colorado, where his plane crashed. No motive was
ever established.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read about the newly opened Vietnam Era
Educational Center in New Jersey. Who decided on its exhibits and
other content?
</P>
<P>
   A: A 25-member planning committee was responsible for putting
the exhibits together, said Kelly Watts, executive director of the
$3.8 million center, and the nearby Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, at
Holmdel, 20 miles south of Newark. About three-fourths of the
planning committee members were Vietnam veterans, with the
remainder academics, historians, museum experts and others chosen
for their expertise in the subject matter. ``We were very careful
to be sure it had a majority of veterans,'' Watts told Q&AMP;A. The
committee's choices then were approved by the center's 18-member
board, which includes 13 veterans. ``People always ask if veterans
were a part of the process, and absolutely that was the case,''
Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the center, dedicated Sept. 27, was
financed primarily by donations of $250,000 byeach of Atlantic
City's 11 casinos, as well as private donations. It is the nation's
first museum dedicated to the Vietnam War. The center sits a few
hundred yards from the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, a black granite
arena bearing the names of 1,553 New Jersey residents killed or
missing in action in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``church key'' when referring
to a bottle opener? I was told that it began in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no doubt that it means bottle or can opener, and it
was commonly used in military circles before the days of screw-off
caps and pop-top rings, but the origin isn't totally known. Morris
&AMP; Morris Word &AMP; Phrase Origins II says the expression is old in the
brewing business. It goes on to say that openers ``perhaps'' got
that nickname because they resembled the top end of the kind of
heavy, ornate key used to unlock church doors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who wrote ``O Canada,'' the Canadian national anthem, and
what are the words?
</P>
<P>
   A: The music was composed by Calixa Lavallee; French lyrics to
accompany the music were written by Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier.
Many English versions have appeared over the years. The version on
which the ``official'' English lyrics are based was written in 1908
by Justice Robert Stanley Weir. The English lyrics are not a
translation or rendering of the French lyrics, which remain
unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   These are the official English lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   O Canada! Our home and native land!
</P>
<P>
   True patriot love in all thy sons command.
</P>
<P>
   With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
</P>
<P>
   The True North strong and free!
</P>
<P>
   From far and wide,
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   God keep our land glorious and free!
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is NASA paying John Glenn to be aboard the space shuttle
Discovery?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The senator already draws a $133,644 federal salary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A list of hurricane names for 1998 included Lisa. But the one
I heard about starting with L was Lester. Why was Lisa omitted?
</P>
<P>
   A: It wasn't. There are two lists of names, one for
Atlantic/Caribbean tropical cyclones, the other for eastern Pacific
tropical cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa swirled around the eastern Caribbean before turning north,
and on Oct. 6 was centered about 710 miles east of the Leeward
Islands, posing no threat to land. By Oct. 10 it was about 1,800
miles east-northeast of Boston. It dissipated in the cold waters of
the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Lester was one of two storms (the other was Madeline)
threatening Mexico's Pacific coast. Lester, which churned off the
coast of Oaxaca state Oct. 18, initially was moving parallel to the
coast and was aimed at Zihuatenejo. But then it changed direction
and moved out into the Pacific, where it died. Farther south,
Madeline started the day Oct. 19 as a hurricane, then dwindled into
a tropical depression before fizzling as it headed northwest into
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the policy in pro football when a ball lands in the
stands? Can the fan who gets it keep it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The policy of the National Football League is for the ball to
be returned. But every attempt is made to avoid the situation from
occurring in the first place. Nets are hoisted behind the goal
posts before field goal and extra point attempts to prevent the
ball from going into the stands. The important factor is crowd
control, said Atlanta Falcons spokesman Rob Jackson. They don't
want fans fighting over a $100 football.

 &HT;    Magazine article reports of GM dealings at Ohio plant
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAINE, Ohio_A Time magazine cover story on corporate welfare
slams General Motors' tax breaks in Moraine as an example of the
company's ``auctioning its surviving jobs to the highest bidders.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which hit newsstands Monday, examines the
abatements GM won locally in recent years, particularly one that
came after the company apparently hinted that a plant expansion
could go elsewhere if the Kettering Moraine school board didn't
approve a tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The board agreed to the abatement _ which allowed GM to keep $4
million in taxes over a 10-year period _ but threatened to reverse
the decision when it learned Moraine really had no competition for
the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   GM apologized, and the school board allowed the tax break to
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the incident was emblematic of a company
``that has secured hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate
welfare at the same time that it has eliminated thousands of
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is their opinion,'' responded GM spokesman Gerry Holmes.
``If no one (else) were getting those benefits, that would be fine
with us. . . . (But) we have to pursue these abatements to be
responsible to our shareholders. Our competitors are pursuing them,
and just to keep even, we have to do so as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Manchester, a member of the Kettering school board and
one who voted to approve GM's tax break, expressed mixed feelings
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not agree with abatements,''she said. ``I do not think
schools should be put in this position. But they have and until
they change, we're in a very difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   tax breaks are a small part of Time's overall story, which
concludes that government tax breaks and subsidies to corporations
rarely create any jobs and end up costing taxpayers money. The
federal government alone gives away $125 billion a year, the
magazine reported

 &HT;    Eagles' Peterson rewriting NCAA record books
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATESBORO, Ga._He's the best college running back in the state
of Georgia this season. In fact, he might be one of the best
running backs in the nation _ in all divisions. And Adrian Peterson
doesn't attend class in Athens or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The collegiate career of the Georgia Southern freshman is only
nine games old, but he has already established himself as one of
the best running backs in school history. The statistics speaks for
themselves _ school records in rushing yards (1,627), rushing
touchdowns (22), 200-yard games (five) and 100-yard games by a
freshman (nine).
</P>
<P>
   The 1,627 yards, 22 touchdowns and nine 100-yard rushing games
are Division I-AA freshman records, with two regular-season and at
least one playoff game remaining. Peterson even surpassed the state
of Georgia freshman record of 1,616 set by Herschel Walker in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Peterson is in position to rewrite the national record
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what can be done to stop him,'' said East
Tennessee State coach Paul Hamilton, who watched Peterson rush for
209 yards and two touchdowns on only 18 carries last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached at the Navy Academy and competed against (Georgia
Southern coach) Paul (Johnson) when he was at Hawaii,'' Hamilton
added. ``We both ran the option and had some pretty good fullbacks.
But this Peterson kid may be the best I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson is the primary reason behind Georgia Southern's rise to
the No. 1 ranking in I-AA, and he appears to be at his best when
the game is on the line. With the Eagles trailing 27-10 in the
third quarter against The Citadel, Peterson scored on a 21-yard
run, breaking four tackles, and added a 51-yard score in which he
ran up the middle and sprinted away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was finished, he had gained 196 yards and five
touchdowns in the second half and Georgia Southern had a 51-34
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen at the I-AA
level,'' Jacksonville State coach Matt Williams said after
Peterson's 219-yard, four-touchdown performance against the
Gamecocks. ``He's got great speed, great vision, and no one player
is going to bring him down. Every coach in America would like to
have one like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's dominance of Division I-AA raises one key question:
How did Division I schools miss on such a talented player? Several
major colleges recruited Peterson after he scored 65 career
touchdowns at Santa Fe High in Alachua, Fla., where he played one
season with older brother Mike, now a standout linebacker with the
University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although Peterson did not have academic problems in high school,
he suffers from a severe speech impediment that former Santa Fe
coach John Carter believes caused some schools to back away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida liked him, but they weren't signing many running backs
the year he came out,'' Carter said. ``He has a speech impediment,
and that may have caused Syracuse to back off a bit. When they'd
call, it might have been a communication problem trying to talk to
him by phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern entered the picture through its most
recognizable player _ former standout quarterback Tracy Ham. As a
former member of Johnson's staff at Georgia Southern, Ham went back
to his alma mater _ Sante Fe High _ to pick up the player that his
former coach constantly raved about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that has contributed to Adrian's
success is that our offense was similar to Georgia Southern's,''
Carter said. ``In 22 years of coaching, I don't think I've ever
seen a back hit a hole quicker than Adrian. What he's doing now
comes as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson's performance has surprised his current teammates
and coaches. He has the speed to run away from defenders (he has a
91-yard touchdown run this season), the power to break tackles and
the consistency to average 8.1 yards per carry and 180.8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him the ball enough times, he's going to make something
big happen,'' said Georgia Southern quarterback Greg Hill, who has
contributed to Peterson's success with his handling of the team's
option offense.
</P>
<P>
   With at least three games remaining, Peterson probably will
become only the fourth player in I-AA history to rush for 2,000
yards in a season and shatter the I-A freshman record of 1,863 set
by Wisconsin's Ron Dayne in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can you say?'' Johnson said. ``He's special. He's a
great back and a great kid.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he has a chance to become one of the most prolific
college running backs of all time, regardless of division, opposing
players and coaches are discovering one motivation behind
Peterson's success - the desire to win a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I try to do is go all out and help us win,'' he said.
``This is a nice honor (setting the I-AA freshman record), but I
just want to help us go 15-0 and win the national championship.''

 &HT;    Despair not; coping advice abounds
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hellfire stories abound. A great collapse may be triggered
by Y2K-plagued computer chips embedded in machinery of all kinds.
Fortunately, advice about coping has also begun bubbling to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point: two articles that coincidentally appear
in consecutive issues of the Year/
</P>
<P>
   2000 Journal on the Internet (http://www.y2kjournal.com).
</P>
<P>
   In the May-June issue, consultant Dave Bettinger writes about
``Embedded chips: Dispelling some myths.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other topics, he explains how to identify problem
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded chips, including the vulnerable ones, tend to reside in
equipment that uses electricity or some kind of power supply. But
here your common sense should prevail _ your clocks and flashlights
aren't going to crash from internal Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment that uses a display may need to be checked, but paper
shredders, power supplies, refrigerators, microwaves and the like
are low risk.
</P>
<P>
   Does it have a microprocessor? It may need to be investigated,
but TV sets, computer monitors, stereo equipment and similar gear
should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   Devices with calendars, especially those that use the calendar
for scheduling, are potentially at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry much about coffee pots, printers, many copiers,
digital clocks and calendars that don't schedule anything such as
those in watches and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   High-risk equipment includes phone systems, fax machines,
irrigation systems and energy-management systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the July-August edition of the Journal, Stephen Greif answers
yes to his article, ``Embedded systems: Still time to cash in your
chips?''
</P>
<P>
   He lays out an action plan. It includes inventorying what's at
risk, developing a strategy, including a contingency plan and
fixing what's broke.
</P>
<P>
   A key step in the plan is vendor contact. If that experience
leads nowhere, then naturally the equipment must be tested if its
value justifies such a move.
</P>
<P>
   The critical business applications that cannot be allowed to
fail for long include those that:
</P>
<P>
   -- connect your business to customers (such as phone and
networking systems)
</P>
<P>
   -- perform key functions (such as manufacturing or
process-control equipment)
</P>
<P>
   -- link your business to suppliers (such as electronic data
interchange systems and networks).
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have very deep pockets, you probably won't be warmed
by the writer's overall prognosis: ``For most (date-corrupted
embedded systems, replacing (them) is the most likely solution.''

 &HT;    Conductor Marin Alsop taking reins of the ASO for very public
job tryout

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_At first I thought, `Oh no, this can't be right _
there's been a terrible mistake!''' Conductor Marin Alsop is
remembering the day she was awarded the Leonard Bernstein
Conducting Fellowship, entitling her to a season at Tanglewood _
summer home of the Boston Symphony _ under the tutelage of the
late, great maestro. ``It was a huge turning point for me, because
they didn't know who I was. I had no political connections
whatsoever. They were simply interested in my talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been only 10 years since Alsop, in town this week to guest
conduct the Atlanta Symphony, gained acceptance into that bastion
of the Classical Musical Establishment. The only woman to win the
prestigious Koussevitzky Conducting Prize, the 42-year-old New York
native is music director of the Colorado Symphony in Denver and the
Cabrillo Festival in Santa Cruz, Calif., and founding artistic
director of New York's Concordia, an ensemble that specializes in
contemporary American music _ Alsop's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other guest conductors leading the ASO this season,
Alsop, who last led the orchestra in 1995, is a potential candidate
to succeed music director Yoel Levi. Her contract with Colorado
expires in 2000, the same time Levi's does with Atlanta. She is to
meet with the search committee this week and politely admits to
being interested. Alsop is also being considered by the Houston
Symphony and other ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably on a list for any orchestra in America right
now that has a music director vacancy,'' says Tom Bacchetti, former
executive director of the Atlanta Symphony and now in that post
with the Colorado Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Atlanta is ready for a woman music director is anybody's
guess. There is none in the top 25 U.S. orchestras and only three
in the top 75: Alsop, JoAnn Falletta in Buffalo, N.Y., and Ann
Madsen in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever major orchestra becomes the first to hire a woman is
going to get so much press and so much interest, because they'll be
doing something risky,'' says Alsop, who has overseen a rise in
both orchestra quality and audience attendance in Colorado since
her arrival five years ago. ``Just think about it: There are no CDs
of a woman conducting standard repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent breakfast at the Four Seasons, following her
habitual three-mile morning run, the refreshingly personable Alsop,
who is single, traced her evolution from free-lance fiddle player
substituting in the New York Philharmonic and playing on jingle
sessions for Kentucky Fried Chicken to her current status as young
American conductor on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gotten my master's from Juilliard in violin performance
and I was trying to get some conducting going _ it's what I always
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was a woman and an American and I'm under 6 feet tall. I
mean, really, what else could possibly be wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a sense of humor and a healthy dose of
irreverence: During her audition for Juilliard's conducting
program, Alsop made a wisecrack that caused the entire orchestra to
dissolve into laughter. ``They threw me out,'' she remembers. ``I
was young and it was hard for me to fit in well. But then I
thought, why am I busting my chops to try to get into a school that
clearly doesn't meet my sensibilities?''
</P>
<P>
   Eagerly admitting that ``tradition is not my forte,'' Alsop
simply formed her own orchestra to gain conducting experience.
Financed with her free-lance earnings, she founded Concordia in
1984, and studied technique with Carl Bamberger, whom she lovingly
describes as ``an old Viennese guy _ very old school. We'd drag out
the vacuum player and say, `Okay there are your woodwinds, and the
plants are the brass.' He was in his 80s, but he had the energy of
a 12-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   And he helped give her the equipment to gain acceptance into the
Tanglewood program, where she studied under Seiji Ozawa, Gustav
Meier and, of course, her mentor Bernstein. (She now owns a house
in the Berskshires in western Massachusetts where she studies
musical scores in the summer. She also has a house in DEnver and an
apartment in Manhattan.)
</P>
<P>
   From Bernstein she learned not only the technical and musical
skills to forge her way in a world dominated by white European
males, but, perhaps most importantly, the confidence to put across
her message in her own way, both physically and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really work on the physical aspect,'' says Alsop, the
only child of two professional string players. (Her father was
concertmaster of the New York City Ballet Orchestra for 30 years.
Her mother still plays in the same orchestra.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman makes the same gesture as a man, the response is
very different. If a man is very delicate with his hands, people
say, `Oh he's so sensitive.' If a woman is delicate, people say,
`Oh she's too frilly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, if a man is very macho, people say, `Oh
he's so strong and virile.' But when a woman does it, they call her
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was about being very, very strong with people. I'm a
little, `Oh, so sorry,' or `Oh, let me do that for you,' or `Oh,
you played a wrong note, so sorry.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work through that. Because when you give it to the
brass,'' she makes a fist to illustrate her point, ``you have to
stay connected to them. They expect you to be firm and be there for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then Bernstein really helped me to just forget about (the
technique of) conducting and connect on an emotional level. That's
hard not only for the conductor but for the players, too. It's a
very intimate relationship and you have to be open to it _ not
afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little question that the connection comes more
easily for a man on the podium than a woman, if no other reason
than sheer tradition. But either Alsop is sidestepping the issue,
or she truly doesn't worry about the gender barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My way is just to try and be myself. Playing in orchestras for
so long I really can relate to the musicians. And once you get over
that hump, once you're connected, which can happen very quickly,
then it opens up the opportunity to connect on a deeper level.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, she's having success getting through. In addition to
guesting with the major ensembles of Philadelphia, Los Angeles,
Cincinnati, and Washington, Alsop has been well-received in Europe,
where there are virtually no active women conductors outside
conservatories. Reviews from her recent stints in London and Paris
were consistently positive.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an all-Bernstein program with the London Sinfonia
last week, The Observer's critic wrote that Alsop ``has this music
in her blood. Through her clarity and sense of momentum she managed
to persuade the City of London Sinfonia it was in theirs too,
urging playing of spirit and swing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, she's extremely popular. ``The audience loves her,''
says Bacchetti, who, in an interesting swap, recently brought Levi
to Colorado to guest conduct. ``She's bright, energetic, personable
and makes music very accessible to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Shulgold, music critic at Denver's Rocky Mountain News,
credits Alsop with the Colorado Symphony's consistent rise.
``Before Marin, we had nothing but Europeans with thick accents as
music directors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marin was absolutely perfect for this community. She was not
only American, but she was very hip, very communicative,
accessible, unpretentious, unsnobby. People just really took to
her, and her being a woman was never really an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider her to be a potentially very hot property. And I
expect an announcement sometime between now and the end of her
contract that a major orchestra has hired her as music director. I
wonder if Atlanta would be a good fit.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: If these seats could talk, you wouldn't want to listen
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Getting ready to redecorate that upscale game
room in Tarrytown?
</P>
<P>
   Trying to find that unusual Christmas gift that will have people
talking?
</P>
<P>
   Well, then, how about buying your own used theater seat from
Cinema West, the recently closed dirty movie house at 2130 S.
Congress Ave.?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Cinema West, Henry
Benedict, the new owner of the property, will offer for sale all
500 or so upholstered chairs in the theater for $25 apiece.
Benedict will sell you one seat or as many as you want.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, after being in business since 1977, Cinema West
showed its last porn movie. Benedict says he bought the place last
summer, for somewhere between $350,000 and $450,000, in hopes of
turning it into a legitimate theater. And now he wants to unload
the seats to help cover his insurance and property tax bills, which
he says add up to about $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to help me defray my ongoing expenses,'' Benedict said of
the seat sale.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, if those Cinema West walls could talk, we couldn't run their
quotes in a family newspaper. You could say the same thing about
the Cinema West seats, too.
</P>
<P>
   So the main thing you want to know is if the seats have been
cleaned for this sale. At a selling price of $25 a pop, of course
not. ``That's why they're so cheap,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm having a hard time imagining the sort of crowd this sale is
going to attract. Can you imagine the kind of guy who would want to
buy a Cinema West upholstered seat for the sentimental value?
</P>
<P>
   I can hear it now. ``Snookums, I'm heading over to Cinema West
for the big $25 theater seat sale. After all, that's where I
saw`Lotta Fanny Does the General Land Office.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you really have to have one of these seats,
remember to bring your truck. Benedict isn't delivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $25 apiece, you can't beat that,'' he said. ``But it's
cash/carry.''
</P>
<P>
   So who will buy these seats? Will longtime customers come around
for a seat? Could be.
</P>
<P>
   James Pehl, a former manager at Cinema West, says there was a
man who attended every week or two and always sat in the same seat
in the back row. He may want to buy his old seat and take it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his one seat, and that was what he sat in,'' said Pehl,
who now works at Megaplex, Cinema West's latest incarnation, an
X-rated book and movie store that opened Sunday on South Interstate
35 near William Cannon Drive. ``Kind of like a Cheers thing, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict anticipates all sorts of buyers. ``I've had some people
approach me that are theater operators that want the seats to use
in a performing arts venue or a movie theater,'' he said. ``And
I've had some people who went there in the '50s and '60s, before it
was a porno theater. They've approached me for sticking them out on
their patio, as conversation pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you see a bunch of guys in trench coats Saturday
lugging furniture out of Cinema West, now you know what's
happening.

 &HT;    There's no bad rap on rock-hard 'Belly'
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the best movie ever to depict gangsta rap culture _
guns, drugs, sexism, warts and all _ the flashy new urban-crime
picture ``Belly'' is as visually dazzling as it is socially
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   From an opening, murderous nightclub scene shot in haunting
fluorescent colors to a showdown finale with rapper Earl ``DMX''
Simmons stalking his way through an ornate opera house, this
quick-action, chest-beating movie looks like an eye-candy music
video stretched out to 110 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Which is no reason to discount it. Written and directed by
26-year-old music-videomaker Hype Williams, who helped turn MTV and
BET into cinematic wonderlands with videos for Puff Daddy, Wu-Tang
Clan and more, ``Belly'' has all the panache its target audience of
young hip-hop fans might demand. Think ``New Jack City'' for the
late '90s. But it also offers that peculiar artistry and naive
gusto often seen in debuts by other self-made, one-man-army
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   DMX plays Tommy, a New York gangsta playa through and through.
In one scene, he's shooting up a nightclub with fancy guns. In
another, he's in his Benz talking on a cellular phone to his
girlfriend while another woman services him _ a moment that's
rather telling of the movie's fantasy-laden machismo.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's lifelong friend, Sincere (Nasir ``Nas'' Jones), is more
of a straight-shooter, with a wife, new baby and classy home to
support. He's hoping to get out of the crime life after one last
big score with Tommy, who's dabbling in dope shipments from Jamaica
to Omaha. All hell eventually breaks loose, with Tommy killing a
drug lord, finding himself shadowed by the Feds and being chased
everywhere by a vengeful associate, Shameek (Clifford ``Method
Man'' Smith).
</P>
<P>
   At times, ``Belly'' is hard to follow. There are holes in its
story, and the line between good rapper and bad actor is crossed on
numerous occasions (Nas and his on-screen wife, TLC's Tionne
``T-Boz'' Watkins, fumble many of their dramatic moments). The
upside to having all the rappers on screen, though, is that they
give ``Belly'' a cool, hardened edge that a Hollywood version
starring Denzel Washington would lack. In this case, that's
definitely a plus.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee is the most obvious influence over this film. Lee's
oft-used cinematographer Malik Sayeed uses vibrant colors and
engaging angles to put his stamp on ``Belly,'' while Williams, as
auteur, followed Lee's habit of worrying less about how scenes fit
together and more about how each one stands out. Many of them hit
home, too, particularly violent ones such as a shootout in a strip
club or another in a mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the violence _ along with the heavy drug use and
the utter lack of anything for women to do but show off their
bodies _ leaves ``Belly'' wildly open to social criticism. The
movie does the right thing with a redemption sort of ending, but it
may be too little too late. Unlike music videos, movies can show
the gritty realities and, moreover, troubling fantasies of gangsta
life. ``Belly'' does so fearlessly. In the end, as with many good
movies, that aspect should indeed give viewers something to fear.

 &HT;    Reborn vintage radios bring out simpler times
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Not all old radios die in landfills. They
surface at garage sales and flea markets. Some people put them in
their original packages and store them in safe places. Then they
take them out, wipe off the dust and repair them. Stephen Kuhn is a
master repairman who specializes in bringing those old ''radio
days'' back to life for his customers who want to recapture a time
of innocence. At Kuhn's shop in Lockhart, old radios and old
memories come swirling back to gratified customers. Here are some
of their stories and his. Summer of '61 in Texas City
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real cool kitty from Texas City!'' Carol Quinlan pulls
her light blue 1958 Packard into the Terrace Drive-In on Ninth
Street, where the best cheeseburger in the world is 35 cents. It is
a place to be seen. She and Diana Cox are talking about what their
dates tried the night before and about their next slumber party
that is sure to be crashed by boys. Houston's KILT-AM station is
playing and playing ``Unchained Melody'' by The Righteous Brothers.
Carol is heartbroken about breaking up with her sweetheart, Kenny
Vanderslice. She wanted to marry Kenny and bear his 10 children.
(He's a cab driver in Denver now. ``God, I'm glad we didn't do
it,'' she says.) Their song is ``Theme From a Summer Place'' from
the movie starring Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue. Her sanity is her
parents' graduation present, a Blaupunkt Verona model table radio
that puts the restless young woman to sleep every night.
</P>
<P>
   1998 in Lockhart
</P>
<P>
   That same radio is playing Elvis and The Platters, the same
songs Carol loved in the 1960s. She's eating pizza and drinking a
Coke with Butch Daniels. ``My God, it's you, Butch, in my living
room!'' Carol had a secret crush on Butch in high school, but she
was Kenny's girl, and Butch was going steady with Jane Sosnowy. Two
years ago at their 35th high school reunion, she and Butch
reunited. Now, he's her steady. On a Saturday evening, they tune in
to Austin's Oldies 103. It's like being back in high school.
</P>
<P>
   All these years, Carol Brown's connection to the wonderful, fun
days in Texas City has been her radio. ``People who know me know
it's been the constant in my life,'' she says. Her adoptive
parents, Edward and Ruth Quinlan gave her the radio just before
graduation. ``It was German made, had round corners and boy, was it
shiny,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, Hurricane Carla hit the coast and the Quinlans were
forced to evacuate to Nacogdoches. Brown packed only her radio,
using the cardboard box it came in. Always, she carried that radio
with her: when she went off to college to Lamar Tech in Beaumont,
when she married in 1962, when she divorced in 1974 and left for
Houston to live with hippies, when she remarried and moved to
Portland, then to San Diego, then back to Portland, then to Corpus
Christi, then Austin and finally Lockhart in 1996. Each time, the
radio was wrapped in sheets next to her on the floorboard of a car.
Even today, she handles it with cotton gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Summer of 1962 in Quihi (Medina County)
</P>
<P>
   At 6 a.m. after a late night thunderstorm, 6-year-old Gordon
Bohmfalk can smell the wet hay and sorghum. It's harvest time.
Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he looks at his grandfather, Irvin
Bohmfalk . ``We've got a lot of fence to fix today,'' he says .
Granddad is focused on the day so he reaches for the truck radio to
hear the weather report and cattle prices on WOAI out of San
Antonio. It takes a few seconds for it to warm up, and then the
raspy reception comes in. Grandpa paid $1,910 cash for his 1958
Chevrolet Apache truck, but it's the radio that intrigues the boy.
By dusk, after the work is done, they listen to a baseball game,
any baseball game. Every day should be like this _ a boy with his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   1998 in Austin
</P>
<P>
   Gordon drives that Chevy truck to work everyday. Working late at
his architecture firm, he sneaks away to drive around the block for
a few minutes to listen to the World Series. The radio still takes
time to warm up. It still howls when it's tuned between stations.
The reception still isn't crystal clear. It's beautiful, though.
Grandpa, it seems, is right there riding shotgun. ``The radio
brings everything back to life. I'm doing something he enjoyed
doing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As Gordon Bohmfalk grew into his teen years, he loved to disrupt
his grandfather's routine by changing the station on the radio to
listen to the Beatles and The Rolling Stones. ``Shut it off,''
grandfather would say in his thick German accent. ``Shut that crazy
stuff off.'' Of course, grandfather never did more than state his
case. Gordon played his music and granddad just put up with it.
</P>
<P>
   After Gordon's grandfather passed away, that old truck must have
sat in a field for 15 years. When Gordon looked at the truck two
years ago, the keys were still in it; the owners's manual was still
in the glove box. ``It was frozen in time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled the truck back to Austin and eventually restored it.
The radio worked for a while and went kaput. He fixed it, too.
Gordon recently took his father, Douglas Bohmfalk, to the ranch
that is still in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about my grandfather and how proud he would be that
the truck is running and the radio is working. I could feel his
presence. That day was emotional for the both of us, but
enjoyable,'' says Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects his son will someday drive him to Quihi when he's up
in his years. They'll listen to the radio howl between stations and
maybe a ball game will be on.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kuhn, 48, is the grand master repairman of antique
radios belonging to people like Brown and Bohmfalk. ``People have
their old radios repaired because they want to recapture memories
of their youth, of good times,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into his Neon Radio shop on Main Street in Lockhart and see
an old Philco radio like the one your granddaddy used. Kuhn's place
to ``tinker'' is a graveyard of radios. He assumes every radio he
trades for or buys is dead. It's up to him to make them come to
life for every person who walks in and says, ``Hey, I remember that
one as a kid. I want it. I don't care what it costs to fix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life comes full circle with these radios,'' says Jason
Wakefield, who's had a couple of old radios fixed by Kuhn and will
probably buy more. Today, he listens to ``Radio Australia,'' the
same program he listened to as a teen-ager on the same short-wave
radio that Kuhn repaired. ``I'm enjoying world radio the same as
when I was a kid,'' says Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 radios collect dust at Neon Radio on shelves
stacked high on a wall. Tables with more radios crowd the entire
shop. In the middle toward the back is Kuhn's repair center.
Volumes of repair manuals are everywhere. So are more shelves with
tubes and transistors to make those radios play again. Military
radios, console radios, transistor radios, table radios. Novelty
radios as Coke bottles, beer cans, hot dogs, baseballs, cars, gas
pumps and toilets. The oldest is a 1923 RCA radio modeled after a
military radio. He has no favorite, but a fake radio that is really
a flask for liquor is a conversation piece. People laugh but no
one's bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does a day pass without someone calling about an old
radio sitting in the attic or garage. They huddled around it in
their day to listen to dramas like ``The Shadow,'' ``The Green
Hornet,'' ``Sky King,'' ``The Jack Benny Show'' and ``Fibber McGee
and Molly.''
</P>
<P>
   They want it fixed. It will bring back memories of mom or dad
and a world that was less technical but seemingly more enjoyable.

   Count on it, there will be many on the far right who will
attribute the Republican decline in Tuesday's national election to
lack of zeal and belief in the old-time religion. That will be a
hard point to make.
</P>
<P>
   The election, as it turned out, was not a referendum on Bill
Clinton or Monica Lewinsky. It was a referendum on that blandest of
human attributes, moderation. The public would like more of it,
less of name-calling, less of hare-brained ideas like shutting down
the government for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the Republican decline since the party's immense
victory in 1994 has been a terrible misreading of the public mind.
The public was looking for something different. They sought a
Republican evolution, not a Republican revolution. Liberal was
already a dirty word. And so, quickly, was moderation. You were
nothing if you did not loathe blindly.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people were frightened. They began to imagine being on
someone's hit list. Still, some good may have come of it. On
Tuesday, a lot of African-American and Hispanic voters, the most
endangered of us, finally may have been convinced that their votes
count for something. Welcome, at long last, to America.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich blames the media for ignoring his most heartfelt
agenda and wallowing in Monicagate. If House Republicans are smart,
they'll raise a lot of hell, then let Bill Clinton cop a plea. If
Bill Clinton is smart, he'll take it.

 &HT;    Fans won't buy live albums by dead rock bands
 &HT;    By Don McLeese, Chris Riemenschneidner, and Jerry Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ `No Security' Rolling Stones Virgin `A Little
South of Sanity' Aerosmith Geffen `Reunion' Black Sabbath Epic It's
an odd statement on the music industry that a $70 concert ticket is
widely accepted these days, but a $15.99 version of that same
concert on CD remains a questionable investment. Take away all the
theatrics and the thrill of having a rock legend stare you in the
eyes _ via an 80-foot Jumbotron, of course _ and the arena-rock
gods of old just seem, well, old.
</P>
<P>
   Overkill also has a lot to do with the growing skepticism for
live rock CDs. Both Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, after all, already
offer an odd assortment of concert albums that aren't very good,
and the Rolling Stones literally have one to match (and milk) every
tour they've done for the past two decades. So as these
classic-rock staples release new concert albums within a week of
one another, culminating today with the Stones' ``No Security,''
don't be surprised to see fans drawing a line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the single-disc ``No Security'' is concerned, enough
is definitely enough. Largely devoid of saturated Stones fare _
``Gimme Shelter'' and a version of ``Waiting on a Friend''
featuring saxophonist Joshua Redman are the most recognizable _ the
album instead focuses on lesser-known material from the ``Bridges
to Babylon'' tour that is often just plain lesser.
</P>
<P>
   Four songs from the ``Bridges'' album is four too many any way
you slice it, but older tracks on ``No Security,'' such as
``Respectable'' and ``Memory Motel,'' prove equally forgettable,
even with Dave Matthews singing on the latter tune. ``Sister
Morphine'' and ``Live With Me'' do their job in widening the
Stones' classic repertoire, but there are just too many gaps in
between to bring it all together.
</P>
<P>
   Black Sabbath's two-disc ``Reunion'' isn't much better. As the
title suggests, this is the real Black Sabbath, not just guitarist
Tony Iommi and the last guy to sing on a Deep Purple album. But
even with singer Ozzy Osbourne and the band's original rhythm
section in tow for this one-night showdown in Birmingham, England,
the Sabbath of lore can't fuel the hell-fire of its classic tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Things start out strong enough, as the band tears through ``War
Pigs'' and ``Fairies Wear Boots.'' The seemingly undead Osbourne,
though, sounds winded by the second half of the disc, eventually
wheezing out the show-stoppers ``Children of the Grave'' and
``Paranoid.'' Two new tracks tagged on to the end make it clear
that maybe this is one band best left in the graveyards of its
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Aerosmith's ``A Little South of Sanity'' makes more sense than
the other two live releases. It also makes more noise (the good
kind). This is actually the Boston bombers' first live album since
their mid-'80s rebirth on MTV, and latter-day hits like ``The Other
Side'' and ``Dude (Looks Like a Lady)'' never sounded better than
on this two-disc collection. Singer Steven Tyler's well-aged rock
rasp is the tie that binds more recent material with older gems
like ``Sweet Emotion,'' ``Mama Kin'' and ``Last Child,'' all of
which the band delivers with fine-tuned finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Aerosmith has a leg up on Sabbath and the Stones by still being
a band, not a corporate enterprise with four backup singers or a
revived legend with catalog CDs to push. Oh sure, they're all in it
for the money these days, but at least there's still life to sell
on ``A Little South of Sanity.'' That's the least a fan should
expect from a ``live'' CD. _ Chris Riemenschneider
</P>
<P>
   `The Seven Deadly Sins' Marianne Faithfull RCA
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing novel about a pop singer taking on Kurt Weill
and Bertholt Brecht. Ask Perry Como, Jim Morrison, Bobby Darin,
David Bowie and Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems cheeky to cast Marianne Faithfull in the last
Brecht/Weill collaboration, ``The Seven Deadly Sins.'' This is not
the sweet folky voice she showed on ``This Little Bird'' and ``As
Tears Go By'' in the mid-'60s, but more the world-weary chanteuse
on her comeback single, ``Sister Morphine.'' In fact in the past
decade, Weill has taken the place Mick Jagger once occupied in
Faithfull's career. She sang on Hall Willner's Weill salute, ``Lost
in the Stars,'' performed the role of Pirate Jenny in ``Threepenny
Opera'' and has been performing ``Seven Deadly Sins'' around
Europe. Although some big-name singers, like Teresa Stratas, Anna
Silja and Ute Lemper have taken up Brecht and Weill, there is an
edginess to Faithfull that has been missing since the death of
Weill's wife, Lotte Lenya, who defined these roles.
</P>
<P>
   Not a singer's singer, Lenya's nicotine-strained tones conveyed
the appropriate streetwise indifference of Brecht's tough women. We
hear it again in Faithfull, although she takes the part an octave
lower than written, making it seem as though we have just awakened
her. Faithfull's own checkered resume(accent) informs this grim
allegory of Anna, a dancer who shimmys and fox-trots through seven
American cities succumbing to the Seven Deadly Sins.
</P>
<P>
   The instrumental playing on the disc doesn't show the same
roughness as the singing. There is always something incongruous
about hearing Weill played this precisely. It is not that conductor
Dennis Russell Davies and the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra miss
the point; I just want to hear more loose threads, blurred like a
Georg Grosz painting. This roughness is still best captured in the
78 rpm recordings of Lenya and the Theo Mackeben Jazz Band. _ Jerry
Young `Electro-Shock Blues' Eels DreamWorks
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing Along at Home,'' suggests the tombstone illustration
inside the CD booklet. Yeah, right. Come on, kids, gather 'round
the piano, and let's serenade ourselves with ``Cancer for the
Cure,'' ``My Descent Into Madness'' and the rest of this eminently
humable song cycle on disease and death.
</P>
<P>
   Once one gets past the oddity of the project, however (It's got
a good beat, you can suffer and you can dance to it!), the second
album by the Eels is the most oddly affecting of the season. It
demystifies the unmentionable by transforming it into fodder for
everyday pop, thus offering an affirmation of life through its
acceptance of death.
</P>
<P>
   It also offsets the tendency toward preciousness of Mark Oliver
Everett, who released two albums under the monicker of E before
adding a rhythm section for band billing as the Eels. While his
supporting cast here includes Grant Lee Phillips and T-Bone Burnett
_ both on the gorgeously redemptive ``Climbing to the Moon'' _ as
well as violinist Lisa Germano, the cathartic introspection is all
E's, as he details his sister's suicide and his mother's terminal
cancer in loving, yet not overly sentimental fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of it works. Lines such as ``Life is funny/But not ha ha
funny/Peculiar I guess'' are too awkwardly banal to pass as
personal observation, while ``It's time to split this hunk of
clay'' sounds manneredly flip. Yet so much of the music has such a
vulnerable, disarming innocence to it _ shaded bittersweet by the
baroque string arrangements over the brittle beauty of the celeste
and harpsichord tones _ that it gives the project the grace of
lullabies or hymns. If you can imagine Daniel Johnston
collaborating with Elliott Smith on a sequel to Lou Reed's ``Magic
and Loss,'' it might sound like this. _ Don McLeese CD
neighborhood: The holiday rush officially begins today with such
major releases as Alanis Morissette's sophomore album, ``Supposed
Former Infatuation Junkie''; a four-CD John Lennon solo box set,
``Anthology''; and the first compilation by U2, ``Greatest Hits:
1980-1990.'' A limited number of those U2 discs come with a second
CD of B-sides and outtakes. Several live discs hit stores today,
too, including Hanson's ``Live From Albertane,'' the Bee Gees'
``One Night Only'' and 311's ``Live.'' Also out: Celine Dion's
Christmas album ``These are Special Times,'' Beck's ``Mutations,''
FWC's ``Organized Crime,'' the Cardigans' ``Gran Turismo'' and
Midnight Oil's ``Redneck Wonderland.''

 &HT;    'NEW' IRS PLAGUED BY OLD PROBLEMS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Internal Revenue Service is trying to
build a more businesslike and friendly image, it's a long way from
winning prizes for popularity or efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new congressional study, some taxpayers are still
hounded long after their tax bills are paid, while revenue
collection centers have such lax security that at least $5.3
million has been lost or stolen in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the huge tax collection agency, whose auditors
frequently go over taxpayers' ledgers with a magnifying glass, can
provide only a rough estimate of the IRS's own balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   After widely publicized hearings last year highlighted similar
problems, the agency began a major overhaul ordered by Congress and
backed by the White House. Even so, the IRS continues to be
``plagued by weaknesses that adversely affect the agency's ability
to safeguard assets,'' said the General Accounting Office, the
investigating arm of Congress, in a newly issued report.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the IRS has made little progress
toward management reforms and said the agency has failed to
implement nearly two dozen ``critical recommendations'' that
government auditors have urged since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy IRS Commissioner Michael P. Dolan, in a response to the
study, argued that the agency had made ``significant progress'' in
some areas but generally agreed with the findings. Among the
problems cited:
</P>
<P>
   _ More than two years after a multimillion-dollar tax bill was
paid by a corporation, the IRS pursued the company's officers, even
putting liens on their personal property, because agency computers
cannot keep track of complex accounts. New computers with more
capacity are planned, but could take more than a decade to install.
In the meantime, the GAO study proposed that such cases be handled
manually, but the IRS rejected the idea as unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of surveillance cameras or basic security precautions has
made it easy for employees to pilfer funds as they process taxpayer
filings. In one case, an IRS employee and his co-conspirators
altered a check written to ``I.R.S.'' to make it read ``I.R.
Smith'' and deposited the sum in his bank account. In another case,
a taxpayer's check for $590,000 was stolen and reprinted into
several checks drawn on the same account.
</P>
<P>
   _ The IRS can offer only general estimates for accounts
receivable and for revenue receipts because of its inadequate
ledger system. Until recently, the tax agency had listed on its
books many debts owed by taxpayers who were deceased, bankrupt, or
incarcerated. It has now determined that only $28 billion of its
$214 billion in overdue taxes could be considered collectible.

</P>
<P>
   Ayers Rock, or ``Uluru'' as it's called in Appalachian, is the
world's largest single stone monolith, rising 1,143 feet above
Australia's seemingly endless desert plain. It is as much a symbol
of the continent as Mt. Fuji is of Japan. It's also as steep a
climb as Masada in Israel, the Grand Canyon in the United States or
the Great Wall in China.
</P>
<P>
   Ayers Rock must exude some primal force that draws tourists from
faraway places, who view the sun rising and setting over it, walk
the six miles around its base and, in some cases, climb to its top.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attracted to this geologic wonder was Dennis
Cavagnaro, a veteran traveler from Oakland, Calif. Like many mature
travelers, he is a little overweight. Despite two hip replacements,
he refused to go quietly into his 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't easy!'' Cavagnaro said. ``The reward of the climb is
the sense of achievement and the spectacular 360-degree view.''
</P>
<P>
   It's best to climb Ayers Rock early in the morning before the
direct, unfiltered sunlight makes it unbearably hot. An early start
also allows the breeze to keep away flies and other biting insects.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers in Cavagnaro's tour group piled out of bed in
pitch-black darkness so that they wouldn't miss the sunrise over
the rock. They had to travel 11 miles from the comfortable resort
at Yulara Village outside Uluru National Park, an Aboriginal
National Park leased to the Commonwealth of Australia. To enter the
park you must show your prepaid entrance ticket ($10) at the ranger
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't the first or last group to reach the western tip of
Uluru's base,'' Cavagnaro said. ``We could see a thin line of hardy
climbers already creeping vertically up the only approved trail.''
</P>
<P>
   The trail's only identifying mark is a low steel chain. Since
there are no other natural features on the rock, the climbers, at a
distance, could easily have passed for ants.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the trail is a sign that explains how the
Aboriginal owners have given permission for people to climb the
rock, but the natives prefer that people don't. A sign also warns
climbers of the dangers: At least 26 climbers have perished on the
rock since 1965 _ 20 from heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the climb requires picking the most efficient
path through 200 yards of huge broken boulders. These have earned
the derisive name ``Chicken Rocks.'' It is here that many initially
intrepid climbers decide it's best to simply explore Uluru's base.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Chicken Rocks,'' there's another 200 yards of bare
surface sandstone which rises at about a 45-degree incline.
Cavagnaro says it's imperative that a climber's footwear have
``grip,'' because that's the only thing that can keep a person from
slipping back down the mountainside _ especially if it's windy.
</P>
<P>
   A steel chain was Cavagnaro's lifesaver. It was supported by
stanchions placed about every five yards. The stanchion is
suspended only two feet off the rock's surface. The low height
isn't a problem since climbers are already bent forward trying to
pull themselves up. The chain also affords some security for
resting and catching your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Rest stops proved to be heartbreaking, Cavagnaro says. He felt
as though he wasn't getting any closer to the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only measure of gain was to look back and see my progress
from the bottom, which looked smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Depressions in the rock showed signs of occasional rainwater.
Cavagnaro was surprised by Uluru's scarred and striated surface _
it was much rougher than pictures had lead him to believe.
 &UR; 'OVER THE HILL' _ TO THE TOP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cavagnaro's persistence finally paid off when, over a rolling
``hill,'' he saw the marker monument at the summit. The climb had
taken him an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   A younger climber, Sherry, had run to the top in 45 minutes. And
she paid the price. ``My thighs are screaming at me,'' she later
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry had brought a pair of ballet slippers, donned them and
pirouetted on the peak. The climbers all posed for pictures before
beginning the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Cavagnaro's calves and thigh muscles, which had valiantly
carried him to the top, now were trembling, begging him to find the
slightest excuse to stop. He tried a variety of psychological and
physical tricks to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Descending with his back to the rock, Cavagnaro enjoyed the
breathtaking, wide-angled vista before him. Letting go of the first
link of chain, he found it a bit frightening to negotiate the last
400 to 500 yards. All the muscles in his body were tight, his hips
were aching and he feared he would fall.
</P>
<P>
   At the base, his troupe of climbers all piled into a van and
headed back to their luxurious digs, Sailes in the Desert Hotel at
the Ayers Rock Resort. Their reward: a cooling plunge in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk just a bit taller these days,'' Cavagnaro now says. ``I
had met my self-imposed challenge. I was validated in my own eyes.
My next goal is to climb the mountain I consider to be one of the
ultimates _ Mt. Sinai, Jebel Sirbal.''
</P>
<P>
   A visa is required to enter Australia. Visitors should consider
staying a few extra days and renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
Alice Springs and a stop at the Frontier Camel Farm _ complete with
a camel ride along the Todd River _ make for a remarkable trip.

 By MIKE ALLEN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Under an eight-foot-tall Gilbert Stuart portrait of George
Washington, an actor dressed in a slave trader's gold vest sinks to
his knees and tells a judge, ``The Negroes had gathered with sabers
around my head, and they just started singing my death chant.''
 &HT;    The trader, Don Pedro Montez, pleads for the return of his
slaves every Tuesday at the Old State House in Hartford, part of a
re-enactment of a trial _ held in that very room _ after the 1839
slave mutiny on the schooner Amistad.
 &HT;    Connecticut's capital is known as the city where the world's
insurance industry blossomed, where Mark Twain wrote most of his
best-known works and where Samuel Colt mass-produced his revolver.
But interest in Hartford's connection to the Amistad grew after the
Stephen Spielberg movie was released last December. Now, new
exhibits, tours and events highlight the area's history as a hotbed
of abolition activity.
 &HT;    The Amistad trial began in Hartford, though it concluded in New
Haven. The slaves returned to the area after they were freed.
Farmington, 10 miles southwest of the city, was known for the
clusters of homes and churches where escaped slaves hid on their
way to Canada. It is one of a number of quaint Hartford suburbs
that treasure their individual histories and identities.
 &HT;    Hartford itself began as a Dutch trading post on the Connecticut
River, then was settled by an English congregation from
Massachusetts. The congregation's minister, the Rev. Thomas Hooker,
is considered the city's founder and is still honored with an
annual parade. The city is now about a two-hour drive from both New
York and Boston, and getting around is a snap: Interstates 84 and
91 cross in downtown.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Old State House, a federal landmark of brick and brownstone
that was the seat of state government from 1796 to 1878 and the
city government from 1878 to 1915, is at 800 Main St., (860)
522-6766.
 &HT;    The State House flies the Union Jack and Betsy Ross flags, among
others, and startles commuters by opening and closing each day with
a cannon blast. It is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m., and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Free. The Amistad trial
is re-enacted in what was the State Senate chamber each Tuesday at
12:15 p.m.
 &HT;    The second floor houses a museum of ``natural and artificial
curiosities,'' patterned after a museum of oddities that was housed
there from 1797 to 1808. It now includes a two-headed calf
(stuffed), a two-headed pig (in a jar) and a ``unicorn horn''
(courtesy of an unfortunate whale).
 &HT;    The Connecticut Historical Society, 1 Elizabeth St., (860)
236-5621, has its own Amistad offering, a five-gallery extravaganza
of light, sound and artifacts telling the story of the voyage and
trial. Upstairs, the historical society has a collection of
Colonial silver, furniture and household goods. Visitors are also
invited to climb into a dugout canoe made with Indian tools and
techniques. Admission: $6, $3 for students. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, noon to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,''
lived in a 12-room ``cottage'' at 73 Forest St. from 1873 until she
died in 1896. The Harriet Beecher Stowe House, (860) 525-9317,
displaying an early use of wall-to-wall carpeting (clashing with
the floral wallpaper), is closed Monday except in the summer and
during December. Admission: $6.50, and $2.75 ages 6 to 16.
 &HT;    Samuel Clemens was cranking up his lecturing and writing when he
and his family built a house next to Stowe's in 1874. The Mark
Twain House, 351 Farmington Ave., (860) 493-6411, which has bricks
painted black and others vermilion, has been referred to as part
steamboat, part medieval fortress and part cuckoo clock; the
curators prefer ``aggressive new modern.''
 &HT;    Clemens often wrote in the billiard room on the third floor,
which featured a ``stepping out deck,'' so unwanted visitors could
be told that Clemens had ``stepped out.'' Tours are 9:30 to 4 p.m.
and 11 to 4 Sunday. Closed Tuesdays after this week, except in
December. Admission: $9, $8 for 60 and older and $5 ages 6 to 12.
 &HT;    One more writer's residence is on a Hartford must-see list. The
Noah Webster House, 227 South Main St., West Hartford, (860)
521-5362, is the birthplace of the dictionary author (the roadside
sign renders his name with diacritical marks). The house has 65
pieces of period furniture and 600 decorative art objects that give
a flavor of life in the late 1700s. Admission is $5. Open 1 to 4
p.m.; closed Wednesday.
 &HT;    The State Capitol, with its shimmering gold-leaf dome, has
one-hour tours from 9:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. on weekdays year-round,
and 10:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. on Saturday from April through October,
(860) 240-0222.
 &HT;    A panoramic view of the city is free from atop the 520-foot
Travelers Tower, on Main Street next to the Wadsworth, from mid-May
through the third week of October from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; (860)
277-4208. A bonus is the two falcons that roost on the observation
deck.
 &HT;    Children can get a break from old houses at Dinosaur State Park
in Rocky Hill, eight miles south of the city, (860) 529-8423.
Scientists have found hundreds of tracks there, some of which can
be seen from a 300-foot-long boardwalk.
 &HT;    In the exhibit center, a push-button game challenges visitors to
use fossils to determine whether the beast was herding, running or
just passing through. The park is open daily 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The exhibit center costs $2, $1 ages 6 to 17 and is closed Monday.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Through Jan. 3, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the nation's oldest
public art museum, is presenting an exhibition exploring the taming
of two frontiers, ``New Worlds from Old: 19th Century Australian
and American Landscapes.'' The museum, at 600 Main St., (860)
278-2670, also has a fashion retrospective, ``Designing Women:
American Style, 1940-1960,'' on display through Feb. 6.
 &HT;    The museum, known for its Hudson River School landscapes and a
collection of Pilgrim Century furniture from the 17th century,
encourages children to explore its collections, by offering
treasure-hunt cards. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Admission: $7, $5 for seniors and students, $3 for ages 6
to 17; free Thursday and before noon Saturday.
 &HT;    A Halloween Graveyard Tour, which includes stops at Colonial and
Victorian burial grounds in Farmington and dinner at a 1789 private
home that once was a tavern, is offered at twilight daily in
October, then on weekends through Nov. 21 by Heritage Trails
Sightseeing Tours, (860) 677-8867. The house has a crawl space
between fireplaces that was a ``hiding hole'' for slaves. The tour,
which costs $32.95, features a lesson in the meaning of gravestone
inscriptions. Bring a flashlight. Reservations are required.
 &HT;    Heritage Trails also offers daily minibus tours of Hartford and
of black history and Amistad sites in Farmington ($15 each).
 &HT;    ``The Phantom of the Opera'' will be performed Dec. 16 through
Jan. 17 (tickets $16.50 to $66.50) at Bushnell Memorial Hall, 166
Capitol Ave., (860) 987-5900. This brick auditorium with gold-leaf
dome and Art Deco interior, where a Presidential debate was held in
1996, sits just down a grassy hill from the State Capitol.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    A portrait of Abraham Lincoln in the front room is a reminder of
the Underground Railroad country that surrounds the Barney House, a
bed-and-breakfast at 11 Mountain Spring Road in Farmington, (860)
674-2796, fax (860) 677-7259. The staff can direct you to houses
nearby where runaway slaves once were secreted.
 &HT;    The peach-colored stucco house, which was given to the
University of Connecticut Foundation by the Barney family, also
serves as a conference center. The seven guest rooms all have
private baths and are decorated with antiques. Doubles are $115.
 &HT;    Another popular choice just outside the city is the Chester
Bulkley House, 184 Main St. in Wethersfield, four miles south of
the city across the river, (860) 563-4236, fax (860) 257-8266.
 &HT;    This five-room brick Greek Revival bed-and-breakfast, built in
1830, is stuffed with porcelain dolls and antique toys. Breakfast
is huge, including seasonal fruit in dishes like baked apples and
pears. Doubles with private bath are $85; two rooms share a bath.
 &HT;    Budget: The West Hartford Inn, 900 Farmington Ave., West
Hartford, (860) 236-3221, fax (860) 236-3445, is between the Mark
Twain House and Farmington. West Hartford, a separate town
adjoining the city, has many of the boutiques, shops and other
amenities that downtown Hartford lacks. The 53 standard hotel rooms
cost $74 for single or double, or $67 with certain discounts.
 &HT;    Luxury: The 1881 Queen Anne-style Goodwin Hotel, Haynes Street
at Asylum Avenue, (860) 246-7500, fax (860) 247-4576, was renovated
early this year. Its 124 rooms are decorated in Colonial style and
all have marble baths. Doubles begin at $189 midweek and $89 on
weekends.
 &HT;    The J. P. Morgan Suite, once an apartment owned by the
financier, includes a grand piano and a whirlpool, and goes for
$677 a night for one bedroom, or $977 for two. The hotel has a
restaurant, lounge and fitness area.
 &HT;    The Simsbury Inn, 14 miles west of Hartford at 397 Hopmeadow
Street, Simsbury, (860) 651-5700, fax (860) 651-8024, has 97 rooms
with French country-style furnishings or mahogany four-poster beds
and armoires. Rooms have refrigerators and hair dryers. Chairs are
arrayed around the lobby fireplace and there are an indoor pool and
a health club. Doubles start at $159; weekend packages start at
$129.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    New England meets the South at The Savannah, (860) 278-2020, a
white-tablecloth restaurant where the sauteed lobster tail is
served over grilled grits. Or try a sweet potato ravioli appetizer
and shrimp scampi with wild mushrooms.
 &HT;    The Savannah, decorated with artifacts from Africa, is on the
first floor of what was once a hotel at 391 Main Street at Capitol
Avenue. Dinner for two with wine, $75. Lunch served Tuesday through
Friday and dinner Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    Hartford's power crowd hangs out across from the Civic Center at
Max Downtown, 185 Asylum St., (860) 522-2530, amid stained glass
and abstract murals. The menu includes lots of fish and pasta
dishes, and a side order of garlic mashed potatoes means a pound of
spuds that take as much space on their own oval plate as the
accompanying chop. The cigar bar in the back is full even at
lunchtime. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine about $100.
 &HT;    Diners eat under the rustic beams of a former grist mill at the
Mill on the River, 989 Ellington Road, South Windsor, northeast of
the city, (860) 289-7929. A promenade deck has been built around
the former mill pond, which has a 30-foot fountain. Pondside dining
is available when the weather allows. It is known for its fresh
fish, especially the redfish nouvelle, lightly blackened and topped
with shrimp, scallops, spinach and Mornay sauce. Dinner for two
with a moderate wine, $60.
 &HT;    Two blocks from the Mark Twain House is Oasis, 267 Farmington
Ave., (860) 241-8200, a 1949 stainless steel diner where the menu
includes salmon baked in pistachio and walnut crust with gorgonzola
and poppyseed dressing as well as meat loaf and open-face turkey
sandwiches. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine, about $25.
 &HT;    Downstairs is Pancho's, where corrugated-steel walls and
leathertop tables evoke a cantina. The menu offers pollo mole and
other Mexican dishes. Open for dinner only; about $30 a couple,
with drinks.

spuds that take as much space on their own oval plate as the
accompanying chop. The cigar bar in the back is full even at
lunchtime. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine about $100.
 &HT;    Diners eat under the rustic beams of a former grist mill at the
Mill on the River, 989 Ellington Road, South Windsor, northeast of
the city, (860) 289-7929. A promenade deck has been built around
the former mill pond, which has a 30-foot fountain. Pondside dining
is available when the weather allows. It is known for its fresh
fish, especially the redfish nouvelle, lightly blackened and topped
with shrimp, scallops, spinach and Mornay sauce. Dinner for two
with a moderate wine, $60.
 &HT;    Two blocks from the Mark Twain House is Oasis, 267 Farmington
Ave., (860) 241-8200, a 1949 stainless steel diner where the menu
includes salmon baked in pistachio and walnut crust with gorgonzola
and poppyseed dressing as well as meat loaf and open-face turkey
sandwiches. Dinner for two, with a glass of wine, about $25.
 &HT;    Downstairs is Pancho's, where corrugated-steel walls and
leathertop tables evoke a cantina. The menu offers pollo mole and
other Mexican dishes. Open for dinner only; about $30 a couple,
with drinks.

 &HT;    In-home showings for women aid sales of sensual products
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karen Williams has an answer to the age-old question: What do
women want?
</P>
<P>
   If you're female and older than 21, she'll sell it to you and
your friends in the privacy of your home. Batteries not included.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Williams earns a good living as a sales rep for
Surprise Parties Co., a Tennessee company that sells lotions,
potions and gadgets that hum to women eager to jazz up their love
lives. Surprise Parties is one of about a dozen similar U.S.
companies that sell sensual products to women using the home-party
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Think: Tupperware party without the burps.
</P>
<P>
   On this Thursday night, she's the reason 10 women have gathered
in a spacious living room in Roswell, Georgia. They're guests of
Clara Pennington, who's housesitting here for a friend and who has
organized the party with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The sales rep is a tall, striking blonde who lives in Aragon,
Ga., with her husband and two young children. The women guests _
among them a receptionist, an office manager, a newspaper reporter,
several homemakers and a professional entertainer _ range from 24
to 40-plus. Some are single, but most are married moms; all of them
cheer when Williams purrs the evening's theme: ``This is all about
you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right!'' says Shellie Holt, 25, who explains that she's
here to find ``some fun new things to spice up my marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a semicircle, the women ooh and ah, giggle and crack
jokes as Williams rolls out her product line. Tammy Freeman, 27, a
professional singer, holds a sensual aid that lights up. ``I feel a
song coming on,'' she deadpans. ``Yooooouuuu light up my life!''
</P>
<P>
   The group roars.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes for the next 20 minutes: Williams describes a
piece of merchandise, answers questions about it and moves on to
the next item on her list.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's time to buy.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure privacy, the women take turns meeting alone with
Williams in a bedroom, which the saleswoman calls ``the shopping
room.'' Each emerges with an identical brown shopping bag. ``This
way no one knows what anyone else has purchased,'' Williams
explains.
</P>
<P>
   As they wait their turn with Williams, the women chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is great,'' says first-timer Lori Cleveland, 29.
``There's no men, no children, and Karen makes it fun. My husband
wanted me to come. He said as I was walking out the door, `Do you
have enough money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, this is soooo much better than going into one of
those, you know, shops,'' says Tammy Freeman. ``Once I went into
one of those shops in Seattle and I didn't look at anything. It was
so intimidating. But with this, you can feel the items, ask
questions about them. I think this is important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so, judging by the success of Surprise Parties and
companies like it.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 10 years ago in Mount Juliet, Tenn., by Sue and Joe
Rhea, Surprise Parties has quickly grown to more than 500 reps in
18 states. There are 78 saleswomen in Georgia alone.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many women attend home parties each year. To
get some idea, however, consider that one ambitious rep, Williams,
works seven parties a week, traversing metro Atlanta, she says,
``from Alpharetta to Fayetteville.'' Between 10 to 15 women attend
each party. That's about 4,500 women a year.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also pull in customers. Passion Parties, another
Tennessee-based company, sells ``a complete line of edible lotions
and oils, lingerie and bedroom toys designed for monogamous
relationships, safer sex, keeping your man interested, interesting
and coming home early,'' owner C.J. Haynes says.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes says she personally attends five home parties a week,
each averaging 10 to 15 women. That's 3,300 women a year who
purchase sensual aids directly from her. She also supervises 175
reps, including two in Georgia, who, in turn, average five parties
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Home-party sales account for a significant portion of the
sensual-products market. ``I know it's put a big dent in the retail
side of the industry,'' says Angel Welker of Jelique Products, a
Washington state company that makes lotions and lubricants. ``As
for the companies that manufacture toys, I know Surprise Parties is
their No. 1 customer. It's my No. 1 customer, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are women so eager to attend these home parties?
</P>
<P>
   Surprise Parties Vice President Donna Wettrig says: ``Women
really want to spice up their marriages. Plus, we're not barefoot
and pregnant anymore. We're coming out of the kitchen. We have
husbands, careers, children. It's our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond raking in revenue from product sales, the company says it
provides good-paying jobs for women like Williams. The path to
becoming a rep, Wettrig says, is just like applying for any other
job. The job applicant goes through an interviewing process and, if
accepted, takes a sales course. Finally, the recruit buys enough
merchandise to see her through the first month or so of parties.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who quit as a Domino's Pizza manager to become a
Surprise Parties sales rep four years ago, says she made $52,000
her first year and will earn close to $70,000 this year. ``With
Surprise Parties I make three times as much as I did ... working a
third of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's a slacker. ``I work hard,'' she says. ``I do a
party each weeknight and two on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't come close to the 50 hours a week I used to
work. Even more important, I get to stay home during the day with
my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says that at almost every party she does, at least one
woman asks her about her job and how she, too, can break into the
business.
</P>
<P>
   This Thursday night is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's host, Pennington, 53, decided to have the party after
attending one at a friend's house. Now she is mulling a career
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am thinking about doing it,'' she smiles. ``It's an
intriguing way to make a living, isn't it?

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY No 409 - November 4, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY -- No. 409 -- Nov. 4, 1998 We are offering
the following articles for sale. Please contact us for availability
your country. Best regards, Karl Horwitz
</P>
<P>
   1. EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW : ALANIS MORISSETTE Alanis Morissette's
new album ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' has just been
released. (This is the long-awaited follow-up to her phenomenal
1995 ``Jagged Little Pill'' album. Many in the media and the music
industry continue to swap notions of why the album sold some 28
million copies worldwide, despite the absence of even a proper
promotional campaign.) This interview makes it plain that the
24-year-old Canadian singer's future began well before she cut a
note of the new album. As veteran singer/songwriter Annie Lennox
remarked, ``She's stunning - really creative and intensely gifted.
She looks like she won't let this industry ruin her.'' By Timothy
White. Billboard. 6,000 words. (Not available in Belgium.) 2.
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW : BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN The new four-CD set ``Bruce
Springsteen : Tracks,'' offers listeners a road map to the artist's
musical journey, via an alternative route. Bruce Springsteen says
the upbeat nature of many of the tracks on his new album ``made me
think it's fun to make some noise again.'' The idea was not, as he
says, to ``put out the seventh or eighth outtake from ``Born in the
USA'' or ``Thunder Road,'' but to deliver to his fans companions to
the music they already knew so well. By Melinda Newman. Billboard.
3,200 words. 3. DIANE'S WILD RIDE After five decades of high drama,
Diane von Furstenberg tells all - almost - in a new memoir,
``Diane: A Signature Life.'' The book is full of the ingredients
that make for best sellers, although usually of the fictional
variety : a mother who survived Auschwitz; an early love affair
with a female school friend; a wedding to a prince (while three
months pregnant); an ambition that built a business empire, watched
it crumble and set out to build it again. And, finally, a bout with
cancer. Interview by Julie L. Belcove. From W Magazine. 1,500 words
+ photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
THE SAME BRANDY - IN THREE DIFFERENT BOTTLES Brandy Norwood is a
one-girl entertainment conglomerate. And she's still only 19.
Brandy talks about her new film, ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer,'' co-star Jennifer Love Hewitt, why it took her four years
to follow up her multi-platinum debut album ``Brandy,'' and why
she's having trouble finding a boyfriend. By Ian Spelling. 1,300
words + photo. 5. CATE BLANCHETT REIGNS IN 'ELIZABETH' Australia's
rising star Cate Blanchett is the buzz of Hollywood and a
front-runner for a 'best actress' Oscar for her stunning portrayal
as England's Queen Elizabeth I. Interview by Ivor Davis. 1,000
words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
BEBE NEUWITH'S LATEST BRUSH WITH GENIUS Bebe Neuwirth has two Emmy
Awards from ``Cheers'' and a Tony award each for ``Sweet Charity''
and ``Chicago,'' but all anyone wants to ask her about is a scene
in Woody Allen's new film, ``Celebrity,'' in which she uses a
banana to give Judy Davis a lesson in oral sex technique. Neuwirth
talks about the new film, her memories of ``Cheers,'' how she
enjoyed working with the idiosyncratic Allen and why she herself is
both comfortable and uncomfortable with her own fame. By Jeanne
Wolf and Shep Morgan. 1,400 words + b/w photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
THINGS LOOKING 'UP' FOR R.E.M. ``Up,'' R.E.M.'s album of new studio
material, is its first since the sudden retirement of drummer Bill
Berry. And it sends a signal : Something different is brewing here.
``What this record is,'' suggests singer Michael Stipe, ``is a band
mutating as quickly as possible, wanting to do better.'' By Jim
Sullivan. From The Boston Globe. 1,800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
NEIL DIAMOND GOES TO THE MOVIES As they say in the trade, Neil
Diamond could sing the phone book and still get a positive
reaction. He has completely switched gears on his romantic new
record, ``The Movie Album : As Time Goes By.'' It leaves Nashville
behind and probes the heart of Hollywood in a double CD of famous
movie songs, performed in the inimitable drawling Diamond fashion.
By Steve Morse. From The Boston Globe. 800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
DEPECHE MODE'S SONIC REVIVAL Synchronization is very important for
Dipjche Mode's live show '98. Visuals and staging are key
components for a band whose members tend to anchor themselves at
synthesizers. ``A visual aspect is quite important,'' says keyboard
player-guitarist-singer Martin Gore. ``I find it very bland to
watch bands proving that they can sound roughly like their
records.'' By Jim Sullivan. From The Boston Globe. 1,100 words.

   ORANGER, Haiti _ Born into obscene poverty, Ileus Viltine, a
dust-covered farmer who's never ventured far from his rough swath
of land, is determined not to die that way.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 67 years, this withered man's had no electricity.
No running water. The only roof over his head was one made of
coconut leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's had no real way to eke out an existence.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This diminutive peasant -- with no education, no special skills
-- now has something akin to winning the lottery, something to call
his very own.
</P>
<P>
   He has goats.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the frisky animals with floppy ears don't look
like much. But they've brought in money that's done more than build
a tin roof and send his children to school.
</P>
<P>
   It's given him a sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I didn't have anything, not even a roof to keep the
rain off of my family,'' said Viltine, smiling through a few teeth
and bad cataracts. ``Now I have something to feel good about,
something to do so I can help my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Viltine is just one of some 1,200 indigent farmers who have
received a pregnant Nubian-bred goat as part of the Haitian Goat
Project, sponsored by Global Health Action, an Atlanta-based
non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1985, the program includes farmer training, ongoing
education, immunizations, and veterinary care for the goats.
</P>
<P>
   It targets the poorest of the poor -- half of whom are women --
in a nation where per-capita income is barely $250 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so poor is education in Viltine's village that scarcely
anyone reads or writes, yet farmers easily recite the dates their
animals were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are excited because, in the past, their goats usually
died of diarrhea or other diseases,'' said Franck(CQ) Toussaint,
the program's coordinator in Haiti, where he trains about 12 new
farmers every month. ``But now the farmers are being taught how to
recognize various diseases and what to do about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred miles from the coast of Florida, Haiti has been
called the slum of the Western Hemisphere, a place where nearly
two-thirds of the land cannot be cultivated since it slopes at such
a steep angle.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action's project operates in a rocky, mountainous
region just west of Port-au-Prince, the capital, that's dotted by
obscure villages filled with badly thatched huts that are no bigger
than two-person tents.
</P>
<P>
   For years the goat was like an undiscovered Cinderella in these
parts: they were seen, but their true potential was never realized
-- that is until Global Health Action intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The organization works with Haitian farmers to cross-breed the
smaller Haitian goat the Nubian goat, which is a larger
milk-producing kind that's imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to improve the quality of Haitian goats by
integrating the mixed-breed kids into the herds here.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action's project is modeled on Heifer Project
International, the Little Rock, Ark.-based charity that donates
farm animals to families in 115 different Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   The goats are perfectly suited to Haiti's steep, rugged terrain
and tropical climate, and don't cause a lot of erosion with their
hoofs. In addition, they require less land, feed and water than
cows.
</P>
<P>
   And their meat -- called cabrit (pronounced ``Ka-breet'') -- is
more popular here than beef.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action collaborates with the School of Veterinary
Medicine at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge to provide
on-site care and training in Haiti -- generally twice a year -- so
that families can continue breeding their goats to generate a
continuous income, while at the same time using the milk and meat
for food.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after years of being mostly overlooked, the goats living
in this village perched high atop a mountain have taken on almost
mythical qualities.
</P>
<P>
   They are said to be hardy, agile, and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Their milk is so nutritious -- just two cups is enough to supply
a person with a day's worth of protein -- that goats have become a
key weapon in the fight against malnutrition, which affects half of
all children here under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to the farmers, the goats can be sold at
market for up to $50 each, depending on their size, enough money to
pay for books, clothing, and education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a Nubian-bred goat sells for more than twice the
price of a native Haitian goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandmother was sick, I sold a goat to help take care
of her,'' said Eliane Kouyou, 46, a gap-toothed woman with matted
dreadlocks who's not more than four feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now she's dead, and I am alone,'' she added, dragging an
uncooperative 75-pound goat behind her. ``The goats are all I have
to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouyou owns three goats that have had six kiddings. In the past
year or so, she's sold four goats for a total of about $120.
</P>
<P>
   Before the goat project, Kouyou's dreary village was a place
where bare subsistence and self-sufficiency went hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Here, finding drinking water's a daily dilemma. Almost everyone
wears ill-fitting, hand-me-down clothes. There's little word of
news from nearby Port-au-Prince, which seems a world away.
</P>
<P>
   But the faces of the villagers light up faster than a Christmas
tree on one recent weekday when a team that included Bruce Olcott,
associate professor of veterinary medicine at LSU, and three
veterinary students arrived by horseback.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken them close to two hours to make the trek up the
narrow, treacherous paths from the group's base of operations at an
Episcopal mission in the town of Darbonne, some 35 miles west of
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summit, of sorts, that attracted farmers, their
families, about 75 squealing goats, and dozens of giggling
children.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an isolated area not used to white faces, it was an
event of great color and drama, with women donned in their Sunday
best.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sweltering sun, the farmers waited patiently for hours
without pushing or shoving to have their goats checked over.
</P>
<P>
   Olcott and his students worked diligently, examining each of the
goat's fecal matter for the appearance of blood-sucking worms.
</P>
<P>
   They trimmed the goats' hoofs to prevent foot rot. They
sprinkled powder on the goats' coats to fight lice. They gave the
goats tetanus shots, plus two other injections to guard against
worms and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Through interpreters, the foreigners threw goat-related
questions in English at the farmers, who responded in Haitian
Creole.
</P>
<P>
   Making his sixth trip to Haiti, Olcott is clearly hooked on the
people and what can be accomplished through the program.
</P>
<P>
   He brings a select group of students each time he visits to hone
skills while exposing them to a Third World environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have nothing, and they are so thankful to have a
chance to make their lives better,'' said Olcott, who contracted
dengue fever and nearly fell down a mountain when his horse lost
its footing on earlier trips.
</P>
<P>
   One of those people is Rose Marie Elisse, who's sold her goats
to pay for two years of sewing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am learning how to make dresses,'' said Elisse, 25, with an
ear-to-ear grin. ``I hope to make that my profession.''

 &HT;    A NEW BREZHNEV OFFERS RUSSIA'S COMMUNISTS A NEW IMAGE
 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Nov. 7 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ He's being called a chip of the old block, the Soviet
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old grandson of the late Leonid Brezhnev, the
bear-like Soviet leader of the Cold War, recently formed his own
political party.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrei Brezhnev's All-Russian Communist Social and Political
Movement is a party his authoritarian grandfather, who ruled from
1964-82, would probably skip.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Brezhnev, a Russian businessman, dares to assert
that Russian communism should embrace concepts such as private
ownership of property and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In a country already crowded with dozens of major and minor
political parties, Brezhnev's initiative is a long shot. He is a
political neophyte and virtually unknown, despite his surname.
</P>
<P>
   But he underscores the predicament facing the present-day
Communist Party, led by Gennady Zyuganov, the parliamentary leader
who finished second to Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party endures as Russia's most popular political
movement -- supported by about one of every four Russians,
according to polls. Likewise, Zyuganov is among the country's
favorite politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the party is riven by internal disputes over ideology and
organization, and suffers an identity crisis as Russia struggles to
adapt to democracy and a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its membership ranges from devout Marxists to Western
European-style social democrats. In control of parliament, it has
blocked initiatives for the private ownership of farms and hindered
joint ventures between Russia and Western companies to drill for
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brezhnev's communism had the same character as Stalin's,'' the
younger Brezhnev explained in a recent interview with the Cox News
Service. ``It was totalitarian. It stayed the same while everything
around it changed. It should have adapted itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Communism in Russia today suffers a similar problem.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on its vast Soviet-era organization of political and
labor unions, the Communist Party can rally hundreds of protesters
onto the streets, as it did in a nationwide protest against Yeltsin
and his government's policies in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the nation's economy a wreck and Yeltsin ailing both
politically and physically, the Communist Party seems unable to
seize the initiative and offer Russians a clear alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Communist Party has failed to overhaul its image, said Sergei
Markov of the Institute for Political Studies. ``They keep making
political assaults on the government, but offer no real policy
other than dreams of yesterday's glories.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to exploit the Communist Party's popularity and
lack of initiative, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov -- a popular
nationalist who enthusiastically supported Yeltsin in 1996 and who
wants to replace him as president in 2000 -- has explored a
possible campaign alliance of reformers and Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Like the younger Brezhnev, Luzhkov has voiced a belief that he
can blaze a third path between the hard-line communism of Soviet
times and the gluttonous capitalism that over the past decade has
made relatively few Russians rich and many more poor.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a leading contender to replace Yeltsin when his term
expires in mid-2000, has advocated mending the welfare state, but
on the basis of a market economy -- a political middle ground
between ``total socialism and vulgar liberalism,'' he said in a
recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of communism rests primarily among pensioners and
laborers, who are nostalgic for the certainty of the Brezhnev era.
In contrast to the current economic throes, in those days Russians
knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time everybody knew what their job was, and where they
stood in the hierarchy,'' said the younger Brezhnev, who possesses
the same pug nose, bushy eyebrows and thick shock of hair as his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The return in recent weeks of several Communists to the
government of the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has stirred
fears that Russia could revert to Soviet-style economic and social
controls.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in late October by the Russian Public Opinion
Center found Russians virtually divided on what would result if
Communists returned to power. Thirty-nine percent said that if the
Communists came to full power in Russia they would implement a
hybrid of socialist policies while preserving private property and
without blocking post-Soviet market-oriented changes.
</P>
<P>
   But 36 percent said a Communist return would result in Russia
reverting back to pre-reform times by nationalizing banks and
industry, prohibiting private property and reinstating a command
economy. The remaining 25 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are afraid of the mere word,'' Brezhnev explained.
``Our task is to make communism more attractive to people.''

BLUNDER IN CALDOR CIRCULAR PROMPTS APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   After an embarrassing mistake, Caldor Corp. apologized Tuesday
for a toy advertising circular that included a photo of two young
boys and a Scrabble board that spelled out the word ``rape.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone connected with designing the circular may have played a
prank, and proofreaders failed to spot the error, which appeared in
11 million newspapers in the Northeast over the weekend, said
spokeswoman Jennifer Belodeau of Caldor, a discount department
store chain based in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we didn't catch it,'' she said. ``It was an
error. It's not something we'd ever do intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scrabble photo appeared on the 29th page of a 44-page
circular that was inserted in various newspapers, including 420,000
copies or more than half the run of The Boston Sunday Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The circular was produced for Caldor by an ad agency the chain
declined to identify. Both the agency and Caldor were responsible
for proofreading, Belodeau said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two nonsense words were spelled out on the Scrabble
board, and the word ``rape'' can be discerned only if the photo is
turned sideways and the Scrabble board is subjected to close
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the glitch was spotted by a reader and brought to
Caldor's attention Friday afternoon, Belodeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldor attempted to alert some of the 85 newspaper companies
running the ad, but by then it was too late, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Globe spokesman Richard Gulla said Caldor is ``a reputable
advertiser'' with a longstanding relationship with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Caldor circular would not have been rigorously
scrutinized when it was one of roughly three dozen such circulars
distributed with the Sunday Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to check every page,'' Gulla said.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder dismayed at least one Connecticut mother, according
to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just shocked that that was allowed to slip through the
cracks,'' Deirdre Armon said. ``I was horrified. To see it go out
in a flier, especially for toys, that made it even more gruesome.''

YOUNG CHEESE MAKERS RUN A CREAMERY RICH IN TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD CHATHAM, N.Y. _ Shaggy sheep are grazing in the autumn-brown
pastures and the air is ripe with the pungent aromas of manure and
composting leaves. The rustic red barn next to the sheep stalls, a
simple white sign with ``Creamery'' in black letters near the door,
is as plain and unpretentious as a bale of hay.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the creamery at the Old Chatham Sheepherding Co., though,
is a business that in many ways contrasts sharply with the pastoral
setting outside. A state-of-the-art computer office is the first
room you enter after donning a hair net and stepping through one of
the many foot baths, designed to remove contaminants from the soles
of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Two computers are always on, monitoring temperature levels in
each of the production rooms and in all 11 storage areas. The
computers also communicate with each other, and whenever any
function performs other than it should, they dial the pager cheese
maker Benoit Maillol (pronounced Ben-Wah May-Oh) keeps with him at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize we are very sophisticated and high-tech,'' said
Maillol, 26, who also operates a laptop that sits on the table
between the two computer systems. ``However, it's important to
understand the computers' function in what we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computers don't make our cheeses and yogurts. Everything
we do is made by hand. What the computers do is give us a better
tool to produce a better product.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no arguing Maillol's assessment. The $1 million
creamery in eastern New York is less than a year old, but it is
setting a new standard by which American cheeses are being judged.
</P>
<P>
   The peppered pyramid soft-ripened cheese won best of its class
at the World Cheese Competition in March, and at the American
Cheese Society Competition in August the fresh ricotta was awarded
first place, while the sheep's milk yogurt and fresh sheep's milk
cheese both won second-place awards.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Appetit magazine was so enamored by the Old Chatham
Sheepherding Co. cheeses that last month it named owners Tom and
Nancy Clark artisans of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jenkins, regarded as the guru of cheese in the United
States, is impressed by what Maillol and fellow cheese maker Alison
Appleby are turning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cheese is as good as anything I've tasted anywhere in
Europe,'' said Jenkins, author of the award-winning 1996 book
``Cheese Primer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elegant, very subtle cheese, certainly not an
in-your-face peasanty cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also an expensive, much-sought-after cheese. Wheels can
sell for more than $20 per pound, and every pyramid, button and
wheel being made is already sold. While the company declines to
provide sales figures, Maillol notes that demand far outweighs
their production capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Hudson Valley Camembert and Nancy's
Camembert, which are a mix of sheep's and cow's milk, all of the
cheeses and yogurts produced at Old Chatham are made from only
sheep's milk, utilizing the growing herd on the 500-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-ripened cheeses _ the Camembert, shepherd's wheel,
pyramids and mutton buttons _ take up to two weeks to cure and
ripen, during which time the mold casing forms and hardens on the
exterior. Every one of these cheeses is turned daily during the
aging process in order to properly distribute the moisture and
allow the mold to develop evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Maillol, a native of France who seems as at home in the creamery
as the sheep do in the fields, laughs when he is asked how his
American friends react to the mold on the soft-ripened cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends in this country, they are afraid of the
mold,'' he said. ``This is an education part for some Americans,
learning to eat all of the cheese. Some friends I have made here,
if they can't see the cheese, they won't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the French are renowned for their cheese-making, and
Maillol in fact was raised on a farm with a goat-milk creamery, the
brown-eyed bundle of energy was essentially a cheese-making
illiterate when he arrived in the United States five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work for the Clarks to work in the fields. This was
going to be a rest stop during a two-year journey around the world
for Maillol, an opportunity to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization that set up my internship here told me I was
coming to work on a goat farm, which is what I knew best from home.
Then I found sheep,'' Maillol remembered. ``They made a mistake.
Pretty quickly I got more and more interested in sheep and
cheese-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a boy I would never go in my parents' creamery. I wanted to
drive the tractors and work around animals. I was an outdoor
person. I guess growing up and getting smarter changed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maillol, who had never operated a computer prior to coming to
the United States, has taught himself the intricacies of the
Internet and computer programming to such a level that he was able
to custom-design the creamery's computer system with the assistance
of a Baltimore firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is so cutting edge that the New York Agriculture and Markets
Department is considering using it as a pilot program, and Maillol
is urging the Clarks to patent the system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jenkins, the cheese expert, is no fan of state-of-the-art
technology for cheese-making _ even though he adores the Old
Chatham cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's not sticking their elbow in the vat to determine
the right temperature, it doesn't bode well for the cheese. That
modernity is kind of a negative when it comes to cheese-making,''
Jenkins said. ``The best cheeses are made by people with nothing
more than rakes and hay and vats of raw milk.''
</P>
<P>
   What amazes Maillol is how far they have come in such a short
time. He and Appleby, 27, are the only two at the creamery with
more than six months' experience. None of the other seven employees
has been involved in cheese-making more than six months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Old Chatham is being recognized as one of the top
cheese-making operations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me very proud. Getting the awards was amazing. I
would never have expected it,'' Maillol said. ``The irony is, we
were sure the Camembert would be the big winner for us _ and we
didn't get anything with it.''

   A company called Gisser Automotive Concepts is gradually rolling
out a vehicle named the Mec4. It's a ``super car,'' designed to
cause covetous drooling and whiplash (from fast-turning heads) as
you drive past other wealthy motorheads.
</P>
<P>
   Based loosely on the Corvette, but hand-built with its own
bodywork and special components, the Mec4 will reach 60 mph in four
seconds _ as fast as any street-legal car you can buy. Gisser
executives boast their beast also will be friendly enough for daily
driving, unlike cars by Lamborghini, which recently were the
subject of a class-action lawsuit because owners kept getting
locked inside their $220,000 cars when it rained.
</P>
<P>
   The Mec4 is cheaper than the competition, too, starting at about
$100,000. Visit Gisser's Web site, http://www.gisser.com, or call
914-583-5383 for information.

   MORE GUY STUFF: In a Texas-centric catalog called Streets of
Salado, for those with actual or spiritual links to the Lone Star
state, we find a product that's a bit macho for our tastes but
perhaps not for others.
</P>
<P>
   It's a toothpick holder, a little pouch, complete with fold-over
lid, made of heavy, distressed leather. (It looks like a saddle or
a beat-up leather jacket.) The catalog text wonders, ```Gotta
toothpick?' Tired of him always asking? Give him a place to carry
his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea of a toothpick holder seems a little, well,
fastidious and fussy to us _ qualities in contrast to the toughness
of the leather. A guy with a leather holder like this one wouldn't
need one, really: He'd be the type to hew a new 'pick from a tree,
no?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, call 888-663-9131 to request a catalog or order a $6
toothpick holder.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEXISM ALERT: An ad for the Counterspy Shop reads, ``Over 300
high-tech products for the man who has everything and wants to keep
it.'`
</P>
<P>
   Captions beneath the various gizmos _ video recorders the size
of dimes, briefcases that emit powerful electrical charges if
stolen, telephones that purport to tell you when the person on the
other end of the line is lying _ all suggest only men would use
them: ``He's watching employees ...'' and ``Night vision allows him
to see in the dark ...'' and ``The Truthphone tells him who not to
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   What, no women have business secrets worth stealing? Or is it
that fewer women are paranoid enough to spend scads of money on
such products? Call 800-685-6374 to request a catalog.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Norah Pauley never knows when the next seizure
will strike.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be shopping one moment and, minutes later, she'll wake up
on the floor with people huddled around her.
</P>
<P>
   Or her face might tremble, and she'll be unable to speak. Some
mornings, she wakes outside in her night gown, with no memory of
leaving her home in the upstate New York city of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Pauley, 47, suffers from epilepsy, an unpredictable electrical
disorder of the brain characterized by recurring seizures, from
slight tremors to severe convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2.5 million Americans have the condition. This
year, an estimated 150,000 new cases of epilepsy will be diagnosed
and between 22,000 to 42,000 people will die of the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent victims was world-record sprinter Florence Griffith
Joyner, who asphyxiated at her California home on Sept. 21 after
suffering an epileptic seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Pauley tries not to think of that possibility, but some days are
harder than others. August was an especially difficult month. She
counted 100 seizures, more than her usual 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know I'm having one until someone says, `Are you
all right?''' she said. ``It gets to you after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with epilepsy more than 15 years ago, Pauley is
cautiously optimistic that a new electrical device will reduce the
frequency and severity of her seizures where medicines have failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, she is scheduled to undergo a two-hour operation at
Albany Medical Center Hospital to implant a vagus nerve stimulator,
described by its manufacturer _ Cyberonics Inc. of Houston _ as a
``pacemaker for the brain.'' About the size of a half-dollar, it's
similar to technology being used by surgeons today to control other
neurological conditions, like Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Ritaccio, an associate professor of neurology and
neurosurgery at Albany Medical College, believes it's a significant
breakthrough for about 30 percent of all people with epilepsy for
whom drugs don't work or have dangerous side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a major technological advance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, more than 1,000 such operations have been performed
during a decade of clinical trials and, more recently, since the
Food and Drug Administration approved the $10,000 device last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clearly understood why the stimulator works. But
studies have shown that it can reduce or halt seizures from 50
percent to 100 percent in people, like Pauley, who don't respond to
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe that vagus nerve stimulation alters or
modulates blood flow in areas of the brain where seizures are known
to start or spread.
</P>
<P>
   Pauley has no idea why she had her first seizure in the early
1980s while shopping for Christmas presents. Today, after trying
various medicines that haven't worked, she'll take any relief she
can get.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, she's broken her leg, chipped her teeth and
become unconscious from her numerous falls.
</P>
<P>
   She's been unable to keep a job, and relies on friends and
family to help her cook and clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't shower alone, I don't use a pool, I don't use the
stairs,'' she said. ``If I know I'm going to have a bad day, I wear
a bicycle helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauley isn't apprehensive about the operation.
</P>
<P>
   A surgeon will make a small incision in the left side of her
neck to expose the vagus nerve, about the diameter of a guitar
string. That nerve is a major conduit of sensory information from
the body and runs from the brain through the face and neck to the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon will then wrap a pair of wire leads, spiraled like a
phone cord, around the nerve. The ends of the wire will be tunneled
underneath Pauley's skin behind the clavicle and connected to a
stimulator, implanted beneath the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Using a computer, a neurologist will program the stimulator to
send off regular electrical bursts to the vagus nerve, usually for
30 seconds every five minutes, depending on the patient's epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, up to 18 months, those regular bursts of electricity
to the vagus nerve have been shown to diminish the frequency of
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Pauley is more anxious about the months after the operation,
when she'll have to wait to see how she responds. There's a chance,
however, that the device may not work or may only have a minimal
effect on her seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth the gamble,'' she said. ``By this time next May,
hopefully I'll be seizure-free.''

SCHUMER BECOMES A PARTY BOSS AS WELL AS SENATOR-IN-WAITING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now it's Senator Putzhead, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   From the moments the polls closed Tuesday night, the Empire
Ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel here was jammed with Rep.
Charles E. Schumer's gleeful supporters. The crowd spilled out into
the hotel lobby and into Park Avenue, thousands of them _ all
grins, chuckles and back slaps. The exit polls showed that Schumer
had beaten Sen. Alfonse D'Amato by taking four out of five Jewish
votes, nine out of 10 black votes and a hefty majority of women.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been a nasty campaign. D'Amato has always had to
fight that way. Cursed with a surly, owlish expression and a flat,
grating, nasal voice, he could never count on the good looks of a
Bill Clinton or the statesmanlike bearing of a Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to carry him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, D'Amato won each of his three terms in the Senate
through sheer hustle and matchless guile. He overcame what
pollsters call ``high negatives'' by working relentlessly to
convince voters that, OK, you might not like me very much, but you
should dislike the other guy more, and here's why. In this tight
race, he might have gotten a little carried away when he referred
to Schumer as ``a putzhead'' and then denied it. The tasteless
Yiddish insult was less a problem than the lie, which worked only
to confirm the thrust of Schumer's campaign sales pitch _ namely,
that voters couldn't believe or trust their senator.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 long years, New York's Democratic Party has worked
mightily to paint D'Amato as a shameless political opportunist who
was unworthy of representing the Empire State to the nation. And
while the Democrats hit on that theme unrelentingly, D'Amato always
found some way to clean their clock every time he ran. Along the
way, he rebuilt a state Republican Party that had collapsed into
wreckage with the departure of Nelson Rockefeller from the
governor's mansion. As the party's de facto boss, D'Amato installed
shrewd, canny Bill Powers as state GOP chairman. He ousted state
Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino and replaced him with a more
dependable ally, Joe Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   And, most significantly, he selected an obscure state senator
named George Pataki to run for governor four years ago and then
craftily engineered Pataki's defeat of the ferocious incumbent,
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the pupil succeeded where the teacher failed.
While D'Amato went down to defeat, Pataki won a huge victory over
New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   With D'Amato out of power, Pataki is now New York's unchallenged
Republican boss. But it remains to be seen if he has the
inclination or interest to run the state party as tightly as
D'Amato did. After Cuomo's downfall, Moynihan _ New York's senior
senator _ failed to step into that role for the Democrats. Moynihan
had bigger fish to fry, and Pataki might arrive at the same
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, his aides were talking about Pataki
for president in 2000. Schumer, however, is a different matter
entirely. Like D'Amato, the senator-elect is a devoted believer in
party organization and discipline. Assembly Speaker Shelly Silver
has been the party's most powerful politician since Cuomo's fall,
and the Democrats have not prospered under his leadership. As
senator, Schumer essentially takes over that leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer campaigned on the premise that he and D'Amato were
vastly different men. But, when it comes to the gritty, often
brutal mechanics of party management, Schumer could turn out to be
Alfonse D'Amato in drag.

ARIZONA PUTS WOMEN IN 5 TOP OFFICES  
 (ADV: THIS UPDATES COLUMN MOVED TUESDAY WITH NAPOLITANO VICTORY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVEN WILLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Arizona made history Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not just state history. But national history.
</P>
<P>
   It elected five women to the five top state offices. This has
never happened anywhere in the country before.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the lineup: Gov. Jane Hull will begin her first term in
January as the state's elected chief executive. Ditto for Secretary
of State Betsey Bayless in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Napolitano eked out a victory to become the first Democrat
elected to the state's top law enforcement office since Bruce
Babbitt in 1976. State Sen. Carol Springer won the treasurer post
outright in the September primary. And Lisa Graham Keegan glided to
a second term last night as state school superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the order of succession per the Arizona Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, there were two other statewide offices on the
ballot - corporation commissioner, which is one-third of a
three-member panel, and mine inspector. They will continue to be
held by men.)
</P>
<P>
   This is truly phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   No state in the nation has five women holding any statewide
elective office, let alone (begin ital) the top five (end ital)
state offices, according to the Institute for Women's Policy
Research in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Five states look close, but really aren't, with four women
serving in statewide elected positions. These states are Delaware,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Washington. But here's the
kicker - none of them has a woman governor.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. There haven't been that many - a grand total of
15, to be exact, according to the Center for the American Woman in
Politics at Rutgers University. (Only 10 of them elected in their
own right.) Right now, there are three - New Jersey's Republican
Christie Todd Whitman, New Hampshire's Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and
Arizona's Republican Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no state has ever elected women to even its top two
positions at the same time, let alone top five, according to the
National Governor's Association.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Enter Arizona's Hull and Bayless.
</P>
<P>
   So while 1992 was heralded nationally as the Year of the Woman
(a bit prematurely, I might add, since many of the gains women made
that year have since been erased), 1998 is clearly the Year of the
Woman in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean to the daily lives of Arizonans?
</P>
<P>
   Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   I confess it's exciting to see the reins of state government
placed so firmly in the hands of women. ``It's about time,` I find
myself thinking. ``Now we'll show them how it's done!`
</P>
<P>
   But such chortling, really, is premature. It also can be
foolish. The fact is, women are vulnerable to the same weaknesses
of character as men. Men have no monopoly on ego. The corruptive
intoxication of power knows no gender. Such human frailties can
extinguish a woman's promise as surely as a man's.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting all in Arizona to suddenly go right because of the Y
chomosome count in its leadership lineup is about as realistic as
expecting the Mideast peace agreement to produce a permanent truce.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I have high hopes for these women - as, I suspect, do
many other men and women in this state. We have a right to such
high hopes. This is a pretty impressive bunch of people. Each is
smart, well-motivated, energetic and principled. Several have
advanced degrees. Each has worked very hard to get where she is
today.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a string of cookie-cutter look-alikes, either. Far
from it. Ideologically the span is wide between Libertarian-leaning
Republican Springer and former Democratic Party activist Janet
Napolitano. Agewise, they bridge two generations with Hull leading
the way at 63 and Keegan bringing up the rear at 39. And while
Bayless had a comfortable upbringing in Phoenix, Springer married
at 18, had her first child at 19 and found herself divorced and
raising five children alone shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   These women, as a collective, are just plain different from
their predecessors. And let's face it: Based on the conduct of some
of those predecessors - an ex-governor felon comes immediately to
mind - this alone makes them cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, these women all actually speak to one another.
That's a novel concept among Arizona elected officials (begin ital)
of the same party, (end ital) let alone different parties.
</P>
<P>
   So forgive me a little glee as we enter a new era of political
leadership in Arizona. As Golda Meir noted at one point in her long
life: ``Whether women are better than men, I cannot say. But I can
say they are certainly no worse.`

SAY, WHOSE BASEBALL BOYCOTT IS IT, ANYWAY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These baseball boycotters can get surly. Like the reader from
Belton, Mo., who was annoyed by my recent column that praised Joe
Torre, the classy manager of the world champion New York Yankees,
and also complimented the entire Yankee organization for its
on-and-off-the-field deportment during the 1998 post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is using your name to write a bunch of hogwash in a
story appearing Sunday, Oct. 25, in the Kansas City Star,'' wrote
Jack M. Lindberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes no talent to laud the Yankees. Yes, Joe Torre is a
nice guy. So?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wishy-washy, wimpy and milquetoast.
</P>
<P>
   ```I modified my boycott this year ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sure a powerful stand. A politician couldn't do better
_ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I modified my goal of making one million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should ever assume, but I assume you began your boycott
of baseball after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was treading on thin ice, as far as I am concerned,
before the 1994 season. No World Series in 1994 clinched it. I
haven't seen a game _ TV or at Kauffman Stadium _ since. The film
clips on the morning TV news and the headlines in the morning paper
are more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boycott (abstain from) is a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will consider ending my boycott when Shoeless Joe Jackson
and Pete Rose are elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. And that's
far from a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosh. Where do you suppose a fan of the Kansas City Royals finds
the wherewithal to be smug, self-righteous and condescending?
</P>
<P>
   But that's OK. A fan has to do what a fan has to do.
</P>
<P>
   This fan _ ex-fan? _ was right about one thing: It is not a good
idea to assume. Unlike this guy, who apparently followed the crowd
out the door after the 1994 players' strike, I began boycotting
baseball back in 1990 in reaction to an earlier ``labor dispute''
that disrupted spring training for 32 days.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase the great Barbara Mandrell, I was boycotting when
boycotting wasn't cool.
</P>
<P>
   If some nouveau boycotter from the Show-Me State wants to
belittle my nine years of sacrifice toward the noble goal of
teaching baseball a lesson, he certainly has a right to do so. I've
endured cheaper shots _ although I don't recall that anyone has
ever compared me to a politician before.
</P>
<P>
   That hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks, I'm perfectly aware that my decision to resume
watching baseball on television last season was an admission that I
had failed in my long-standing effort to ignore the national
pastime. I knew I'd be criticized by hard-core baseball boycotters.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't regret my decision. I enjoyed what I saw of the Mark
McGwire-Sammy Sosa assault on the single-season home-run record. I
enjoyed what I saw of the playoffs and the too-short, four-game
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad that I ``modified'' my boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is, I did not set foot in a major-league
ballpark in 1998. I did not buy a single ticket to a game. I did
not contribute to the oversized bankrolls of players and team
owners by buying licensed products such as caps, mugs, T-shirts,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some sort of punishment
on the person or institution you are boycotting. The eight years I
spent before the '98 season trying to pretend that baseball didn't
exist inflicted more punishment on me than it did on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And this season? Baseball did not increase its profits by one
nickel as a result of my decision to watch an occasional game on
television. If watching made me wishy-washy, I'll just have to live
with the shame.
</P>
<P>
   I will not apologize for ``modifying'' my boycott. It's my
boycott; I can do anything I want to with it.
</P>
<P>
   And I won't apologize for praising Joe Torre and the Yankees.
One of the reasons I started boycotting in the first place was
because so many of the people involved with major-league baseball
are just plain jerks who routinely dishonor the game and insult its
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and his 1998 Yankees made me proud to be a baseball fan _
boycott or no boycott.

THE BIBLE'S BLUEPRINT FOR URBAN CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the Rev. Eldin Villafane, Pentecostal minister, Hispanic
scholar and Harvard University lecturer, what his favorite book is
about urban concerns, an issue Villafane has spent a lifetime
working on, and he'll answer: Phillippians.
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprising answer given that he's referring to the New
Testament book chronicling Paul's letter to the church of Philippi,
the first church the apostle founded in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Paul exhorts the nascent Christian community not only to be
faithful to God, but to spread the ``good news'' of Jesus by
bringing hope and comfort to those in need.
</P>
<P>
   The short book, Villafane asserted as he readied for his class
last Wednesday, is a powerful blueprint for what an urban church
should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has to incarnate itself in the city, particularly
in those places that are hurting the most,'' said Villafane,
talking at lunch in the cafeteria at the Harvard Divinity School,
where he is spending the fall semester teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many city churches are already coming to the rescue
across urban America.
</P>
<P>
   In neighborhoods struggling with poverty, unemployment and
family breakdown, churches are evolving into crucial social,
economic and political anchors.
</P>
<P>
   African-American congregations, Roman Catholic parishes and some
mainline Protestant churches in urban communities nationwide are
straining their budgets to come to the aid of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The clergy not only have to be intimately familiar with
Christian scripture, but also have some savvy about the delivery of
social services, the creation of affordable housing and the
development of job-training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good strong urban ministry is holistic,'' says Villafane,
whose Wednesday afternoon class at Harvard is called, ``Seek the
Peace of the City: Theology and Ethics for Urban Ministry.'' ``It's
not enough to be a spiritual hothouse. That's not being faithful to
the Gospel message. You have to also be concerned about the
systemic oppression of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Villafane has been observing the shifting roles of city
congregations from his perch as a professor specializing in urban
theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Puerto Rico who was raised in New York, Villafane
also founded the Center for Urban Ministerial Education at
Gordon-Conwell, which prepares about 300 students annually to serve
urban churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have students walk out of seminaries with a solid
theology to work in cities,'' said Villafane, president of the
national Association for Hispanic Theological Education. ``We need
sharp and creative thinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the well-known proverb, `If you give a man a fish, you
feed him for a day; if you teach him to fish, you feed him for a
lifetime' to articulate the emerging and intensely challenging role
expected of city congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Providing social services, a food pantry, thrift shop, is like
giving someone a fish and is something many churches already do.
Many churches also teach people how to fish through tutoring,
mentoring and other such programs, a role Villafane refers to as
social education.
</P>
<P>
   But it is two other vital functions _ social development, or
helping people build fishing rods, and social justice, helping them
get a piece of a lake to fish in _ that many churches are still
warming up to. ``Within many black and Latino churches, people are
trying to focus on social development, meaning economic
development, but it's happening slowly,'' Villafane said.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent lecture in Cambridge, Mass., Villafane described how
the surging growth of Latinos in America is giving birth to city
churches in converted storefronts, converted synagogues and
traditional church buildings that have lost their white congregants
to the suburbs. These churches are examples of the new kind of
urban church, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There one finds a simple but powerful proclamation of the
gospel of Jesus Christ,'' Villafane told the audience at Harvard.
``There one finds a gathering of God's church, providing a
community of freedom, dignity, self-worth, comfort, strength, hope,
joy _ abundant life.''
</P>

THE VOTERS OF '98: STIRRED, NOT SHAKEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not an earthquake, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Nor a tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   But as a wakeup call to right-wingers everywhere, Election '98
was on the loud side.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a Congress that off its slightly reduced
conservative strength, after a massive conservative investment,
appears to have lost the political if not the moral authority to
impeach President Clinton; it never had the numbers in the Senate
to kick him out of office based on the current case to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   But however narrowly divided the House of Representatives turns
out to be after what can only be interpreted as a left hook to Newt
Gingrich's glass jaw, this is also a Congress that may not appear
capable of doing anything else, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country that faces numerous, complex, and vexing
problems (Social Security and health care being only two) that may
be even tougher to solve with inventive compromises if Congress
becomes even more closely divided.
</P>
<P>
   For instructive example, the country really should turn at long
last to its governors, whose ranks are once again swollen by
precisely the kinds of people Congress lacks in sufficient numbers.
</P>
<P>
   From Republican Paul Cellucci in Massachusetts to surprise
Democratic winner Tom Vilsack in Iowa; from the GOP's Bush brothers
in Texas and Florida to New Democrats like Roy Barnes in Georgia,
Don Siegleman in Alabama, and Tom Hodges in South Carolina, the
lessons ought to be obvious: Go to work; get things done, even if
not ideally; give ground to gain ground; don't race-bait; don't
gay-bash; and leave the right to choose alone. Republicans have
shown they can be as inventive and persistent as President Clinton
in governance in the pragmatic '90s, and they are being rewarded
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Congress. For the defeat of Al D'Amato in New York
and Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina and they crowning of Gray
Davis in California, the Democrats get bragging rights, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton gets the medal for Campaigner of the Season.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no question that the Bush brothers and several
ideological cousins get the Republican stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is when the gridlock gurus in the Congress
are going to get the message. To say that Newt Gingrich and Senate
majority leader Trent Lott had one lousy campaign season this year
is an immense understatement, but to say that either or both will
learn from their colossal goofs is pure fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, however, overinterpret the results last night at
their peril, Clinton included. This was no wild and crazy
electorate that went to the polls. For example:
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bayh, the former governor of Indiana, tore through the
Indianapolis suburbs like a twister last night en route to his
landslide victory for the Senate seat last Democratically occupied
by his father 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But right through the same suburbs and towns that form the
state's 6th Congressional District came chronic Clinton pursuer Dan
Burton, running for reelection against a Democrat charged with
impersonating women over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, something like 25,000 solid Indiana citizens voted
for Democrat Bayh and Republican Burton, not knowing or caring of
the contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff happens whenever Americans vote, but this election
was an unusually good one for dichotomies as well as irony.
</P>
<P>
   Another illustration of the country's split personality to go
with its divided politics is provided by so-called exit polling of
voters at polling places by a large media consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to cite the most important things on their mind, 19
percent brought up education (a solid Democratic winner all year),
and 19 percent brought up moral values (just as solid a Republican
winner all year).
</P>
<P>
   An electorate that is dividing this cleanly and sharply is not
in much of a position to provide clear guidance to the senators and
congressmen who have to go back to ``work'' _ for the next two
months in the House on the impeachment inquiry the public hates and
for the next two years in both branches on perhaps a few matters of
actual significance, such as Social Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   This was an electorate that is no fan of Washington's favorite
sport. Most people in the exit polls _ fully two-thirds, in fact _
agreed that the eternal Lewinsky investigation has hurt President
Clinton's ability to govern the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting slightly more anti-Clinton sentiment than is
generally found in surveys of the public as a whole, two-thirds of
the respondents opposed impeachment of the president. Nearly half
favored censure of him; 40 percent said he should quit.
</P>
<P>
   The message, in short, continues to be that the country wants no
part of this, but it will, of course, go forward anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This was not, however, an angry electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 percent of the voters said their own financial situation
had worsened in the past year; nearly half said it was improved,
and almost as many said it was roughly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Even more notably, more than 80 percent of the respondents
described economic conditions as good or excellent; that figure is
about double what it was four years ago when the Gingrich
earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether either party can take enough out of
this result to form some kind of basis for governance that can
improve on the pathetic record of 1997.

TO TIBET AND BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: ``Sis'' is spelled with an accent over the i.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Sis' ``Tibet: Through the Red Box'' may well be the most
visually arresting book to be published in the United States this
year. Without question, it's the most authoritatively endorsed.
``The Dalai Lama has blessed the book,'' Sis (pronounced CEASE)
confides with deadpan merriment, ``so it's all official.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was a study in escalating implausibility. It took
place in a Tibetan monastery in (of all places) Switzerland. When
Sis, 49, presented the book last June, it was wrapped in a prayer
scarf the Dalai Lama had given his father, Vladimir Sis, a Czech
filmmaker, four decades before, in Lhasa. And the one with the
media savvy turned out to be the holy man from the Himalayas, not
the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was actually much more aware of publicity than I was,''
marvels Sis. ``He was constantly pointing, `Stand here.' I was so
confused that I was standing with my back to the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   How Sis came to be in a position to meet the Dalai Lama may be
the most implausible element of all _ except that it's his father's
story, not his.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted into the Czech army in 1950, Vladimir Sis was sent to
China to teach filmmaking. ``I'll be home in four months for
Christmas,'' he told his family. He was home for Christmas _ except
it was the following Christmas, 14 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of teaching, Vladimir was ordered to record the Chinese
invasion of Tibet. He spent six months lost in the Himalayas after
being cut off by an avalanche. Along the way, he met the young
Dalai Lama and survived countless adventures.Peter Sis' book
relates Vladimir's experiences through the eyes of the boy who
heard the oft-repeated tales of his father's adventures: ``stories
about a country named Tibet, which I thought he'd made up.''
</P>
<P>
   The way each Sis came to meet with the Dalai Lama is at once
strange and enchanting. That is as it should be, for Peter Sis is a
man on intimate terms with both strangeness and enchantment. He has
gone from being a rock 'n' roll DJ in Soviet-occupied Prague to
making a music video for Bob Dylan in Los Angeles to becoming one
of America's most sought-after graphic artists.
</P>
<P>
   His work runs the gamut from a mural at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport to the poster for the film ``Amadeus'' to
stage sets for the Joffrey Ballet. New York's Museum of Modern Art
has several of his film shorts in its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Sis' affinity for things odd and beguiling is most evident in
the books for children he has produced over the past 15 years.
Combining a delicate, magically detailed beauty with a faint air of
melancholy, such picture books as ``Follow the Dream'' (1991), ``A
Small Tall Tale from the Far, Far North'' (1992), and ``Starry
Messenger'' (1996) have earned him a devoted following.
</P>
<P>
   Sis' work is ``like no one else's,'' says Roger Sutton, editor
of The Horn Book magazine, marked by ``a sense of mystery that is
in almost everything he does.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something almost medieval about his books, in both their
otherworldliness and rich density of detail. His best work may have
more in common with illuminated manuscripts than with contemporary
children's books. Few other writers, for any age group, have made
the sheer pastness of the past seem so palpable _ or managed to
turn the labyrinth of memory into a stage for such grave waltzes or
ecstatic cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   Sis' favorite subject is the pain and promise of discovery. The
discoverer may be famous (Christopher Columbus in ``Follow the
Dream,'' Galileo in ``Starry Messenger'') ormay be Sis himself
(visiting the Prague of his boyhood in ``The Three Golden Keys,''
1994). The discoverer may even be another species (``An Ocean
World,'' 1992) or an inanimate object (``Beach Ball,'' 1990). ``I
see all these books are leading to the same thing,'' he says,
``someone unhappy heading to a new country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter has helped raise the children's book, as few others
have, into a cross-generational genre,'' says Steven Heller, art
director of The New York Times Book Review, where Sis has published
nearly 1,000 illustrations. ``The paradox is he's done this really
beautiful, arcane work that hasn't elevated him to the same stature
as the mass-market heroes like Chris Van Allsburg and Maurice
Sendak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tibet book may change that. For one thing, it's being
marketed as a book for adults. One problem that has dogged Sis is
the way his work defeats categorizing. ``It's complicated,
sophisticated stuff,'' says The Horn Book's Sutton, ``and you're
just not going to have a huge children's audience for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sis' new book would also seem well timed to ride the wave of
Tibet chic, joining the likes of Richard Gere, Martin Scorsese, and
Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mortality, not marketing, inspired ``Tibet: Through the
Red Box.'' For years, Vladimir Sis had forbidden his family to look
at the small wooden chest _ the red box of the title _ in which
he'd kept his Tibetan diaries, for fear of retribution from
Communist authorities. When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer
four years ago, he wrote his son, ``The Red Box is now yours.''
(Fortunately, the cancer proved treatable and Vladimir, 73, was
able to join Peter at his meeting with the Dalai Lama.)
</P>
<P>
   It was during his father's absence that Sis first demonstrated
an artistic bent. ``I painted the apartment _ tables, chairs, light
switches, everything,'' he recalls. ``I thought if I could make the
home beautiful, he wouldn't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Sis suffered from curvature of the spine. ``I was
often in the hospital and I so appreciated the books I would read.
I can remember vividly all those books and pictures where I could
be looking for hours at some detail.''
</P>
<P>
   A forthright, energetic man, Sis is an animated talker who
unjustly maligns his lightly accented English. His command of the
language proved crucial in his late teens and early 20s. He became
a music journalist and rock DJ, making frequent trips to London to
interview performers and returning to play all the latest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tape recorder, and the interview would run on the
radio in Prague. It was stupid, though, because no one understood
English, so whenever they'd talk, someone would do a voiceover in
Czech. I talked to everybody. Led Zeppelin. Ten Years After. Free.
Joe Cocker. The Beach Boys _ they were the nicest people. Two
Beatles: George Harrison, Ringo Starr.'' He sighs. ``I wish I had
interviewed John Lennon.'' Rock 'n' roll provided ``spiritual
color,'' Sis says, in a society that ``was always dark and
imposing.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers how he and his father would see Vaclav Havel, then
a dissident playwright, now the Czech president, on Sunday walks
and would say hello. ``Everybody knew everybody. It was a small
country. I admired him very much for being so determined that he
went to prison. We were all against the regime but nobody did very
much. ... I was in police headquarters many times, but it was more
about `What music did you play?' or `What did you say?' So maybe,
in a way, I was in the underground. But it was not that I was
throwing hand grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   Sis poured his rebelliousness into art, doing posters,
illustrating a handful of children's books, and making animated
films. The films won awards during the '70s, which brought the
Czech ministry of culture artistic prestige and much-needed foreign
currency, so Sis was allowed to study at the Royal College of Art
in London and do some work abroad. The last such assignment was in
Los Angeles, in 1982, and Sis decided not to return to Prague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to be in California,'' he laughs. ``It was just so
different. It was a little bit like fulfilling that dream of rock
'n' roll _ there's the Sunset Strip! That's where Jimi Hendrix
played! _ And I knew the names of all the streets from (Raymond)
Chandler books.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he worked with Dylan on the music video of ``GottaServe
Somebody'' and taught art. A mutual friend sent some of Sis' work
to Maurice Sendak. ``He called me from Connecticut and said, `What
are you doing in the most plastic state in America!''' With the
money he made for doing the ``Amadeus'' poster, Sis moved to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   He found it hard going. ``There were three or four years when I
wasn't able to pay my rent exactly on the date, and I was wondering
if I'm going to survive. Am I drifting back to Europe and Prague?''
To keep the Old World at bay, he developed a furious work ethic
that would have won the approval of his old Czech Communist
masters. Sis' talent and diligence made him a favorite of art
designers, and his work began to appear in the Times, Esquire,
Newsweek, Time, and The Atlantic Monthly, among other publications.
Somehow, he found the time to marry and have two children.
</P>
<P>
   Sis illustrated his first US children's book in 1983. ``Some of
the early ones were very bad,'' he says, rolling his eyes. ``Thank
God `Jed and the Space Bandits' finally went out of print.'' He
would be given a text, and his job would be to provide the images.
His financial situation didn't allow for much selectivity. That
began to change with ``Rainbow Rhino'' (1987), the first book for
which he created both text and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, if I had it my way, there would be no text.
It would be self-explanatory. Now I understand more and more that
not everyone knows what I know. So you need a few words to explain;
sometimes you need even longer explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I always sort of shrug when somebody says, `Oh, you're
an author.' There's a little quote from Nabokov at the end of the
Tibet book _ now that's a writer, not me. I would say I'm putting
together a sort of assemblage. I would think my language is more in
the pictures than in the text. ... If I have very detailed picture,
like in `Starry Messenger' or like in `Three Golden Keys,' I can
use just two lines and it somehow works together in harmony. I
don't have to go the other way around.''

CAVALLI IS DELIGHTED TO BE THE ONE AND ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Cavalli, CEO and co-founder of the American Basketball
League, can talk all he wants about increased revenue and higher
attendance as the league enters its third season. But it's no
secret what he's really gloating about _ the ABL is the only
professional baketball game in town right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we seem to have caught a break here with the NBA
lockout,'' he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ABL and NBA go head to head during the winter, with the NBA
scoring a slam dunk by being televised on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But not now. Not with the NBA and its players having on-and-off
negotiations and possibly no games until January, if then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to exploit what we have in front of us, to
remind people that while the NBA isn't playing, there is still an
opportunity to come out and sample,'' Cavalli said. ``And maybe
they'll like it better than the men's game. We don't have players
on strike ... or players choking coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The other thorn in the side of the ABL has been the WNBA, the
other women's professional league. Even though WNBA games are
played during the summer, it has the luxury of being affiliated
with the NBA and its marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ABL is starting to get established as part of the
American sports scene,'' Cavalli said. ``We have the highest level
of women's basketball in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with two teams dropping out of the already small ABL
(Atlanta and Long Beach), Cavalli acknowledged that the road has
had it bumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's basketball is still a start-up and is going to have
some missteps,'' he said. ``It has been difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He's banking on the two replacement teams _ Chicago and
Nashville _ and increased TV coverage to grab fan attention.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he's hoping to capitalize on the lack of NBA action.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you'll see big newspaper ads by the ABL this week
that say, ``Looking for pro hoops? We're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli said the league already has heard from friends in the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we provoked them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't sound too upset.

THE GENES OF A LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Election-day winners, those who answered the
call of public service, now have a list of things to do: choose a
staff, find an office, and deposit a sample of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   This chore is necessary if their careers attain the eminence of
Thomas Jefferson, in which case their DNA will fall like acid rain
upon Mount Rushmore. Cough up those chromosomes, Ms. or Mr. Future
Leader. Inquiring minds want to know.
</P>
<P>
   A retired pathologist, Eugene Foster, has examined Jefferson's
DNA, along with British and Dutch geneticists. They conclude that
the nation's third president, the author of the Declaration of
Independence, fathered at least one child of Sally Hemings, a slave
at Monticello, Jefferson's Virginia plantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very, very likely,'' Foster said of this
centuries-old paternity suit, detailed in Nature magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's now-confirmed descendants have cause to celebrate,
but who else is happy about this new political trend? Yes, science
must be served, but not if self-righteous critics judge Jefferson
to be their inferior, not if they make Monticello just another
media stakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Science now fortifies debunking, the revisionist history that
flourished in the 1920s. But the last person to voice dismay would
be TJ himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a truth existing which I fear, or would wish
unknown to the whole world,'' he wrote to Henry Lee on May 15,
1826, months before his death. Jefferson would not have feared
deoxyribo-nucleic acid, the exploration of which won James Dewey
Watson a share of the Nobel Prize. (After Watson's triumph in 1962,
I interviewed him as he sketched a double helix. I never expected
DNA to become a double hex of gossip and science.)
</P>
<P>
   From the high moral ground of 1998, the question arises: Was
Jefferson a hypocrite? Probably. He opposed slavery in theory, but
not in practice. But when he discussed slavery, he wrote, ``I
tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that His
justice cannot sleep forever.''
</P>
<P>
   H.L. Mencken, a leading debunker who was later debunked himself,
abandoned revisionism in 1926 when he wrote of a letter from
Jefferson to John Adams that ``spoke of the time when both came
into fame as `the heroic age.' The phrase was certainly not mere
rhetoric. ... In one thing they were exactly alike; they were men
of complete integrity. ... One could not buy them, and they would
not lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times, the Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson
welcomes Jefferson to the African-American family. Suggesting that
the news will help blur rigid racial lines, he cites a liberating
truth: ``No society has ever solved its ethnic problems without
intermarriage, and America will be no exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Jefferson becomes more human, the DNA story also
confirms a vengeful attack by a blackmailer, James Callender, in
the Richmond Recorder in 1801: ``It is well known that the man,
whom it delighteth the people to honor, keeps and for many years
has kept, as his concubine, one of his slaves. Her name is Sally.''
</P>
<P>
   Callender's aim was to assault honor, but his target never
reacted publicly because of his hard-won philosophy. ``It is
afflicting that a man who has passed his life in serving the
public,'' Jefferson wrote in 1786 to James Currie, ``should yet be
liable to have his peace of mind so much disturbed by an individual
who shall think proper to arraign him in a newspaper. It is,
however, an evil for which there is no remedy, Our liberty depends
on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without
being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An evil for which there is no remedy'' is not a trumpet call
fans of the First Amendment prefer. But Jefferson was a realist. As
he wrote in the same letter, ``To the sacrifice of time, labor,
fortune, a public servant must count upon adding that of peace of
mind and even reputation. And all of this is preferable to European
bondage.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ There's life in the Eck yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Eckersley is making no promises, but after filing for
free agency Tuesday, the 44-year-old Red Sox reliever said he plans
to work out this winter with the idea of returning for the 1999
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they want me to come back,'' said Eckersley, asserting
that both general manager Dan Duquette and pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan have told him they'd like him to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play anywhere else. It's either here or
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Filing for free agency was merely a procedural move for
Eckersley, who was paid $1.5 million by the Red Sox last season.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley said he intends to install a Cybex machine in his
Sudbury home so he can strengthen the right shoulder he injured
last season, one in which he set a major league rec-ord for career
appearances (1,071) but bore little resemblance to the dominant
closer who won Cy Young and MVP awards for the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, signed last winter by the Red Sox with the idea that
he would share the closer's job with Tom Gordon, instead recorded
just one save in 50 appearances, going 4-1 with a 4.76 ERA. He was
on the disabled list for seven weeks (June 1 to July 23), then
ended the season by giving up home runs in his last three
appearances at Fenway Park, including one to Cleveland's Manny
Ramirez in Game 3 of the American League Division Series that
turned out to be the deciding run in the Indians' 4-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   His subpar performance did nothing, however, to deter fans from
greeting him with long and loud ovations at every appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who had not suffered shoulder problems in nearly a
decade, said he would like to see how his shoulder responds to his
offseason workout program before he calls it quits. He sounded like
a man who, if healthy, plans to be in Fort Myers, Fla., when
pitchers and catchers report around Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get in shape and be ready to pitch,'' he said.
``Be as good as good can be. Go for it, what the hell. I've had
time to think about it for the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley did some work for ESPN Radio during the World Series,
and he'd consider broadcasting as his next career. But Tuesday he
sounded like a man who wants to come back for a 25th big league
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have that competitive edge,'' said Eckersley, who is
three wins short of 200 and 10 saves short of 400, numbers that are
virtually certain to land him in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Also filing for free agency Tuesday was Darren Lewis, who played
a splendid center field for the Red Sox last season but could be
swept aside if the team lands free agent Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was a bargain for $500,000 last season, one in which he
did not make an error in 104 starts in center. He established
career highs in numerous offensive categories _ average, hits,
runs, doubles, home runs, and RBIs _ though his average in the
second half (.245) was .045 lower than it was before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   He also stole 29 bases, the second-highest total by a Sox player
in the last 20 seasons, and allowed Jimy Williams the option of
moving Nomar Garciaparra from the leadoff spot. Defensively, his
sliding catches became his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   The club held a contract option for Lewis to return next season
for $1.1 million, but because he played in more than 100 games, he
had the contractual right to decline the option and file for free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams said when the season ended that he wanted Lewis
back, but the Red Sox have already shown an interest in Bernie
Williams, one of the top prizes in the free agent auction.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Red Sox plan to announce the hiring of Ken Macha's
replacement as manager at Triple A Pawtucket. Gary Jones, whose
Edmonton teams won back-to-back titles in the Pacific Coast League
in 1996 and '97, will become the highest-ranking African-American
manager the Red Sox have ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who turns 38 next Wednesday, was a Cubs farmhand who
managed for eight years in the A's system, winning three titles,
before joining Art Howe's staff as first base coach in Oakland this
past season. Macha is leaving the PawSox to join Howe as bench
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Another staff member who may be hitting the road is Dick Pole,
Boston's bullpen coach, who has already interviewed for the
pitching coach job with Kansas City and will do likewise in Anaheim
in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox did announce promotions and additions to their
scouting staff. Kevin Burrell has been promoted to cross-checker
and Ernie Jacobs to full-time scout. Also, Matt Haas and Ed Roebuck
were hired as scouts, Ben Cherington rejoined the organization in
that capacity, and current scout Steve McAllister has shifted
territories. The Sox also thanked New England scout Buzz Bowers,
who recently retired from full-time duties to become a consultant.
Ray Fagnant will take over Bowers's territory.

BELOVED TEACHER WORKS TO GIVE STUDENTS A CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE -- In 1972, I knew Gloria Erkins as Miss Bolden. She
was 25, an English teacher at Marshall High School, and the faculty
adviser to our Afro-American club. At a time when there were less
than 10 African-American seniors, Miss Bolden, one of the few black
teachers in the school, was our godmother.
</P>
<P>
   When our club held a Christmas toy drive, we sorted the gifts
well into the evening in Miss Bolden's apartment. On those gloomy,
ever-colder evenings around the winter solstice, her living room
was a cocoon. We wrapped them to the bass guitar and high-pitched
violins of ``Shaft,'' with Isaac Hayes singing, ``He's a
complicated man, but no one understands him but his woman.''
</P>
<P>
   We were black kids negotiating a complicated school, and no
teacher understood us like Miss Bolden. She was the one who
directed me to a federally funded urban writing workshop that led
to newspaper reporting. ``The toy drive was so students understood
that you don't only take, you give,'' Erkins recalled the other
day. ``The club was for cultural awareness, so you could get to
know each other and find out who you were as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   While Milwaukee is an epicenter of state-funded vouchers for
private schools, Erkins exemplifies why public schools must remain
our top priority. Now 52 and a 31-year teaching veteran, Erkins is
the principal of Vincent High School.
</P>
<P>
   Her office has not diminished her intimacy. She will stay three
hours after the final bell to hear a boy complain about a
girlfriend. Students come up to her to get a hug. Some bragged
about their academic accomplishments. One 6-foot-7-inch student
came to her office looking for a bandage for his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want a Band-Aid, he wants attention,'' Erkins said.
``He's so tall, students are always looking up to him. It created a
loneliness about him. We put his locker between two tall basketball
players, so he could talk to people eye to eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be selective,'' Erkins said, ``Private schools, they
can pick and choose students who will make them look good. They
don't have to take students with special needs. We do. Some people
say choice is the answer. What they don't realize is that many of
us are working to give kids a choice within public schools because
we have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Erkins talked about satellite programs that take previously
disinterested or disruptive students and keep them educated and
doing community service. She has an agribusiness program that has
set students on the path to careers in natural resources management
and landscaping. She talked about how Vincent is open seven days a
week to be a safe haven of extracurricular activities. She
estimates that 400-500 of her 1,850 students participate in things
like sports, debate, Scrabble, drama, and a gospel choir.
</P>
<P>
   She is the first to say it is not easy. After all, she has no
control of the baggage students bring to school from their
families. At Vincent and the city's high schools in general, the
grade-point average even for students who attend school at least 90
percent of the time is between a C-plus and B-minus.
</P>
<P>
   But just as she got us to care about children at Christmas at
Marshall, she beamed about how Vincent's basketball players,
winners of an unprecedented three straight state championships, are
humble enough to mentor children in biddy basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe every child can learn,'' Erkins said. ``Contrary to
what people may think, we have high expectations of our children.
We have teachers who spend a lot of their own money to make sure
students have the proper resources. If we could get support around
that instead of being bashed, or building prisons, it would be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of how it would be different is fittingly back at
Marshall. One of Erkins's students nearly 30 years ago, John
Holmes, is now a national award-winning communications teacher
there.
</P>
<P>
   Through aggressive grant proposing, he has amassed state-of-art
television editing equipment. The work of his students is so
professional that CNN has designated Marshall as one of 15 high
school bureaus. Marshall students Sharonda Hunter, John Tillman,
and Andrew Hodges have been offered internships by CNN News Group
chairman Tom Johnson. Johnson was impressed by watching Hunter
break away from a pack of journalists to interview CNN founder Ted
Turner and Education Secretary Richard Riley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our teacher says it's all about connections and working hard,
and now we know,'' said Tillman, 17. ``When you're in the press
room of a Braves game and everyone around you is 30 and 40 and
you're only 16, it makes you feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually want to run an airline,'' said Hodges, ``and this
class has shown me how you have to understand every person, every
ego in the process. It takes 16 people to produce a video, and
everyone has to be happy. I figure, if I'm doing this at 17, think
of what I'll be doing at 35.''
</P>
<P>
   What Erkins was to me, Holmes is to Hunter, Tillman, and Hodges.
It is a Milwaukee few people hear about amidst the noise to use
vouchers to flee public schools. Erkins and Holmes have given
public students a choice. They have the choice to dream that if
they can fly high at 17, the sky's the limit at 35.

NEW MONEY, OLD PAPA; ALLY OOPS; STARS ON STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Money is just about as controversial as the New Coke,
which left America in a major fizz and the Coca-Cola Company in
public disgrace back in 1985. Nobody is very enthusiastic about the
twenties, fifties, and hundreds now winding their way through the
country's cash registers, ATMs, wallets, and, alas, washing
machines. Not that anyone is ready to refuse a personal influx of
this sleek breed of bills, but as enforced public art, the New
Money is getting the Old Thumbs Down.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; The New Yorker  &LR; for Nov. 9, Adam Gopnik takes an astute and
wonderfully wry look at our changed currency. He praises the
``period feeling'' of the Old Money, with its post-Civil War aura,
its classic lettering, its innocent national pride. ``Is there a
sweeter American image than that single motorcar chuffingalong
outside the Treasury Building on the back of the old ten?'' he
writes. ``It has stayed there right up through the era of the Santa
Monica freeway and drive-by killings, still asking the same forlorn
question: Will the horseless carriage ever catch on?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he notes, by exaggerating and simplifying elements of
the Old Money, the New Money seems to be making a satiric comment
on it. In this way, the New Money is a kind of ``metamoney,'' with
an ``X-Files'' aspect that reveals hidden secrets when held up to
the light. Its design says something about our era: ``In its
combination of overkill and emptiness, the New Money evokes the new
midtown hotels, with their black-and-white `Deco' marble lobbies,
wedged into tiny lots, and then the cold sealed rooms immediately
above _ the luxury falling off as soon as you've checked in.''
</P>
<P>
   In a piece called ``Last Words,'' Joan Didion cast some doubt on
the decision to publish the unfinished Ernest Hemingway ``African
novel'' in July 1999, as part of the centennial celebration of the
author's birth. Given the title ``True at First Light,'' the
manuscript is said to have been Hemingway's project from 1954 to
his suicide in 1961. It will be cut in half from approximately 850
pages by Hemingway's son Patrick. ``You care about the punctuation
or you don't, and Hemingway did,'' she writes. ``You care about the
`ands' and the `buts' or you don't, and Hemingway did. You think
something is in shape to be published or you don't, and Hemingway
didn't.'' She also quotes one of his letters to an author who was
writing about him: ``I know few things worse than for another
writer to collect a fellow writer's journalism which his fellow
writer has elected not to preserve because it is worthless and
publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what to make of the Calista Flockhart anorexia
question. Last season the ``Ally McBeal'' star was thin; this
season she's a stick with lips. Her jaw line appears to have crept
rather dangerously up to her ears, and her cheekbones are flat as
empty plates. If Flockhart is not anorexic, then she may need some
intensive dietary instruction. But if she is anorexic, then let's
hope her ``people'' are intervening, and not submitting to her
self-denial in the manner of a rock-star entourage. After the
tragedy of Karen Carpenter, no one should be able to pretend this
problem away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; People &LR;  magazine's exclusive with Flockhart is unsatisfying.
Naturally, the actress does not admit to having an eating disorder,
but can she actually have gone into a major interview without
educating herself on the relevant terms? ``I guess I don't know the
exact definition of anorexia,'' she says. ``But I eat. I eat
normally. I eat whatever I want, whenever I want. I don't have a
messed-up relationship with food.'' She then caps her vagueness
with a statement dodgy enough to rival those of the president: ``Am
I anorexic? I guess my answer would have to be no.'' Look closely
at that last sentence and go cross-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Flockhart's indirect denials, the article
includes suggestive details meant to raise your eyebrow _ about her
menu choice during the interview (a bowl of tomato bisque) and the
description of her arms as ``bony'' and ``skinny.'' They don't help
to clarity the situation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rolling Stone &LR;  for Nov. 12 works up its old political dander to
condemn Kenneth Starr and the inquisition of President Clinton,
with a strongly worded editorial by Jann Wenner. To underscore the
point, the magazine collects comments from a bunch of rock and
movie celebrities, including obvious big mouths like Eddie Vedder,
Bono, and Lou Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The many observations end up sounding like repetitive cant,
except for a few light spots, one or two unusual points, and some
unexpected venom. David Byrne has no fond feelings for Clinton: ``I
think he's a lousy president, I think he's scum,'' he says, though
not in reference to the small-potatoes Lewinsky business. Melissa
Etheridge feels sympathetic: ``I lied the first few years of my own
sexual behavior, so I know what it's like.'' Patti Smith has a
cultural interpretation: ``When I look at the crucifixion of
Clinton, I look at the crucifixion of my generation. They are
finally nailing us for introducing new ideas about sexual mores,
sexual freedom, personal freedom.'' And Shirley Manson of Garbage
has a literary perspective: ``It's beautifully Shakespearean.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's Norm Macdonald who takes the mature approach: ``People
criticize the way the media are covering this whole story, but I
like it because it's dirty sex every day _ it's really got me
reading the paper again.''

   Beginning the week of Dec. 6, 1998, the Boston Globe will begin
moving two new columns, by staff writers Adrian Walker and Brian
McGrory. They will join Pulitzer-winning columnist Eileen McNamara
in The Globe's Metro section.
</P>
<P>
   Because these are Metro columnists, their subject matter on some
days may be too local to be of interest outside the immediate
Boston area. Budgets will indicate when their columns will not move
for this reason.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule:
</P>
<P>
   -- Eileen McNamara's Sunday column will move on Monday; her
Wednesday column will move Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Brian McGrory's Tuesday and Friday columns will move Tuesday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Adrian Walker's Thursday column will move Thursday; his
Saturday column will move Friday Evening, for immediate release.

ANATOMY OF A HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET 
Written, produced, and directed by: Theodore Bogosian 
On: PBS 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What, you may wonder, is NBC's Friday night crime drama
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' doing on PBS in the middle of the
week? ``Anatomy of a Homicide: Life on the Street,'' is a two-hour
program that debuted Wednesday at 9 p.m. on PBS that includes a
complete, commercial-free episode of the much-celebrated network
series. If this all sounds mildly confusing, it is.
</P>
<P>
   But the behind-the-scenes documentary _ a salute from PBS to
hard-won quality on commerical TV _ is more than mildly rewarding.
Despite its imperfections, ``Anatomy'' is both an interesting case
study of a fine, imperiled series and a lively evocation of the
mechanics behind the magic of television entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Boston filmmaker Theodore Bogosian tells his story by focusing
on the creation of what turned out to be a harrowing and deservedly
prize-winning ``Homicide'' episode produced and aired last year
called ``Subway.'' ``Anatomy's'' strong suit is the parallel it
achieves between its own high-tension account of making the
``Homicide'' episode and the edgy style that distinguishes the
Baltimore cop stories.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the office, on the set and literally on the street
creating ``Homicide'' is a dizzying, hurry-up affair. Among other
things, there is no rehearsal time. ``Subway'' guest star Vincent
D'Onofrio, playing a man squashed between train and platform who
will die as soon as the car ceases to compress him, takes the
grisly role only days before shooting begins. ```Homicide,''' he
observes, is ``fueled by velocity,'' and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian's documentary stresses the near-chaos involved in
making episodic television _ sweating script deadlines,
streamlining the story, hiring actors, grappling with Baltimore
officials over city locations, negotiating with network censors,
pushing a Hollywood feature-film director to hustle to TV's faster
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Exacerbating this apparently normal madness is a death threat:
If ``Homicide'' can't pick up its precariously low ratings, can't
beat its time-slot competitor ``Nash Bridges,'' NBC's entertainment
president Warren Littlefield says it could get the axe.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Anatomy'' is that it's not content simply to
capture the literal and figurative rush of creating good TV.
Portentous narration delivered with ``Victory at Sea''
melodramatics pictures a monster battle between ``commerce'' and
``art.'' This silly inflation has the reverse effect of its
intention, comically trivializing the obviously real differences
between the creators of ``Homicide'' and NBC brass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is revealing and fun TV about making quality
television. There are snappy portraits of the show's creative
staff, notably writer and supervising producer James Yoshimura.
Then there is the disturbing and very good episode of ``Homicide''
itself, scripted by Yoshimura and prominently featuring crackerjack
actor and former ``Homicide'' regular, Andre Braugher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide,'' of course, survived the 1997 season, but just
barely, as you will learn. But after six full seasons, it no longer
has Braugher and some of the other members of its original,
defining ensemble, and is losing its luster. In ``Anatomy,'' you
can see how some of the exceptional episodes got that way.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Late one afternoon, as on most days,
traffic has come to a standstill along the main thoroughfare
leading north from the port of Buenos Aires. The sun shines off the
wide Parana River to the east, as well as reflecting from the solid
ribbon of vehicles stretching for miles in both directions. Trucks
make up a surprisingly large portion of the volume. A gasoline
tanker is trailed by a semi-trailer hauling a shipping container;
nondescript trucks of all shapes and sizes, some of them at least
30 years old, with bubble-shaped hoods and wooden bays, have been
pressed into service to carry the goods of a booming economy.
Traffic stalls for long periods; when the wait becomes unbearable,
a single horn triggers a cacophony of protest. This is the sound of
Mercosur.
 &HT;    These are heady times in Argentina, once the poster child of
economic chaos and financial volatility. The country's economy is
bursting at the seams _ expanding as fast as any in the world _ and
not even crisis in Asia seems able to stem growth. Strict monetary
policy is paying off in terms of low inflation and a flood of
direct foreign investment. This newfound stability has served to
elevate the country among its neighbors, the members of the
Mercosur customs union, in such a way that Argentina is quickly
consolidating a financial and industrial base to take advantage of
its natural resources and serve not just its own 35 million
inhabitants, but the 200-plus million citizens of the continent's
most advanced free-trade region.
 &HT;    Last year, the economy grew 8.6 percent and so far this year has
replicated those rates, though the government expects GDP gains by
year end to total 6 percent. Much of this growth has been fueled by
direct investment, which last year hit US$10.5 billion, triple the
average annual rate for the 1990s. The government predicts that
over the next five years, foreign direct investment will reach an
average $13.5 billion per year, most of it concentrated in
infrastructure, manufacturing, agriculture and the extraction of
natural resources. The flow of incoming capital goods, which
account for half of all imports, is so strong that the government
blames foreign investment, along with cooling prices for the
country's main commodities exports, for the growing current account
deficit.
 &HT;    Unlike most of the region, Argentina sports a well-defined
middle class and buying power per consumer is two to three times
greater than across the border in Brazil. Combined with the
country's lush farmland, increasing agricultural productivity and
industrial potential, the economy provides a solid local base.
Still, the real gains from operating here come from the growing
links between the economies of the Southern Cone. ``If you are
building supermarkets, well, that's Argentina,'' says Felix
Zumelzu, director of the Argentine-U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``If
you are talking about building plants, you have to think on a
Mercosur basis. Any sector that has strong Mercosur potential is
going to do well.''
 &HT;    With that Mercosur mantra in mind, multinationals have been the
first to take advantage of falling borders to trade. From
automakers to food producers, transnational corporations are
consolidating their operations and expanding business opportunities
along an axis defined by Argentina and Brazil. The biggest market
is Brazil, but as long as doubts remain regarding that country's
stability, Argentina is seen as the safe haven from which to seek
opportunity. And large Argentine companies are proving that they
can compete, too. ``Argentina forms part of a platform,'' says Luis
Pagani, the general manager of Arcor, a local sweets company and
the world's largest producer of hard candies. ``Brazil has a very
large attractive market and, as the economy goes up, millions more
become consumers. We consider it part of our domestic market.''
 &HT;    Stable currency. President Carlos Menem's monetary policy, known
as convertibility, is generally credited with putting the country
in its envious position. Covertibility, the plan implemented by
former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, pegs the Argentine peso to
the U.S. dollar. Menem has also been credited with privatizing much
of the federal government's productive assets, such as railways and
ports, as well as maintaining fiscal discipline. His policies
passed their stiffest test earlier this year as financial shocks
spread from the crash of economies in Southeast Asia.
 &HT;    Similar turbulence from Mexico's devaluation in 1994 shook
Argentina to the roots and imperiled the ability of the
government's currency board to peg the value of the peso to that of
the U.S. dollar. A run on bank deposits forced some institutions to
close down and worsened the effect of that panic. But the silver
lining was a wave of mergers that reduced the number of banks from
200 to about 140, today. Foreign banks snapped up distressed
institutions, and their deep pockets _ along with a stiffer
regulatory environment _ have served the country well this time
around.
 &HT;    Bank deposits have risen 15 percent this year, a clear sign of
confidence after they fell by a similar percentage following the
``tequila'' crisis in 1995. And unlike Brazil, Argentina has not
been forced to fend off speculative attacks on its currency, even
though some charge that the one-to-one exchange rate with the
dollar leaves the local currency overvalued. ``Banks are stronger
because of the backing of foreign institutions and the new
accounting laws,'' says Marcela Cristini, senior economic analyst
at Fiel, an Argentine think tank. ``The economic scene is very
stable now.''
 &HT;    The turnaround has not come without cost. The banking sector
continues its grinding phase of mergers and acquisitions, and other
industries are set to follow the same course. The government has
seen fit to suspend $1 billion in planned public spending this year
to adjust for Asia's effects. The work force has also suffered,
with approximately one of seven adults now unemployed or
underemployed. Many of those lacking jobs are former public-sector
workers and economists say that this structural shift may leave
them permanently along the waside unless they upgrade skills.
 &HT;    But even this has not stemmed enthusiasm for Argentina's
economic course.
 &HT;    Ironically, Menem is widely despised after eight years in
office. His approval ratings hover in the low teens and when he
announced that he would not attempt to run for reelection, the
national sigh of relief was nearly audible. But Menem's policies
are not in question. Pundits note that the presidential campaign
for elections in 2000 is already underway, calling this the longest
political season ever. But few in the business sector seem worried
that the monetary and fiscal policies of the Menem administration
are in danger of being dumped. In fact, business leaders were more
afraid of the potential damage caused by Menem's bid to change the
constitution so that he could run again rather than of an unknown
candidate winning the election. Some say this speaks volumes about
the maturity of the political system: ``We have a currency,
stability, a budget. These are things we didn't have before,'' says
Felix Pena, the Economy Ministry's undersecretary of foreign
commerce. ``We have very clear rules of the game. I can do much
fewer things than my predecessor could do just a few years ago.
There are mechanisms in place that don't allow me to misbehave,
even if I wanted to.''
 &HT;    This is the sort of talk investors like to hear. Foreigners are
beefing up operations across the board, while Argentine companies
have awakened to the fact that they must slim down and, in many
cases, seek partners, to make sure they will be relevant in the
Mercosur economy. ``Argentines are hungry for alliances. They know
they must be able to compete with Brazil,'' says Yves Moyen of U.S.
management consultant AT Kearney. ``Each industry has its own pace
to consolidation. Banks and automotive are already done, but
others, like food and beverages, are wide open.'' Local partners
are especially eager for outsiders, adds Cesar Deymonnaz, country
manager for ABN Ambro, the Dutch bank. ``Argentines are very proud
of their business and they wouldn't merge among themselves. For
this reason, a lot of banks went under in the Tequila Crisis and
the same thing happened in other sectors. Many have been bought out
by multinationals.''
 &HT;    Productivity gains have been made as a result. The cost of
electricity under the privatized regime is 60 percent cheaper.
Private operators of rail and port facilities have also cut costs,
by over half in the case of the latter. ``There's a productivity
shock going, with gains of 30 percent this decade,'' says Hector
Oswaldo, an advisor to the Economy Ministry. ``What we are seeing
is a restructuring of domestic companies. What happened in banking
is going on across the board. It's like we're living in another
country.''
 &HT;    Chemicals and energy. U.S. chemical firm Monsanto's recent
acquisition of local drug company Chemotecnica is an example of how
locals in key sectors are seeking the muscle of multinational
players. Dow Chemical, another U.S. company, has also entered a
joint venture on a $1.3 billion investment and earlier this year
France's Total SA put out bids for a proposed $70 million plant
that would extract gas and liquids as well as process
petrochemicals south of Buenos Aires. Indeed, the region around the
Bahia Blanca port has become a major petrochemical center and the
sector is considered among the fastest growing.
 &HT;    Agricultural chemicals are in hot demand both locally and in
Brazil, a part of the trend in developing agribusiness and opening
new lands to farming in both countries. Argentina is a veritable
cornucopia of produce, rich in all the basic staples: rice, wheat,
milk, soy; the list goes on. Argentine farmers are major players in
world markets for commodities like wheat and soy. Now farmers are
arming a marketing campaign for the country's famous grass-fed beef
to rival what neighboring Chile has done for wine. According to
Cresud, one of the country's largest agricultural property
concerns, large tracts of quality farm land are still available at
low prices, on average less than $6,000 per hectare, compared with
over $20,000 per hectare in Europe and New Zealand.
 &HT;    Lower land prices do reflect risk: the farther out of main urban
centers, the more difficult the business climate, due to
conflicting interpretation of legal statutes _ and corruption.
Miners working the Argentine Andes have run into problems with the
Catamarca regional government, which insists on charging royalties
that the federal government does not claim. Such a payment
structure lowers margins to the point that mining companies are
losing interest in the region, especially while world mineral
prices stay low. The ambiguous legal situation hinders both
agriculture and extractive industries. Indeed, corruption is often
cited as a major issue for companies doing business here. But
economist Cristini dismisses the issue: ``Investors understand that
judicial stability is not ideal. This does not stop them from
investing, which tells you something about their margins of
profit.''
 &HT;    In fact, no one is pulling out, at least not yet, due to such
fears. Rosario, the country's northern port on the Parana River,
has been revived as players like Cargill and Bunge invest to create
their own port facilities to move grain. But the government must do
more to secure agricultural growth, says Carlo Lovatelli of
Brazilian commodities dealer Bunge International. ``The legal
issues of land ownership are a problem. And Argentina has not
invested enough on infrastructure in agricultural areas. That needs
to rise.''
 &HT;    Downstream, food and beverage industry sources expect $5 billion
in investment as food processing rises to meet minimum requirements
for supermarkets and restaurants. ``Everything is heading the way
of American- and European-style supermarkets,'' says Arcor's
Pagani, whose company is investing in packaging plants. ``They [the
consumers] are becoming more and more demanding in the way products
are packaged.''
 &HT;    Consumer habits are moving toward concentrated retail
purchasing, and away from specialty shops and markets. Economies of
scale are speeding the rise of modern retail food outlets, with
convenience becoming a major factor in buying patterns, says
Francisco Sanchez Loaeza, CEO of Mexico-based Panamco, the largest
soft drink bottler in Latin America. ``People say Argentines won't
eat corn flakes for breakfast, just bread and butter. I challenge
that: The opportunity here is for companies that can drive change
in consumer habits.''
 &HT;    The automotive sector, long a bellwether of Argentina's _ and
Mercosur's _ fortunes, continues to crank. Despite the lack of
resolution of tax issues between Mercosur nations, major automakers
continue to invest. Germany's Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota
recently announced plant additions, adding to more than $2 billion
in upgrades already under way by U.S. automakers Chrysler, Ford and
General Motors. Volkswagen plans to sell 70 percent of new
production in Brazil; Toyota will destine half of its pickups for
other Mercosur markets, mostly to Brazil. But Brazil's sliding
currency has made vehicles and parts produced in Argentina
marginally more expensive. Such a trend is indicative of
Argentina's ability to compete, within Mercosur and globally. The
key, say industry officials, is not depending solely on price.
``Being a low-cost global player is not an option for Argentina's
automotive suppliers,'' says Salomao Ioschpe, president of
U.S.-based Iochpe-Maxion Ohio, whose Argentine plant won a
worldwide supply contract with Mercedes Benz.
 &HT;    Tooling up to produce exports such as these leads to the two
main obstacles faced by Argentina as it enters the era of Mercosur.
As long as companies based in Argentina depend on sending such
large percentages of their output to Brazil, the Argentine economy
is intrinsically bound to the fate of its larger neighbor. For
example, both Fiat and Ford had to cut production this year in the
face of declining Brazilian demand.
 &HT;    Logistics. The other problem is logistics _ getting the goods to
that rich potential Brazilian market. In fact, infrastructure is at
once an investment opportunity and a major bottleneck.
Privatization of ports and rails is only a first step. The nine
companies that now control the former state railway inherited three
different gauges of track, making them incompatible. Major spending
will be required to allow the national system to work together. And
though the federal government has unloaded its properties, the
Inter-American Development Bank says that regional and municipal
governments must do the same.
 &HT;    Nearly three fourths of Mercosur cargo travels by road,
according to the Brazil-Chile Chamber of Commerce, creating the tie
ups like those around the Buenos Aires Port. Projects are underway
to launch a Buenos Aires-Sao Paulo rail route, but more is needed.
``Congestion is going to be a problem,'' says Mario Guaragna, the
general manager of Argentina's Metrovias train company.
 &HT;    But Argentines are giddy with the prospect of being the small
partner of a burgeoning free-trade area. Brazil may be four times
as big, they say, but Argentina gets four times the benefits of
Mercosur. That alone provides ample motivation to work out the
problems: ``We are nearing enormous production levels in mining and
petrochemicals,'' says Nicolas Matienzo, Argentina-based regional
vice president of U.S. firm Ryder Integrated Logistics. ``Without
infrastructure works, it will be very hard to sell the all products
we are making.''

Rated: R

<P>
   ``Belly'' probably takes its name from the expression, ``in the
belly of the beast.'' It's also an appropriate title since by its
end, this film sits thick and nasty in the pit of the stomach like
a bad meal.
</P>
<P>
   This sickeningly violent film, starring a bevy of rap stars,
marks the feature debut of hot video director Hype Williams, and
while there are hints of his trademark trippiness, this is
basically an utterly joyless endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of childhood friends Sincere (Nas) and Tommy
(DMX), whose lives sink deeper and deeper into crime. The film
begins with a shootout in a nightclub, and the violent mood is set
as the body count continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   Sincere is supposed to be the conscience of the film. He's
constantly plagued with doubts about his life, especially since he
has a girlfriend, Tionne (T-Boz from the rap group TLC), and a baby
girl. He knows it's just a matter of time before the violence
reaches his lovely little home in St. Albans, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   But for Tommy, it's all about the benjamins. He lives in his
ultramodern home in Jamaica Estates with his trophy girlfriend,
Kisha (Taral Hicks), who Sincere describes as ``a ghetto Naomi
Campbell.'' Tommy always wants to increase his bankroll, and sees
his opportunity while watching MTV News when Kurt Loder (Kurt, what
is up with that?!) talks about a potent heroin hitting the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy hooks up with Lennox (Louie Rankin), a Jamaican drug
dealer who agrees to bankroll Tommy's entry into the big-time drug
market. Next thing you know, gats are shouting and young black men
are dropping like so many dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has obviously watched the Martin Scorsese masterpiece
``GoodFellas'' many times. There's the voice-over narration from
Sincere, and lots of slow motion and freeze frames. There are also
the inevitable nods to Brian DePalma's ``Scarface,'' which has been
elevated to ghetto fabulousness in the hip-hop community. Williams
has a directorial style, but he has absolutely nothing to say as a
writer, at least beyond finding every possible way to get a certain
racial epithet into the mouths of each and every character.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, though, is Williams wants to have it both
ways. He wants to be a playa-hater, schooling us on the evils of
guns and drugs, cautioning us about the violence and mayhem tearing
apart the inner city. He does this through Sincere's uneasiness,
and with a trying 10-minute polemic delivered by a Louis
Farrakhan-like minister, played by former NAACP president Benjamin
Chavis.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also intoxicated by the excitement of the life. His
denouncement comes only after what seems an eternity of
Lexus-driving, money-flashing, blunt-smoking, gun-toting,
hair-trigger madness. Williams revels in the life he wants us to
revile, and what we're stuck with is a morality tale told in the
most immoral way possible.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Un atardecer, como casi todos los
dias, el trafico se ha paralizado en la principal carretera que
conduce al norte desde el puerto de Buenos Aires. El sol se refleja
en el anchuroso rio Parana y en la hilera de vehiculos que se
extiende varios kilometros en ambas direcciones. Los camiones son
una porcion sorprendentemente grande del trafico. Un camion
cisterna de gasolina va seguido por un remolque con un contenedor;
camiones de todos tipos y tamanos, algunos fabricados hace 30 anos,
transportando los productos de una floreciente economia. El trafico
se paraliza por largos periodos; cuando la espera se hace
insoportable, un bocinazo desata un concierto de protestas. Es el
sonido del Mercosur.
 &HT;    Son tiempos agitados en Argentina, que una vez fue el mejor
ejemplo de caos economico y volatilidad financiera. La economia del
pais revienta por las costuras y ni siquiera la crisis de Asia
parece capaz de detener el crecimiento. La austera politica
monetaria rinde dividendos de baja inflacion y una avalancha de
inversion extranjera directa. Esta estabilidad ha servido para
destacar al pais de sus vecinos, los miembros del Mercosur, de
forma tal que Argentina consolida rapidamente una base industrial y
financiera para aprovechar sus recursos naturales y atender no solo
a sus 35 millones de habitantes, sino a los mas de 200 millones de
ciudadanos de la mas avanzada region de libre comercio del
continente.
 &HT;    En 1997 la economia crecio el 8,6 por ciento y en lo que va de
este ano mantiene ese indice, aunque el gobierno espera que el
crecimiento del PIB para fin de ano termine en el 6 por ciento.
Gran parte de este crecimiento se debe a la inversion directa, que
el ano pasado llego a US$10.500 millones, el triple del indice
promedio anual en los anos 90. El gobierno pronostica que en los
proximos cinco anos la inversion extranjera directa alcanzara un
promedio de US$13.500 millones al ano, concentrada en la
infraestructura, la manufactura, la agricultura y los recursos
naturales. La entrada de bienes de capital, que representan la
mitad de todas las importaciones, es tan vigorosa que el gobierno
culpa a la inversion extranjera, junto con los bajos precios de los
principales productos de exportacion del pais, del creciente
deficit de cuenta corriente.
 &HT;    A diferencia de la mayor parte de la region, Argentina tiene una
clase media bien definida y el poder adquisitivo del consumidor es
dos o tres veces mayor que al otro lado de la frontera, en Brasil.
Junto con las fertiles tierras de labor del pais, la creciente
productividad agricola y el potencial industrial, la economia
ofrece una solida base local. Sin embargo, la verdadera ventaja de
operar en el pais proviene de los fuertes vinculos entre las
economias del Cono Sur. ``Si uno construye supermercados, es en
Argentina,'' dice Felix Zumelzu, director de la Camara de Comercio
EU-Argentina. ``Si uno habla de construir fabricas, hay que pensar
en el Mercosur. A cualquier sector que tenga un fuerte potencial en
el Mercosur le va a ir bien.''
 &HT;    Con esa mantra del Mercosur en mente, las multinacionales han
sido las primeras en aprovechar la apertura de las fronteras al
comercio. Desde los fabricantes de automoviles hasta los
productores de alimentos, las transnacionales consolidan sus
operaciones y aumentan las oportunidades comerciales a lo largo de
un eje definido por Argentina y Brasil. El mayor mercado es el
brasileno, pero mientras persistan las dudas sobre la estabilidad
de ese pais, Argentina se vera como un puerto seguro donde se
pueden buscar oportunidades. Y las grandes empresas argentinas
demuestran que tambien pueden competir. ``Argentina forma parte de
una plataforma,'' dice Luis Pagani, gerente general de Arcor, una
compania local de dulces y el mayor productor de caramelos a nivel
mundial. ``Brasil tiene un mercado muy grande y atractivo y, al
crecer la economia, habra mas millones de consumidores. Lo
consideramos parte de nuestro mercado nacional.''
 &HT;    Moneda estable. En general se atribuye a la estrategia monetaria
del presidente Carlos Menem, conocida como convertibilidad, la
envidiable posicion del pais. La convertibilidad, el plan
implementado por Domingo Cavallo, ex ministro de Economia, iguala
el peso argentino al dolar estadounidense. Tambien se ha elogiado a
Menem por la privatizacion de gran parte de los activos productivos
del gobierno federal, como puertos y ferrocarriles, asi como por
mantener una disciplina fiscal. Su estrategia paso a principios de
este ano la prueba mas dificil, la de la repercusion financiera de
la crisis de las economias del Sudeste Asiatico.
 &HT;    Una turbulencia similar, causada por la devaluacion del peso
mexicano en 1994, conmovio a Argentina hasta las raices y puso en
peligro la capacidad de la junta monetaria del gobierno de igualar
el valor del peso al del dolar. Un retiro generalizado de depositos
bancarios obligo a varias instituciones a cerrar sus puertas y
agravo el panico. Pero brillo un rayo de esperanza con una oleada
de fusiones que redujo el numero de bancos de 200 a unos 140, hoy.
Bancos extranjeros absorbieron a instituciones en apuros, y su gran
volumen de capital, junto con regulaciones mas estrictas, fueron
esta vez una gran ayuda para el pais.
 &HT;    Los depositos bancarios han aumentado el 15 por ciento este ano,
una clara senal de confianza tras reducirse en un porcentaje
similar por el ``efecto tequila'' en 1995. Y a diferencia de
Brasil, Argentina no se ha visto obligada a defenderse de los
ataques de la especulacion contra su moneda, aunque algunos afirman
que la paridad con el dolar deja subvaluada a la moneda nacional.
``Los bancos son mas fuertes debido al respaldo de las
instituciones extranjeras y a las nuevas normas de contabilidad,''
dice Marcela Cristini, analista economica de Fiel, un grupo de
estudio de Argentina. ``El escenario economico es ahora muy
estable.''
 &HT;    El cambio ha tenido su precio. El sector bancario mantiene un
proceso de fusiones y adquisiciones, y otros sectores deben seguir
el mismo rumbo. El gobierno ha decidido suspender la asignacion de
US$1.000 millones para gastos publicos este ano con el fin de hacer
un ajuste por el efecto de la crisis en Asia. La fuerza laboral
tambien ha sufrido: aproximadamente uno de cada siete adultos esta
desempleado o subempleado. Muchos de los que no tienen trabajo son
ex empleados del sector publico y los economistas dicen que este
cambio estructural puede dejarlos permanentemente al margen a menos
que amplien sus conocimientos.
 &HT;    Pero ni siquiera esta situacion ha paliado el entusiasmo por el
rumbo economico de Argentina.
 &HT;    Ironicamente, Menem es muy impopular al cabo de ocho anos en la
presidencia. Su indice de popularidad esta entre el 10 y el 15 por
ciento y cuando anuncio que no buscaria la reeleccion, casi se oyo
un suspiro de alivio nacional. Pero las politicas de Menem no se
cuestionan. Los expertos senalan que la campana presidencial para
las elecciones del 2000 ya esta en marcha y la consideran la
campana politica mas larga de la historia. Pero pocos miembros del
empresariado parecen pensar que la estrategia fiscal y monetaria
del gobierno de Menem este en peligro. Es mas, los lideres del
sector privado temian mas al posible dano causado por el desafio de
Menem a la Constitucion para poder postularse de nuevo, que al
hecho que un candidato desconocido gane las elecciones. Algunos
dicen que se trata de una senal reveladora de la madurez del
sistema politico: ``Tenemos una moneda, una estabilidad, un
presupuesto, cosas que no teniamos antes,'' apunta Felix Pena,
subsecretario de comercio exterior del Ministerio de Economia.
``Tenemos muy claras las reglas del juego. Puedo hacer muchas menos
cosas de las que podia hacer mi antecesor hace solo unos anos. Hay
mecanismos instituidos que no me permiten una mala conducta, aunque
quisiera.''
 &HT;    Esta es la clase de retorica que a los inversionistas les gusta
escuchar. Las empresas extranjeras refuerzan sus operaciones de
todos tipos, mientras las argentinas han descubierto que deben
reducirse y, en muchos casos, buscar socios para garantizar un
papel de importancia en la economia del Mercosur. ``Los argentinos
tienen sed de alianzas. Saben que deben ser capaces de competir con
Brasil,'' apunta Yves Moyen, de la consultoria de gerencia
norteamericana AT Kearney. ``Cada sector tiene su propio paso de
avance hacia la consolidacion. El sector bancario y el automotriz
ya esta copado, pero otros, como los alimentos y las bebidas, estan
abiertos.'' Los socios locales buscan sobre todo a extranjeros,
agrega Cesar Deymonnaz, gerente de la division argentina del banco
holandes ABN Ambro. ``Los argentinos estan muy orgullosos de sus
negocios y no fusionarian sus empresas entre si. Por eso muchos
bancos quebraron por el efecto tequila, y lo mismo ocurrio en otros
sectores. Las multinacionales han comprado a muchos.''
 &HT;    Un resultado ha sido un aumento de la productividad. El costo de
la electricidad bajo el regimen privatizado es 60 por ciento menos.
Los operadores privados de puertos y ferrocarriles tambien han
reducido costos, mas de la mitad en el caso de los puertos. ``Hay
un incremento de la productividad, con aumentos del 30 por ciento
en esta decada,'' dice Hector Oswaldo, asesor del Ministerio de
Economia. ``Estamos presenciando una reestructuracion de las
empresas nacionales. Lo que ocurrio en la banca ocurre en todos los
sectores. Es como si vivieramos en otro pais.''
 &HT;    Quimica y energia. La reciente adquisicion de la compania
farmaceutica local Chemotecnica por la firma estadounidense
Monsanto es un ejemplo de como empresas nacionales en sectores
clave buscan la potencia de las multinacionales. Dow Chemical, otra
compania norteamericana, tambien ha formado una empresa conjunta en
una inversion de US$1.300 millones, y a principios de este ano la
francesa Total SA hizo ofertas por una propuesta planta de US$70
millones que extraeria gas natural y procesaria productos
petroquimicos al sur de Buenos Aires. La region alrededor del
puerto de Bahia Blanca se ha convertido en un gran centro
petroquimico y el sector se considera entre los de crecimiento mas
rapido.
 &HT;    Los productos quimicos para la agricultura tienen una gran
demanda tanto en Argentina como en Brasil, como parte de la
tendencia de desarrollar la actividad agricola y disponer nuevas
tierras para los cultivos. Argentina es una autentica cornucopia de
productos agricolas, con una riqueza de todos los productos
basicos: arroz, trigo, leche, soya, etc. Los granjeros argentinos
tienen una gran participacion en los mercados mundiales con
productos basicos como el trigo y la soya. Ahora los granjeros
preparan una campana de mercadeo de la famosa carne del pais,
proveniente de reses alimentadas naturalmente, para imitar lo que
el vecino Chile ha hecho con el vino. Segun Cresud, una de las
mayores empresas de propiedades agricolas del pais, todavia hay
grandes extensiones de tierra de labor a bajos precios, como
promedio a menos de US$6.000 por hectarea, mientras en Europa y
Nueva Zelanda el precio de la tierra supera los US$20.000 por
hectarea.
 &HT;    Los bajos precios de la tierra reflejan un riesgo: mientras mas
lejos de los grandes centros urbanos, mas dificil es el ambiente
comercial, debido a una interpretacion conflictiva de los estatutos
juridicos y a la corrupcion. Las empresas mineras que trabajan en
los Andes argentinos han tenido problemas con el gobierno regional
de Catamarca, que insiste en cobrar derechos que el gobierno
federal no reclama. Esa estructura de pagos reduce los margenes de
ganancia al punto que las companias mineras pierden interes en la
region, sobre todo con los bajos precios mundiales de los
minerales. La ambigua situacion juridica obstaculiza al sector
agricola y al de la mineria. En efecto, a menudo se menciona a la
corrupcion como el peor problema que afrontan las empresas que
hacen negocios en la zona. Pero la economista Cristini le resta
importancia al asunto: ``Los inversionistas entienden que la
estabilidad judicial no es ideal. Pero eso no los detiene a la hora
de invertir, lo cual dice algo de sus margenes de ganancia.''
 &HT;    En realidad, nadie se esta retirando, al menos por el momento,
debido a esos temores. Rosario, el puerto del norte del pais en el
rio Parana, ha revivido con la inversion de colosos como Cargill y
Bunge, que han construido instalaciones portuarias para transportar
granos. Pero el gobierno debe hacer mas para garantizar el
crecimiento agricola, dice Carlos Lovatelli, del corredor brasileno
de bienes basicos Bunge International. ``Las cuestiones juridicas
de la propiedad de la tierra son un problema. Y Argentina no ha
invertido lo suficiente en infraestructura en las zonas agricolas.
Hace falta aumentar esa inversion.''
 &HT;    Rio abajo, fuentes del sector de alimentos y bebidas esperan una
inversion de US$5.000 millones al aumentar el procesamiento de
alimentos en respuesta a los requerimientos de supermercados y
restaurantes. ``Todo sigue el rumbo de los supermercados estilo
norteamericano y europeo,'' dice Pagani, de Arcor, cuya compania
invierte en plantas de envasado. ``Cada vez son mas exigentes en
cuanto a la forma en que se envasan los productos.''
 &HT;    Los habitos del consumidor se mueven hacia las compras
minoristas concentradas y se alejan de las tiendas y los mercados
de productos especializados. Las economias de escala aceleran la
aparicion de modernos mercados minoristas, con la conveniencia como
un importante factor de los modelos de compra, indica Francisco
Sanchez Loaeza, presidente ejecutivo de Panamco, de Mexico, la
mayor embotelladora de refrescos de America Latina. ``La gente dice
que los argentinos no comeran hojuelas de maiz en el desayuno, sino
pan y mantequilla. No estoy de acuerdo. La oportunidad es para las
companias capaces de cambiar los habitos de consumo.''
 &HT;    El sector automotriz, que desde hace tiempo es el indicador de
la suerte economica de Argentina, y del Mercosur, sigue a toda
marcha. A pesar de que no se han resuelto las cuestiones fiscales
entre las naciones del Mercosur, los grandes fabricantes de
automoviles no dejan de invertir. Volkswagen, de Alemania, y
Toyota, de Japon, anunciaron recientemente adiciones a sus
fabricas, mientras las norteamericanas Chrysler, Ford y General
Motors ya realizan mejoras por mas de US$2.000 millones. Volkswagen
planea vender el 70 por ciento de su produccion nueva en Brasil;
Toyota destinara la mitad de sus camionetas a otros mercados del
Mercosur, mayormente a Brasil. Pero la resbaladiza moneda brasilena
ha provocado que los vehiculos y las piezas producidos en Argentina
sean un poco mas costosos. Esa tendencia indica la capacidad de
competencia de Argentina, dentro del Mercosur y a nivel
internacional. La clave, dicen los ejecutivos del sector, no
depende solamente del precio. ``Los suministradores argentinos del
sector automotriz no pueden participar en la economia globalizada
con bajos costos,'' dice Salomao Ioschpe, presidente de la empresa
norteamericana Ioschpe-Maxion Group, cuya planta en Argentina
obtuvo un contrato de suministro mundial de Mercedes Benz.
 &HT;    Esforzarse por fabricar productos de exportacion como estos
lleva a los dos obstaculos principales que afronta Argentina al
entrar en la era del Mercosur. Mientras las companias radicadas en
Argentina dependan del envio a Brasil de porcentajes tan altos de
su produccion, la economia argentina esta atada a la suerte de su
vecino mayor. Por ejemplo, tanto la Fiat como la Ford tuvieron que
reducir la produccion este ano debido a una declinacion de la
demanda brasilena.
 &HT;    Logistica. El otro problema es la logistica: colocar los
productos en el potencialmente rico mercado brasileno. En realidad,
la infraestructura es a la vez una oportunidad de inversion y un
cuello de botella. La privatizacion de los puertos y los
ferrocarriles es solo un primer paso. Las nueve empresas que
controlan el antiguo sistema ferroviario estatal heredaron lineas
de tres anchos distintos, lo que hace necesaria una gran inversion
para que el sistema funcione como un todo. Y auque el gobierno
central ha vendido sus propiedades, el BID dice que los gobiernos
municipales y regionales deben hacer lo mismo.
 &HT;    Casi las tres cuartas partes de la carga del Mercosur se
desplaza por carretera, segun la Camara de Comercio Brasil-Chile,
lo cual crea congestiones como la que rodea al puerto de Buenos
Aires. Esta en marcha un proyecto ferroviario entre Buenos Aires y
Sao Paulo, pero hace falta mas. ``La congestion sera un problema,''
afirma Mario Guaragna, gerente general de la empresa ferroviaria
argentina Metrovias.
 &HT;    Pero los argentinos estan deslumbrados ante la perspectiva de
ser el socio menor de una floreciente zona de libre comercio.
Brasil puede ser cuatro veces mayor, dicen, pero Argentina recibe
cuatro veces mas beneficios del Mercosur. Solo eso es suficiente
motivacion para resolver los problemas: ``Nos acercamos a niveles
de produccion enormes en la mineria y la petroquimica,'' dice
Nicolas Matienzo, vicepresidente regional en Argentina de la firma
norteamericana U.S. Ryder Integrated Logistics. ``Sin obras de
infraestructura, sera muy dificil vender todos los productos que
fabricamos.''

THE ISOLATION OF STAY-AT-HOME FATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the quiet of the day, Armen Aghamianz talks about the
isolation of the at-home dad.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue the 36-year-old Waltham man first became
acquainted with three years ago after deciding to care for his
infant son while his wife worked at her managerial job full time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other fathers, Aghamianz soon discovered that some of
us still aren't ready to accept the growing social trend of the
stay-at-home dad: Mothers on his block shunned him; women at a
local exercise program for tots were visibly disturbed by his
presence; moms at a nearby park were downright frosty; and the
clerk at a neighborhood grocery store snickered.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; cl10.9 &LR;  ``When I tried saying hello to a group of mothers at
the park, they walked the other way,'' recalls Aghamianz. ``So, I
said to myself, `OK, I didn't shower today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Scott Bokun, 32, of Lexington recalls feeling
``funny'' just walking around town. ``I felt isolated,'' he says of
his initial experience four years ago. ``I wanted to talk to an
adult and just have a regular adult conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien, 52, of Scituate, was chastised by the local
vagrant. ``I was buying something and he walked up to me and said,
`Hey, why don't you go out and get yourself a real job!'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin Poussaint isn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given a lot of lip service to the idea of fathers
staying home, but the truth is, the housewife image isn't even
acceptable anymore, especially as children begin to grow up and go
on to day care or school,'' notes Poussaint, Harvard Medical School
professor and clinical psychiatrist at the Judge Baker Children's
Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often begin to think of these fathers as dependent
because, essentially, they have assumed a role very similar to the
one women had,'' says Poussaint. ``As a result, a lot of men must
struggle with emotional issues and self-esteem, especially when the
children are ready to go to school. They're asked, `Why are you
still around the house?'''
</P>
<P>
   These issues are hardly unique to at-home dads. Women are also
likely to face criticism these days for remaining at home while the
kids are at school. But while women can easily turn to others like
themselves, men must work harder to forge similar links with
stay-at-home fathers, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics suggest that the number of at-home fathers is
likely to increase as more men drop out of the work force
altogether or resort to part-time work _ and as more firms
institute flexible work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nation's 54.4 million married couples with children in
1997, 5.6 percent were families with sole bread-winner wives, up
from 2.4 percent in 1967, reports the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Moreover, 10.7 percent of employed men who were part of
a dual-earner couple worked part time last year, compared with 9.4
percent in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Aghamianz eased the loneliness by joining a Boys Club that had a
group for dads. He also founded a father-and-child play group that
meets at his home, and he accepted a part-time night job driving a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Bokun formed a group, too. He met some members through an
At-Home Dads newsletter created by Peter Baylies of North Andover,
a stay-at-home father who relieved his own isolation by using a
computer and the Internet to forge links with 800 fathers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, when extended families were still in vogue,
at-home parents could walk no farther than the end of the block to
find a relative or a neighbor to talk to. But back then, with the
first big wave of married women entering the work force, the stigma
associated with being a house husband was far more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as career-minded Americans have moved up the economic
ladder, many have become physically and emotionally disconnected
from their families, their neighbors, and their communities because
of the demands of contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   Wellesley psychologist Richard Levin believes the isolation some
at-home fathers are experiencing is common among people of all ages
and both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us tend to live some distance from our families,''
says Levin, co-author of ``Shared Purpose: Working Together to
Build Strong Families and High-Performance Companies. ``We are
forced now to rely on community supports that have weakened. This
results in greater stress on the nuclear family, which is expected
to carry it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark L. Baron of Sharon decided to stay home with his two
children four years ago. Today, his wife is the sole bread-winner.
Baron cares for the children during the day, goes to early
afternoon sports games, does housework, cooks, and pays the bills
with the money his wife earns.
</P>
<P>
   Baron, 40, said reaction to his decision to give up his sales
position and stay home was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down, I think, the in-laws may have said, `My son-in-law,
a bum?' But it's been four years now, and they're impressed,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He encountered more pressure from his own relatives. ``My
grandmother, to this day, will ask, `When are you going to get a
job? Have you started studying for your insurance license yet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say couples should negotiate terrain and establish how
chores will be divided. They should also communicate early on their
expectations and feelings. Their ability to switch roles without
serious repercussions will be determined by their own
self-perceptions, how they see their marriage, whether they can
withstand social pressures and stigma, and whether hubby's decision
to stay home was thrust upon him or decided by both spouses.
</P>
<P>
   A former inspector with Boston Scientific, Aghamianz says he and
his wife had talked for a while about his desire to stay home with
their first child. He says his son's birth led to an epiphany of
sorts. Aghamianz's father had worked so hard there was little time
left for the kids. It was not surprising Aghamianz was determined
that would not happen to him and his son, Andreas.
</P>
<P>
   Says Baron, ``For us, the issue was, do we work our brains out
and not see the kids, or do we have less money and more time for
the kids and each other?
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we were stuck in overdrive. We were always getting to
the day care center at 6 p.m. or just before it closed. Then, after
paying bills and taxes, we realized we really hadn't made that much
to show for all that aggravation... It just wasn't worth it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody knows that Goldilocks can't stick around
forever. The question is: Has she left already?
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, the American economy hummed along in near
perfect balance, neither too hot nor too cold. Then this summer,
with the Asian crisis spreading to Russia and Latin America,
investors began to behave as if the global boom _ and with it, the
US boom _ had been built on sand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, both the market and the economy seem to show
signs of renewed strength. An army of pundits was busily at work
late last week touting the latest news _ unexpectedly strong
third-quarter economic growth and a runup in stocks _ as a victory
for the bulls and a return of good times.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the headlines, many economists said, the signs of
danger still lurk. And the economy's recent lurchings have already
taken something out of the nation: perhaps an ability to believe
any longer in the notion of uninterrupted growth, perhaps the
Goldilocks from the Goldilocks economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that everything has gone bad. In fact, the US economy
remains structurally sound,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global
economist with Primark Decision Economics in Boston. ``But we're
being brought back to earth by forces largely beyond our control
and beyond our borders, and no one-day blip in the numbers is going
to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sparkle is going out of the American economy,'' Sinai
said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of an economy being brought back to earth are showing up
everywhere, even in the new third-quarter growth figures that
sparked a burst of optimism and a modest stock rally Friday.
</P>
<P>
   True, the nation's gross domestic product, its total output of
goods and services, expanded at a 3.3 percent annual rate from July
through September, almost double the 1.8 percent rate of the second
quarter and substantially higher than the 2 to 2.5 percent rate
that most analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   But economists said a full percentage point of that growth was
due to a not-likely-to-be-repeated burst of auto production by
General Motors, which was replenishing inventories depleted by a
strike earlier this year. In addition, the GDP report contained
some worrisome evidence of weakness, especially in business
investment. Corporate spending on such things as factories and
computers has accounted for almost one third of the nation's growth
so far this decade, but it dropped sharply last quarter, its first
decline in nearly seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be fading sparkle, rather than bouncing
statistics, that ultimately determines what happens next.
</P>
<P>
   That is because in ways that analysts barely understand, it has
been the heady sense that the economy of the 1990s was no longer
bound by its old limits that won it the Goldilocks label (for the
young fairy tall character's preference for porridge that was not
to hot, not too cold) &UR; . &LR;  It has been that label and all it connotes
that has given American families the confidence to consume and
invest with near-abandon in recent years. And more than anything
else, it has been that consumption and investment that fueled what
seemed until recently like an unstoppable upward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Goldilocks simplicity to recent trends, it will be
harder for consumers, businesses, and lenders to spend, invest, and
lend as aggressively as they have until recently,'' said Mark M.
Zandi, chief economist with Regional Financial Associates Inc., a
West Chester, Pa., economic forecasting firm. And the result, he
said, will almost certainly be economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   But how much?
</P>
<P>
   It may have been easier in the past to tell what the the economy
was doing because by the time the issue of a slowdown came up, one
of the Big Three economic measures _ GDP, employment, and inflation
-- was often already beginning to shift. This time, however,
policymakers and corporate executives to have begun to act as if a
downturn is underway even without one of the major measures moving.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that it is hard to know what to watch to decide
where the economy is headed. Here are some of the things that
economists are keeping their eyes on:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Individuals.  &LR; Consumers and their enthusiastic spending have
been responsible for two-thirds of the economy's growth during the
decade. Investors and their unflagging optimism have been credited
with much of the long boom in stocks. Analysts see signs that
individuals are no longer as ready to consume or invest as they
were only a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence has fallen substantially in recent months,
according to surveys by the Conference Board and University of
Michigan, and retail sales have begun dropping at a 1.2 percent
annual rate since peaking last June.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, individual investors have begun shifting increasing
amounts of their money from more aggressive stock mutual funds into
more conservative bond and money market funds _ a sign, according
to some analysts, that investors are to protect themselves for loss
than chase big gains as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Companies &LR; . Corporate America is experiencing its first profit
decline since the start of the 1990s stock boom, and it appears
unable to do much immediately that won't cause still further
declines.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the companies that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index saw their profits contract between 1 percent and 2.5
percent the last quarter and could well see a further contraction
this quarter, according to Charles L. Hill, reseearch director of
Boston-based First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When profits shrink, companies ordinarly raise prices to make up
for the decline. But with foreign competition growing and consumers
less willing to spend, firms in many industries don't have that
luxury. So they are beginning to turn to their other option,
cutting spending through layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Layoff announcements are running 53 percent ahead of last year's
levels and are on pace to be the largest since the early 1990s,
said John A. Challenger of the Chicago-based outplacement firm
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas Inc. ``The cuts are coming from all
sides right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As layoffs rise, consumers are likely to grow more cautious and
spend less, dampening corporate profits still further.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; International markets.  &LR; A key contributor to the recent
improvement in the US stock market has been the absence of another
overseas catacylsm like the Russian debacle and the domino collapse
of East Asia. But analysts warn there are still plenty pf trouble
spots, the most important at the moment being Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials announced a budget austerity plan last week
that sets the stage for a US-orchestrated aid package at protecting
against a run on the country's currency. Most economists said they
are hopeful the combinaton of austerity and aid will do trick. But
what if it does not?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If it doesn't,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist of
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., ``then you're talking recession from Terra Del
Fuego to the Rio Grande.''
</P>
<P>
   That _ and another damaging crisis for US stocks and, most
likely, a final blow to he Goldilocks economy.

CMG'S WETHERELL: TEXTBOOK WORK ETHIC AND GUILE, UNIQUE VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ Considering his poker style, it's no wonder
David Wetherell is a successful Internet entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Among poker buddies, Wetherell is known for his steely nerves, a
man willing to hold a few decent cards in hopes of creating a
winning hand _ or, at least scaring off other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have a hand that's marginally good, but you have to
pay a lot to stay with him,'' says longtime business associate and
card buddy Jack McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   That gutsy style occasionally has cost Wetherell a bundle,
McMullen recalls, but he is &UR;  &LR; more often a winner than a loser.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising, then, that Wetherell is betting heavily on
Internet businesses, a volatile but potentially lucrative industry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it looks as if Wetherell has an impressive hand.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman and chief executive of Andover-based CMG Information
Services Inc., an Internet investment and holding company,
Wetherell has amassed a stake in about two dozen Internet
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   A few of CMG's investments already appear to be winners. Lycos
Inc. is America's number four Internet search engine. GeoCities,
which creates communities on the Internet by letting users set up
free Web pages, is the Web's third most popular site.
</P>
<P>
   Both investments have paid off handsomely for Wetherell's
company.
</P>
<P>
   CMG paid $2 million for an 80 percent stake in Lycos three years
ago, when it had only three part-time employees. Today, it owns 25
percent _ a stake worth $437 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, it paid $2 million for a 54 percent stake in GeoCities.
Today, its 29 percent stake is worth $269 million.
</P>
<P>
   But not even the best-known Internet companies have found ways
to be consistently profitable. CMG is no exception. And many of the
companies it invests in aren't profitable, either. Wetherell's
business plan, then, is one huge speculative bet that the Internet
will someday pay off commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gut-wrenching collapse of many Internet stocks in
late summer, Wetherell remains confident that he's at the leading
edge of a revolution. ``The Internet is bigger than the Industrial
Revolution and it's happening faster,'' he insists.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As the Internet evolves, Wetherell has strengthened his hand
by building CMG in a unique, holistic way.
</P>
<P>
   While each of CMG's companies has its own Internet niche, they
typically work together, leveraging each other's strengths, in
hopes of generating the most ``eyeball time,'' in Internet
parlance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the companies is its own independent molecule,''
explains Hans Hawrysz, chief executive of PlanetDirect, a free
personalized Web service that is one of a handful of Internet
companies CMG built from scratch. ``But they are also strung
together into complex compounds that meet individual or customer
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Its structure as a cross between an Internet mutual fund and a
venture capital firm attracts investors who want a piece of the
action in Internet stocks, but are wary of the sector's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   As investors have poured in, CMG shares have soared, and despite
losing half their value in this summer's stock market gyrations,
CMG shares are still the biggest gainer in the state this year _ up
276 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like most Internet companies, CMG still isn't a consistent
money maker. &UR;  &LR;  For the fiscal year ended in July, CMG had an
operating loss of $79 million, on revenue of $91 million.
</P>
<P>
   What sets CMG apart from traditional venture capital firms is
the fact that Wetherell is not just buying stakes in existing
companies, he's also building companies from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insight Dave had was that the Internet is such a
fast-changing, amorphous thing that a `Street' venture firm would
be at a disadvantage, because they wouldn't know anything about
running an Internet company. So his idea was to have an operating
venture company,'' says McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   The company is divided into three units: (AT)Ventures, which
buys stakes in other companies but typically keeps existing
management; the Internet Group, which builds wholly
owned &UR;  &LR; companies from scratch and hires its own managers; and the
Direct Marketing Group, the mailing list company where CMG has its
roots.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of strategic vision that makes the soft-spoken
Wetherell so special, say those who know him.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is out looking not just for Internet companies,'' says
Carol Vallone, president and chief executive of Universal Learning
Technology, a Web-based distance-learning company in Peabody that
is one of CMG's most recent investments. &UR;  &LR; He is also asking
himself, ```How can I build a number of companies that will
complement each other and benefit from each other, that can profit
and leverage off of each other's experiences?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a programmer at heart, a hands-on kind of product
person,'' says Hawrysz. ``At one level, he's a visionary. He gets
very excited about the way Internet technology can change the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In that way, adds Hawrysz, ``there's a bit of the classic '60s
altruist in him. But he also gets down to bits and bytes detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell, 44, confesses to working &UR;  &LR; up to 80 hours a week,
but &UR;  &LR; tries to put in as many hours as possible &UR;  &LR; from his home
office &UR;  &LR; in North Andover, so that he's not a stranger in his three
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   But deputies say he's a workaholic who functions on little
sleep. It's not unusual, they say, to receive e-mail &UR;  &LR; messages from
Wetherell at 3 or 4 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of six children in a Connecticut farm family,
Wetherell studied mathematics and education at Ohio Wesleyan
University, with plans to become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But late in his senior year in college, he discovered that he
loved computer programming. After a couple of jobs _ one as a
computer code-writer, another as a headhunter &UR;  &LR;  _ he founded a
venture-backed company in 1982 called Softrend Inc., which
developed integrated desktop software long before Microsoft
introduced its own OfficeSuite product. But Wetherell sold that
company in 1984 after his sponsors defected from the venture
capital firm, leaving Softrend orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell recovered from his disappointment, and in 1986 decided
to buy College Marketing Group, a direct-mail company that
specialized in selling lists of professors and their courses to
textbook publishers. &UR;  &LR; He changed its name to CMG.
</P>
<P>
   He built up the company's core mailing lists and took it public
as a direct-mail company. But what really excited &UR;  &LR;  Wetherell was
the chance to use it as a platform for building other database
marketing ventures on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1994, shortly after CMG went public, Wetherell became
convinced that because of the World Wide Web, electronic publishing
would become standardized on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He formed an Internet subsidiary of CMG called Booklink
Technologies and developed what he believed would be the first of
many Internet products, a Web browsing program.
</P>
<P>
   But the browser quickly attracted the interest of the America
Online computer network, which bought Booklink for $30 million in
AOL stock. Ten months later, Wetherell sold the stock for $73
million.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly flush with cash, Wetherell in 1995 formed (AT)Ventures,
``because I couldn't imagine how to spend all that money,'' he
recalls. His investment targets: promising Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his poker-playing friends say, Wetherell claims to
be averse to risk. Of all potential investment strategies, he
thinks the Internet is a conservative bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest-growing industry in the world is the least risky
thing to invest in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he just knows how to pick the right companies. Only one of
his Internet investments, a free e-mail service called Freemark,
has failed.
</P>
<P>
   That winning percentage &UR;  &LR;  has earned him a reputation as one of
the smartest Internet business people around and explains why CMG
receives several hundred business plans a month from Internet
entrepreneurs seeking financial support.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why outside &UR;  &LR; investors for the first time are
eager to participate in CMG's investment group and why powerful
backers such as Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Sumitomo Corp.
have all invested in CMG.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Vallone is one of the lucky few who had the chance this
summer to sell Wetherell on her business plan, which is similar to
an idea for Web-based education that Wetherell was eager to try
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``His opening comment to me was, `CMG took a run at this
business five years ago. Tell me in 15 minutes why your plan is
going to be successful,''' she recalls. ``I knew I had one question
to make it or break it with Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon learned that Wetherell is a quick study who immediately
saw the benefits of her strategy.
</P>
<P>
   He committed $3 million, and after that, other venture firms
lined up to help finance Universal Learning Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the hottest Internet venture firm,'' she says. ``When
CMG invests in your company, your ticket is punched.''

BOSTON'S SEAFOOD RESTAURANTS ARE A LURE FOR TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A clutch of them congregates in front of the Union
Oyster House, gesturing, peering inside, conversing rapidly in
Italian. Inside, a couple, obviously retired, digs into a platter
of oysters and clams, their Boston guidebook parked by their
silverware. Several faces peek into the souvenir shop filled with
gewgaws that celebrate the restaurant's 170-plus years in business.
</P>
<P>
   They're tourists, all trying to soak up the essence of the city
through its food as well as its sights. Boston's tourism swells to
a crescendo in the fall, boosted by conventions and business
meetings, foliage gazers and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But where do they go to eat? An informal survey of tourism
officials, hotel concierges, and a few cab drivers reveals some
facts, some common ground, and a few vagaries.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of food are they seeking? Seafood, seafood, seafood is
everyone's answer. Paula Ramsdell, concierge at the Four Seasons
Hotel in Back Bay, says the question she answers ``all day, every
day'' is ``where to eat'' and that Boston means seafood for most
tourists. For tradition she usually recommends Union Oyster House,
while Legal Sea Foods or Grill 23 &AMP; Bar will top her list for more
upscale dining.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Capone, a concierge at the Westin Copley Place, says he
often suggests Union Oyster House for those seeking tradition, and
Ron Balleani of the Charles Hotel in Cambridge echoes that. Rick
Walsh, an IOTA cab driver, also says seafood is the quest for most
tourists. He suggests Anthony's Pier 4 or Jimbo's for a waterfront
view and the Union Oyster House for a sense of history. Another
cabbie, who didn't give his name, says he steers tourists to
No-Name Restaurant (``No-Name is seafood,'' he says) or Jimmy's
Harborside.
</P>
<P>
   So does Union Oyster House capture the traditional seafood
destination prize? Patrick Moscaritolo, president of the Greater
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, offers an overview. ``We know
anecdotally, from tour operators and others, that Union Oyster
House is high on everybody's list.'' He attributes its popularity
to a combination of history, uniqueness, and food.
</P>
<P>
   Union Oyster House, near Quincy Market, has been in constant
operation as an eating place since 1826 although the main part of
the building, where the worn wooden oyster bar is located, is
perhaps as much as a century older than that, says president and
CEO Joseph Milano. At the oyster bar, about 2,000 oysters are
shucked daily, say the men working there, who rattle off statistics
about the restaurant with a practiced ease. It can serve about 400
people at a time in three buildings and attracts locals as well as
tourists, Milano says.
</P>
<P>
   What about Durgin-Park? Isn't that the tourist mecca? Seana
Kelley-Chase, a manager and a member of the family that owns
Durgin-Park, says tourists keep the place rocking all year. ``It's
students in the spring, families in the summer, and seniors and
international visitors in the fall.'' The second-floor restaurant,
known for hefty portions of roast beef and baked beans, has been
spiffed up in recent years to an almost Disney-like brightness.
Kelley-Chase says seniors order the New England favorites like fish
cakes, baked beans, and chowder, while the international set favors
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Durgin-Park wasn't mentioned much by concierges. Cabbie
Walsh says he doesn't recommend it because of the Big Dig traffic.
Ramsdell says Durgin-Park is rarely asked about, although ``older
visitors often inquire about Anthony's Pier 4 and Jimmy's,'' two
other places that were once meccas.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Driscoll, concierge at the Marriott Long Wharf, says he
likes to ``expose children to Durgin-Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents took me there when I was a kid, and I never forgot
the experience,'' Driscoll says. He and his wife took their son
when he was 7. It's something kids enjoy, Driscoll says, and they
can also ``see what a surly waitress really is.''
</P>
<P>
   What's big with international visitors? The Italians outside
Union Oyster House, on a business and pleasure trip from Bologna,
planned to eat at that restaurant as well as at Brasserie Jo in the
Colonnade Hotel in Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Moscaritolo says: ``More and more, I hear about restaurants on
Newbury Street as though the street has become a destination unto
itself.'' So foreign visitors will mention Capital Grille or
Sonsie, Armani Cafe or Joe's American Bar &AMP; Grill, especially if
they can sit outside, he says. ``The new smoking ban, you know,''
he adds with a chuckle, referring to the smoking habits of
Europeans and Asians in view of Boston's new restrictions in
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Do tourists arrive with knowledge about the Boston dining scene?
Capone of the Westin Copley Place says many tourists are seeking
the best restaurants after educating themselves with publications
and the Internet. Ramsdell of the Four Seasons says the hotel's
guests are usually very sophisticated and are armed with a list of
places they want to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Are they asking for what's new and hot? Oh, yes, all the
concierges say. Ramsdell suggests Mistral, Clio, No. 9 Park, and,
of course, Aujourd'hui in the Four Seasons. Balleani of the Charles
Hotel always recommends the on-site Rialto and also mentions
Mistral and the Black Rhino. Driscoll of the Marriott Long Wharf
might steer visitors looking for upscale eating to the Bay Tower
Room or the Top of the Hub or perhaps to Mamma Maria's for those
who want to try the North End.
</P>
<P>
   And Capone adds that there are always people who come by at ``7
o'clock on a Saturday and want the best table in town at 8,'' but
generally tourists ``are fairly reasonable about time
constraints.''

THE PATRIOTS: A MID-TERM REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ So what's better: Heading into the second
half of the season following a 28-18 loss to Green Bay at home,
with the prospect of facing the Vikings in Minnesota, or finishing
the first half with a 21-16 win over Indianapolis on the road and
starting the second half at home against Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   In both cases _ 1997 and 1998 _ the Patriots were 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   At this point last season, the Patriots found themselves in a
three-way tie for first with the Dolphins and Jets, while the Bills
were 4-4. This year they're in a four-way tie for first with those
teams. The difference is their divisional record: 2-2 this season,
as opposed to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is the amount of injuries. This year's
Patriots are where they are despite a slew of injuries, which may
be a credit to them.
</P>
<P>
   After the eighth game last season, the Patriots' offense was
ranked sixth overall, 15th rushing and third passing. The defense
also was ranked sixth overall, 10th against the rush and 12th
against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the offense is ranked eighth, 23d rushing and fourth
passing, while the defense is ranked 10th, second against the rush
and 26th against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a positional look at how this year's team stacks up
against last year, through eight games.
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Drew Bledsoe had completed 57.4 percent of his passes
for 2,047 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. With losses to
Denver and Green Bay, though, the Bledsoe bashers were out in force
saying, ``He can't win the big game.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, he has completed 57.6 percent of his passes for
2,052 yards with 11 touchdowns and 6 interceptions. He had thrown
27 fewer passes.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus is that Bledsoe is more poised and less prone to
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Better.
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACK &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a healthy Curtis Martin gained 791 yards on 177 carries
for a 4.47-yard average. The numbers were skewed, though, by a
199-yard performance on 40 carries against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards has certainly made great strides toward replacing
Martin, with 580 yards on 152 carries for a 3.8-yard average, but
he still has a way to go before he can truly replace Martin's
explosiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards may be gaining more ground on Martin as a receiver. In
1997, Martin had 25 receptions for 188 yards (7.52 yards per catch)
while Edwards has caught 17 passes for 169 yards (9.9) and is
emerging in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards also has eight touchdowns while Martin had only three.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Worse.
</P>
<P>
   FULLBACK &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to measure the value of a fullback, especially against
Sam Gash or Keith Byars. Suffice to say the Patriots were making
strides in their blocking schemes with Tony Carter, but when he was
injured, they took a step back when they had to force-feed Chris
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   For a rookie, Floyd is tough and gaining huge amounts of
experience, but he does't have the savvy of Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Worse.
</P>
<P>
   WIDE RECEIVER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed with Terry Glenn. He missed three entire
games and parts of others in the first half last season. He had 19
catches for 327 yards (17.2-yard average). Now, as another
hamstring injury dogs him, he has 25 catches for 415 yards
(16.6-yard average).
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson was the leading receiver among the wideouts last
season with 25 catches for 385 yards (15.4). Though forgotten
earlier this season, Jefferson has had a revival with the injuries
to Glenn, Troy Brown, and Vincent Brisby; he has 14 catches for 345
yards, a whopping 24.6-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Before spraining his ankle, Brown was off to a superb start with
21 catches for 304 yards (14.5); last year he'd caught 20 passes
for 218 yards (10.9). Brisby, who this year caught six passes for
89 yards (two for touchdowns) before breaking his finger, had 14
receptions for 168 yards (12.0) in '97.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have added two new players _ one young, one old _
to the mix this season. Second-round pick Tony Simmons is
developing into a fine deep threat with five catches for 156 yards
(31.2), while greybeard Henry Ellard caught three passes and
dropped two in his debut last week vs. Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots are probably better off in the long run with
the emergence of Simmons, the injuries to three major receivers
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Worse.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHT END &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates has missed a game and a half with two sprained ankles
and therefore is slightly behind last season's pace. In 1997, he
caught 32 passes for 434 yards, a 13.6-yard average, with 5
touchdowns. After his 10-reception performance vs. the Colts this
past Sunday, Coates has 28 catches for 309 yards (11.0) and 3
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have been trying to get more work out of Lovett
Purnell, who is used in two-tight-end sets, and rookie Rod Rutledge
in blocking situations.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle injuries slowed Coates, but otherwise he shows no
signs of aging. With a little more depth behind him, the position
appears stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Better.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots allowed 12 sacks last year and 17 this season.
That's somewhat alarming, considering that Bledsoe has gone to more
three-step drops under the Ernie Zampese system.
</P>
<P>
   Could the pass-blocking be suffering because there has been
emphasis on improving the run-blocking? It's hard to make a case
for that, considering that the Patriots ran for more yardage last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sacks are the result of young running backs not
picking up blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Same.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Until the line was decimated by injuries, assistant coach Ray
Hamilton had a nice eight-man rotation working. Second-year lineman
Brandon Mitchell was becoming a force, both in spelling Henry
Thomas inside and filling in for Ferric Collons and Willie McGinest
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to McGinest, Thomas, Collons, and Chad Eaton have
thrown things out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   This year's line has accounted for 14 of the team's 23 sacks.
Last year it had 11.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Better.
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Johnson, Chris Slade, Todd Collins, and Tedy Bruschi have
been a steady group. Slade had six sacks last year, twice as many
as he currently has, but he hasn't been in as many pass-rushing
situations and has been slowed down with knee and ankle problems.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 51 tackles last year, 47 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, opponents had run for 801 yards on 203 carries for
a 3.9-yard average. This season, they have 615 yards on 193 carries
for a 3.2-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Same.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have allowed a 60.3 percent completion rate and
1,784 passing yards. Last year, they allowed a 60.1 percent
completion rate and 1,718 yards. They have 13 interceptions now,
compared with 10 last season.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff between Jimmy Hitchcock and Chris Canty probably
hasn't been equitable at this point. While the Patriots have
allowed one long pass _ Dedric Ward's 43-yard TD reception over
Canty _ this season, they also allowed just one pass over 40 yards
last year _ a 47-yarder to Denver's Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Law is emerging as a top corner in the league and Lawyer
Milloy a top safety. But the Patriots are 26th against the pass,
and that reflects on the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Worse.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Vinatieri hit 14 straight field goals last year and has
made 15 of 19 this season. He had 65 points last season and has 65
points this season.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Tupa averaged 47.4 yards on 36 punts last season,
with nine kicks inside the 20-yard line. This season he's averaging
45.1 yards and has put seven balls inside the 20.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Meggett hadn't done much on returns last year, averaging
22.1 yards on kickoffs and 10.3 yards on punts. Comparatively, the
Patriots are better off with Derrick Cullors (26.1 yards per
kickoff return), though he has slowed down lately. Brown averaged
14.1 yards per punt return, and Canty 14.3 yards in Brown's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Better.
</P>
<P>
   COACHING &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the second half last season, the offense got worse while the
defense got better. The Patriots hope to even that out this season.
Zampese's offense has been embraced, while Steve Sidwell's defense
has begun to solve its third-down problems and also must work on
offsetting shorter passes over the middle that opponents are
feasting on.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll has a better grasp of personnel and communication,
though he still hasn't been able to avert the dips the team has
gone through.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Better.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Close your eyes and listen to the New England
Blizzard during a scrimmage. There's the familiar squeak of shoes
on the court, the thud of the bouncing basketball, and the sound of
the coach's whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a voice above the din, imploring, ``Passing game!
Passing game!'' or ``Let's box out! Let's box out!''
</P>
<P>
   You suspect there's a bruiser on the court shouting out all
these orders.
</P>
<P>
   Then you open your eyes and see where all the noise is coming
from. It's Jennifer Rizzotti, small in stature at 5 feet 5 inches,
but large in lung power.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, K.C. Jones, has no complaints. After all, as head
coach of the Celtics from 1983-88, Jones heard plenty of noise on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Larry Bird _ he would scream at his teammates.
That's what captains do,'' Jones said. ``She's vocal out there and
tries to light the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recent 3 1/2-hour practice of running, shooting,
dribbling, and lighting all the fires she could, Rizzotti took a
gulp of water, threw on her University of Connecticut sweatshirt,
and headed for the trainer's room. Then she untied her shoes, cut
off the tape wrapped around her ankles, and soaked her left foot,
which was full of blisters.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work, said Rizzotti with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my share of injuries, but nothing that's really had
to keep me out,'' she said. ``I've sprained my ankles. I keep them
taped.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, 24, is a veteran of the American Basketball League,
which kicks off its third season Thursday. She and fellow cocaptain
Carolyn Young (still known as ``C.J.'' for her maiden name, Carolyn
Jones) are the only original Blizzards on the team, and Rizzotti
has started every game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there were four new players on the squad of 10, so
part of the team's practices involved getting used to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out there and play hard against each other because it's
10 people for five spots,'' Rizzotti said. ``You get accustomed to
playing with certain people and their styles of play, and then you
get new people thrown in the mix, and I think sometimes it's harder
for them. They're not really sure how things are run. So it's been
quite a challenge to try and mesh everyone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, a point guard, is a two-time ABL All-Star who averged
10.8 points and a team-high 4.4 assists per game last year. Before
turning pro, she was a two-time All-American at UConn, where she
holds school career records for assists (637) and steals (349).
</P>
<P>
   She's not about to ease up. During the past two summers,
Rizzotti has hired personal trainers to work on her game. Two
summers ago, it was a shooting coach; this past summer, she and
Rebecca Lobo _ a fellow UConn alum and now a player in the other
women's league, the WNBA _ were coached in their defensive moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very intensive, very hard. You're exhausted by the time
the day's over,'' Rizzotti said. ``But the key is, when the four
days are over, you can't just not do the drills. They teach you
things that you can do over and over again and you can incorporate
and get really comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she did get in some golf, Rizzotti said the summer
was really not an ``offseason.'' The Blizzard trainer, Jeanna
Polonchock, sent the team home with exercises in conditioning and
strength training to do throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's our job,'' Rizzotti said. ``People think that it's
nice that we have five months off, but we have to do conditioning
for an hour or two, do lifting, and play basketball for an hour or
two, so it's not like we have every day off. We're still working to
get in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her height, Rizzotti said she's never felt it was a
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   Standing 5-5 would be about average on a high school girls'
basketball team, kind of short on a college team, and very short on
a professional team. Put it this way: If the Blizzard were to line
up for a team picture according to height, Rizzotti would stand on
the left and Kara Wolters would be at the far right. At 6-7, she's
the tallest player in the league. Rizzotti is the second shortest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be as tall but I always work harder than the person
I'm playing against,'' said Rizzotti. ``In terms of defense and
work ethic, I've never felt at a disadvantage. I'm tougher. I get
the loose balls.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the way Jones sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is the most competitive player in the league,'' he
said. ``If she has to go through a wall to get the ball, she'll do
it.''

WOMEN, MINORITY VOTERS BUOY CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Women and minorities turned out in huge numbers
Tuesday to support Sen. Barbara Boxer, giving the Democrat a
re-election victory with a surprisingly comfortable margin.
</P>
<P>
   The race, expected to be an election-night cliffhanger, became a
runaway for Boxer. Fueled by a multimillion-dollar barrage of
mostly negative campaign advertising, Boxer outpolled Republican
state Treasurer Matt Fong by 53 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed by her opponent and some analysts as too liberal for
California, Boxer won with strong support from voters in the San
Francisco area and Los Angeles. But the first-term senator also
polled nearly evenly with Fong in the Central Valley and Southern
California suburbs, where pre-election polls had shown Fong with an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we couldn't do it, that I was a fluke of history,''
Boxer told a packed crowd of supporters and rowdy campaign workers
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that I was too progressive. They said that I was too
supportive of the president. They said I was too feisty. ... They
all missed something. They missed the deep support that I have in
every part of this beautiful state because we stand together on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who has called it the race of her life, savored the
victory, clapping to the beat of James Brown's ``I Feel Good''
along with her husband, Stewart, an Oakland lawyer, and adult
children, Doug and Nicole. She also was joined onstage by Reps.
Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Lee and state Sen. John Burton, who
cajoled her into running for Congress in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was decidedly different in Newport Beach, where a
teary-eyed Fong spoke to the small crowd that remained after a
series of concession speeches by Lungren and other Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Democrats and Republicans. Tonight, after the
elections, we are Californians and Americans,'' Fong said, with his
wife Paula and teen-age children, Matthew and Jade, at his side.
``I wish them well, but tomorrow in America is another day, so
watch out. We're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's margin of victory was a surprise to some supporters and
a blow to Republican strategists, who had seen her as vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But she overwhelmingly won the support of women voters,
exploiting a gender gap that Democrats have ridden to election
victories in recent years. And, as part of her coalition of women
and minorities, Boxer took 55 percent of Asian-Americans, who were
expected to vote heavily for Fong, a fourth-generation
Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election came down, once again, to a focus on issues that
tend to matter most to women and minorities _ education in
particular, but also gun control and choice and social issues in
general,'' said Mark Baldassare, pollster with the nonpartisan
Public Policy Institute of California. ``Women voters came back to
Barbara Boxer ... but I think (she) also benefited from a strong
vote among African-Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans, which
Democrats generally enjoyed in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's election marked a reversal of fortunes in a campaign
that began with Boxer on the defensive over her links to a troubled
President Clinton and ended with Fong railing against what he
called ``nasty, distorted'' attack ads from his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Fong looked like a serious contender after pulling off a
come-from-behind victory in the June primary against San Diego
car-alarm magnate Darrell Issa, who outspent him 4-1. He was lifted
by a surge of crossover Democrats, including many Asian-Americans,
who saw him as moderate and knew him from his mother, March Fong
Eu, the longtime secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's campaign struggled through the summer as Fong toured the
state and raised money while she was stuck in Washington. But when
Congress wrapped up its business last month, she returned to
California and began campaigning nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   It was in August that Clinton admitted an affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Boxer, whose daughter is
married to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, immediately
was singled out. Critics howled that she was a hypocrite for
avoiding a hard line against Clinton after being an outspoken
critic of other public figures accused of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   At an Aug. 26 debate in Hollywood, Fong charged that her silence
on the Clinton affair was ``deafening.'' Two weeks later, she
condemned the president's behavior as immoral and the polls showed
the race tightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating to have the month dominated by Monica
Lewinsky,'' Boxer campaign manager Rose Kapolczynski said of the
White House intern with whom Clinton carried on an extramarital
affair. ``We really couldn't get traction on the issues we wanted
to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the affair undermined Fong's efforts to create a
strong impression with voters. His speeches on water policy and
national security were mostly ignored, while his comments about
Boxer and her ties to Clinton got front-page play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Matt Fong's candidacy never got off the ground,
really,'' said Rollin Post, a veteran television commentator in San
Francisco. ``First of all, no one really knew who he was. He never
really made a really positive case for himself. His campaign seemed
to be assuming that Boxer was unpopular enough so that you could
win by being the alternative.''

A DIFFERENT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bruce Arena was named US national soccer coach last week,
he noted that the collegiate system is not designed to develop
players for Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Arena is a most credible source, since he played and coached in
colleges for two decades before guiding D.C. United to two MLS
championships.
</P>
<P>
   So, is MLS wasting time with collegiate scouting and drafts? If
so, where are the US players of the future going to be developed?
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Queiroz proposed a nationwide Under-19 league. Such an
idea is probably too radical, but Queiroz makes a valid point. What
is needed is organized, ambitious competition separate from the
restrictions of the educational system, especially as that system
relates to the entertainment/sporting industry.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the structure exists for development. Teams such as
Taunton Sports in the Luso American Soccer Association provide
competition and training for Under-18, U-16, U-14, and U-12
players. Taunton has excellent facilities, and unlike mainstream
programs, it does not charge youngsters to participate and provides
uniforms and food, as well as coaching and competition.
</P>
<P>
   By having a stadium and clubhouse, Taunton also promotes a
convivial atmosphere in which sport becomes part of the fabric of
the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many youth programs, but I think there is a
future for this type of program because there are more and more
kids playing,'' said Herman Mello, who coached Taunton Sports's
senior team to the LASA season and Super Cup championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to develop players through youth programs is by
having better coaches. With club teams, such as in LASA, the
coaches have a system and they know the kids and their backgrounds.
You have to build from the youth level to prepare kids for higher
levels of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Taunton's players have included former Revolution midfielder
Paulo Dos Santos, Carlos Fernandes, Danish striker Bjorn Hansen,
and midfielder Andrew Williams, the Columbus Crew's Jamaican
international.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Okaroh was A-OK
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Losing  &UR; Francis Okaroh  &LR; was a huge mistake by the Revolution
last year. He might have been their most valuable player, bringing
experience, leadership, and skill at a low price and without
occupying a foreign spot. Okaroh proved his value by helping the
Chicago Fire win the MLS Cup championship and the US Open Cup while
playing with a separated shoulder. For the Revolution to either
underestimate Okaroh's value or misjudge his character was
incomprehensible. The Revolution simply could not afford to risk
exposing Okaroh to the expansion draft last year ... Chicago
defeated the Columbus Crew, 2-1, for the Open Cup title, but the
Fire needed to move playmaker  &UR; Peter Nowak  &LR; to sweeper after  &UR; Lubos
Kubik  &LR; departed with a broken leg in the 14th minute ... The Fire
became the fourth US team to win the ``double,'' the Division 1 and
cup titles, after D.C. United in 1996 and the Fall River Marksmen,
whose triumphs in 1924 and '30 have been documented by historian
 &UR; Colin Jose  &LR; of Hamilton, Ontario. The Marksmen were named after
owner  &UR; Samuel Mark &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who also built Mark's Stadium in North
Tiverton, just over the Rhode Island border, to avert Massachusetts
blue laws. The Marksmen consistently drew crowds of nearly 10,000
with players such as  &UR; Adelino  &LR; (Billy)  &UR; Gonsalves &LR; , &UR; Werner
Nilsen &LR; , &UR; Arnie Oliver &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Bert Patenaude &LR; , &UR;  &LR; all
Massachusetts-based members of the US national team that finished
third in the 1930 World Cup and qualified for the finals of the '34
World Cup. The 1930 Marksmen's goalkeeper was  &UR; Johnny Reder &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
also played first base for the Red Sox. The 1929 US Open Cup was
won by New York Hakoah, composed mostly of the all-Jewish Vienna
Hakoah team that had won the Austrian championship before moving en
masse to Brooklyn. Playing as the Hakoah All-Stars, their best
finish was third place in the American Soccer League.

New low for Scolari

   &UR; Luis Felipe Scolari  &LR; has had a despotic reign as coach of
Gremio Porto Alegre and Palmeiras in Brazil. Usually, he has
attained success with uncompromising methods that have included
using bouncers as ballboys to intimidate the opposition. Now
Scolari has taken his political incorrectness to the limit by
endorsing former Chilean dictator Gen.  &UR; Augusto Pinochet &LR; .
``Pinochet also did many good things,'' Scolari told Radio Jovem
Pan of Sao Paulo. ``The workings of state are awkward. He could
have done some retaliatory deeds here and there but he did more
good than bad.'' Scolari has transformed Palmeiras from a team that
emphasized artistry to a pragmatic group, which is in second place
in the Brazilian championship. He is hoping to meet Vasco da Gama
in the playoffs, since Vasco has a busy schedule starting with a
Nov. 14 visit to D.C. United for the first leg of the Copa
InterAmericana, then on to the Intercontinental Club Championship
against Real Madrid in Tokyo Dec. 1, then the final of the Copa
InterAmericana in Fort Lauderdale Dec. 5.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dramatic turns
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the symbol of pragmatic, disciplined play has been
 &UR; Giovanni Trapattoni &LR; . But Trapattoni's autocratic style and
traditional, catenaccio ideas have conflicted with the modern game
and the younger generation. At 59 years of age, Trapattoni might
have difficulty changing.
</P>
<P>
   At least Trapattoni has been willing to adjust. He won the
German Bundesliga championship last year with Bayern Munich, an
experience that not only proved his managing ability but also
broadened his perspectives. Now, Trapattoni is being tested by
Fiorentina.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired by  &UR; Vittorio Cecchi Gori &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a media mogul/movie
producer whose ambitions include winning the Serie A scudetto and
an Academy Award for ``La Vita e Bella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more difficult to win the Serie A than the Oscar,''
Cecchi Gori said.
</P>
<P>
   He won over the fans by guiding the ``Viola'' to first place for
most of the season, until a 2-0 loss to Parma combined with
Juventus's 2-0 victory over Sampdoria dropped it into second place.
</P>
<P>
   Trapattoni has not made all the right moves. He substituted
Brazilian forward  &UR; Edmundo  &LR; with a 1-0 lead late in the game at AS
Roma, and Fiorentina surrendered two goals in injury time to lose.
He played defensively in a 2-0 loss to Parma Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo reacted demonstratively and disrespectfully to being
removed, but Trapattoni settled the issue by urging Edmundo to
prove him wrong, which Edmundo did by leading Fiorentina to victory
in a UEFA Cup match against Grasshoppers of Switzerland and over
Salernitana.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I not forgive someone with such a touch?''
Trapattoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Trapattoni seems to be enjoying his transformation from
iron-handed dictator. He has been able to charm the media, and to
meld differing personalities such as Edmundo, Argentinian superstar
 &UR; Gabriel Batistuta &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Belgian-Brazilian striker  &UR; Luis
Oliveira &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roberto Benigni &LR; , &UR;  &LR; director and star of ``La Vita e Bella,''
said Edmundo could win the Oscar for best actor. And Benigni, who
is from Prato, near Florence, provided a solution to Cecchi Gori's
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can give the Oscar to Fiorentina, and everyone will
be happy,'' Benigni told La Gazzetta dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Issue for the ages
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Haruna Babangida &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a Nigerian right wing who turned 16 last
month, according to official documents, has been promoted to the
first team at Barcelona in Spain and signed a contract with a
buyout clause worth more than $5 million. The problem is that
Babangida, whose brother  &UR; Tijani  &LR; plays for Ajax and Nigeria's
national team, is probably older than 16. Babangida was injured
while playing for Nigeria's Under-20 team against Tanzania, and a
bone scan indicated that he was at least three years older than
indicated. Barcelona officials defended Haruna and said he is
``very well developed for his age.'' But this raises questions
about other African players, who have faced hardships and an
incredibly competitive situation in attempting to move to big
clubs. Cheating on ages can be worth millions of dollars,
unimaginable wealth in some countries. The rich European clubs
exploit this situation. Age probably should not be such a
determining factor, especially if players such as Cameroon's  &UR; Roger
Milla  &LR; can perform so well into their late 30s ... The
Confederations Cup, scheduled for Jan. 8-20 in Mexico, could be
salvaged by a ``Europa'' All-Star team that would replace France.
Europa would meet Brazil in the opener in Guadalajara, but that
would not be nearly as enticing as a rematch of the World Cup
final.

RECORD SHOWS THE FALCONS AMONG THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Name the three teams in the National Football League with the
best regular-season records in the last calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   The first two should be easy: The Super Bowl champion Denver
Broncos, who are still undefeated in 1998, and the team they beat a
year ago for the title, the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The third team is surprising.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Atlanta Falcons. In the past 16 regular-season games,
Denver and Green Bay are 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   Just one game back is Atlanta, a team that doesn't get the
respect it deserves. The Patriots had better understand that when
the Falcons pull into town to play them Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When quarterback Chris Chandler starts and finishes a game _
which doesn't always happen _ Atlanta usually wins. During that
16-game stretch, Chandler has a 12-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Chandler throwing the ball and Jamal Anderson
running it is very potent. Anderson, a big back in the mold of
Jerome Bettis, powered his way to 173 yards against St. Louis last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler also has speed receivers on the outside in Tony Martin
and Terence Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defensive line is hurting; all four starters _
Willie McGinest, Ferric Collons, Chad Eaton, and Henry Thomas _ are
beat up, and that is a problem. Even though their offensive line is
not that great, the Falcons are fifth in the league in scoring,
with 212 points through eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is a veteran who knows where to go with the ball. He
makes good selections, picks the open receiver, and feasts on
aggressive linebackers and defensive backs who crowd the line
looking to stop Anderson. Chandler loves play-action. He sticks the
ball into Anderson's gut, then pulls it back, trapping many
defenders moving toward the line.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Atlanta is very good on the line of scrimmage and
has the pass rushers to give Drew Bledsoe a lot to think about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie will be the Bills quarterback for the foreseeable
future, even though head coach Wade Phillips, in his words, is
electing to ``dance around'' that question. Rob Johnson, who was
No. 1 opening the season, is still hurt and can't throw the way he
would like. And even if he makes a miraculous recovery from rib
damage, Flutie would still be the man because the veteran players
on the team know he deserves the chance to keep them on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, meanwhile, isn't going to let this opportunity to cash
in on his celebrity interfere with his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us he doesn't want to do any of this stuff until the
season is over,'' said Kristen Kuliga, vice president of marketing
for Woolf Associates, which handles Flutie's marketing and
endorsements. To date, some 160,000 boxes of Flutie Flakes cereal
have been sold in the Buffalo market alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Doug is going to have some opportunities for good
national endorsements,'' said Kuliga. ``There is a national
telecommunications company we are close to finishing a deal with.
Another offer is coming in from a soft drink company. Then there is
a car deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Doug told us he doesn't want to do anything but play and
win until the season is over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every Patriot fan should say a quiet thank you to Pres Hobson.
Hobson, the former sports editor of the Patriot Ledger, is the one
who came up with the idea of building a stadium for the Patriots in
Foxborough. Just about 30 years ago, Hobson, who also was general
manager of Foxboro Raceway, convinced the owner of the track, E.M.
Loew, to give some of its land to the town, for the purpose of
building the stadium. Hobson went to Patriots owner Billy Sullivan
with his plan. The town bought into it. A stock offering raised the
money. And the stadium went up in one year for less than $7
million, one of the great bargains in sports history. Now, after
the election, the Patriots will be back visiting Rhode Island and
Connecticut to talk about a new stadium for them in one of those
places. Owner Bob Kraft reportedly doesn't want to get heavily
involved until the season is over, but others will do the talking
soon.

DESIGNERS HEED THE CALL FOR CREATIVITY AND WEARABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When designer Issac Mizrahi _ a darling of the
fashion press _ abruptly closed up shop here last month, it was as
if he sent a wake-up call to the clothing industry: Creativity is
fun but business is still business. Clothes need to sell.
</P>
<P>
   This week during spring fashion week, some of the more than 45
designers showing seemed to signal they got the message.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Geoffrey Beene and Linda Allard at Ellen Tracy both
showed thoroughly wearable collections that were modern and chic,
but not routine. They overcame a rut many other American designers
are stuck in: figuring out what comes next now that minimalism is
dead. Beene and Allard demonstrated that old standbys still work
for American women: classic fabrics, interesting color
combinations, unique geometric shapes, and relaxed fits.
</P>
<P>
   Beene's collection was by far the most innovative and applauded
so far. The designer, who once spent a year in medical school and
thus has a different perspective of the human body, is known for
using transparent panels, color variations, and other techniques to
draw the eye. Tuesday, his show was no exception. Dresses were
often two-tone in color (red bodices with yellow skirts, for
example). Fabric was draped at the hip or slit at the top in the
back to show off bare skin.
</P>
<P>
   Zippers were also used creatively. One model wore a black skirt
with a thick beige zipper on one side and a beige top to match.
Another beige short-sleeved dress had a navy zipper that ran
throughout the garment as a pattern, not for functional use. If the
wearer wanted, she could literally unzip her dress and be left with
two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In a futuristic design, Beene presented a black strapless top
with a plastic panel placed across the breast. The model wore it
with a pink skirt. It looked ready for a year 2000 party. Another
memorable outfit was a black halter-top dress with a full pleated
skirt and a satin panel under the breast, creating a triangular
shape over the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Beene used traditional shapes, but he created excitement by
tweaking them with unique piping and modern touches such as plastic
panels. This kind of design, mixing creativity with wearablity, is
what fashion is supposed to be all about.
</P>
<P>
   The Tracy collection revolves around a notion that a lot of
designers just don't get: modern women want great sportswear
separates to mix and match for work and weekend. Indeed, Allard's
tops ranged from halters, to tube tops, to beaded shells, to
chiffon sweatshirts (all of which can be worn alone to make a
statement or under tailored jackets for a toned-down look).
</P>
<P>
   Many of her pants were cropped just above the ankle while some
sleeves cut off just below the elbow. She often mixed fabrics
(textured pants with smooth jackets, for example). She also blended
the dressy with the casual (embroidered jackets or beaded shells
over drawstring pants).
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of these elements we've seen before from other
designers. There were no feathers or hanging fringe to add pizazz.
But Allard's collection is reality-based. It will satisfy the needs
of the modern woman. And that's what the fashion-industry should be
focusing on now. Just ask Mizrahi.

IT'S PRISSY AND NEW YORK NORTH, BUT I LOVE VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Jeff Danziger is a political cartoonist who draws for
200 newspapers all over the world. But he began his career in
Vermont, and still has clients there. Recently, one of them decided
that, hunkered down in his Manhattan hellhole, Jeff had lost touch
with the Green Mountain State. They invited him back for a
get-reacquainted visit, and offered him a car to career around area
code 802.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff asked me to join him. Together, we set off in search of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Let me reveal my bias. I have forceful views on the great
opinion dyads of our time. I've always been a Charles man; never
Diana. Fur, not fleece; shaken, not stirred; comedy, not tragedy;
women, not men. I prefer Newsweek over Time, Eastern Europe over
Western Europe, the West Coast over the East Coast. And craggy New
Hampshire _ Live Free or Die? you bet! _ over prissified Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the construction of Interstate 91, Vermont and the
Berkshires have become wholly owned subsidiaries of demonic
Manhattan. (Digression: A few years ago, Boston magazine editor
Craig Unger told me why he liked Berkshire County: ``It's just like
the Upper West Side.'' My point exactly.) Who in Vermont
(((itals))) isn't (((end itals))) from New York? Boyish governor
Howard Dean hails from Long Island. The ludicrous Bernie Sanders,
America's only ``socialist'' congressman, hails from Brooklyn, as
do Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, of artery-clogging ice cream
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Even people you thought were from Vermont turn out to be
transplants. We now learn that Chester Arthur, one of the state's
two presidents, was born in Canada _ and thus ineligible for the
American presidency. Perhaps aware of her son's dazzling future,
his mother conveniently lost his birth certificate. The state's
other president, Calvin Coolidge, made his political reputation as
governor of Massachusetts, not Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   (((itals))) This supercilious pap flows easily from your pen,
Alex. But isn't it the case that you yourself lived in Vermont,
dividing your time between the Sapphist commune in Essex Junction
and the small weekly newspaper in the middle of the state where
your name long graced the masthead?(((end itals.)))
</P>
<P>
   Where did it all go wrong? When did the Green Mountain Boys
yield to the Green Mountain Coffee Roasters? Was it when the
Rockefellers purchased the town of Woodstock and decided to put it
under glass? Or was it when artist Woody Jackson planted the first
plywood cow on a grassy knoll, signalling to the hordes of New
York-plated Saab turbos that Vermont's crystals-and-macrame theme
park was open for business?
</P>
<P>
   (((itals))) You hypocrite! I saw you Christmas-shopping in the
Woody Jackson store in Middlebury last week, memorably asking the
sales clerk, ``Do you have any refrigerator magnets?'' You're the
first to slur Vermont's paint-by-numbers ``artistes'' _ but in fact
you displayed Sabra Field's ``Mountain Suite'' in your living room
for over a decade! And you liked it! And when you had a chance to
meet Field, the ``artist laureate of Vermont,'' last week, you
groveled for her autograph! (((end itals)))
</P>
<P>
   It's too pathetic. The state that once quarried marble for
America's grand public temples now air-expresses too-prescious
Teddy Bears to all corners of the planet. The last time I visited,
Vermont was negotiating a friendship treaty with the former Soviet
province of Karelia, best known as the birthplace of KGB hangman
Yuri Andropov. Whatever happened to that?
</P>
<P>
   (((itals)))More empty slander. In fact, didn't you remark to
Danziger that the two of you should write a ``triumphantly sleazy
best-seller'' (Updike's phrase) so you could afford a summer
cottage on the Isle La Motte? Didn't I hear you mumble, traversing
Lake Champlain on the Essex-Charlotte ferry at sunset, with the
Adirondacks glowing orange behind you, that ``this is the most
beautiful place I've ever seen''?(((end itals)))
</P>
<P>
   Guilty as charged. Now I want to go back.

CEREBRAL PALSY FAILED TO BREAK SPIRIT, DULL CREATIVE SPARK OF POET
VASSAR MILLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BOB TUTT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ From birth, cerebral palsy impaired acclaimed poet
Vassar Miller's abilities to walk and talk and do the simplest
things with her hands.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't break her spirit nor dull creative powers that
enabled her to craft almost 400 poems collected in 10 celebrated
books over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who died Saturday at 74, had wanted people to see her as
a spirited person with clear perceptions, equal to dealing with her
handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts Phillips, a professor in the University of Houston's
creative writing program, observed that ``a profound sense of
spirituality and religious belief'' lay at the heart of Miller's
verse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of that in contemporary American poetry,''
he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be,'' Phillips added, ``that the pain she suffered was
part of her strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Elizabeth Bennett, book editor of the
Houston Post, Miller once observed, ``The stereotype people have
tended to have of me is that I am a pure, little, good person.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in reality, ``I have a terrible impulse to shock the
staid,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said Tuesday that the reality also was that the life of
the feisty Miller was pathetic in a lot ways. ``She wanted so much
to be independent, but her physical condition made that
impossible,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 article, Houston Chronicle writer Leslie Sowers
explained how failing health had diminished Miller's life.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, then destitute, could no longer use her hands to peck
out poetry on a typewriter. She conceded that trying to dictate her
verse would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller's need to write is urgent, to free the words that are
becoming trapped within her,'' Sowers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Parr, an English professor at the University of St.
Thomas, said she would ``probably compare Vassar Miller to Emily
Dickinson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite what for reasons of her health was a very confined,
even restrained existence, she nevertheless seemed to have a
marvelous sense of the spirit of human beings,'' Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I value her work and am very glad she lived and breathed and
put her existence into words.''
</P>
<P>
   Poet Joyce James of Houston said that Miller's poems ``were so
powerful that they were both physical and emotional at the same
time. There also was great drama in them, expressing the tension
between the body and the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``If I Had Wheels or Love,'' a compilation of Miller's
poetry, poet Kelly Cherry made this appraisal:
</P>
<P>
   ``In her best poems, Vassar Miller launches language like a
satellite, sending a probe into the inner space of moral
consciousness and religious awe.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a writer ``unafraid to explore the most difficult
paradoxes of existence'' to do this, Cherry added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``Slump,'' Miller frankly addressed the
condition of those disabled like herself: &QL; 
``The mind and the senses drift &QL; 
upon a casual wind &QL; 
blowing, petals of a shattered rose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The body, God knows why, creeps &QL; 
along, some crazy creature &QL; 
half an insect, half a tumbleweed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Only the heart lies awake, &QL; 
a naked nerve, an eyeball &QL; 
staring from the socket of the darkness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``If I Had Wheels or Love,'' Miller evoked sensuous images
and longing: &QL; 
``Along the country backroads flower-strewn, &QL; 
Fondling your flanks, my dear, made clouds from clay. &QL; 
If I had wheels or love, I would be gone. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Cool as the evening is and soft as fawn, &QL; 
Warm as my fiddling fingers when they say &QL; 
I could make prayers or poems on and on. &QL; 
If I had wheels or love, I would be gone.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Open Question,'' Miller pondered the concern people may
have about health problems: &QL; 
``Do they die from being thin? &QL; 
Do they they die from being fat? &QL; 
Never mind. Their common sin &QL; 
Is their marching onward flat- &QL; 
footedly to waste their wealth. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Do they die of cancer sneaking &QL; 
through their cells? Or from the treason &QL; 
riddling their own hearts? While reeking &QL; 
of it, mortals pour as season, &QL; 
preservative from mortal filth, &QL; 
their intolerable concern for their health?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Quarry,'' Miller ruminated about her feelings about
God: &QL; 
``What are you, then my love, my friend, my father, &QL; 
My anybody-never-mine? Whose aim &QL; 
Can wing you with a knowledge-bullet, tame &QL; 
You long enough to term you fur or feather? &QL; 
Labeled one species, you become another &QL; 
Before I have pronounced your latest name. &QL; 
My fingers itching after you, like flame &QL; 
Melting to frost, you vanish into neither. &QL; 
Face, mind, heart held in honor for your sake, &QL; 
Magical creature none can ever snare, &QL; 
Are but the trails you beat, the arcs you shake &QL; 
Among the leaves _ the bird no longer there.'' &QL;

BUSY `BELLY' MORE LIKE A MUSIC VIDEO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Belly'' may star rappers DMX, Nas, T-Boz and Method Man, but
this film is really all about someone never seen on screen, its
director, Hype Williams.
</P>
<P>
   I've not seen all feature-film debuts by music-video directors.
Of those I've seen, this is the least like a feature film and the
most like a music video.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the film lives moment to moment is putting it
gently. One is reminded of scenes in old westerns where the outlaw
uses branches to obliterate his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' direction is extremely busy _ memory-intensive, to
employ a computer metaphor. You might not have enough RAM to retain
what happened 30 seconds before (or you might not care whether you
remember).
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the 'hood are Tommy (DMX) and Sincere (Nas). They
drift into the drug business, have each other's backs as brothers.
But we soon see how a fundamental difference in character will
affect their relationship, possibly tragically.
</P>
<P>
   Centered Sincere has a wife and child, reads self-improvement
books and intends to leave the drug business. Jagged-edged Tommy
wants money, power and is willing to do what it takes to get them.
He likes the drug business. It wires him.
</P>
<P>
   As for lighting a set, Williams isn't interested in helping us
make out what objects are, nor the boring, middle of the color
spectrum. He likes filters, very wide-angle lenses, slow motion,
freeze frames, white-flash frames, smear effects and double
exposures. Hey, he's a music video director.
</P>
<P>
   When we'd just like see the characters, sort them out and track
what they're doing, it seems show-offy. At other times, Williams'
fluency pays off. The scenes of violence _ there are many _ have an
apt, clinical coldness. One, taking place in a Jamaican drug lord's
mansion, is interestingly surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams certainly has an eye. And on the occasions when his
directorial proclivities intersect storytelling needs, he can be
effective. Perhaps in his next film, he will prioritize story and
actors above himself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Belly'' &QL; 
Starring: DMX, Nas, Method Man, T-Boz &QL; 
Rating: R (for strong violence, language, sexuality and drug use.) &QL;

PETITE PONIES SPARK JOY IN PROGRAM FOR DISABLED CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  EDITORS: Photo available on New York Times photo service. 
 
By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six-year-old Kirsten McDuffie squirmed in her wheelchair, paying
little attention to the activity in a pasture behind her family's
Tomball, Texas, home.
</P>
<P>
   Then her mother, Staci Heine, plucked her from the wheelchair
and placed her atop a shaggy moppet of a horse standing less than 3
feet tall. Kirsten flashed a smile, dark eyes shining as she blew
through her lips in satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Success. A reaction from Kirsten, who doesn't talk and seldom
responds to people around her.
</P>
<P>
   The miniature horses are ``about the only thing she really
responds to,'' said her stepfather, David Heine.
</P>
<P>
   Staci Heine hopes to re-create that experience for disabled
children across the Houston area through a national program known
as Personal Ponies Ltd., which provides miniature horses as
companions for kids with a variety of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all kids grow up wanting a pony,'' Heine said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the program, started a dozen years ago by a
veteran racehorse breeder, is that the gentle, pint-size horses can
bring joy, even opportunities for learning, to disabled children.
</P>
<P>
   The horses are United Kingdom miniature Shetlands, a separate
breed from American Shetland ponies, said Marianne Alexander, who
started the program on her Greystone Farms in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not beautiful,'' she said of the breed. ``They look
like those little troll dolls. They're wide, round and low to the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But they're strong _ capable of pulling four adults in a cart _
and most important, they're good-natured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so sweet and kind,'' Alexander said. ``They will stand
next to a child for hours on end, to be brushed and braided and
hugged, sort of like the Velveteen Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The horses grow to about 34 inches tall _ 28 to 30 inches is
considered ideal for a small child in a wheelchair _ and Heine said
they're far more solicitous of people than their full-size
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big ones, they don't care if they step on you,'' she said.
``The little ones are much more gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   Heine, who grew up in Rosenberg, Texas, had always loved horses.
When she and her husband moved to a semirural area of Tomball last
year, she got the opportunity to indulge.
</P>
<P>
   She now has three full-size horses, along with a full complement
of cats, dogs, rabbits, chickens, guineas and a rooster.
</P>
<P>
   Then she decided that a Shetland pony would be nice for her
kids: In addition to Kirsten, she has three other daughters, Tori
McDuffie, 4, and Melody and Becky Heine, who are 21 months and 9
months, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So she did the modern thing _ she hopped onto the Internet for
information. That led her to Alexander and Personal Ponies Ltd.,
and Heine found a project that touched her heart.
</P>
<P>
   She thought not just of Kirsten but of her first-grade
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many handicapped kids I've met in her class,''
Heine said. ``I think it will help.''
</P>
<P>
   She now is training two horses for placement, donated by a
miniature horse farm in Brenham, and is waiting for a mare and
stallion to use as breeding stock, donated by people who heard
about the program and liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Heine estimates it costs about $1 a day to care for the
miniature horses, including feed, veterinarian and farrier bills.
The horses also need a stable or shed to protect them from the
weather. She hopes to find volunteers who can keep the horses for
children who don't have a place for them.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides the horses at no cost to disabled children,
to be kept as long as the child benefits from the relationship.
Alexander said there are no limits on the types of disabilities;
horses have been paired with children who are autistic, blind,
mentally retarded and terminally ill, among other disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some children keep the horses into adulthood, she said, while
others have them only briefly. And while some are able to be
actively engaged _ riding the horses, harnessing them to carts,
brushing and caring for them _ others simply draw pleasure from
their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander started the program in memory of her brother, who had
epilepsy and died at the age of 13, after a childhood during which
he always wanted a horse. That was decades ago _ Alexander is in
her late 60s now _ but she never forgot what her brother told their
father just before he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know, I never got a pony.' I don't want to be
maudlin, but I think I offer ponies to children in his memory,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Personal Ponies Ltd. has chapters in most states and in Canada.
Alexander said there are several chapters in Texas, but Heine is
the first to offer the program in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Families are screened to make sure they are able to care for the
horses, Alexander said, and they are required to submit annual
reports, signed by a veterinarian, certifying that the horse is
well-tended and in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Heine received her first two miniature horses _ both geldings,
named MCC Rising Star and MCC Every Child's Dream _ in late
September, and hopes to have them ready to place with a child
soon. &QL;

CHILEAN WINES ARE GOOD VALUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine grapes were grown in Chile as far back as the mid-16th
century, but it wasn't until the mid-19th century that modern
viticulture really took hold. Coincidentally, that was about the
same time that the California wine industry got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Although neighbor Argentina produces four times as much wine,
today Chile is a major global player because of savvier marketing.
In the past 15 years, Chile has made a niche in the world market
with well-made, low-priced wines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Chile's wines are made in the central part of the
country, with most of the important regions being not too far south
of the capital of Santiago. The climate is virtually ideal, with
warm days during growing season, and nights cooled by Pacific
breezes. The four major varietals grown in Chile are cabernet
sauvignon and merlot for reds, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc for
whites, although other varietals are cropping up on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tasted a wide skein of wines from three Chilean
producers, and the wines generally lived up to their reputation _
with a few disappointments. If some of the vintage years below seem
too early, remember that in Chile, harvest is in March and April
because the seasons are reversed. So, yes, there are some 1998
Chilean wines already here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vina Tarapaca &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Correa has been a winemaker for nearly 30 years, although
he doesn't look that venerable. He's been with Vina Tarapaca since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chile,'' he said, ``to become an enologist, a winemaker,
you must get a degree in agronomy first. Because to make quality
wine, it is a mixture between vineyards and winery.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all successful winemakers, Correa travels to look and
learn. Hence, in addition to the usual Big Four wines at Vina
Tarapaca, he's also experimenting with syrah (``it has excellent
potential in Chile'') and viognier, both of them Rhone varietals.
In addition to his very well-made sauvignon blanc, he's also making
one in the herbaceous style of New Zealand's Cloudy Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Vina Tarapaca's wines generally offer excellent value. The
``regular'' bottlings retail for $7, the Riservas for $10. Vina
Tarapaca is marketed in the United States by Beringer Wine Estates.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a brief rundown:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; 1998 Vina Tarapaca Sauvignon Blanc _ 4 stars to 4 { stars _
very nice wine, with only a hint of herbs and with a bracing
grapefruit quality. Excellent with grilled mahi mahi at Brennan's.
</P>
<P>
   1998 Vina Tarapaca Chardonnay _ 4 stars _ a well-integrated
blend of wine made partially in stainless steel tanks, and 25
percent barrel-fermented. Good fruit and balance.
</P>
<P>
   1997 Vina Tarapaca Riserva Chardonnay _ 4 stars _ pretty oaky
(100 percent barrel-fermented), but fruit does come through. I much
preferred the regular chardonnay, but this style is very popular
and this is a well-made wine.
</P>
<P>
   I found most of the reds to be less successful overall, but
perhaps the youth of the vines is why.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Vina Tarapaca Merlot _ 3 stars _ simple cherry flavors,
with no astringent oak intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Vina Tarapaca Riserva Merlot _ 3 { stars _ a bit more
complex, with more plum nuances.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Vina Tarapaca Cabernet Sauvignon _ 3 stars _ simple black
cherry flavor, and again, no oak distractions.
</P>
<P>
   1994 Vina Tarapaca Riserva Cabernet Sauvignon _ 4 stars to 4 {
stars _ from an older vineyard, this is a yummy wine, with
mouth-filling fruit and just the right amount of oak.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Errazuriz
</P>
<P>
   While much of Chile's winegrowing is south of Santiago, a major
area is the Aconcagua Valley 60 miles north of the capital. It was
there in 1870 that Don Maximiano Errazuriz founded his winery in
1870. Today, fifth-generation descendant Eduardo Chadwick runs the
winery, as well as a joint venture with California's Robert Mondavi
called Caliterra. More on that in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Izquierdo is the viticulturist at Errazuriz, and over
lunch at Solero we tasted a slew of wines. Izquierdo said the
climate of the Aconcagua Valley is stable due to the Andes to the
east and the Pacific to the west, ``and they haven't moved in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   1997 Errazuriz Sauvignon Blanc _ 2 { stars _ a tart, acidic,
almost sour white wine. It was more attractive when paired with
food. About $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Errazuriz Chardonnay _ 3 { stars _ a solid version of the
popular white wine; $8.99.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Errazuriz Riserva Chardonnay _ 3 { stars to 4 stars _
bigger, fuller, and more expensive at $15.99.
</P>
<P>
   1997 Errazuriz Merlot _ 4 stars _ good fruit and structure; nice
wine at $8.99.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Errazuriz Cabernet Sauvignon _ 4 { stars _ really tasty,
balanced red wine; a steal at $8.99.
</P>
<P>
   1995 Errazuriz Riserva Cabernet Sauvignon _ 4 stars _ good,
solid wine, with black currant notes; about $15.99.
</P>
<P>
   We also tasted Errazuriz's top wine named for the founder, the
1994 Don Maximiano Riserva Cabernet, which was both excellent and
sold out. The 1995 version is due presently, and since Izquierdo
touted the 1995 vintage as one of the best ever, it'll be
interesting to see if Errazuriz hits it out of the park again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Caliterra
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Chadwick joined with Napa Valley's Franciscan Vineyards
and created a brand called Caliterra. However, Izquierdo said, that
association didn't last long. So in 1991 Chadwick teamed up 50-50
with Napa's Robert Mondavi in a new version of Caliterra.
</P>
<P>
   While Errazuriz is 100 percent family-owned and estate-bottled,
Caliterra, while planting a lot of acreage and building a new
winery facility, relies on a lot of contracts with growers.
</P>
<P>
   We tasted just a few Caliterra wines, including:
</P>
<P>
   1996 Caliterra Riserva Chardonnay _ 3 { stars _ solid
chardonnay, 'nuff said; about $10.99.
</P>
<P>
   1996 Caliterra Merlot _ 3 { stars _ again, a solid effort, with
no astringency in the aftertaste; about $7.99.
</P>
<P>
   1995 Caliterra Riserva Cabernet Sauvignon _ 4 { stars _ mercy,
what a tasty bottle of cabernet, with plums and cassis out the
wazoo; terrific bargain at $10.99.
</P>
<P>
   Both Errazuriz and Caliterra are handled here by Glazer's.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, there were many more hits than misses with these
Chilean wines, and they continue to offer great values to their
American customers.

CUBA'S KORDA SHOWS A REVOLUTION FOR THE FUN OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Visiting the United States for the first time in
nearly 40 years, Alberto Korda was surprised at the strange rules
and regulations Americans take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No smoking,'' he said with a delighted laugh, waving his
cigarette in the air. ``There's no smoking in this country!''
</P>
<P>
   If he exaggerates, it's only in the interests of a good story.
And if there's one thing the father figure of Cuban photography
knows how to do, it's tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   Korda, 70, was in town during the weekend for the opening of a
retrospective exhibit of his work at Photographic Center Northwest.
It was organized by Darrel Couturier, who opened the show last
month at his Los Angeles gallery and served as Korda's translator
during his Seattle visit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Korda's name is little known outside Cuba, one of his
photographs has become a 20th-century icon, a black-and-white shot
of Che Guevara taken at a state funeral in 1960, a year after Fidel
Castro and Guevara overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista
and took over the island country.
</P>
<P>
   Korda didn't plan on being the official photographer of the
revolution. In the early 1950s, he was greatly enamored of the work
of American fashion photographer Richard Avedon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd look at his work in Harper's Bazaar and say to myself,
`This man is a god!''' The exhibit at Photographic Center Northwest
includes a healthy portion of Korda's fashion shots, modeled after
Avedon. While the same sleek and dramatic angles prevail, Korda's
work is warmer. His models lack the haughty glamour of their North
American peers. Instead of staring blankly in front of them, they
sizzle and flirt shamelessly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about this difference, he shrugged philosophically. ``I am
a macho Cuban man born with a lot of sexuality. A smile from a
woman is a wonderful thing.'' I met Avedon. He's uglier than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, Avedon had a suggestion. ``He told me to mix
fashion with revolution. I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it intentionally but might as well have. Korda
gravitates toward the glamorous and the upbeat. When Castro and his
men were taking over the country, Korda presented them as chic good
fellows. His photos of rebel encampments in the hills could be
documenting a picnic instead of a revolution, a picnic with guns.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution, Castro noticed the young fashion
photographer. Appreciating the sort of visual record he provided,
Castro asked him to continue. Since then, Korda has had complete
access to the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never told me not to take a photo,'' said Korda. ``It
was always up to me. I know by instinct what kind of photo to take.
Fidel is a big man, but he has skinny legs. When I shot him at the
beach, I waited until he'd walked far enough into the water so that
his legs didn't show.''

   All of Korda's prints are black and white. This is partly due to
taste but mostly to necessity. To this day, said Korda, Cuban
newspapers don't have the capacity to print in color.
</P>
<P>
   Some Korda photos of his friend and leader are too personal for
public consumption. One of Korda's favorites in this category
caught Castro in the Kremlin in his long underwear. A Russian had
just told him that the table in front of him once belonged to
Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Catherine the Great's table?' Smiling, he put his
feet up on it and leaned back in his chair, cigar in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro is by all accounts a good athlete, but the show at
Photographic Center Northwest presents him in some of his less
glorified moments. He embodies a classic duffer stance on the golf
course, and the photo beside it shows Guevara on the same day at
the same course laughing. Castro was giving him plenty to laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   When skiing in Russia, Castro quickly assumed the prone
position. Korda caught him lying down and grinning helplessly at
the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Another famous photograph presents Castro shaking hands with
Ernest Hemingway. On one level, it's a typical shot of two famous
people greeting each other surrounded by adoring multitudes. But
Korda found depths beneath the surface. These two monumental male
egos can't help using the handshake as a power struggle. As the
camera clicked, the pair seemed to be trying to pin each other to
the mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an emotional moment for Fidel,'' remembered Korda.
``He loved Hemingway's writing. Notice the black tape on Fidel's
thumb. He cut it fishing for marlin. It was a contest, and he won.
A capitalist journalist suggested he won because a Russian
submarine attached the biggest fish to Fidel's line.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda is proud of his most famous photo, showing the young
Guevara at his most saintly and monumental. ``Che didn't like to be
photographed. He moved to the front of the funeral to look at the
crowd. In a moment, he had moved away.'' Korda liked the print and
pinned it to his studio wall.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian book publisher saw it during a visit in 1967 and
asked for a copy. Korda gave it as a gift. When Guevara died later
that year, the publisher printed millions of posters featuring it
and distributed them throughout Europe and the United States,
without giving Korda credit.
</P>
<P>
   He never got a dime for the image, which has been reproduced on
everything from T-shirts to flags and buttons. ``I'm proud of it.
My great-grandchildren will point to it and remember me. It's a
symbol of this century. Whenever there's a strike or protest
against injustice, that image appears. An Italian critic called it
the 20th-century's `Mona Lisa.' Che would have liked that. All the
women told him he was beautiful.''

SPRING FASHION: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COLOR THEY PROMISED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEy  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Color. They promised us color. And gray cleverly
described as baby blue is not color.
</P>
<P>
   Spring '99 fashions were going to be colorful. Women's Wear
Daily said so. So did Donna Karan, one of the New York designers
who jumped the gun and showed her collection early, just before she
visited Seattle in September to show her fall collection.
</P>
<P>
   Karan, known for her black on black collections with an
occasional dab of navy or brown thrown in, bragged that she had
used more than 30 different colors for spring '99.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of designers previewing their collections here
this week to fashion retailers and media are barely giving color a
lick.
</P>
<P>
   Take Max Azria, designer for the BCBG line. He sees spring as a
gray season. But he calls it ``nickel.'' He dished out a little
``burlap,'' heather gray, and more nickel, with spoonfuls of
``sand'' and mauve to sweeten things up. Black and ``carbon'' were
very visible.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 57th item in the show _ out of 64 total _
that there was any noticeable color _ a lavender camisole under a
geranium-red satin organza coat. It looked good enough to eat.
There was even a geranium evening gown _ an extraganza of tulle and
beads _ to end the show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pale palette, Azria produced a fascinating
collection of sportswear as evening attire. He put embroidered
aprons, often chiffon, over capri pants and T-shirts. A cropped
trouser (that means several inches above the ankles) was shown with
beaded leggings and a tulle shell. A funnel neck top _ a style
usually reserved for cotton-fleece gym wear _ was done in silk
taffeta.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this was not a collection of wear-to-work
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allard, designer for the Ellen Tracy label, is known for
being a friend to working women. That friendship could be strained
come spring.
</P>
<P>
   Like other designers here, she's into navel-displays. She's also
fond of strapless camisoles, as in camisoles prone to sliding down
over the breasts of models as they walked the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Allard has also opted for a neutral palette: Ivory, a gray she
calls ``mist,'' a tan she calls ``nude,'' silver, charcoal and
mocha. Although there are some serious gaps between tops and
bottoms in this collection, there are some very wearable pants,
jackets and skirts that could be paired-up and worn without
embarrassment in public. It wasn't until the finale that some color
appeared. But the coral looked more like watered-down orange
sherbet, and the shocking pinks were truly shocking, the sort of
memorable clothes that can be worn only once before they become
``Oh, here comes Lulu in her pink dress'' fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Allard's drawstring skirts and pants were slung way below the
navel. The good news is drawstrings make them very adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine some of these navel-baring,
see-through evening clothes out in public. Even at PONCHO, that
glamorous Seattle party where almost anything goes, it would take
courage to appear in some of these costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beene, one of the oldest, most establlished designers
in New York, knows how to give women glamour and coverage. His
clothes for spring are sublime and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his show with jersey tank-top dresses done in two
colors _ pink with yellow, or lavender with gray, for example. A
slim red skirt had a pale green linen top.
</P>
<P>
   Another dress looked like a Mondrian painting with blocks of
color outlined in black.
</P>
<P>
   When a garment didn't have color, the accessories did. Beene put
red and green gloves with a navy dress. A black dress was
ornamented with day-glo orange cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chic. Tres chic.

`BELLY' BUCKS TREND, MAY ALTER STEREOTYPE OF YOUNG BLACK MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you might think a movie genre is tired, dead and
there's not one more idea can be squeezed from it, along comes a
film that adheres to the formula but challenges and tweaks it too.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Belly,'' a stylish, visually gorgeous and tough
film about two black friends, Tommy (DMX) and Sincere (Nas), who
come from the same place but want different things in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we were kids we were like Butch and Sundance. We'd do
whatever for the dollar,'' says Sincere in a voice-over
introduction. So, OK, sure, we've heard it a million times. His
pal, Tommy Brown, desires power, money and women and he doesn't
care who he has to kill or what he needs to sell to attain it.
</P>
<P>
   Sincere just wants to provide for his love, Tionne (Tionne
``T-Boz'' Watkins), and their baby, Kenya. He does what he needs to
do in order to make a living. These two best friends move through a
world of violence, drugs, sex, guns, prison and imminent death
before coming to the same conclusion: Life is what you make it and
knowledge and self-respect are everything.
</P>
<P>
   But getting out isn't as easy as getting in. Black men are a
dime a dozen in this Queens ghetto and there is always another
brother coming up through the ranks who is eager to kill if someone
steps into his territory. Because Tommy has never cared about lines
of demarcation, he's constantly in hot water and eventually lands
in jail. Only a miracle will save him and, ultimately, a disguised
miracle occurs.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what makes ``Belly'' unique and worthwhile. There is
a real rite of passage these two young men go through in order to
find themselves, and for once the payoff isn't death.
</P>
<P>
   Writer and director Hype Williams is to be commended for making
something fresh out of shopworn material, although he writes with a
hammy, heavy fist, and many of the messages that ``Belly'' delivers
garnered unintentional laughter, even at the press screening.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more pluses than minuses. Williams has cast a
bunch of multiplatinum rap artists in the lead roles and, despite
moments of self-consciousness and the fact that the dialogue is
garbled and hard to understand, they're mostly enjoyable in their
film debuts. Williams also had the good sense to use Malik Sayeed,
Spike Lee's most recent cinematographer, who paints the screen with
vivid colors and wild visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belly'' ends on the eve of the new millennium and, as one
character proclaims, ``God will finally begin to overcome evil.''
If ``Belly'' is an indicator, the cinema's stereotyping of young
black men may also change.
</P>
<P>
   Belly. Directed and written by Hype Williams. Cast: DMX, Nas,
Taral Hicks, Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins. Artisan Entertainment. 95
minutes. Rated R for violence, language, sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

ENTERTAINING BY THE BOOK: DON'T OBSESS ABOUT HOUSE AND FOOD! ENJOY
FRIENDS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Parties are more casual and informal than they used to be, but
they still require planning. If hiring a caterer is not an option,
take some tips from expert party-givers. Make lists, budget your
time and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice we've heard in years came from chef,
restaurateur and cookbook author Hugh Carpenter: Simplify. Focus on
enjoying your friends. Don't obsess about the house or the food.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Carpenter and his wife, food photographer
Teri Sandison, downsized their routine for entertaining. They give
relaxed Saturday or Sunday morning breakfasts, brunches or early (5
p.m.) dinner parties. They request that guests bring a prepared
dish _ appetizer, salad, bread or dessert _ to supplement the
entree. Guests can make something at home or pick up a specialty
item at a deli or supermarket; it should require no more than a
brief reheating.
</P>
<P>
   If you are preparing the food, shop early, prepare as much as
possible the day before and make it easy on yourself any way you
can. Strive for what Martha Gill calls ``casual elegance'' in her
new book, ``Modern Parties.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll know you've succeeded if you've had as good a time as
your guests and you feel encouraged to throw another party.

   Food and Beverages &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Make use of takeout, caterers and supermarket takeaway. Make one
thing and buy the rest. Have things delivered. Ask the liquor store
for advice on drinks, stocking the bar and how much to order.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare enough, but not too much food. Focus on a three-course
meal. Most people overdo. Allow eight appetizers or pieces per
person if serving dinner, 12 pieces per person if you are serving
only appetizers. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Ask guests to bring favorite dishes for a potluck supper or
holiday brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of serving snacks in one big bowl, divide them among a
few colorful bowls, decorative glass containers or small baskets
lined with napkins. Arrange individual servings of crackers, nuts,
chips and pretzels on small plates. Set them out next to chairs,
couches and benches. Figure that each adult will consume one to two
handfuls of nuts or chips and two to four individual servings of
finger foods. _ ``Simplify Entertaining''
</P>
<P>
   Don't put snacks on the bar. That's where everyone congregates,
and if guests find food there, they'll never leave. _ ``Simplify
Entertaining''
</P>
<P>
   Plan at least one or two vegetarian dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Add a mound of cluster tomatoes on the vine to a relish tray. Or
just wash, pull off the stems and put them out in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For dips, set out small bowls of barbecue sauce, a sour
cream-horseradish mixture, honey mustard, Russian dressing and
ketchup. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Purchase a coffee carafe or thermos in which to store hot
coffee, so you will always have two pots available. Make one pot
ahead of time, pour it in the carafe and put it on the table so
people can help themselves. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Make a pot of regular and a pot of decaf coffee; many people
prefer decaf, especially in the evening. Be sure to label
coffeepots or carafes.
</P>
<P>
   For a buffet, offer mostly nonalcoholic drinks _ fresh juices,
flavored teas, coffees, hot chocolate and bottled waters. For many
parties, wine, beer and perhaps champagne are sufficient. For more
than 30 guests, consider hiring a bartender. _ ``The Buffet Book''
</P>
<P>
   To chill a bottle quickly, fill a bucket or deep container with
ice. Add enough water so that when the bottle or cans are
submerged, the water climbs at least halfway up the sides of the
beverage containers. _ ``Simplify Entertaining''

<P>
   Planning Tips &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An open house is a good idea for a holiday party because you can
invite more people than you could for a dinner party. Guests can
come and go to suit their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Before cleaning the house, declutter. Get some big boxes or
plastic containers. Put clothes in one, papers in another, books
and magazines in another. Hide the boxes in the garage, laundry
room or somewhere out of sight until the party's over. _ ``Keeping
Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Keep a fully stocked first-aid kit and fire extinguisher on
hand. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   If pressed for time before the party, clean only the rooms that
will be used. Be sure all bathrooms are clean and have plenty of
supplies. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flowers for a centerpiece, put a nice bowl or basket
of peppers, citrus, artichokes, squash, fruits or nuts on the
table. _ ``Keeping Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, decorate with pine cones in a cut-glass bowl, shiny
apples in a big wooden dish, autumn leaves on the table with Indian
corn and unusual gourds; in December, use evergreen boughs with
votive candles or shiny tree ornaments in a basket. _ ``Keeping
Entertaining Simple''
</P>
<P>
   Use good-looking plastic ``evergreens'' or presentable boughs
from an old artificial tree as decorations. Many people are
allergic to the real thing.

   Liquor
</P>
<P>
   The amount people drink depends on the time of day and type of
party. For an open house or cocktail party, use these estimates:
</P>
<P>
   1 (750-milliliter) bottle 21 (1 {-ounce) drinks
</P>
<P>
   If entertaining for the evening, figure 6 guests will have a
total of 12 to 18 drinks 1 to 2 (750-milliliter) bottles.
</P>
<P>
   If entertaining 12 people, plan on an average of 36 to 48 drinks
3 (750-milliliter) bottles.
</P>
<P>
   If entertaining 25 people, figure 50 to 75 drinks 4 to 5
(750-milliliter) bottles.
</P>
<P>
   These figures are based on 17 (1 {-ounce) jiggers to 1
(750-milliliter) bottle. They may be generous because people don't
drink as much hard liquor as they used to and some guests may be
the designated drivers.

</P>
<P>
   Beer
</P>
<P>
   Offer a variety of imported and domestic types. Consider having

<P>
   Ice
</P>
<P>
   To serve 25 at a cocktail buffet, you will need 1 large bag of

   Throw a color party. Send out invitations in your child's
favorite color and call it a ``purple party,'' for example. Ask
guests to dress in purple; decorate the cake or cupcakes with
purple frosting; and buy purple balloons, plates and napkins. Find
some purple party favors. Have purple face paint ready. Pull out
paper, purple markers, purple paint and smocks. _ ``Keeping

ENTERTAINING BY THE BOOK: DON'T OBSESS ABOUT HOUSE AND FOOD! ENJOY
FRIENDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Parties are more casual and informal than they used to be, but
they still require planning. If hiring a caterer is not an option,
take some tips from expert party-givers. Make lists, budget your
time and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice we've heard in years came from chef,
restaurateur and cookbook author Hugh Carpenter: Simplify. Focus on
enjoying your friends. Don't obsess about the house or the food.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Carpenter and his wife, food photographer
Teri Sandison, downsized their routine for entertaining. They give
relaxed Saturday or Sunday morning breakfasts, brunches or early (5
p.m.) dinner parties. They request that guests bring a prepared
dish _ appetizer, salad, bread or dessert _ to supplement the
entree. Guests can make something at home or pick up a specialty
item at a deli or supermarket; it should require no more than a
brief reheating.
</P>
<P>
   If you are preparing the food, shop early, prepare as much as
possible the day before and make it easy on yourself any way you
can. Strive for what Martha Gill calls ``casual elegance'' in her
new book, ``Modern Parties.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll know you've succeeded if you've had as good a time as
your guests and you feel encouraged to throw another party.

   Lemon Chicken Meatballs
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Buffet Book'' by Carole Peck (Viking, $29.95). Good
as an appetizer or as an entree with pasta, rice or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts &QL; 
10 to 12 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed, cut into
cubes &QL; 
3 cups whipping cream &QL; 
6 egg whites &QL; 
9 anchovy fillets in oil &QL; 
Juice and chopped zest (thinnest colored part of peel only) of 2
lemons &QL; 
1 cup chopped flatleaf parsley &QL; 
 &QL; 
{ cup capers, drained &QL; 
1 teaspoon each: freshly ground black pepper and nutmeg &QL; 
Coarse salt to taste &QL; 
2 quarts chicken stock or water &QL; 
3 tablespoons cornstarch or arrowroot diluted in { cup water &QL; 
Chopped chives or parsley &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remove excess fat and tendons from chicken; cut into 2-inch
cubes. Set aside. Put bread cubes in large bowl, pour cream over
them and let them soak 30 minutes. In 3 batches, in a food
processor, coarsely grind chicken with egg whites. Remove to a
large mixing bowl. Add anchovies, zest, parsley, capers, pepper,
nutmeg and salt to food processor, and pulse briefly to mix. Pour
over soaked bread and knead. Add bread mixture to ground chicken;
mix quickly but thoroughly with your hands or large spoon. Form
into meatballs 1 { inches in diameter. You should have about 50.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stock to boiling in large pot that is 3 to 4 inches deep,
such as a poaching pan. Drop in 1 or 2 test meatballs and cook 2 to
3 minutes, until they are light in color and float to the surface.
Taste for seasoning, correct if necessary and adjust cooking time.
Cook the rest of the meatballs in batches, lifting the finished
ones out with a skimmer; place in an ice bath to cool quickly.
Drain. Reserve poaching liquid.
</P>
<P>
   When all the meatballs are cooked, strain poaching liquid
through a fine mesh strainer into a 2-quart pot. To thicken sauce,
whisk in cornstarch and water mixture. Simmer, stirring
occasionally, about 20 minutes, until sauce is thickened and
smooth. Remove from heat and strain. Stir in lemon juice. Add
meatballs to reheat. Serve warm in the sauce sprinkled with chives
on small plates with foodpicks or hors d'oeuvres forks. Makes about
50.

   Pork Tenderloin and Chutney
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a recipe from Kathy Craft, caterer and owner of
Paulie's restaurant, 1834 Westheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients: &QL; 
2 ({-pound) boneless pork tenderloins (see note) &QL; 
{ cup each: sherry, soy sauce and oil (Craft uses olive oil) &QL; 
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice &QL; 
 &QL; 
1 (1-inch) piece of fresh ginger root &QL; 
3 garlic cloves &QL; 
1 medium onion, chopped &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place pork in large resealable plastic bag and marinate
overnight. Remove pork from bag, drain and grill on a hot grill,
rolling to mark on all sides. Remove to baking sheet and roast in
375-degree oven until done. (Craft uses an internal temperature of
140 degrees on a meat thermometer because the pork continues to
cook after it's removed from the oven.) Check pork after 10
minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Slice thinly on
diagonal.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with a spicy mustard, mustard sauce and cranberry chutney.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: If you use marinated pork loins that come two to a
package in the meat department at the supermarket, there's no need
to marinate them. Craft says you don't need to peel the ginger if
you chop it in a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Spicy Jones Cranberry Pepper Relish, available at Spec's Liquor
Warehouse, 2410 Smith, and other specialty food stores, is a good
accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Comfortable Entertaining,'' author Nathalie Dupree does a
similar marinated roast pork with a marinade of cup each sherry and
vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. She preheats the oven to
500 degrees and roasts the pork 11 to 15 minutes until the interior
registers 160 degrees on a meat thermometer. She lets the pork cool
10 minutes, slices it thinly and spreads it with chopped
room-temperature mango chutney (an 8-ounce jar).

   THE 1998 MID-TERM ELECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ Taking up where he left off
before the election, President Clinton planned Wednesday to ignore
the prospect of impeachment and focus on Social Security and the
other high-profile issues that served his party so well at the
polls. And now, he has more political capital to spend on push
them. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-COALITION _ WASHINGTON _ The basis of the Democrats'
election success was a coalition of black, Hispanic and women
voters. These groups, which all find something to dislike in top
Republican issues, represent a major challenge for the GOP as its
prepares for 2000. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ Talking to House Judiciary
committee members and others about what the election results mean

   ELECTION-GINGRICH _ ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich holds morning press
conference in Atlanta to discuss election. We'll see what he and
Rep. John Linder have to say about the results. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-POLLS _ WASHINGTON _ The election results may have been
a surprise to some people, but not America's leading pollsters, who
all claim they predicted the Democratic gains. They problem, they
say, is TV talking heads, who refused to let public opinion
research shake the inside-the-Beltway conventional wisdom that
Republicans would gain seats. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-INTERESTS _ WASHINGTON _ How are the big-money special
interests _ tobacco, health care, gambling and political giving
itself _ likely to fare as a result of Tuesday elections? (Malone,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-GRAMM _ WASHINGTON _ With the defeat of Alfonse D'Amato
in New York, Phil Gramm of Texas rises to the chairmanship of the
Senate Banking Committee. What this could mean to the financial
services industry and consumers. (Harlan, Cox News Service).

were defeated. (Moscoso, Cox News Service).

Cruise's failure to get a Blockbuster card last week because he
could not produce satisfactory ID to please the store's clerk; and
how the couple won a judgement last week, against a tabloid

WAKE UP AND SMELL THE POLITICAL REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I had the strangest dream Tuesday night. A
no-apologies liberal was re-elected senator in California. A
Democratic friend of labor was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Monica issue flopped. Across the nation, right-wing
Republicans were left clutching their Starr reports. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., attempted to tear his hair
out, or at least loosen it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats started talking about bringing back George McGovern in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Then I woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal'' was still a dirty word, despite the victorious
Barbara Boxer's pride in being one.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Boxer, the Democratic senator from California, what
advice she would give her Republican challenger, Matt Fong, if he
were to run for office again, she said: ``I'd say, `Matt, find
where your heart is. Is it with Lou Sheldon, or is it with
Stonewall? You need to know, because these are very different
places for your heart.'''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if Fong knew where his head is. Fong, who described
himself as ``moderate,'' gave $50,000 to an anti-gay, anti-abortion
group headed by the Rev. Lou Sheldon. After numerous flubbed
explanations, he had his mom do an advertisement for him.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown wasn't as kind to Fong as Boxer
was, saying, ``We're sending Matt Fong back to his mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics is still a rough business.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has always led with her heart and stuck by her beliefs.
But just a few weeks ago she looked beaten. That was until the San
Francisco Examiner exposed Fong's donation to Sheldon's anti-gay
group, and Boxer paid for a barrage of powerful negative
advertising portraying Fong as a guy who'd put toxic waste in kids'
lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Money still ruled in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts didn't. Americans don't like nuts in office unless they're
endearing or they're pro wrestlers. It was clear to many voters
that the Republican Party had lost its Reagan geniality, and turned
narrow and mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had no program and no ideas beyond saving the
lives of those not born yet; the heck with the lives of you, me and
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican program was a Monica obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really sick of the scandal,'' said San Francisco
Treasurer Susan Leal, who was at the Boxer victory party. ``They
ask, `What are you doing for my health care? What are you doing for
my children's education?''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia C. Wang, a vice chairwoman of the California Democratic
Party, did something for some children's education. She took 60
high school students walking precincts last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said was, `None of you have ever lived under a
Democratic governor. What you don't understand is that the
Republicans have spent 16 years demolishing the educational system,
so this is your chance to rebuild it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a dream last night that we woke up from eight years of
Gov. Pete Wilson, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   What a nightmare, this wedge-wielder. He tried to become
president using one wedge issue after another, from punishing
illegal immigrants to ending affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   All he did was mess up California, his hopes for the White
House, the Republican Party and Republican Attorney General Dan
Lungren's chance of becoming governor. Of course, Lungren looked
just a little too extreme, especially compared to the cool, gray
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco political consultant Don Solem said of the two big
California races: ``Boxer defined Fong. Fong didn't define himself.
Davis defined himself. Lungren didn't define Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds definitive, but there's more to it, as Solem noted.
Voters wanted leaders who are ``steady and true.''
</P>
<P>
   No nuts, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to have been a fly on the wall as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, Lott, and House Republican leader Dick Armey and other
right-wingers watched the election results roll in.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if they prayed for guidance or swore up a storm. I
think I know.
</P>
<P>
   I had a dream last night that Kenneth Starr went away.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Tuesday afternoon, she
had exit polls showing Democratic victories across the land. Still,
she said, the Republicans would press on with impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe these right-wing Republicans. They get
their orders like this from the Christian Coalition,'' she said,
waving the exit poll data as if it were right-wing marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a dream, that election night scene. The crowd at
Boxer's party had a surprising number of young people. Maybe young
people find something admirable in a woman politician who stands up
for what she believes. Maybe they don't think of her as ``pushy''
the way so many older men do.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer talked too much, causing some television stations to
switch to Lungren's concession speech. That's excusable. Then she
danced and pumped her fists. No one would be asking the same old
question about whether she is too close to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They'll all disappoint us, and liberals will be the most
disappointed because they expect so much.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't a dream. Nothing in politics is. But it beats
those Newt nightmares we've been having.

BAD BOY OF LOUISIANA POLITICS IS FACING ANOTHER INDICTMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The first time federal prosecutors thought
they had former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards on the ropes, he
warned them not to underestimate him.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a meeting with the U.S. attorney preparing to prosecute
him for allegedly taking bribes to influence hospital licensing,
Edwards turned and said: ``Remember one thing. You need 12 votes.
All I need is one.'' In the end, the charismatic, silver-haired bad
boy of Bayou State politics charmed the New Orleans jury and got 11
votes. The jury deadlocked. At a second trial held two years later,
everyone voted to acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than a decade ago, but the colorful character who
combines arrogance with unstoppable charm remains a populist hero
in Louisiana even as he faces his most serious threat yet.
</P>
<P>
   After a drawn-out investigation, federal prosecutors have
extracted plea bargains from four of Edwards' friends and
associates who say the former governor illegally accepted huge sums
to help secure valuable riverboat casino licenses, then brazenly
hired a man to bug the homes of the very FBI agents who wiretapped
him.
</P>
<P>
   The case has riveted Louisianians, who are astonished that
people close to him would turn on Edwards, something unimagined in
30 years. And it grabbed national headlines because one friend, San
Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., gave up his team before
he pleaded guilty to making what he said was an illegal, $400,000
``extortion'' payment to Edwards. In cash.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' attorney has been told to expect an indictment, making
both fans and critics wonder if the former governor can keep his
record of invincibility intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules that apply to ordinary people do not fit me,'' the
71-year-old Edwards once boasted. Serving 16 years as a Democratic
governor, his relentless popularity in some quarters makes it
extremely difficult to convict him, said former U.S. Attorney John
Volz.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a sharecropper, Edwards was Louisiana's first Cajun
and first Catholic governor in modern times. More than once
declared washed up, he made two political comebacks to win the
governorship an unprecedented four times. A legendary womanizer,
Edwards never denied his liaisons. He would pointedly correct a
number if the estimate was too low.
</P>
<P>
   His friends and enemies both agree that Edwin Edwards was made
for the state's freewheeling politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand Louisianians,'' said Volz, who
prosecuted Edwards in 1983 and 1985. ``They want to be entertained
by their politicians. They don't tolerate corruption. They demand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear to all: Edwards is no hypocrite, whether it
comes to high-stakes gambling in Las Vegas, chasing skirts or
playing fast and loose with political ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Before his first trial, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' asked Edwards if he
had sold a seat on the state minerals board in 1971 for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was $45,000,'' was the governor's candid reply.
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to former aide Clyde Vidrine, Edwards added, ``I
think Clyde skimmed $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   As for seducing women, the legendary Cajun Casanova once
explained: ``Two out of 10 women will go to bed with you, but you
have to ask the other eight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him a `pelvic populist,''' said an old acquaintance,
Dr. Cason de la Houssaye of Crowley, a south Louisiana town of
15,000 deep in Cajun rice-growing country where Edwards began his
political career. ``He's never been a hypocrite. That's one of his
best features.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one sin in Louisiana politics _ being boring,''
de la Houssaye added. ``Edwin never was. He outdid them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Louisianians are surprised that federal prosecutors want to
put the rapscallion away.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 30 years, there have been numerous investigations
_ 20 grand juries by Edwards' count _ and the two trials.
</P>
<P>
   What has come as a jolt is that, for the first time in Edwards'
checkered career, close friends and associates have agreed to
testify against him in the extortion, racketeering and obstruction
of justice case.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are viewing with abject shock that Edwards' cohorts are
turning on him,'' said Gus Weill, who handled Edwards' political
advertising in an early gubernatorial race. ``No one had ever
turned on him before. Louisianians are astonished.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Riddle III, a Democratic state representative from
Edwards' central Louisiana hometown, Marksville, is not an Edwards
partisan. He said: ``The most common thought is, `I can't believe
he finally got caught.' But, after all these years, his friends are
starting to peel off.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   One of those ex-friends, DeBartolo, says he was pressured to
hand over $400,000 after Edwards warned that it would mean the
difference between him getting a riverboat casino license or not.
DeBartolo got the license but abandoned his $194 million Bossier
City resort project after being targeted by a grand jury
investigation last year. Pleading guilty, he was sentenced to two
years' probation and a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has not remained silent. He has maintained that he
operated legally as a paid consultant and that the authorities are
seeking revenge for having failed to nail him in the past. The
$400,000, seized from Edwards' home vault, was merely a consulting
fee, he said. Authorities kept the cash as evidence and wrote him a
check for the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor said it was not unusual for him to keep such
a large sum at home in case he needed it for a last-minute gambling
trip. Shooting craps has long been a favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Although allegations that Edwards accepted payoffs have caught
most of the attention, conspiring to bug the FBI agents' homes
might be the easiest to prove, Volz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edwards could say, `I was being paid as a consultant.' Then
why would you wiretap the federal government?'' Volz asked.
``Trying to wiretap the FBI is probably the most damning of all.
... That exposes the criminality of all this.''
</P>
<P>
   There would likely be no case at all if not for two private
prison contractors from Texas, brothers Patrick and Michael Graham,
one-time cronies of Edwards who were desperately seeking to
mitigate their own federal tax evasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Graham of Houston, whose legal scrapes include an
accusation that he took $150,000 to arrange a Texas prison escape
for a murderer, reportedly offered information on Edwards' casino
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In a bugged private jet, Graham finessed Edwards onto a flight
from Colorado, but the ex-governor gave nothing away.
Court-approved wiretapping was extended to Edwards' home and
office, eliciting comments on DeBartolo and others hoping to land
coveted casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was fined $25,000 and given a three-month sentence in
federal court in Houston on Oct. 1. His sentence would have been
longer had he not cooperated, his attorney told reporters. His
brother Michael was fined $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   In public, Edwards has exhibited little anguish and looks fit
for a man in his 70s. In meetings with reporters, he often steers
the conversation away from the investigation and toward earthier
subjects, such as his recent vasectomy reversal. His second wife,
34-year-old Candy Picou, would like to have children, Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Edwin Edwards would say he grew up dirt poor. His
father, Clarence ``Boboy'' Edwards, who had a third-grade
education, did work others' land at one time. But by the time
Edwards was playing trombone in the Marksville High School band,
his father was running a family grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was known as an argumentative, unathletic, but brilliant
student with striking good looks who hunted doves and worked after
school at Western Auto. He made no secret of his ambitions. He
confided to a friend, Raymond Laborde, the band's bassoonist and
later a state representative, that one day he'd be governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very smart, but as a 6-year-old I didn't want to
farm,'' Edwards would say years later. ``You have to work too hard.
I wanted to be a politician and a lawyer so I wouldn't have to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Agnes Brouillette, was pure Cajun and a devout Roman
Catholic. His father was half-Welsh, half-Cajun and a Protestant
who didn't object when Edwin began attending a small Nazarene
church.
</P>
<P>
   Though baptized a Catholic, the youth became a revival preacher
during his high school years, recalled Laborde, who watched his
friend enthrall worshippers with his polished delivery and grasp of
the Bible. He would later return to Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   His Cajun roots, his non-French name and his familiarity with
Protestant fundamentalism served him well as a populist candidate
in a state divided between conservative Protestants in the north
and Cajun Catholics in the south.
</P>
<P>
   And very early on, Edwards recognized the potential of the black
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was post-civil rights, a TV-era version of Huey and Earl
Long,'' said historian Wayne Parent of Louisiana State University,
who is an authority on Southern populism. It had been difficult
bringing blacks and whites together, but Edwards was the first in
Louisiana to do so, Parent said.
</P>
<P>
   After serving on the City Council in Crowley, he was elected to
the state Senate in 1964. A year later, when a congressman was
killed in a car crash, Edwards won a special election to the U.S.
House. He returned to run for governor as a reform candidate in
1971, building the coalition of Catholics, blacks and union labor
that he nurtured for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Edwards, it was an axiom of Louisiana politics that a
Catholic couldn't get elected governor and a Protestant couldn't
become mayor of New Orleans,'' said Jack Dalton Wardlaw, The
Times-Picayune's veteran Baton Rouge bureau chief.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Edwards appointed numerous blacks, including
prominent civil rights activists, to state boards and was always
accessible to African-Americans, who were voting in large numbers
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up inspiring more loyalty in them than they ever have
had for black candidates,'' said journalist John Maginnis, author
of two books on Edwards, ``The Last Hayride'' and ``Cross to
Bear.'' ``He treated them like equals and delivered on his
promises.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, he often received 80 percent or more of the black
vote.
</P>
<P>
   His background meshed perfectly with a Cajun cultural
resurgence, a new sense of ethnic pride that followed years when
children were punished for speaking French in school, Wardlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   When a fellow Cajun attacked him during the 1971 primary race,
Edwards disarmed him in a way that people still talk about.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent, Puggy Moity, claimed that Edwards was a ``tweetie
bird'' _ a homosexual _ which seems ludicrous now in view of
Edwards' well-grounded reputation as a serial philanderer of the
heterosexual persuasion. At their next joint appearance, Edwards
planted a wet kiss on Moity. The crowd loved it.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Edwards pushed through a new state constitution
that replaced one that had tied the Legislature in knots for half a
century. Income tax collection, a joke to many Louisianians, was
streamlined and enforced by a capable Edwards appointee.
</P>
<P>
   And he changed the way Louisiana collected tax on crude oil from
a flat rate per barrel to 12.5 percent of value. Few expected the
result. When oil prices boomed shortly afterward, it meant hundreds
of millions in extra revenue for the state _ money Edwards
liberally dispensed to build state-run charity hospitals, bridges
and highways, endearing him ever more deeply to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The budget soared in Edwards' first term to $4.5 billion from
$1.9 billion. The oil windfall financed Edwards' spending spree
while the middle class still paid very low taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an uncanny knowledge of government, how it worked, what
it could do,'' Wardlaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards served from 1972 to 1980. State law prevented a third
consecutive term. He reoccupied the governor's mansion from 1984 to
1988. Behind in the polls, he dropped out during the next election
but made a comeback in 1991, defeating white supremacist David
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all smooth sailing. Edwards admitted that his
family received $10,000 and an expensive dining table from South
Korean businessman Tongsun Park.
</P>
<P>
   After he questioned the resurrection of Christ in a candid but
sensational interview with former Shreveport Journal editor Stan
Tiner, he publicly backtracked to dampen the resulting Bible Belt
uproar. Then, in classic Edwards style, he reignited the furor by
appearing at a media roast with ketchup stigmata on the palms of
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The audacious Edwards considered himself so popular, he told
reporters during his 1983 campaign, that the only thing that could
keep him from re-election was getting ``caught in bed with a dead
girl or a live boy.''
</P>
<P>
   His mounting ethical lapses didn't always ride easy with voters.
</P>
<P>
   This became evident when Edwards emerged in 1991 as the only
viable gubernatorial candidate to defeat Duke, a former Ku Klux
Klan leader. It was called the election from hell. Summing up the
climate, said Parent of LSU, was a reluctantly pro-Edwards bumper
sticker that said: ``VOTE FOR THE CROOK, IT'S IMPORTANT.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving in court that Edwards is a crook is another matter. But
the government has a much stronger case now, said Volz, the former
U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI caught Edwards and his oldest son, Stephen, also an
attorney, discussing the casino license scheme on audio and
videotape, said Volz, now in private practice in Mandeville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have wire tapes and no inside witnesses,'' he said
of his two attempts to convict Edwards in the 1980s. ``It was based
on documents and his public statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors now have wire tapes, videotapes, plus all these
co-conspirators are making deals and will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps crucially, the trial will be held in staid Baton
Rouge _ not high-rolling New Orleans, an Edwards' power base, Volz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that Edwards' constituency is Afro-American,
and that's what most of the jurors in New Orleans are,'' he said.
``This is extremely significant. The determining factor in the case
is where they try the case. Baton Rouge is no lock cinch for the
government. But New Orleans would be very close to one for the
ex-governor.''
</P>
<P>
   It might all come down to whether the government can impanel 12
jurors immune to Edwards' wily charm, Volz conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing,'' says de la Houssaye's wife, Isabella, the
Republican mayor of Crowley, ``is that those people who pled guilty
will go to jail, and Edwin will walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a jury in this state that will convict Edwin
Edwards.''
</P>

LET'S PUT TO REST THIS CORNY SOUTHERN MYTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cornbread seems like such an innocent food. It's simple to make:
a little flour, a little cornmeal, an egg, milk, baking powder and
some shortening.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is one important ingredient left: sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Now the howling begins. cornbread is no longer benign. I'm told
there was recently a battle on the Internet among members of a
discussion group that rivaled a Civil War skirmish. Sugar in your
cornbread apparently, to some, indicates the blood in your veins.
If you like your cornbread rough and coarse and totally
unsweetened, you are, by God, Sir, a Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   If you care for a bit of sugar, you are a Yankee dog. So say the
purists.
</P>
<P>
   I say, ``Hooey.''
</P>
<P>
   I've broken cornbread on some of the best ranches in the state,
and I can tell you there is no common bread. Some stands firm to
the touch and gives a hard texture upon which beans and juices can
ride. Others crumble easily. They are delicate and sweet and, when
joined by hot, melting butter, become a joyous meal unto
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you call those cooks Yankees, you're likely to get a 10-inch
cast-iron skillet across the noggin.
</P>
<P>
   I've done my research, and I'm telling you, sugar in cornbread
is a matter of taste, not nationality. Don't even attempt to
convince me that those wonderful Southern cooks who know just the
right amount of sweetness to add to green beans, or how much
molasses to baste on ham, or how much brown sugar to mix with sweet
potatoes, would recoil in horror at the thought of sugaring their
cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a sweet tooth, you want sugar in your cornbread. If
you don't, you don't. It's that simple, so stop all the
name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   Historians like to get into the fray sometimes. They think that
because sugar was relatively scarce in the early 1800s, people
surely wouldn't have wasted it in cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a waste. If fact, a tablespoon of sugar goes a
long way in a cornbread recipe. It is a way of giving a little to a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not play with words. If you put honey, molasses, cane
syrup, corn syrup or maple syrup in your cornbread, you put sugar
in your cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   And don't play with regional boundaries either. Don't say real
Southern cornbread comes without sugar, when in fact, some places
in the South don't even like their cornbread made with yellow
cornmeal. Yeah, that's right. A lot of folks in the Deep South
prefer white cornmeal. And some of them use sugar, some don't.
</P>
<P>
   If sweet cornbread were such an anathema in the South, then why,
pray tell, does Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix do so well here? The little
blue box represents 87 percent of national corn muffin-mix sales,
says John Rutherford, sales manager for the Michigan company. Texas
ranks third in the nation when it comes to consuming Jiffy.
</P>
<P>
   Jiffy has sugar in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had sugar in the mix since Day One,'' Rutherford says.
``We started it in 1950 and when we moved from a regional packer to
a national market, we were told time and again it would never sell
because there was too much sugar in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix is the seventh largest-selling
dry-grocery item in the country. The company produces about 2
billion of the little boxes a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, interestingly enough, Jiffy doesn't advertise. Nope, you've
not seen any Jiffy TV commercials. No print ads, no coupons. It's
word-of-mouth only.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford says his findings have been the same as mine. Sugar
in cornbread is a matter of taste, and it has nothing to do with
your address.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing regionalism has to do with cornbread is in the
amount we consume. The South, which in this case includes Texas,
consumes the majority of the country's cornbread. Here, the first
choice is cornbread, the other choices are simply light bread and
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, there are places in the United States where it is
still thought of as a trailer-park, po-folk food. It hasn't been a
part of the national obsession with cornmeal mush, commonly known
these days as polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Some still think of cornbread as Johnny Cakes or Hoe Cakes,
terms from our past that reflect economic disadvantages. They don't
know what the smell of beans simmering on the stove, and cornbread
baking in the oven _ sugar or not _ can do to lift the spirits.
</P>

 &HT;    REVIEW: Wolfe's novel not definitive of Atlanta
 &HT;    By John Huey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Relax, Atlanta. Whatever else Tom Wolfe's sprawling novel ``A
Man in Full'' may be, it is not the great defining Atlanta novel
that so many folks in the always insecure capital of the New South
have been eagerly anticipating. Not that it doesn't have grandiose
pretensions in that direction. And not that Wolfe hasn't done a
prodigious job of reporting his subject.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the author gets so much detail about the city right _
including those fabulous symphonic Wolfeian descriptions of its
neighborhoods, and a pretty fair taxonomy of those who inhabit its
political and social scenes _ that it's almost worth plowing
through all 742 pages of this tome for nothing more than a cultural
travelogue of your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   As you would expect, Wolfe is at his best in Buckhead. ``Here in
the gloaming,'' he writes, ``the white blossoms, arranged in their
distinctive planes, swept from green breast to green breast, from
mansion to mansion, estate to estate, as if some divine artist had
adorned the heavenly air itself with them to show that the
residents of Buckhead, off West Paces Ferry Road, were the elect,
the anointed, the rightful white hard grabbers of whatever Atlanta,
Georgia, had to offer.'' The book's protagonist, Charlie Croker,
lives on Blackland Road; his deserted millionaire ex-wife dines at
what has to be Pano's and Paul's and works out among a pack of
young hardbodies she thinks of as ``boys with breasts,'' at a place
awfully like Jeanne's Body Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is pretty good on the other side of town, too. His
``Morehouse men'' characters live in Cascade Heights or Niskey
Lake. One of the central characters, Tech football hero Fareek
``the Cannon'' Fanon, grew up on English Avenue. And before it's
all over, we travel to Summerhill, Cabbagetown and Mechanicsville,
as well as Cherokee County, DeKalb-Peachtree Airport and
``Chambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   The author understands the basic social compact of the city,
too. Here, for example, is Mayor Wesley Dobbs Jordan explaining to
a fellow Morehouse man, nicknamed Roger ``Too White,'' how the
politics of road-building works in Atlanta: ``So they've got this
lawyer who's their spokesman, the white people do, and he starts
his pitch, and he's talking about Atlanta's place in the regional
economy and the global village and the cosmos and one thing and
another and Isaac interrupts him and says, `Scuse me, brother, but
you mind if I speed things up and get right to the checkered flag?
You got the money, and we got the power. We want some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes!, as the author himself might put it, Tom Wolfe has done his
homework in the 11 years he's been working on this epic. You won't
catch him on many detail mistakes, though he does miss occasionally
(a couple like the Crokers, a Virginia debutante and her Tech
football hero husband, would never have lived in the
Virginia-Highland neighborhood of the late '50s). But why quibble?
For the most part, Wolfe's Atlanta is very recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Man in Full'' also features many rich scenes that have
nothing to do with Atlanta. There's Turpmtine, the south Georgia
quail plantation so central to Charlie Croker's manhood; it is
rendered in splendid detail, though I would question some of the
sociological implications Wolfe draws. Though he has the quail life
rooted deep in the slave past of the South _ like the plantations
of his native Virginia _ a good many of the real south Georgia
quail plantations were established by carpetbagging industrialists
from the North: the Duponts, say, or the Olins, who enjoyed
pursuing the sporting life with one another, and with patrician
Southerners like Coca-Cola's Robert Woodruff. But again, we
quibble. Clearly, Wolfe went there, he saw, and he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ```This morning,' said Charlie, `I'm only gonna shoot the bobs.'
Morning came out close to moanin', just as something had come out
sump'm. When he was here at Turpmtine, he liked to shed Atlanta,
even in his voice. He liked to feel earthy, Down Home, elemental;
which is to say, he was no longer merely a real estate developer,
he was ... a man.''
</P>
<P>
   There are so many carefully drawn, vivid scenes in this book,
and many of them feature Conrad Hensley, the pathetic but noble
young man whom we first encounter on the job as a frozen foods
picker inside a Croker Global Foods warehouse in Oakland. Wolfe
clearly has spent some time somewhere along the way in a freezer
locker and is hellbent on capturing all of that experience in its
full horror (as it happens, your reviewer spent several summers
working in just such a place and can attest to the author's
remarkable grasp of detail and uncanny powers of description). I
have not, on the other hand, spent any time in prison, but having
now read Wolfe's pages and pages and pages of life in a California
prison with young Conrad, I don't feel the need to.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good, huh? A big, rich book, chock-full of wonderful
descriptive writing, clever social commentary, and comprehensive,
sophisticated reporting. What could be better? Well, for starters,
the plot. For another, the characters, who _ like those in
``Bonfire'' _ are intentionally cartoonish but _ unlike their Wall
Street predecessors _ don't really contribute to any larger point
that Wolfe makes us care about. And just to press on against the
grain here, the dialogue is often as lame as the plot, especially
toward the end, where Wolfe for some inexplicable reason has chosen
_ after giving us the most laboriously detailed scenes of freezer
lockers, prison yards and other venues only marginally related to
the plot _ to sum up everything that happens to everyone in one
totally artificial conversation between the mayor and Roger Too
White.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the mayor, on Page 737: ``No politician can go around
taking sides in sex cases, because the facts can come out and blow
up in your face at any time. But when the issue is not guilt or
innocence but fairness, justice, individual rights, and peace and
calm in the city _ then you can have your say, and I came down as
hard in favor of Fareek Fanon as it was possible to do in that
context. And then when Croker turned on Fareek _ it looked as if he
were proving my point! The `business interests' were determined to
be unfair and unjust!'' And so on, and so forth, much like the end
of a Perry Mason episode. You see, Della, once Paul decided to
investigate Murphy ...
</P>
<P>
   But back to the plot and the characters. Maybe the problem is
that Wolfe simply picked the wrong place to write about at the
wrong time. Sure, Atlanta is a swell place to live and work, but is
there really anything going on here these days that compares to the
level of interest in Wall Street's excesses at the time ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities'' came out? It certainly isn't office park
development, whose golden age passed a long time ago. There's
racial politics, of course, and I guess we have to admire Wolfe for
taking it on with all his politically incorrect swagger (i.e., lots
of dialect and jive talk). But he doesn't really take us anywhere
new in this story, and he gets a lot of it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the white racism in contemporary Atlanta is so
much more subtle and sophisticated than what we see in Charlie
Croker, who is such a Hollywood-style cliche that it's hard to
believe someone as sophisticated as the great Tom Wolfe could have
wrought him. He's not representative of any extant species walking
Atlanta today, and he's much less interesting than some of the
quirkier characters the city has produced over the years _ say,
John Portman, if you must be in real estate, or Ted Turner, if you
wanted to actually connect to something going on in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there's the African-American political scene. The
big revelation, according to Wolfe here, seems to be that these
black political figures are actually well-educated, well-dressed,
well-spoken and well-heeled. Duh! What's all wrong is that they are
also presented as prudent, wise guardians of the public trust who
embrace Machiavellian principles for the greater good. In reality,
of course, Atlanta's 27 years of black political rule has proved
nothing if not that African-American politicians are just as venal,
petty and egocentric as the white counterparts in their chosen
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there's Wolfe's primary plot premise _ that an
alleged date rape of a white society girl by a black football
player would endanger the public peace. Give me a break! This is a
city that has endured, among other things, the missing and murdered
children crisis, a fatal bombing at the Olympics, and nearly 40
years of Hosea Williams rattling the cages of assorted Klansmen.
We're not talking ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' here. Race was Wolfe's
most ambitious, and potentially relevant, theme. But in the end, I
felt I was reading more about racial attitudes as they exist in
Wolfe's native Richmond or in his home of New York than as they
actually are in Atlanta _ a much more complicated place racially
than either of those two.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe is probably most successful in drawing the character of
Charlie's ex-wife, Martha, and her struggle to regain her place in
Atlanta society after the big man has ditched her. But in the end,
when he ties it all up neatly in one little chapter, we end up not
caring much about what happens to her either. But for really grand
irrelevancy, consider the oh-so-lengthy matter of Conrad Hensley,
the freezer worker/convict and his conversion to the teachings of
the stoic philosopher Epictetus and how all this plays out on the
ultimate fate of Charlie Croker. As disappointing denouements go,
this one is All World, going beyond the normal limits of deus ex
machina into territory more Vonnegut than Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   So why are most critics rushing to award this seriously flawed
epic the highest honors? The theory here is that it's partly a
generational thing and mostly a New York thing. Baby-boom readers
love the body of work that is Wolfe's up until now. From ``Radical
Chic'' to ``Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' to ``The Right Stuff,''
he has proven to be a journalist of uncommon gift and scope. His
only other novel, ``Bonfire,'' struck a central nerve in us all
that still resonates a decade later. And now we want so much to
relive the joy. Tout New York (to borrow an affectation applied to
Atlanta throughout ``A Man in Full'') loves Wolfe and his
larger-than-life literary persona, and those who hang in the
Hamptons are hungry for a megahit from one of their own, having
seen book sales in this decade swing so heavily toward
middle-of-the-road, superficial plotmeisters like John Grisham
(though Wolfe's book could've benefited greatly from a little
Grishamesque plot counseling).
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. And Wolfe stimulates all these wonderful feelings
of anticipation from the moment the reader opens the massive
volume. ``A Man in Full'' is a book full of promise from its lush,
seductive beginnings. Sadly, in the end, it falls apart like a
cheap TV movie. My advice to Atlantans: Get out of that line. Save
your $28.95. Reread ``Gone With the Wind.'' And wait for the
paperback.
</P>
<P>
   John Huey is a native Atlantan who lives in New York, where he's
managing editor of Fortune magazine.

   DIGGS-MUSIC-PROFILE _ First he made seven Top 10 albums, as the
producer and mastermind of the Wu-Tang Clan. He came up with one of

1990's. Then Robert Diggs, better known as the RZA, decided it was

</P>
<P>
   COPLAND-HOUSE _ In 1960, Aaron Copland, searching for a new
place to live as he approached his 60th birthday, found a six-room
house on a hilly three-acre site in Cortlandt, N.Y., about an
hour's drive north of New York. He bought the house on the spot,
and lived there until he died in 1990. Now, thanks to an unusual
agreement between the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, which manages
Copland's estate, and Cortlandt, a town of 38,000 in upper
Westchester County, other composers will be able to live and work
in that house, called Rocky Hill. By Anthony Tommasini.

   NY-LIBRARY-REOPEN (Undated) _ Ever since it opened on May 23,
1911, the main reading room of the New York Public Library has lent
itself to fancy flights of literacy. And now that it is reopening
on November 16 after a year of restoration, its curious mix of
gaudy hauteur and inviting domesticity is more evident than ever.

   NY-APPLE-EXPERIMENTS (Geneva, N.Y.) _ All the way in the back of
the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station's orchard here
stand several jumbled rows of the oddest apple trees you've ever
seen. No two are alike, not in form or leaf or fruit: this one
could pass for a linden tree, that one for a demented forsythia.
Maybe a third of these six-year-old trees are bearing apples this
fall _ strange, strange fruit that look and taste like nothing so
much as God's first drafts of what an apple might be. By Michael
Pollan. With map.

<P>
   JEFFERSON-FAMILY-SPLIT (Undated) _ Sadly, almost two centuries
after Thomas Jefferson's death, most of the members of the
Monticello Association, which comprises 800 descendants of his two
daughters, Maria and Martha, have yet to come to grips with the
notion that the great man fathered children not only by his wife
Martha, but by Martha's half-sister, his slave, Sally Hemings. By
Lucian Truscott IV.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV-FLAT-PANELS (Undated) _ From Swatch's super-thin Skin line
of watches, each barely a membrane with display wrapped around the
wrist, to computers and flat-front television sets, flatness is the
quality of the hardware moment. The arrival of HDTV this month
signals another clarion call for the flat screen hung on the wall,
so long promised and yet so slow in arriving. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Hasbrouck Heights, N.J.) _ With evangelical zeal,
John Beirne is bent on convincing the uninitiated that equatorial
plants are the perfect autumnal alternative to mounds of mums and
heads of flowering kale. He's got a point: other gardens have
closed for the season; his glows like a supernova until November's
killing frost. By Ken Druse.

being ready for guests or not. By Marianne Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   NY-APARTMENT-HUNTING (New York) _ Although there are no
statistics available for market changes as recent as the last few
weeks, New York City real estate brokers and agents are full of
anecdotes about the Prodigal Buyer, those cautious souls who were
scared off by the stormy market but have returned to the want ads _
and the open houses. By Tracie Rozhon.

SERVATIUS RETIRES AS EDITOR AT MIDLAND, TEXAS; MINTON APPOINTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 Midland Reporter-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas _ Meta Marie Minton, associate publisher of the
Edwardsville (Ill.) Intelligencer since 1996 and previously editor
there for three years, has been named editor of the Midland
Reporter-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Spence, publisher of the Reporter-Telegram, said the
appointment was effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Minton, 35, succeeds Jim Servatius, 65, who has retired as
editor after 20 years in news department management at the
Reporter-Telegram, including 18 years as editor of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Minton was editor of the Edwardsville Intelligencer, a Hearst
newspaper, from 1993 until being named associate publisher in May
of 1996. Prior to that, she was news editor, city editor and
reporter at several daily newspapers in Illinois after receiving
her degree in journalism from Eastern Illinois University.
</P>
<P>
   While in Edwardsville, Minton was awarded the Edwardsville-Glen
Carbon Chamber of Commerce's Athena Award in recognition for her
work with various community groups including service on the Trails
West Boy Scouts Council board, the Southwestern Illinois Regional
Senior Olympics Board and the Edwardsville Foundation Board.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts she spearheaded at the Edwardsville Intelligencer
brought the newspaper two Inland Innovation Awards. In 1996, the
newspaper won first-place honors for its cable television
partnership and in 1997 it won first place for its leadership in
establishing the Festival 66 community event and accompanying Route
66 web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will miss the talents of Jim Servatius who has served so
well on our management team for the past 20 years but wish him the
best in his well-deserved retirement,'' Spence said in making the
announcement. ``We are very fortunate, however, to be able to bring
to Midland a talented member of the Hearst newspaper group as his
successor. I know Meta Minton will be a valuable member of our
executive staff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Servatius was editor of the Plainview Daily Herald, also now a
Hearst newspaper, for 18 years before coming to Midland in 1978. He
was executive managing editor here before being named editor in
January 1980. Earlier, he was employed in various editorial
capacities at the Vernon Daily Record and the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Through his years at the Reporter-Telegram he served on the
boards of directors of the Midland United Way, the Midland Arts
Assembly, Family Services, Junior Achievement, Need to Read and on
the advisory boards of Leadership Midland and Midland County
Library.
</P>
<P>
   A strong proponent of ``institutional journalism,'' through
which a newspaper's influence and editorial space is used to
further community accomplishments, he worked behind the scenes to
assure both news and editorial support for countless worthwhile
programs and projects in Midland, Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midland has been very good to us, as it has for so many,''
said Servatius, who, with his wife Ann, will remain here. ``We will
continue to enjoy the many good things this city has to offer and
view its continued development through the pages of the
Reporter-Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton said it was ``an honor to follow in the footsteps of a
distinguished editor like Jim Servatius.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the exciting challenge of helping lead the
Reporter-Telegram into the next century and I feel fortunate to
join this exceptionally talented staff,'' she said.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 4. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The elections rule. USA Today slugs the story ``Democrats Dash
GOP Hopes,'' and its front-page cover story says Tuesday brought
``good news for the man who wasn't on the ballot,'' Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the New York Times main headline reads in part,
``Democrats Hold Off G.O.P. Advance, Weakening Impeachment
Prospects....'' The Los Angeles Times headline lavishes its big
type on the victory of Democrat Gray Davis in the California
governor's race, the re-election to the Senate of Barbara Boxer and
the victory of the initiative permitting Indian-run casinos. And
the headline over the Washington Post lead credits the Democrats
with scoring significant upsets _ the Post, like everybody else,
stressing the defeat of GOP incumbent senators Alfonse D'Amato of
New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The papers cite the general satisfaction exiting voters
expressed _ with Clinton, with the economy and with their own lot
in life. And everybody says 60 percent of voters thought Clinton
should not be impeached. The upshot is that the Republicans will
not achieve a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Although, as
everybody notes, the Republicans do retain control of both the
House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The press consensus is that the only real bright spots for the
Republicans are the victories of the brothers Bush in the Texas and
Florida gubernatorial races. The LAT says that George W. Bush's
re-election instantly makes him the Republican presidential
front-runner. The NYT's R.W. Apple says both Bushes are to be
reckoned serious presidential contenders. And Maureen Dowd only
seems to be half-joking when she suggests that the brothers form a
Bush-Bush ticket in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page Wall Street Journal story details a little-noticed
aspect of the emerging e-marketplace: Large corporations are moving
slowly into Internet marketing, not really any longer because of
misgivings about its power, but because it threatens to destroy
traditional hands-on sales channels, which still constitute about
90 percent of most companies' order flow. For instance, the Journal
ponies up a Seattle GM dealer who has made 10 additional sales this
year with the help of his automaker's Web sites, but who also
worries that GM might someday just take buyers' orders directly and
get rid of him.

   With the papers relentlessly rah-rahing over the latest exploits
of the home team, often, amazingly, on the front page, it's
sobering to take in the NYT op-ed on the rampant criminality of
professional football players. According to the piece, it's
look-the-other-way day in the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dick Vermeil of the St. Louis Rams is quoted saying this
about a linebacker charged last week with involuntary manslaughter
in a crash in which the other driver died: ``I think it'll be good
for him to get back and get with his teammates and get going
again.'' Then there's another Ram who plays on despite having
pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in a case where the victim
suffered partial paralysis and brain damage. And the Miami Dolphin
wide receiver who, despite one conviction and two arrests for
beating his fiancee, was offered a new contract by the club and has
never been disciplined by the league.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Jeff Benedict, claims that a study he helped conduct
shows that 1 out of 5 NFL players has been charged with a serious
crime.
</P>
<P>
   An AP story inside the WP reports that the Caldor department
store chain has apologized for unwittingly publishing 11 million
copies of an advertising circular in which two smiling boys are
depicted playing Scrabble around a game board where the pieces
clearly spell out the word ``RAPE.''
</P>
<P>
   The WP, famous for applying wholesomeness principles to its
copy, outdoes itself today. The Reliable Source's item about an
election day get-together of old pols includes this quote from one
of them: ``If a bomb went off in this place, 50 percent of the
country's known supply of (equine droppings) would be destroyed.''
Can't the Post see that whereas the actual phrase used would go by
virtually unnoticed, the paper's baroque translation only forces
the reader to dwell on the matter?

THE PRACTICE OF READING
</HEADLINE>
  By Denis Donoghue 
 307 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
 By PETER BROOKS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the more polemical moments of ``The Practice of
Reading,'' Denis Donoghue proposes that we should teach English
language and literature as if they were a foreign tongue and a
foreign literature. Our problems, he says, arise from the
assumption that our students know the language and are qualified to
undertake a study of the literature, and ``if we taught English as
a second language and a second literature, we would become more
responsive to the mediating character of the literary language, the
opacity of language as such: we would not assume that the language
is transparent to our interests.'' This may be implausible as a
practical proposal of reform, but it effectively highlights
Donoghue's overriding concern in his new book: that the arduous and
exciting business of close attention to the language of literature
may be suffering from perilous neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue has for many years been worrying about how we read --
and how we should read. As a leading ``practical critic'' -- to use
I. A. Richards's term -- with a broad and deep literary culture,
Donoghue has always been ready to skewer theories that he thinks
stand between the reader and a direct experience of texts. His
allegiances lie most of all with the tradition of the New Critics
and other ``close readers,'' from T. S. Eliot and Richards through
William Empson, F. R. Leavis, R. P. Blackmur, Kenneth Burke. But
whereas in earlier books, for instance ``Ferocious Alphabets''
(1981), his critique was directed toward post-structuralists like
Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man, now what he calls
``ideologically opportunistic'' criticism draws his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue is right (and hardly alone) in detecting an ideological
and political turn in criticism, part of the movement often
referred to as cultural studies, which (under the general influence
of Michel Foucault, among others) tends to see literature as just
one among many discourses reflective of dominant ideological
practices and to study it as a cultural artifact without any
special claim to independent status or superior insight. He is
right, too, in his claim that most critics of this persuasion don't
read with the patient attention to language characteristic of the
New Critics: ``Their metier is not verbal analysis but the
deployment of themes, arguments and morally charged conclusions. .
. . They take language for granted as providing direct access to
reality and fantasy.'' In one of his liveliest chapters, Donoghue
takes on recent commentaries on ``Macbeth'' that, he says, ``issue
not in analyses of the language of the play but in an invidious
account of the ideology that the play allegedly sustains: for that
purpose, a reading of the play in the detail of its language is
thought to be a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting result of Donoghue's warfare on this new front is
a newly relaxed attitude toward the deconstructive readings of
Derrida and de Man, who in fact gave very close attention to texts,
though with austere and unsettling results. De Man, after all,
proposed a ``return to philology'' as ``an examination of the
structure of language prior to the meaning it produced.'' It's not
theory Donoghue is hostile to, he has asserted -- in fact, we don't
have enough good theory in literary study -- but ``the prosecution
of principles and ideologies under the pseudonym of theory.''
Indeed, literary study at present is sometimes held to be
post-theoretical, and that has often meant the neglect of poetics
-- the study of the conditions of meaning of texts -- as well as
scrupulous reading, in favor of a search for sociopolitical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Donoghue generally aligns himself with formalism, as the
attention to the shape and texture of literary works, his larger
ambition is the rehabilitation of the esthetic, particularly as it
was formulated two centuries ago by Schiller. The esthetic to
Schiller is not marginal or decorative, it is central to human
experience: the realm of human freedom, of the Spieltrieb -- the
human capacity for play -- for reformulating the givens of reality.
The word Donoghue keeps coming back to, here and elsewhere, is
``imagination'': the capacity of the mind to encompass other forms
of life, a fictional sphere where, in the line of one of his
favorite poets, Wallace Stevens, ``the world imagined is the
ultimate good.'' He also likes the word ``Romanticism,'' not as set
in sterile opposition to Classicism but as a ``permanent category''
of human aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These are crucial and complex issues. The problem is that ``The
Practice of Reading'' doesn't provide much scope for their full
development. A series of eight mainly short occasional essays on
critics and practices of reading, followed by seven readings of
individual texts, the book never provides an extended argument on
any one topic. The problem isn't made any easier by the fact that
the book refuses to tell us what the occasion for most of the
essays originally was (most were journal pieces or lectures), which
makes some of them float a bit weightlessly. Donoghue's arguments
are often given in a kind of shorthand, leaving this reader, at
least, largely unsatisfied. When, for instance, he takes on de
Man's interpretation of Wordsworth's famous, and famously
problematic, ``Boy of Winander,'' he concludes by calling it
``formidable but perverse,'' and simply asserts to the contrary,
``I have to remind myself that Wordsworth . . . wrote some of the
most moving poems in the language.'' To be sure, but this is not an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue's magisterial tone and his readiness to pass trenchant
judgment can be bracing, but they can also confuse and even
trivialize important issues now much debated. Nor are definition
and clarity advanced by his tendency to refer in a litany to
critics he likes -- Leavis, Empson, Blackmur, Burke especially --
while taking unexplained swipes at those he doesn't, sometimes, one
feels, without much sense of what they are really saying. The
result is a book that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.
Donoghue is a formidably gifted critic whose range of reference is
truly impressive and whose commitment to what he calls (he is
paraphrasing Blackmur on Stevens) ``the superior impersonal reality
of words'' is profound and, in the current context, salutary. But
his book never really gets to the business of telling us how and
why the practices of reading he approves are the right and powerful
ones.

MY FIRST COUSIN ONCE REMOVED
</HEADLINE>
  Money, Madness, and the Family of Robert Lowell 
 By Sarah Payne Stuart 
 Illustrated. 244 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25 
 ------ 
 YANKEES IN THE BELFRY 
 By REEVE LINDBERGH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathaniel Hawthorne once suggested that ``in every half-century,
at longest, a family should be merged in the great abstract mass of
humanity, and forget all about its ancestors.'' Good advice. We
risk a great deal when we cannot allow our parents, our
grandparents or any of our other relatives, however admirable they
may be, to recede into the benign realms of memory, but instead
keep them with us always, in sharpest focus, throughout our days.
Indeed, those especially who have famous relatives will admit, if
they are honest, that it is one thing to honor one's celebrated
kinfolk, and quite another thing to struggle with the lifelong
impression that those other illustrious family lives are more
important than our own. With a hearty, if somewhat toxic, mixture
of pride, envy, exasperation, love and despair, Sarah Payne Stuart
goes straight to the heart of this struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first cousin once removed was Robert Lowell, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet -- a fact I just happened to mention on my
application to Harvard College. The worst part was that I had to
work this genealogical information into the essay.'' Thus begins
``My First Cousin Once Removed: Money, Madness, and the Family of
Robert Lowell.'' Stuart and her brothers grew up with the knowledge
that ``we were Winslows, as if this information alone should make
everything clear in our lives.'' It did not. Instead, Stuart
learned that she and her family were Boston aristocrats, with a
heritage, like most, partly honorable and partly horrific. Her
Mayflower ancestor, Edward Winslow, established peace with the
Indians and maintained it for 40 years. He once traveled for many
miles through the snow to nurse Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoags.
A generation later, Edward's son Josiah, who had grown up with
Massasoit's children, trapped a group of women and children from
the Narragansett tribe in their wigwams and burned them alive.
</P>
<P>
   For the descendants of the Winslows, and of the Thorndikes,
Lowells, Cottings and Paynes, family history is a mixed blessing,
and family life can be very grim. Stuart's perspective is often
friendly, but never reverent. ``In my family, genes are
everything,'' she writes, ``so that even being a manic-depressive
is a kind of badge of honor, proving the family's tenacity in
sticking close to Boston, where there was no one to marry but one
another.'' Robert Lowell, known to his family and friends as Bobby,
was a manic-depressive as well as a poet. He also had a tendency to
drink heavily, to write about his family in a way that upset them,
and to leave his wives. ``Bobby had created a lot of turmoil in the
family before I was born,'' his younger cousin Sarah writes, ``but
then he had won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and
for years he could get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard, reading this book, to envy Robert Lowell, who
suffered a series of debilitating breakdowns over the course of his
career, until in 1977 a heart attack ended his life at 60. Others
suffered too. Stuart's mother, Lowell's first cousin and a
childhood intimate, also had a breakdown, and was hospitalized for
a year and a half. Johnny Payne, the second of her three older
brothers, a gifted musician perceived by his family as ``the
perfect child . . . considerate of his parents and hard-working in
school,'' suffered his first breakdown during his second year at
Harvard, and his condition was diagnosed by the staff of McLean
Hospital in Belmont, Mass., as paranoid schizophrenia. His sister
tried, and failed, to have her brother come to live with her in her
own Harvard suite at Winthrop House. One weary paragraph conveys a
wealth of feeling about that period of her life. ``After you are
with someone who is really crazy, you never use the word the same
way again,'' Stuart writes, and then, simply, ``I was unable to
cure Johnny.'' (Johnny ultimately got well enough to perform with
Phoebe Snow, Bonnie Raitt and Tim Hardin, and to get married, have
children and start a music school.) Half a dozen family members
were afflicted in all.
</P>
<P>
   This story about family craziness seems, in and of itself, so
remarkably and cheerfully sane. It is a survivor's story, with so
much intelligence, humor and affection brought to bear that even
the monsters it occasionally offers up are appealing. They are the
artist's own monsters, after all, and it is clear that she loves
them, from the benevolent family matriarch of her childhood, her
namesake ``Great-Aunt Sarah,'' who at 99 turns to her beloved
great-niece and says, ``I don't like you, you're poor,'' to the
Boston relatives at Lowell's funeral who ``sat stiffly in their
pews, careful not to be too comfortable,'' to the very atmosphere
of the ancestral home in Boston, ``where everything was stifling,
where never once had I said a true thing, but where everything was
certain, down to the chicken they ate every Wednesday, year after
year.''

BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION 
 JUDE
</HEADLINE>
  A Pilgrimage to the Saint of Last Resort 
 By Liz Trotta 
 HarperSanFrancisco, $24.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saint of lost causes and desperate cases, Jude, the most
obscure of Jesus' Twelve Apostles, is enjoying a grass-roots
renewal of interest, Liz Trotta contends, thanks to
end-of-the-millennium despair. Trotta takes readers to the ruins of
Edessa, an ancient city in eastern Turkey where legend has it that
Jude earned his reputation as a miracle worker by healing King
Abgar of leprosy; to Rome, where Jude's relics lie in St. Peter's;
on her talks with AIDS patients at Jude's shrine in San Francisco;
and to her interviews with believers across the United States, who
offer accounts of desperate prayers to Jude being rewarded with
miracles. Jesus' assignment to Jude, she suggests, was:
``Fundamental changes happen in secret within individual hearts. It
is not a matter of converting nations and bestowing victory upon
chosen peoples, but of revealing God's kingdom quietly by answering
each lonely cry.'' If only Trotta, the New York bureau chief for
The Washington Times, could define her own role as clearly. She
seems to see Jude's hand everywhere that she cannot find an answer:
a missed interview, a wrong turn or an altar she cannot locate. Is
her search factual or spiritual? The reader is left wondering. _

 &UR; Confessions of a Common Reader &QL; 
 &UR; By Anne Fadiman &QL; 
 &UR; Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the literary Eden that forms Anne Fadiman's life, the air
remains pure allusion, the marginalia flows, and the only snake in
the grass is a typo. The daughter of the writer Clifton Fadiman,
she cultivated her bibliomania in her family's intellectual
atmosphere, affectionately called ``Fadiman U.'' She grew from
assembling castles out of her father's set of Trollope to learning
about sex from his poorly concealed copy of ``Fanny Hill.'' Editor
of The American Scholar, Fadiman now has her own bookish family
(her husband reads Homer aloud to her in bed). Her ``common
reader'' take on these topics and others -- like John Adams's
incensed jottings in Mary Wollstonecraft's ``French Revolution''
(``200 years later, his handwriting still looks angry'') and the
wordy exotica of a mail-order catalogue (``a Harlequin romance for
the kind of people who vacation in Krk'') -- fills these 18 lissome
essays on bibliophilism and language, which appeared first in
Civilization magazine. How you respond to them depends a lot on how
you feel about someone whose greatest discomfort as a 19-year-old
evidently occurred in the offices of The New Yorker (she
mispronounced ``Ms.'' in front of a gracious William Shawn). Like
Gladstone, whose ``On Books and the Housing of Them'' exhibits how
completely his Victorian sensibility operated ``within the
miniature empire of his own library,'' she, too, functions within a
genteel fortress of books. _ RENEE TURSI

   &UR; FAMILY OUTING &QL; 
 &UR; By Chastity Bono with Billie Fitzpatrick &QL; 
 &UR; Little, Brown, $24 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of Sonny and Cher's television show in the early 1970's
remember Chastity Bono as the blond, angelic child holding hands
with her famous parents. Bono broke that dainty public image by
growing up to become a gay activist. Readers hoping for a dishy
tell-all or a literary memoir in ``Family Outing'' will be
disappointed. The book is more of a comprehensive guide to the
coming-out process for homosexuals and their parents. With its
heavily instructional and sometimes wooden tone, ``Family Outing''
reads like a textbook. Yet there is no doubt it will be helpful to
its intended audience. Bono's celebrity may attract readers who
need this kind of advice but might not receive it otherwise. Though
she tends to explain rather than feel in her prose, she shows guts
by revealing her own story, including her sorrow at the death of
her father, a Republican Congressman who co-sponsored the Defense
of Marriage Act. At the time of his death, father and daughter had
not spoken in almost a year. The biggest surprise: when Bono came
out, Sonny was supportive; Cher, known for her wild, rebellious
image, was enraged. Ultimately, Cher embraced her child and told
her, ``So this is your journey: making being gay or lesbian
commonplace.'' _ ANDREA COOPER

   &UR; CULTURAL CALISTHENICS &QL; 
 &UR; Writings on Race, Politics and Theatre &QL; 
 &UR; By Robert Brustein &QL; 
 &UR; Ivan R. Dee, $26 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the playwright August Wilson delivered a speech in which
he celebrated what black theater ``often accomplished amid adverse
and hostile conditions,'' slammed the idea of ``color-blind''
casting as ``a tool of the Cultural Imperialists,'' and identified
the critic Robert Brustein as chief cultural imperialist. A heated
public debate ensued, which Brustein continues in several of his
essays here. He characterizes their differences as ``a
philosophical dispute over the basic function of dramatic art.''
``I believe that plays must be engaged with the social and
political issues of the time,'' he writes, ``but I continue to hold
the admittedly unfashionable view that no major work of art ever
changed society, however it succeeded in changing consciousness.''
Many of these essays, most of which were originally published in
The New Republic, are concerned with how ``extra-artistic
considerations'' -- multiculturalism, gay rights, women's issues
and political correctness -- impair current thought, including that
of arts funding agencies. It is because of trying to accommodate
these ``extra-artistic considerations,'' Brustein argues, that we
find ourselves bending over backward to perform what he cleverly
calls ``cultural calisthenics,'' much to the disservice of art.
Other essays praise the great acting teacher Stella Adler, the
playwright and performer Anna Deavere Smith, and recent plays like
``How I Learned to Drive'' and ``Gross Indecency.'' Robert Brustein
is an elegant and eloquent voice in the wilderness of contemporary
American culture. _ ROBIN LIPPINCOTT

   &UR; ELVIS PRESLEY 1956 &QL; 
 &UR; By Marvin Israel &QL; 
 &UR; Abrams, $17.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Elvis Presley released his first album in March
1956, a photographer for Seventeen magazine named Marvin Israel
caught him on tour at the University of Dayton. ``Elvis Presley
1956'' (Abrams, $17.95), a gritty compilation of dozens of
previously unpublished black-and-white photos, was the result.
Seventeen probably passed because the photos of the rising teen
idol were too raw: the black-rimmed, raccoon-like eyes, the pitted
skin and the electric current that seemed to ripple through
Presley's spine. We also see his natural charm: a picture of a
smiling Elvis, en pointe, knees splayed, cradling his
leather-embossed guitar; a gauzy picture of his Pharaonic features
that makes him look like a god from ancient Memphis. Portraits of
the fans capture an era: girls in their Junior League best with
polka-dot bows, and their gape-mouthed, sullen dates; a
leather-jacketed Natalie Wood look-alike scowls in front of a
30-foot-tall cutout of Presley at the premiere of ``Love Me
Tender,'' his first film, at the Paramount in Times Square. Israel,
who went on to become one of the most influential photo editors of
the 1960's, commissioning work by Diane Arbus, Robert Frank and Lee
Friedlander, had an intimate access to Presley before he became a
superstar that comes across in the photos. The text is perfunctory
(``in 1956 Elvis was a rocket'') and identifying captions would
help, but the images speak for themselves. _ ERIC P. NASH

 THE BOOK OF JOB 
 Translation, introduction and notes by Raymond P. Scheindlin 
 Norton, $23.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Book of Job, considered by many to be the greatest poetic
drama in the Hebrew Bible, resonates with spiritual import and
psychological power. Probably set down at some time during the
fifth or fourth century B.C., the story may well be a retelling of
an even older exemplary folk tale about Job, who undergoes
unimaginable suffering inflicted by an omnipotent and seemingly
uncaring God. Raymond P. Scheindlin, a professor of medieval Hebrew
literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
translates the biblical Hebrew into language that is mellifluous
and eloquent, yet contemporary in tone. He acknowledges the Book of
Job's well-documented difficulty and resists any urge to nudge his
version in a more discursive direction. As he says in his
introduction, ``Poetry does not state the book's message . . . it
is the book's message.'' _ ANDY BRUMER

   &UR; THE HIGHER JAZZ &QL; 
 &UR; By Edmund Wilson &QL; 
 &UR; University of Iowa, cloth, $34.95; paper, $17.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, Edmund Wilson wrote and partly revised a
novel set in the months before and just after the 1929 stock market
crash _ a time when he had suffered a breakdown and was unable to
write. He intended, as Neale Reinitz explains in his introduction,
``a sweeping narrative'' called ``The Story of the Three Wishes,''
in which a man assumes three successive identities _ a New York
stockbroker, a Russian official and a bohemian writer in
Provincetown. But the original project veered in another direction,
more in keeping with the new title, ``The Higher Jazz,'' given by
Reinitz to this previously unpublished narrative. Its main
character, Fritz Dietrich, may be out to distill ``the blue unhappy
beautiful longings'' of American popular music into a classical
form, but he's just as entranced by the ``round little rump'' of
his companion, Caroline Stokes. Fritz and Caroline soon wed, and
join a witty set of New Yorkers loosely based on Dorothy Parker,
Robert Benchley and Wilson's friends Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.
Unfortunately, there are too many characters in the novel, and not
much plot for them to be essential to. Reinitz has successfully
reconciled gaps and inconsistencies in the text, and his
commentaries connecting it to Wilson's life and other work are the
chief interest of the book. Interesting too are the parallels to
Wilson's editing of Fitzgerald's unfinished novel, ``The Last
Tycoon,'' published just before Wilson started his own manuscript,
and those between ``The Higher Jazz'' and ``The Great Gatsby.''
Wilson's story has its own Nick; its parlor-gag family, the
Ratsbys; and a lot of clever dialogue -- all of it mildly engaging,
but never very captivating. _ DAVID WALTON

   &UR; LIKE BEING KILLED &QL; 
 &UR; By Ellen Miller &QL; 
 &UR; Dutton, $24.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's something daunting about a novel that opens with a long
scene in which self-described ``dope fiends'' sit around a table
getting high. Usually in such situations, the author means to clue
us in to an addict's skewed logic, but often we just feel as if
we're stuck at a party where no one speaks our language. Ellen
Miller's first novel begins with one of these sequences and never
quite recovers. The narrator, Ilyana Meyerovich, is a Brown
graduate living on the Lower East Side who reads books about
pharmacology for fun and has a deadpan wisecrack for every
occasion. She also knows with comfortable certainty that heroin,
the drug that seems to mesh so well with her tendency toward
existential despair, will eventually kill her. Then she meets
Susie, a sunny, good-hearted soul who knows how to make peach pie,
and she falls in a kind of love. But the relationship shatters, and
Ilyana careers down a self-destructive spiral. In Ilyana, Miller
has drawn a surly yet oddly appealing character. Mostly, though,
her novel simply seems calculated to shock, and the pace is dragged
down by Ilyana's serpentine digressions. ``An image formed, was
completed, then disintegrated, then reconstructed itself into a new
image, which formed fully, which crumbled, which was rebuilt into
something different,'' is just the beginning of one such musing.
``Like Being Killed'' puts you in a drug user's head, but it
doesn't give you enough reasons to want to stay there. _ STEPHANIE

   &UR; A MASTERPIECE OF REVENGE &QL; 
 &UR; By J. J. Fiechter &QL; 
 &UR; Arcade, $21.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that its publishers are calling ``A Masterpiece of
Revenge'' a mystery is more mysterious than its plot. A chief
suspect and motive are established early on, and despite a clever
twist at the end, events generally unwind without suspense. As one
might expect from a man who once ran the Swiss watch company
Blancpain, J. J. Fiechter has written a meticulously detailed
narrative. The novel's central character, Charles Vermeille, is an
expert on the 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain. But it's
a seemingly simple set of modern pictures that stumps Vermeille:
photographs of his son that arrive in unmarked envelopes. There are
no threats, no notes, just candid photos of the young man, who has
recently begun studying at Berkeley. Then another picture is
brought to Vermeille's attention -- a painting, apparently a
long-lost Lorrain. More intrigue arrives with Jane Caldwell, the
director of a lab devoted to art conservation and keenly in need of
cash. A scientist by training, Caldwell is also a methodical flirt:
``She made calculated but graceful gestures; she formed
irresistible smiles; she fluttered her eyelashes; she moved her
shoulders sinuously.'' ``A Masterpiece of Revenge'' is similarly
calculated and graceful, but, sad to say, not nearly as sinuous. _

</P>
<P>
   The novel Raymond Carver occasionally spoke of writing never
materialized. Who can say, had he escaped death from lung cancer at
the age of 50, whether it ever would have? Carver was disposed to
the short form, and if he is the story writer of Teacher's Scotch
and domestic dissolution, then in ALL OF US: The Collected Poems
(Knopf, $27.50) he is their poet as well. The four volumes
collected here by William L. Stull (who also provides ample
biographical material, a chronology and exhaustive appendixes) were
mostly written in the 1980's, during the final decade of Carver's
life; they capture in verse much of the same pared narrative power
that distinguishes his fiction. Throughout the book, simple
declarative sentences pile up like collection notices as Carver's
plain-spoken diction lends immediacy to his characters' downward
spins and sporadic redemptions. As an offshoot of his desire to
blur the lines between poetry and prose, Carver even arranges
passages from the stories of his beloved Chekhov, lining them up
like verse. For Carver himself, however, the strongest poems begin
where his own stories end, in moments of lyrical insight that leave
narrative to one side. In ``September,'' ``Near Klamath'' and
``Late Fragment,'' for example, he discovers his own perfect music
and density of expression. Other poems, while sharing the
melancholy humanity of his stories, never quite realize their
potential as verse. Still, their willed artlessness and unflinching
emotions commend them to us. Like the fresh rolls a baker offers to
grieving parents in one of Carver's stories, each of them is ``a
small, good thing.'' _ DAVID YEZZI

   &UR; THE ROAD TO THE ISLAND &QL; 
 &UR; By Tom Hazuka &QL; 
 &UR; Bridge Works, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dolan, the 31-year-old narrator of Tom Hazuka's first
novel, becomes entwined in a cat's cradle of guilt, betrayal and
revenge after the death of his beloved father in a suspicious
hit-and-run accident. In the opening chapters, Hazuka deftly
balances back-fence realism with a supercharged expository style.
In short, sure strokes, he creates credible if not terribly complex
characters -- the wife and son Jimmy has abandoned, his best
friend, his resentful brother, his stoical mother. But Hazuka
eventually lets the novel's fast-paced plotting assume such control
that it distorts the emotional range and logic of his story.
Exposition clicks like a metronome, grim secrets are held back for
authorial convenience, and coincidences become felicitous to a
fault. In the end, no one can disagree with Jimmy's discovery that
it is better to forgive than to seethe. But the plot doesn't allow
him room to come naturally to the realization that he has
misunderstood the crucial emotional relationships of his youth. Nor
does it seem likely that his passivity can change into the optimism
of the novel's last pages. Still, ``The Road to the Island'' has
moments of high moral purpose and somber grace; it suggests that
for Hazuka more convincing efforts lie just ahead. _ CHARLES

  America's Rocky Road to Political Stalemate

 THE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD 
 How Character Makes and Ruins Presidents, From Washington to
Clinton

 OFFICE POLITICS 
 By SEBASTIAN MALLABY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a life writing about politics, Robert Shogan is spitting
with contempt. Bob Dole, we are told on the first page of ``The
Fate of the Union,'' ``waged a brain-dead campaign'' in 1996.
George Bush's economic policies suffered from ``bankruptcy.'' At
the start of his Presidency, Bill Clinton had ``no guidepost beyond
the relentless pursuit of expediency.'' And time is no healer:
``Clinton began his second term with no clear objective except to
get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most authors, one broadside at a time might offer catharsis,
but Shogan's frustration is mightier than that. In ``The
Double-Edged Sword,'' published almost simultaneously, he unloads
his grievances about earlier statesmen. John Adams suffered from an
``abrasive, introspective personality''; Jefferson was duplicitous;
Madison lacked dynamism; Jackson's supporters had to organize a
``whitewash committee'' to defend their man against character
assaults. And after Jackson, ``a nearly unbroken parade of
political mediocrities presided in the White House.'' Shogan has
his generous moments in describing Washington, whose force of
personality he credits with holding the young Republic together.
But, even then, the author keeps his critical faculties about him:
Washington had only ``meager gifts as an orator,'' a ``notoriously
short temper'' and was not even a brilliant general.
</P>
<P>
   This two-book assault on American statecraft has a larger point.
As Shogan points out, Americans set great store by their
Presidents' personal qualities. They want them to act, in the words
of Walter Dean Burnham, as ``the high priests of the American civil
religion.'' Ever since Washington's hagiographers invented the myth
of the cherry tree, they have longed for virtue in them. This
thirst reflects more than mere idealism. It reflects the fear, as
Shogan, a political correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, puts
it, that the country has ``a political and governing system that
was designed not to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and you alone can awe the insolence of opposing
factions,'' Gouverneur Morris implored Washington at a time when
the great man seemed reluctant to accept the job of President. In
Shogan's view, the need for character in the White House has grown
pressing again recently. Modern innovations have rusted the
political machinery: primary elections, ballot initiatives and
television have all eroded parties as the organizing instruments of
politics; strong Presidential character is needed to fill the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such character has not been forthcoming. In fact, Shogan
hints that attaining it may not be possible. In 1996, for example,
some voters judged that Bob Dole's trustworthiness counted for more
than Bill Clinton's empathy; but more thought the opposite. In
1976, a majority voted for Jimmy Carter's honesty. But four years
later an even bigger majority decided that Carter's indecisiveness
made him unsuitable for a second term. No consensus on the optimum
Presidential character seems possible. And so America seems
destined for more years of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of Shogan's views is that America should scrap its
Constitution for a parliamentary system less dependent upon elusive
character and faster at dumping inadequate leaders. But although
Shogan does rail at one point that ``social and economic change has
transformed the anachronistic system bequeathed to us by the
Founders into a political wasteland,'' he shies away from pursuing
his argument to its bracing conclusion. Instead he offers the kind
of anecdote and color that have disinguished his long reportorial
career. Rather than attempting to demolish the edifice of American
politics, Shogan is content to amuse the reader. Which may come as
a relief.

THE ROAD HOME
</HEADLINE>
  By Jim Harrison 
 446 pp. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. $25 
 ------ 
 O PIONEERS! 
 By THOMAS MCNAMEE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a singular comfort in knowing, on the first page of a
novel, that you are in the hands of a master:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to forget that in the main we die only seven times
more slowly than our dogs. The simplicity of this law of proportion
came to me early in life, growing up as I did so remotely that dogs
were my closest childhood friends. It is for this reason I've
always been a slow talker, though if my vocal cords had been
otherwise constructed I may have done well at a growl or bark or
howl at scented but unseen dangers beyond the light we think
surrounds us, but more often enshrouds us.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the first words of ``The Road Home,'' and they
accurately prefigure the idiosyncratic grace of the narrative to
come. ``My mother was an Oglala Sioux,'' this introductory voice
tells us, ``my father was an orphan from the East . . .
intermittently mad as he was over a life largely spent on helping
the Natives accommodate themselves to their conquerors.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have read Jim Harrison's 1988 novel, ``Dalva,'' the
intricately layered world of ``The Road Home'' will be immediately
familiar. Like ``Dalva,'' this novel has multiple narrators, the
first of whom is Dalva's grandfather, John Wesley Northridge 2d, a
Nebraska country gentleman of moderate wealth and immoderate
awareness -- the one giving him the time and the other the means to
look deep into human experience. If you don't already know the
Northridge family, you soon will, so vividly does Harrison render
them, and with such economy: ``When you tell me stories about your
life,'' Dalva demands of the old man, ``why do you always pretend
you were such a nice person? . . . Everyone in town says you were
the scariest man in the county. . . . So I wish you wouldn't just
tell the good parts about yourself. I'm not some little kid, I'm
11.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of a few pages, Northridge's impetuous mind
will plunge into the past, leap decades forward in time, then snap
back to the present like a whip crack as he assembles what at first
seem unrelated fragments into a comprehensive and harmonious
composition. Northridge's childhood best friend, now a Lakota
medicine man, has prophesied that Northridge is soon to die, and
Northridge takes him at his word. ``I have settled down to enjoy
what I now truly believe to be the last year of my life,'' he says.
The old man returns to the calling he gave up long ago, making
sketches of the things and people he has loved. This too is a way
of coming to terms with his life: ``Artists,'' he remembers his
first wife saying, ``paint the world so they can understand its
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel's shifts of mood are as wrenching as those in its time
line; merriment topples into horror in a heartbeat: Northridge, in
1952, remembers his art school classmate Davis, on a trip back in
1909, ``swigging tequila for a toothache when he said he was going
to climb a mountain to catch the breeze. This irritated me and I
said, 'Go ahead, you fool, you'll break your neck,' and he did. . .
. He said no last words so crushed was his face but his eyes still
moved for a moment or two after I reached him.''
</P>
<P>
   This book's view of the world emphasizes connectedness, from
generation to generation and between the earth and its furred,
feathered and human inhabitants. Northridge sees these fragile
bonds as the pattern for human love, the best of all willable
emotions in a landscape of pain and sorrow. Even as an adolescent,
Northridge could manage to feel both awe and love in the midst of
fear; he remembers facing the terrifying tribal elders of a girl
whom he had impermissibly (being only half Indian and therefore, in
their view, white) pursued: ``These were not Methodist Indians but
warriors with a lineage that owed nothing to the white man. We did
not live upon the same earth that they did and we flatter ourselves
when we think we understand them. To pity these men is to pity the
gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the novel's narrative voices so fills the mind that no
other seems possible. Then suddenly another is speaking, equally
convincingly, apparently whirling away with different concerns but
in time woven into interlacing stories of cousins, daughters,
friends, dogs, horses, heartbreak, folly, violence and illness.
Hard on the death of the gentle John Wesley Northridge 2d, the
voice of his great-grandson Nelse seems at first a belligerent
slacker whine. But as the young man discovers and rejoins the
family from which he was severed at birth -- when Dalva, then 15,
was forced to give him up for adoption -- his deepening knowledge
of the never-ending waste of Indian greatness darkens the novel's
tone shade by shade, edging toward the anguish and compassion that
are the irrecusable estate of his bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   The nature-nurture conundrum that runs throughout ``The Road
Home'' comes nearest the surface in Nelse's narrative, in which
adoption removes him from Northridge nurture even as his Northridge
nature drives him back into the arms of his biological family.
Nevertheless, Harrison repeatedly insists that having Indian blood
does not make Nelse -- or his grandfather, for that matter -- an
Indian. (``Though I was half Lakota,'' the old man observes, ``I
lived as a white man and that's what mattered.'') Do these
narrators sound so much alike because of their shared nature -- or
is each speaker an inflection of the author's sensibility? Surely,
the answer is both; the coexistence of contradictions, as
Grandfather Northridge makes clear, is a problem only for those who
do not pay full attention to life.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's voice is at its richest in the older narrators,
particularly Naomi Northridge, the widow of John W. 3d and the
mother of Dalva. Her history is the obverse of Nelse's: without
Northridge blood but immersed in Northridge heritage, she has
escaped the family curses of violence and excessive introspection,
and she shares their gifts for contemplation and bold action. ``I'm
just Naomi,'' she says, ``definitely an older woman looking at the
moon and stars, ordinary as the earth they shine down upon'' --
which is to say, not ordinary at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HOME-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: ordinary at all.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Northridge, the fourth narrator, the brother of Naomi's
dead husband, also finds exaltation in the everyday. Echoing Yeats,
he wonders ``how you make your soul clap its hands and sing.'' The
answer, he discovers at last, lies in ``my very ordinariness,''
which leads him back home. ``The central thing about loving
someone,'' he concludes, ``is that it very much made you want to
continue living.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalva returns, in middle age, as the last narrator, reunited
with her son and, like her uncle, drawn by a mysterious magnetism
back to the Sand Hills of Nebraska. If, ultimately, this novel
offers the sort of practical wisdom suggested by the title of
Wallace Stevens's great poem ``How to Live. What to Do,'' Dalva
takes us to its home, a place beyond speech -- ``the natural world,
the grace of the divinely ordinary.'' In the mind that is
sufficiently mindful, the world as it is is enough, and
transcendence is not necessary. Love is always available, inside
oneself, to be lavished on ``the sound of horses eating oats, the
crunch,'' on ``birds and flowers, including also bird and flower
shadows,'' on ``the presence of underground rivers.'' For Dalva,
this even extends to ``my first car, the aqua convertible,'' and to
``a rooster named Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Such awareness makes the ordinary extraordinary, the unnamable
unforgettable. To read this book is to feel the luminosity of
nature in one's own being.

  The Politics of Girls' Anger 
 By Lyn Mikel Brown 
 259 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $24.95 
 ------ 
 OPHELIA FIGHTS BACK 
 By REBECCA MEAD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been seven years since a much-discussed study by the
American Association of University Women identified the phenomenon
of girls' diminishing sense of self-worth as they approach
adolescence. Since then, books like Mary Pipher's blockbuster
``Reviving Ophelia'' have further lamented the evaporation of young
girls' feistiness into hesitancy and self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Mikel Brown, who is an education and human development
professor at Colby College, takes a different tack. In ``Raising
Their Voices,'' she argues that the popular reception of such books
has all but ignored an equally significant phenomenon -- girls who
``actively resist dominant cultural notions of femininity.'' Girls
question the weakling role assigned to them, Brown says; she
approvingly quotes one of her defiant young subjects as asking,
``Who exactly is Ophelia?'' -- a comment she interprets not as an
indictment of the school's English literature department but as an
encouraging instance of ``refusal and resistance.'' She worries
that the current rhetoric of low self-esteem ``has become a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' and this book is an attempt to provide
an alternative prophecy, with the hope that it, likewise, will be
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest for productive anger, Brown listened over the
course of a year to two small groups of girls from 11 to 14: the
first from the working-class town of Mansfield, Me.; the second,
from a far more affluent town nearby, Acadia. Brown, who in 1992
was co-author with Carol Gilligan of ``Meeting at the Crossroads,''
another study of adolescent girls, hypothesized that Mansfield's
working-class girls would be the more active in their resistance to
social pressures; and the Mansfield girls have indeed learned about
female toughness. (She quotes one girl explaining why she wouldn't
fight with her mother: ``You should see her arms, she's got
muscles!'') More significant, these girls do not for the most part
fall prey to the anxieties that the contemporary literature would
have us believe are endemic among adolescents: one girl who,
feeling cold, had refused to take her coat off in a classroom,
recounts with scorn a teacher's interpretation that she is going
through a phase where she dislikes her body.
</P>
<P>
   The Acadia girls, whose lives are so much more cushioned, are
far less comfortable in their skins. School is a fraught hierarchy,
in which they are lorded over by the ``popular'' girls whom they
both disparage and envy. When it comes to the middle-class girls,
Brown seems to be stretching to find instances of nonconformity;
for the most part, the girls accept the prevalent female
stereotypes, referring to classmates as ``sluts'' or ``airheads.''
You almost get the impression that she would like to prescribe
poverty for them to force them into rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's thesis that working-class girls are better equipped to
avoid the epidemics of American adolescence is provocative, but her
study is conducted on what social scientists call a ``convenience
sample,'' one that came easily to hand rather than one selected to
be representative. And while Brown, whose work is unhappily
jargon-ridden, has a sharp ear for the ``ventriloquation'' of
sexist stereotypes, she is less attuned to the possibility that her
subjects may be mouthing feminist dictums -- as when a 13-year-old
tells her that ``a lot of what makes me mad is a society that
ideals the perfect woman,'' a phrase that strikes the reader as
learned rather than felt.
</P>
<P>
   Brown tries to strike an optimistic note, saying that it is
important to learn from girls' ``outspokeness.'' But she betrays
her pessimism when, in conclusion, she quotes a line from Susanna
Kaysen's memoir of mental illness, ``Girl, Interrupted'': ``It is
easy to slip into a parallel universe.'' Brown applies Kaysen's
words to the transition between girlhood and womanhood; Kaysen,
though, was talking about the movement from sanity into madness.
For Brown, it seems, one shift is not so different from the other.

THE SEARCH FOR THE GIANT SQUID
</HEADLINE>
  By Richard Ellis 
 Illustrated. 322 pp. New York: The Lyons Press. $35 
 ------ 
 THE BIG CALAMARI 
 By LAURA MILLER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the more than 50,000 species in the phylum Mollusca, few can
be said to possess much allure. Gastronomes might argue for the
more delectable bivalves -- oysters, scallops and clams -- but only
one genus fulfills the old Romantic formula for the sublime by
combining beauty with terror: Architeuthis, the giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty is harder to see. As for the terror, humanity has
been fabricating vicious intentions for Architeuthis since the
first specimens washed ashore and inspired legends of the kraken
and the sea serpent, as Richard Ellis exhaustively demonstrates in
``The Search for the Giant Squid.'' Jules Verne's ``Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea,'' and especially the Walt Disney movie based
on his novel, are touchstones for most contemporary squid fanciers,
who thrilled as children to the sight of Kirk Douglas on the deck
of the Nautilus, fending off malevolent tentacles with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Architeuthis evades us. ``No one has ever seen a
living, healthy giant squid,'' Ellis maintains. The creature
inhabits the deep ocean, surfacing only when dead or dying. Its
home -- utterly dark and icily cold, under the pressure of
thousands of feet of seawater -- is as alien to human beings as
outer space, and as inaccessible. As a result, the giant squid
presents us with zoology's last grand mystery. Architeuthis, which
can grow to a maximum (known) length of 60 feet, is one of the
largest animals on earth, but we know next to nothing about it --
not its hunting and breeding habits, or its life-span, or even its
geographical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, we pursue it. In 1997, an expedition led by the
Smithsonian Institution teuthologist (or squid specialist) Clyde
Roper and filmed by National Geographic sought to photograph the
giant squid in the waters off New Zealand. They used a camera
attached to the body of a sperm whale, Architeuthis's nemesis,
which produced spookily mesmerizing footage of the backs of whales
as they dived to stupendous depths. This looks like those scenes of
desert highway illuminated by the halo of a speeding car's
headlights in old film noir movies, and the expedition turned out
to be as doomed as a noir hero: no squid.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Ellis, the author of ``Imagining Atlantis'' and other
books, has compiled what little we do know about Architeuthis, and
just about everything we can surmise. It has lidless eyes as big as
dinner plates. It probably changes color depending on its mood. The
sperm whale most likely disables it with a focused sonic boom,
which enables the mammal to scoop up the stunned cephalopod. Unlike
the flesh of its smaller, edible squid cousins, Architeuthis's is
saturated with ammonium chloride, which causes it to taste like a
mouthful of household cleaner. Some of the rigorously researched
pages in ``The Search for the Giant Squid'' contain more data than
anyone but the most devoted squid buff could desire. Still, after
piling on the facts, Ellis will dash off an evocative sentence
urging his reader to ``envision the giant squid lurking almost
invisibly in the blackness of the depths, its amazing eyes able to
pick out the tiniest light or movement, its muscular tentacles
shooting out to capture its unsuspecting prey,'' and send a shiver
down your spine, the kind of shiver from which squid mania is born.

   Definitely, it starts with terror, but Architeuthis does have
its own beauty, one born of mystery. In an overlighted,
overphotographed, overdocumented, prettified world, the darkness
and its strangest creature have become precious.

T. C. BOYLE STORIES
</HEADLINE>
  The Collected Stories of T. Coraghessan Boyle 
 691 pp. New York: Viking. $35 
 ------ 
 THE DAMNED OUTNUMBER THE REST 
 By JIM SHEPARD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that I've just negotiated almost 700 pages of T. C.
Boyle's short fiction -- who else of his generation could have
assembled, by this point, a ``Collected Stories'' the size of the
Phoenix white pages? -- and I'm not sick to death of it attests to
its overall inventiveness, flash and just plain entertainment
value. Everything is here, each of the stories from Boyle's four
previous collections plus seven new stories, a staggering 68 in
all: the blasphemous and the hilarious, the maddening and the
moving, the weak and the strong.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his career, Boyle has been compared to
everybody but Sappho, and there's probably no escaping
name-dropping when discussing his fiction, since he's always trying
on voices and forms, rummaging through the toy box and pulling out,
for his own purposes, other people's shticks. He has S. J.
Perelman's affection for the absurdities of pop culture as starting
point (``De Rerum Natura'' begins, ``The inventor is in his
laboratory, white smock, surgical mask, running afoul of the laws
of nature'') as well as his understanding of the comic potential of
craven narrators propelled mostly by their baser instincts: libido,
hunger, self-preservation. He has Robert Coover's wicked sense of
the flimsiness of our received cultural representations of goodness
and virtue. (In the early and hilarious ``Heart of a Champion,''
Lassie's rigorous A.K.C. morality and trouble-at-the-dam heroism
give way to her darker impulses.) He has Donald Barthelme's gift
for deadpan comic premises (``The Hit Man'' begins, ``The Hit Man's
early years are complicated by the black bag that he wears over his
head'') and for Osterizing high and low culture: ``The son
threatened to waste his father. He did not, restrained no doubt by
considerations of filial loyalty and the deep-seated taboos against
patricide that permeate the universal unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the parodies, which have as their usual M.O.
the collision of the canon with the mingy, statureless aspects of
contemporary culture. Kafka's hunger artist becomes a
publicity-grubbing cross between one of the Wallendas and Evel
Knievel. ``The Overcoat II'' puts a Soviet spin on the travails of
Gogol's hapless protagonist. Hemingway takes a double beating, once
for ``The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber'' (this time the
female sports Banana Republic shorts and an N.R.A. marksmanship
award) and once for ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' with Robert
Jordan's cowardly and inept slacker of a grandson fighting contras
in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Are Norsemen'' posits a Woody Allen type as a warrior bard
singing of mayhem and plunder. (``Some of us wore our twin-horned
battle helmets, the sight of which interrupts the vital functions
of our victims and enemies and inspires high-keyed vibrato.'') And
``Green Hell'' levels the whole travel-disaster subgenre with one
swipe, confirming that no one does cartoon catastrophe with more
panache: ``The plane is nosing for the ground at a 45-degree angle,
engines wheezing, spewing smoke and feathers. Lights flash,
breathing apparatus drops and dangles. Our drinks become lariats,
the glasses knives.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is drawn to that ``look of the mad saint,'' to the
obsessive, the mortifier of the flesh. He's like ``Flannery
O'Connor with a television and no church,'' as Lorrie Moore once
put it, and at first glance his landscapes -- full of comic
ignorance, incipient violence and the continual oppressive sense of
an unsparing judgment about to be rendered -- strongly resemble
O'Connor's. But setting his energetic godlessness aside, Boyle's
work seems more Calvinist than Catholic: most of the time, the
question of who's among the elect and who's damned -- the latter
stupendously outnumbering the former -- seems inexorably
predetermined. In a world divided into predators and a kind of
evolutionary backwash that constitutes their prey, the
socioeconomic group that can be described as ``the end product of
psychosomatic dieting and the tanning salon'' is singled out for
repeated scourging. Special contempt is heaped upon ``the miser,
the hoarder, the burrowing squirrel.'' The collection opens with
``Modern Love,'' about a woman who brings disposable sanitary
sheets to public theaters and requests a ``full-body condom'' when
making love, and closes with ``Filthy With Things,'' about a
married couple suffering from ``acquisitive disorders.'' A nether
ring of Boyle's Inferno seems reserved for real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a continuing preoccupation with the approaching
apocalypse, as well as the thematic motif of yuppie fecklessness
and complicity in the face of disaster. In ``A Bird in Hand,'' 10
million birds assault a homeowner's little grove of trees while his
wife is ``concentrating on a tricky picot stitch.'' Far better, in
this worldview, either to get down into the muck, to ``partake once
more of the seething life of pond, puddle and ditch,'' or become
the predator (animals throughout these stories -- whales,
elephants, even frogs -- represent a Lawrentian model of
decisiveness and passion) and be shaken to your primordial root by
``the pounce, the slash, the crack of sinew and bone . . .
terrifying and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BOYLE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: wonderful.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, there's a lot of playing at badness -- characters
who ``thought they were hip and depraved, thought they were
nihilists and libertines, thought they'd invented sex'' -- and a
lot of the real thing. Boyle is chillingly good at noncomic
psychos, whether they're stalking a solitary forest ranger in her
fire tower in ``Sitting on Top of the World'' or mailing apiarian
death threats to adoptive parents in ``King Bee.'' The apogee of
this Darwinian strain may be found in what might be called the
Konrad stories: in ``Descent of Man,'' the evolutionary weakness of
humans is enacted by the narrator's realization that he's losing
his scientist lover to Konrad, an increasingly intimidating
chimpanzee. In its sequel, ``The Ape Lady in Retirement,'' Konrad
returns to enact, with a different woman, one of the collection's
most explicit versions of a thumb-wrestling match between Eros and
Thanatos.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comedy in Boyle's work resides in his similes, and
in the offhand or theatrical harshness of the worldview they
reveal: ice in a glass rattles like ``loose teeth spat into a
cup.'' Someone's eyes seem to ``swell out of his head like
hard-cooked eggs extruded through the sockets.'' Such similes can
be strung together to further bury a still-twitching victim: a
daughter's hand lies across a father's palm ``like a demolished
building, a cement truck, glacial moraine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to read 68 of these stories without becoming convinced
of the advantages of a ``Selected'' -- as opposed to ``Collected''
-- ``Works.'' Some stories echo one another. (``Hopes Rise'' seems
to be a later and more successful version of ``Whales Weep.'')
Boyle is a particularly premise-driven writer, and for every great
idea played out with wit and ingenuity -- ``I Dated Jane Austen,''
or Idi Amin as the centerpiece of a Dada festival, or a Beat
Christmas with Jack and the gang all underfoot in Mrs. Kerouac's
living room while Mario Lanza blares carols on the radio -- there's
a premise so well trammeled that you can't help wondering if it was
taken on as some sort of challenge. There's the warmed-over
Sartre-meets-Kafka of ``The Big Garage'' and the ``Tales From the
Crypt'' tire-iron irony of ``The Devil and Irv Cherniske,'' in
which a yuppie sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for more
material goods. In ``Hard Sell,'' a publicity flack negotiates a
makeover for the Ayatollah. ``The Little Chill'' stamps flat the
self-absorbed concerns of Lawrence Kasdan's film. It's like
watching 16-inch guns blow long-since-riddled wrecks out of the
water. In the least interesting of these stories, the protagonists
are straw dummies who get steamrollered and dragged to and fro to
demonstrate that it's a ferocious world out there. In the best --
stories like ``If the River Was Whiskey,'' ``The Fog Man,''
``Without a Hero'' and ``Stones in My Passway, Hellhound on My
Trail'' -- a genuine sadness is glimpsed amid all the suffering,
and the feelings generated are not simply visceral.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Boyle fans is that his more recent stories
suggest an increasing willingness to stay committed to the human
beings under examination. ``Mexico,'' one of the newest, renders
with heartbreaking empathy, rather than contempt, ``the voice of a
loser, a fat man, the maker of bad guesses and worse decisions.''
Which is a development the author may have foreseen as far back as
``De Rerum Natura'' in 1976. In that story, an all-powerful and
endlessly quirky inventor is asked, ``And which of your myriad
inventions gives you the greatest personal satisfaction?'' He
answers, ``Those to come.''

THE SHADOW UNIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
  The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses 
 By Alan Charles Kors and Harvey A. Silverglate 
 415 pp. New York: The Free Press. $27.50 
 ------ 
 P.C. 101 
 By SAM TANENHAUS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do we really need another tract on the sins of higher education?
Haven't we been told more than we ever wanted to know about the
offenses committed in academia in the name of political correctness
and multiculturalism? The opening pages of ``The Shadow
University'' aren't promising. We meet once more the durable cast
of villains: aging 60's radicals, grim-lipped feminists,
sensitivity enforcers. Worse, the authors' prose bears down on us
with all the nuance of a dropped anvil. ``Universities have become
the enemy of a free society,'' they declare, ``and it is time for
the citizens of that society to recognize this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Charles Kors, a professor of history at the University
of Pennsylvania, and Harvey A. Silverglate, a civil liberties
lawyer, deliver the unexpected. Refreshingly, they seem to believe
that even if professors teach what they wish, Western civilization
will survive. What does concern them is the threat to free
expression posed by the advent of campus speech codes -- adopted,
according to one survey, by 60 percent of American colleges and
universities as of 1989 -- and by the profusion of diversity
workshops and the like. The goal of this enormous program of
enlightenment may be laudable, the authors concede. The trouble is
that far too few institutions encourage free discussion, and far
too many promote ``censorship, indoctrination, intimidation,
official group identity and groupthink.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty members with the temerity to challenge the
new orthodoxy are not dealt with kindly. Many of the most ludicrous
examples cited in this book have received ample attention, like the
case of the University of Pennsylvania freshman threatened with
disciplinary action because, in a fit of pique, he called noisy
members of an African-American sorority ``water buffalo.'' But the
authors also describe more obscure cases, for instance that of a
sociology professor denounced by feminist colleagues for an article
he had written justifying patriarchy on the grounds that its roots
were biological. The professor was dismissed, as was a dean who
intervened on his behalf. Curiously, the institution in question
was not a left-wing redoubt but a conservative Baptist university
in Dallas. Stories like this, the authors say, are repeated in
every region of the country and at every variety of educational
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most usefully, Kors and Silverglate provide an unsparing picture
of how campus authorities settle these cases. More often than not
the accused are prohibited from mounting even a minimal defense.
They are barred from questioning those who have lodged complaints
against them and from calling witnesses of their own. In addition,
there is a double standard. Conservative white heterosexual men,
the authors observe, are monitored like parolees, while
homosexuals, feminists and people of color get away with
comparative murder. Kors and Silverglate report that ``the theft of
student publications at universities is pandemic.'' The majority of
the stolen publications are conservative, and ``in most instances,
the thefts occur with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, Kors and Silverglate are old-fashioned civil
libertarians who support everyone's right to sound off. While most
victims of speech codes these days seem to be on the right, the
authors also deplore attempts by Emerson College to censor the rap
music played on the campus radio station. And they criticize the
City College of New York for ejecting Leonard Jeffries, a professor
of African-American Studies, from his departmental chairmanship
because of his inflammatory opinions about Jews and the slave
trade.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of good news about all this is that the press, so
often maligned of late, has covered the issue closely. Many of the
injustices described in ``The Shadow University'' were first
reported in newspapers. This shouldn't be surprising. Even the
shabbiest journalist knows the value of free speech. Kors and
Silverglate have performed a useful service too. The abuses they
describe need fixing, and this cogent book should help.

THE SIXTIES
</HEADLINE>
  Cultural Revolution in Britain, France, Italy, and the United
States, c.1958-c.1974 
 ON THE BARRICADES 
 By ELLEN WILLIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The right's passionate hatred of the man Newt Gingrich called a
``counterculture McGovernik'' propels an all-out effort to destroy
him for offending traditional sexual morality. Most of the American
public resists the jihad, barely reacts to the explicit sexual
detail in the Starr report and seems inclined to think consensual
sex is not the state's business. It's not yet clear which viewpoint
will prevail. But whatever the resolution of the presidential
scandal, it is one more proof -- as if any were needed -- that 30
years after the fact, the conglomeration of events and symbols
known as ``the '60s'' refuses to fade into history.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the issues raised by the rebellious '60s remain
unresolved; debate on the meaning of the '60s is as contentious as
ever. Nor of course are these only American concerns. ``The
Sixties,'' Arthur Marwick's expansive narrative of the era's events
and consequences, takes as its starting point the contested legacy
of those tumultuous years in four countries: the United States,
England, France and Italy. Against this broad backdrop Marwick, a
British cultural historian, explores the question, can what
happened in the '60s be called a cultural revolution?
</P>
<P>
   The right has never doubted that the '60s were exactly that --
an unmitigated disaster for conservative social values. Not so the
left. In the United States, most liberals and leftists see the
civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements as the decade's major
achievements, while regarding its cultural radicalism as a
frivolous, if not positively destructive, distraction from ``real''
politics. In Europe, judging from Marwick's account, the idea that
the '60s were a missed opportunity for a Marxist revolution still
has currency on the left. As for those who come from the cultural
movements themselves -- at least in America -- many feminist, black
and gay rights advocates, beleaguered by racial and sexual
backlash, insist that little has been accomplished, that racist and
patriarchal institutions remain essentially unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the views about the '60s, the right's seems to me the
most accurate. The very virulence of the conservative reaction and
the continuing turmoil over cultural issues attest to the erosion
of social norms that were once taken for granted; it's
conservatives' frustration over their inability to translate their
political dominance into cultural hegemony that leads to episodes
like the Starr inquisition. This is Marwick's judgment as well. As
he sees it, the '60s (a period he defines as stretching from 1958
to 1974) resulted in a genuine and lasting '' 'revolution,' or
'transformation' in material conditions, life styles, family
relationships and personal freedoms for the vast majority of
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   The signature events of the '60s -- the emergence of the
Beatles, the Berkeley and Columbia uprisings, May '68 in Paris and
so on -- are in Marwick's view only the dramatic flashpoints of a
pervasive breakdown of rigid social rules and hierarchies, in which
widespread affluence, the influence of young people, the explosion
of mass media and the development of an international popular
culture played vital roles. Taking as his purview every aspect of
the '60s -- from the early stirrings of artistic experiment, civil
rights activism and sexual rebellion to black power and the Vietnam
War to the emergence of radical feminism and gay liberation -- he
marshals in exhaustive and often exhausting detail the
cross-national evidence for his thesis. Youth magazines in France,
the introduction of divorce in Italy, student protest at the London
School of Economics, the desegregation of universities in the
American South, all appear as pieces in a mosaic of change that
stretched across the West.
</P>
<P>
   Marwick rejects the view, held by most '60s rebels and their
enemies alike, that the cultural revolt he describes was about
destroying the bourgeois social order. The champions of this
apocalyptic project he labels ``Marxisant,'' a catch-all term for
various ideologies that share ``a broad metaphysical view about
history and about how society works, derived from Marxism.''
Marxisant thinking, he says, assumes the existence of ``the
dialectic'' -- the emergence of a new cultural synthesis from the
conflict between bourgeois society and its opposition -- for which,
Marwick declares, ``there is no more evidence . . . than there is
for the existence of 'the Holy Ghost.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he cites his commitment to ``nonmetaphysical,
source-based, scientific history'' as the basis of his own
conclusion that the countercultural movements ``did not confront .
. . society but permeated and transformed it.'' Most of the
cultural innovations of the '60s ``were thoroughly imbued with the
entrepreneurial, profit-making ethic.'' Furthermore, Marwick
argues, established institutions were for the most part managed by
liberals who reacted with ``measured judgment'' to the '60s
protesters and accommodated many of their demands. When
confrontations did occur, they were caused by failures of measured
judgment, in the form of intransigent authorities and
out-of-control police.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quarrel with Marwick's contempt for the '60s fantasy of
revolution, which started with blinky-eyed delusions that the
echt-commercial enterprise of rock-and-roll was anticapitalist,
progressed to the notion that provoking the police would expose the
true, fascist nature of the system and ended by producing real
bombs. But he oversimplifies the relationship between the culture
of the '60s and its politics.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he doesn't understand the extent to which liberal
authorities' ``measured judgment'' was contingent on radical
militance and the threat of social disruption. Like the society in
general, many liberal politicians, university administrators and
other heads of institutions were genuinely influenced by the
cultural radicals' ideas, but by and large their first concern was
stability. Radicals' disregard for accepted limits made them
nervous, and their impulse was to head off trouble by making
concessions. Radicals, for their part, understood that it was only
by being uncompromising that they would get anything at all; and in
fact reforms like legal abortion and clean air and water standards
would never have been won without radical agitation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SIXTIES-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: radical agitation.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marwick's assumption of an essential harmony between the '60s
counterculture and capitalism is also too simple. The dynamic,
entrepreneurial economy of the '60s was indeed an engine of
cultural experiment. But there is another face of capitalism: the
corporation, with its authoritarian, hierarchical bureaucracy and
its subordination of human values to the discipline of the bottom
line. Cultural radicalism, with its celebration of freedom and
pleasure and its resistance to compulsive, alienated work, is
always a potential threat to the corporate system, however
profitable its music, art and favored technological toys may be.
It's unfortunate that Marwick has succumbed to the reflexive,
sweeping dismissal of Marx that (like the parallel dismissal of
Freud) is now the intellectual fashion. If he had been able to
entertain the concept of dialectics, not as a dogmatic prescription
for social theory but as a useful way of thinking about
contradictions, his grasp of the political '60s would be more
nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   Marwick's ``nonmetaphysical,'' resolutely empirical approach to
history has another drawback: ``The Sixties'' suffers from his
effort to pack so much material into a single volume. The result is
an overload of information that, paradoxically, calls attention to
what's left out (Germany, which rates only a couple of references,
is a glaring example). The author's treatment of some subjects (pop
music, for instance) is inexcusably sketchy. At the same time, he
often lets his historian's interest in trees distract him from the
analytical forest, leading him to go on about other subjects --
John Updike's ``Rabbit, Run,'' the liberalizing of liquor laws in
Memphis -- at a length far out of proportion to their significance.
There's something to be said for the sheer weight of facts
documenting the extent of change. Yet a more selective, more
focused narrative would have added considerably to the rhetorical
power of Marwick's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``The Sixties'' is an important and timely
contribution to public debate. The conventional wisdom about the
'60s -- that its achievements were either trivial or evil -- has
helped produce Americans' current pessimism about the possibility
of change. Those who fail to understand their history may or may
not be doomed to repeat it, but they are certainly unable to build
on it. Marwick shows that we have something to build on.

 ONE MAN'S AMERICA: 
 A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His Country 
 By Henry Grunwald 
 Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former editor in chief of Time Inc. tells of how he arrived
here in 1940 as a 17-year-old Viennese refugee and worked his way
into the house that Henry Luce built, which gave him a terrific
vantage point on his adopted country. This memoir ``percolates with
anecdote, insight and charm,'' Robert W. Merry wrote here last
year.

</P>
<P>
   Most of these 55 tales focus on Jews of amazing variety,
laboring or wandering under the weight of conscience. Whether grim
dramas of workaday existence or ruminations on the meaning of love,
the best stories meld the allegorical and the everyday and brim
with ethical concerns, from the burdens of capitalism to the
enormity of the Holocaust. ``There must be many readers who will be
grateful to 'The Complete Stories' for prompting a return to
Malamud,'' Walter Goodman wrote in these pages in 1997. '' 'Is
morality a necessary part of fiction?' one of his characters asks.
The answer, in Malamud's revelatory work, remains a resounding
yes.''

</P>
<P>
   In recounting more than 300 years in the life of what is now the
six-million-acre Adirondack Park, the author argues that wilderness
is not only a human invention but a New York invention. This is ``a
thoroughly readable and entertaining tour'' of the preserve and the
Indians, trappers, redcoats, magnates and others who have passed
through, James Gorman said here last year. Heart and Blood: Living
With Deer in America, by Richard Nelson (Vintage Departures, $14),
raises difficult questions about our complex relationship to deer
and wildlife in general, and tackles the troubling ethical and
ecological contradictions of hunting in the modern age. Last year
our reviewer, Robert Finch, called this ``a brave and beautifully
rendered work.''

   &UR; THE MOORING OF STARTING OUT: &QL; 
 &UR; The First Five Books of Poetry &QL; 
 &UR; By John Ashbery &QL; 
 &UR; Ecco Press, $18 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first five collections of poems (1956-72), the celebrated
author reveals his twin obsessions with self-evasion and
self-renewal, and his enthusiasm for complex poetic schemes and
outre forms of lyricism. ``The elusiveness and mysterious promise
of his lines remind us that we always have a future and a condition
of meaningfulness to start out toward,'' Nicholas Jenkins wrote
here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOOK OF FAMOUS IOWANS &QL; 
 &UR; By Douglas Bauer &QL; 
 &UR; Owl/Holt, $12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged man tries to make sense of his mother's scandalous
affair when he was a boy in a small Iowa town, a betrayal that
continues to haunt him as an adult. Last year in the Book Review,
Douglas Unger called this a ``moving and lyrical'' novel that
``gracefully works its way back and forth in time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALMOST NO MEMORY: STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; By Lydia Davis &QL; 
 &UR; Ecco Press, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many of the characters in these inventive tales, the past is
disturbing, while the present is strange and vivid. Last year our
reviewer, Liam Callanan, said the author writes ``in compressed
prose that is frequently poetic and, without question, memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAST WISH &QL; 
 &UR; By Betty Rollin &QL; 
 &UR; Public Affairs, $12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this revised account of the author's personal encounter with
the assisted suicide issue, she describes what happened when her
terminally ill mother asked that she help her commit suicide in
1983. ``Rollin's loving portrait of her mother's life . . . is as
compelling as the account of her death,'' Susan Jacoby said here in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEMOIRS &QL; 
 &UR; By Sir Georg Solti &QL; 
 &UR; A Cappella, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renowned conductor, who died last year at the age of 84,
looks back on an astonishing career driven by an irresistible
addiction to making music. The result is a ``zestful book by a man
whose motto was 'Never Give Up' and whose appetite for work and
life comes across as genuinely inspiring,'' Paul Driver wrote here
in 1997. Bernstein: A Biography, by Joan Peyser (Billboard,
$19.95), which was originally published three years before Leonard
Bernstein's death in 1990, has been revised and updated. In 1987
our reviewer, Leon Botstein, found the profile to be gossipy and
repetitious, but said ``Peyser has managed to convey the magnitude
and range of Mr. Bernstein's talent and achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VAPORETTO 13 &QL; 
 &UR; By Robert Girardi &QL; 
 &UR; Delta, $11.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An American banker in Venice becomes obsessed with a mysterious
young woman with a cool touch who will meet him only at night. Last
year our reviewer, Malachy Duffy, said this ``artful novel ...
invites us to put aside our rational skepticism and enter a world
where the past is still hauntingly present.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MATTERS OF CHANCE &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeannette Haien &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Perennial, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of this large novel is Morgan Shurtliff, a
wealthy Midwesterner whose character is tested during World War II
and after, when he returns to a changing country. ``Haien
charmingly takes us through more than three decades of one family's
pleasures and sorrows,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote here in 1997.

EXTRA LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  Coming of Age in Cyberspace 
 By David S. Bennahum 
 238 pp. New York: Basic Books. $23 
 ------ 
 NOTHING BUT NET 
 By J. D. BIERSDORFER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to age, generations use cultural milestones as
markers along the highway of life. The baby boomers, for instance,
were not only midwives to the birth of rock-and-roll but also
witnesses to the rise of television as a popular entertainment and
informational medium. In ``Extra Life: Coming of Age in
Cyberspace,'' David S. Bennahum notes that the generation known as
X was the first to incorporate a new home technology into its
ethos: computers. ``As computers entered our homes, we were
defining a new culture through gleeful experimentation,'' he
writes, ``one that with the Internet in the 1990's would become
dominant, capturing as much attention as did rebellion in the
1960's or jazz in the 1920's.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennahum, a contributing editor of Wired, Spin and Lingua
Franca, has written a laid-back autobiography of opinionated
observation. Memoirs of people under 30 (with the possible
exception of Drew Barrymore) often run out of interesting anecdotes
because there has not been a whole lot of living done yet. ``Extra
Life'' neatly sidesteps this pitfall, because Bennahum relives not
only his own youth but that of the personal computer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like many memoirs, the book longs for a simpler time. Instead of
``Howdy Doody'' and Beatle wigs, Bennahum, born in 1968, wistfully
recalls learning BASIC code writing from a manual, programming
modems by hand and enthusiastically sharing his computer knowledge
with his buddies. ``To know the machine as we did, so intimately,
is to forever change the way we experience our machine-mediated
world,'' he observes. In many ways, he is a classic poster child
for those of us who came of age in the late 70's and early 80's.
(Full disclosure: I'm 31.) The family moved frequently, his parents
divorced when he was young and, mired in adolescent angst, Bennahum
discovered, as many of us did, the magical world of pixels and
programming through Pong, a popular arcade video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was the first generation to have toys that bore little
relation to the world of adults, or reality on this planet,'' he
recalls. ``They came from a galaxy far, far away, as the opening
titles to 'Star Wars' suggested.'' With gadgets like these and some
preteen experimentation with drugs enlightening his lonely
Manhattan childhood, Bennahum takes his interest to the next level.
Bargaining with his father, he strikes a deal -- his dad will buy
him a home computer in exchange for excluding his hoodlum friends
from his bar mitzvah's invitation list. With an Atari 800, 48
kilobytes of RAM and a cable to attach the thing to a television
set to convert the screen into a monitor, he's off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book dwells too long on certain details of his life
(his youthful druggie days bring to mind ``The Basketball
Diaries,'' except with Upper East Side nerds), Bennahum sticks to a
steady narrative pace and re-creates well his mind-set and
childhood loneliness. In a memorable chapter, he alternates his
recollections with the script of a computerized role-playing game
to amplify his explanations of just why computers enticed him so
and how he applies basic computing principles to his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like amateur acousticians who prefer the sound of analog vinyl
records to digital compact disks, Bennahum is a purist. After
examining the past, he voices his concerns for the future, worrying
about the commercialization of the Internet and fearing that slick
off-the-shelf software with easy-to-use interfaces will keep people
from truly understanding their machines (whether they want to is
another matter). ``Such camouflaged technology changes into
wizardry or sorcery, becoming the alchemy of our time,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   With low-key but astute introspection, ``Extra Life'' strips the
surface layers to find the roots of both a generation -- one expert
at converting alienation into self-sufficiency -- and one of its
milestones. A milestone that, in Bennahum's view, ``would cross
over and become a rich part of our culture, world culture. . . . A
new media. . . . Here is where it would happen -- not at Microsoft,
or in some mysterious research lab. It would happen out here, built
by us, for ourselves.''

CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  By MARILYN STASIO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's this boat, see, all sparkly bright and gleaming in the
sun, sailing up the Hudson River to Albany. To the New York state
legislators who voted to give it a trial run as a riverboat casino,
the pretty cruise ship represents a legitimate source of new
revenue. But to the bold thieves standing on the shore in Richard
Stark's dazzling crime caper ``Backflash'' (Mysterious Press/
Warner, $20), the Spirit of the Hudson looks like ``a big shiny
white empty box, going upriver to be filled with money.''
</P>
<P>
   The meticulous planning that goes into their ingenious heist is
typical of Stark (Donald E. Westlake, in noir humor) and of Parker,
the master strategist of this series, who organizes a crack team of
professional con men and killers -- each and every one an artiste
at his trade -- to empty the pretty white box of its newly
accumulated loot. Parker spares no detail and leaves nothing to
chance; but he can't control the human wild cards that run amok in
this deck, and before you can say ``Deal me out,'' the delicate
infrastructure of his brilliant scheme begins to topple in a wave
of panicky violence. The cool killings that resolve this setback
are as skillfully managed as the steel-nerved dialogue and
cold-blooded code of honor that give Parker's gang its peculiar
charm. Meanwhile, anyone who took this trip for the sightseeing can
hang over the side of the Spirit of the Hudson and marvel at the
wonderful life studies Stark makes of the proud old towns clinging
to the edges of a time that has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   The ardent feminism that distinguishes Anne Perry's Victorian
mysteries finds its ideal focus in ``A Breach of Promise'' (Fawcett
Columbine, $25), which hinges on the scandalous public trial of
Killian Melville, once widely admired as ``the most brilliant,
dazzling, creative architect of the age'' but now despised for
weaseling out of a promise to marry his patron's daughter. The
distraught genius engages Sir Oliver Rathbone to present his case
but refuses to tell his barrister why he cannot, under any
circumstances, marry the girl. In his puzzlement, Rathbone turns to
William Monk, the private inquiry agent who has uncovered many a
horror in this series, and to Hester Latterly, who is currently
caring for a young officer gravely wounded in India.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the jarring coincidence that sets up the resolution,
the story is full of feeling and weighted with intelligent thought
about the status of women in mid-Victorian society. Outraged by
``the whole forced performance of grooming every young woman for
marriage and . . . judging her human worth by her
marriageability,'' Perry makes an impassioned case for every person
who, like Hester's hideously disfigured patient, becomes an outcast
in society's attic.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the blues, Ace Atkins lets us know in
``Crossroad Blues'' (St. Martin's, $21.95), ``something mysterious
and dark.'' The down-and-dirty music of the Mississippi Delta sure
does tug at the hero of this frisky debut mystery, a gone-to-seed
blues historian named Nick Travers who plays harmonica at JoJo's
Blues Bar, the ``last of the old New Orleans blues joints.'' When a
rival musicologist disappears into the delta landscape with a stash
of lost recordings by the legendary Robert Johnson, Nick takes
himself upcountry to pick up the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't quite make it to the mythic crossroads in
Greenwood, Miss., where Johnson met up with the Devil, Nick does
run across a few hellbent psychos who are pretty scary, and he
interviews some old bluesmen whose scratchy voices catch the ragged
cadences and downbeat mood of the delta. Although Atkins could use
the tip on style that JoJo gives Nick on his harmonica playing
(``It wasn't about being fancy. . . . It was about bringing the
right emotion out at the right time''), when his old guys open up
you can really hear the music everybody talks about so
reverentially.
</P>
<P>
   For a bunch of liberated lesbians, the characters in Joan M.
Drury's ``Closed in Silence'' (Spinsters Ink, paper, $10.95) spend
more time talking about hair than the entire beauty salon of
Southern honeys in ``Steel Magnolias.'' In fact, Mary Sharon,
Teddie, Rachel, Grace, Julie and the narrator, Tyler Jones, have so
much to say about their looks, their lives, their loves and how,
some 20 years after graduating from college, they came to be
huddled together on an island in the San Juans, that the story is
half over before a body turns up to open the mystery. But if
efficient storytelling is not Drury's strong suit, she certainly
knows how to establish the right atmosphere for a whodunit. That
probably doesn't say much for a book that tries with deadly
earnestness to deliver meaningful insights into character and
relationships. But for what it's worth, Drury has a knack for
setting a scene. Who knows -- she might yet get around to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   A graffito in a tough neighborhood of Edinburgh -- ``Won't
Anyone Help?'' -- tells the whole story of ``The Hanging Garden''
(St. Martin's, $24.95), another rubbed-raw police procedural in Ian
Rankin's superior series featuring his enigmatic detective, John
Rebus. This time, it's all up close and personal for Rebus, whose
daughter is made the target of a hit-and-run ``accident'' to teach
him a lesson. As she lies hospitalized in a coma, Rebus wonders
which of his current cases inspired this dreadful act of vengeance:
The distinguished scholar suspected of being a Nazi war criminal?
The gangsters fighting a vicious war to corner the market in drugs,
guns and prostitutes? Or could it be Candice, the young Serbian
woman he is trying to rescue from the white slave trade? The answer
that emerges after the customary genre rituals of violence are
observed does not address the deeper issue raised by the wall
graffito. Only Rebus does that, by caring for all the people he
tries to help. ``Their stories fascinated him,'' Rankin writes.
``When part of their lives, he could forget his own.''

 HOW I GOT THAT STORY 
 By CHRISTOPHER DICKEY 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived through combat and tried to talk about it
to someone who has not will remember the look. There is excitement,
at first. But then the listener's eyes draw away, sympathetic but
distant and, finally, simply uninterested. And you realize suddenly
that you have made your life, and your near death, a bore. So after
a while, you do not talk about the war to those who have not been
there. If you're a journalist, you write the story, publish the
picture. You talk about other things.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Anderson, a journalist who has been in many danger zones,
including Bosnia and Chechnya, knows this. So, too, do the
characters in his haunting first novel, ``Triage.'' It is a story
of war, the photographers who cover it and the people they leave
behind. It is about the insidious guilt that attaches itself to the
deaths of all those you saw dying but could not save, because you
never can: not the shrunken babies in the refugees' arms; not the
young woman whose red handprint, streaked on the wall, lingers in
the house where she had thought she would find shelter. None of
them. It is the guilt that comes from having been the ultimate
voyeur at the ultimate moment.
</P>
<P>
   The novel opens among Kurds facing an Iraqi assault in the late
1980's, another episode in a fight that only the Kurds or the
correspondents and aid workers who travel among them ever seem to
care about, ``a perpetual second-tier conflict,'' as Anderson
writes. Mark Walsh, an American freelance photographer, has been
wounded and finds himself in a hideous makeshift hospital where the
Kurdish doctor can do nothing but guess at which patients are
beyond his feeble power to heal. To make room for those coming
freshly wounded from the battlefield, the doctor tags the men he
thinks have no chance to survive; then he shoots them. The Kurdish
warriors, those proud perennial losers of Middle East history, call
themselves Pesh Merga. ``Do you know what Pesh Merga means?'' the
doctor asks Walsh. ``It means 'those who face death.' A romantic
name don't you think? Poetic. I myself have never seen one face
death; they all turn away at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is not tagged for mercy killing. He makes it out to Turkey
and back to his Spanish girlfriend in Brooklyn. But he does not
talk about what happened to him in the mountains of northern Iraq.
He does not explain what happened to the friend who went with him
to Kurdistan but did not come back. ``He kept the details of his
work to himself as if it were all some desperate secret,'' Anderson
writes. ``He would be quiet for a few days, waiting for his mind to
adjust to peacefulness the same way eyes had to adjust to the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   If only his mind would adjust. But it betrays him, and as it
does, his body begins to shut down. His legs no longer function.
The world of his apartment closes in.
</P>
<P>
   One does not feel very sorry for Walsh, in fact. We don't know
him that well. We never have any real idea why he has spent nine
years of his life photographing combat. For Walsh, as for many
other correspondents and photographers, war has become a job, a way
of life, sometimes a rush. And then it's all you know how to do. Is
there a reason that he searches out suffering thousands of miles
away from home when there is so much of it just down the street?
Walsh doesn't know, or guess, or ask. He moves along the brittle
surface of the pain that he sees, as if it had no roots in his own
experience. All we know is that his parents have retired to Fort
Lauderdale, a brother has a nice apartment in Seattle, one sister
is in San Diego and another is in Chicago. When Walsh was little,
he used to watch the evening news while sitting on his father's
lap, and sometimes it made him cry. So much for history, culture,
faith, family, all the things so important to the people he
photographs as they die in obscure wars. A typically rootless
American, Walsh can hardly begin to understand their conflicts,
their lives or their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's girlfriend, Elena, however, has a European's sense of
history. She has a woman's knack for deflating a man's pretensions
of bravery, a woman's need to know the things he will not admit. We
are not sure what has brought Elena to her barren loft with Walsh,
but we do know what she is running from: the history of the
grandfather who raised her. She has discovered that he operated a
special clinic for Franco at the end of the Spanish Civil War. Papa
Joaquin took in war criminals and ``purified'' their thoughts
before sending them back into the world. This is the inherited
guilt she lives with, and which she hopes to atone for.
</P>
<P>
   Then Joaquin insinuates himself back into her life, hoping to
cure Walsh. The old fascist is still spry, bright and unrepentant.
He is the character who gives the book its life, its grim but
genuine humor and all of its worthwhile surprises. Into the sere
landscapes of a Hemingwayesque novel about men at war comes this
Roman Catholic conscience straight out of Graham Greene, full of
doubt, anger and hard-earned, hard-edged wisdom. Joaquin was not a
voyeur, but a participant in a vast and monstrous war. ``Because
decent men never act as quickly as tyrants, the decent of both
sides were soon dispensed with. And because cruelty has always been
man's most awesome weapon -- capable of shocking entire nations,
entire peoples, into submission -- the spoils of victory went to
those who showed mercy the least, who knew cruelty the best.''
Joaquin learned in Andalusia, where history had always moved with
such cruel deliberation, ``that history was now to become like a
falling object, constantly gaining momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage'' you will find that there are a few peasants who
are far too wise, or at least too articulate, and some long
passages of dialogue that should have disappeared in earlier
drafts. And there are times when I wish Anderson's design for this
novel were a little less schematic. There are too many layers of
triage: in Kurdistan, in a New York hospital and in Joaquin's
defunct center for ``psychological purification'' -- plus the
sorting that takes place when Elena examines the files of refugees
at her job in the United Nations, or when Walsh selects his slides
on the light table. But the thought that lingers at the end of the
book remains strong. Those who look death in the face do what they
can, and it is all they can do. As reporters, as photographers,
even as voyeurs, they try to make the rest of us glimpse, at least
for one uncomfortable moment, the thing we did not want to see.

AT HOME WITH THE MARQUIS DE SADE
</HEADLINE>
  A Life 
 By Francine du Plessix Gray 
 Illustrated. 491 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $27.50 
 ------ 
 THE PORNOGRAPHER AND HIS WIFE 
 By EMILY EAKIN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing by your man has newfound respectability. Once the
province of the poor, the powerless and the naive, wifely displays
of fealty and forgiveness now meet with feminist approbation.
Today, even at the highest echelons, there is strength in
abjection, honor in stoicism, virtue in endurance. All of which
makes the timing of Francine du Plessix Gray's latest biography,
``At Home With the Marquis de Sade,'' impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray's boldly imaginative retelling, the long-suffering
spouse of history's most infamous rake becomes a praiseworthy
enabler of greatness. Through sex scandals, police raids and prison
terms, Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil de Sade, the marquis' plain,
unschooled and, to his mind, sadly underpedigreed wife, remained a
model of devotion. Though what was demanded of her -- particularly
in the conjugal bed -- might not always have been to her liking,
Pelagie, Gray writes, never wavered. While her husband languished
in the Bastille, Pelagie lived hand-to-mouth just to keep him in
cutting-edge frippery and rich desserts. During a single month in
1784, according to prison logs, she had 12 packages of strawberries
delivered to his cell. When she wasn't traipsing around Paris in
doomed efforts to satisfy his wants (``We're sending back to Mme.
de Sade the useless bonnet,'' he scolded in a typical thank-you
note. ``We doubt it would even fit a 5-year-old child''), she was
busy petitioning for his release, overseeing his real estate
holdings and paying him marital visits (she bore him a child
conceived in the Lyons jail). The single recorded exception in this
chronicle of exemplary servitude involved a request from the
marquis for custom dildos. Dutifully, Pelagie approached local
cabinetmakers, only to have them laugh in her face when they
learned the proposed objects' dimensions. ``I beg you to release me
from this errand,'' she entreated her husband, apparently to no
avail. But even this, Gray urges us to consider, was humiliation in
the name of a greater good: ``It was solely through Pelagie's love
and dedication that the Marquis de Sade's talents were able to
flower and become part of the Western heritage.'' In other words,
without his wife's tireless ministrations, the irascible marquis
might never have written a word.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, will share Gray's horror at this
thought. Once revered as a martyr of the French Revolution (``the
one complete and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history,'' Aldous
Huxley gushed), a freedom-loving philosopher of the first rank and
a novelist whose literary gifts earned him a place in the
prestigious Bibliotheque de la Pleiade, Sade has lately been
treated as a dangerous fraud. His philosophical ideas, where not
blatantly plagiarized, have been exposed as wholly derivative, and
his vaunted novels -- which one commentator likened to ``the sacred
books of the great religions'' -- viewed as pornography of a
particularly insidious kind. Roger Shattuck, perhaps the most
eloquent of contemporary Sade bashers, has deemed ``Juliette'' -- a
1,000-page orgy of rape, murder, sodomy, incest, dismemberment and
bestiality -- the literary equivalent of toxic waste. Susceptible
readers, he warns, might attempt some of these scenes at home. His
proof? Ted Bundy read the marquis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, though she turns Pelagie into something of a
cardboard saint, Gray's take on Sade is mercifully short on cant.
Obviously an admirer -- she extols his ``visionary gifts'' for
``expressing humankind's most bestial urges'' -- she is
nevertheless at pains to demystify her subject. Husband, homeowner
and parent, her Sade is more comfortable hanging out at the estate
in Provence than preening or skirt-chasing at court. From letters,
laundry lists and grocery bills, Gray extracts the temper of his
marriage, noting the tenderness (unlike most upper-class couples,
the Sades used the familiar tu form of address), the material
extravagance and the gourmandise. The affinity between husband and
wife could hardly have been greater, Gray writes: both had been
``lonely, affection-starved children.'' (In ``Sade: A Biographical
Essay,'' University of Chicago, $29, Laurence L. Bongie challenges
such an interpretation with suggestive new evidence that Sade's
mother was a far more involved and affectionate parent than
previously supposed.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus is Gray's Sade domesticated -- and thoroughly defanged. Yet
the feat is difficult to sustain. There is frustratingly little
home in ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade.'' Though his marriage
lasted 27 years, Sade spent 15 of them in jail or on the lam. Even
when he was a free man, his taste for prostitutes and kinky sex
kept him frequently on the road. Like everything else, Pelagie
seems to have taken these absences in stride, just as she looked
the other way while Sade seduced her little sister right beneath
her nose. And yet, when it came to matrimony, Gray would have us
believe, the marquis was something of a prude. ``Perhaps because of
his high regard for his wife,'' she writes, ``Sade developed a
notably idealistic view of marriage. With one exception, all of his
liaisons were held with courtesans, whores and young domestic
helpers, and he prided himself immensely on never affronting 'the
sanctity of wedlock' by committing adultery with a married woman.''
``There was no inappropriate sexual relationship,'' you can almost
hear him saying -- and believing it!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SADE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: believing it!) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Gray, however, must eventually concede defeat.
Three-quarters of the way through her book, the saintly Pelagie
deals the tale of marital idyll an unexpected blow. On the eve of
her husband's release from the Bastille, she obtains a formal
separation and promptly drops out of his life. It's an act for
which Gray seems unable to forgive her: ``Having survived greater
measures of passion and devotion than most women experience in 10
lifetimes, she returned to being the placid, conventional creature
she had been before she met Donatien de Sade. Reclusion, religious
devotion, the petty groveling of a provincial Catholic life, would
now be the measure of her days.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally entertaining but more persuasive is Gray's evocation of
historical context. The marquis' sexual and literary
transgressions, she suggests, were excessive not in kind, just
degree. Whipping and sodomy were all the rage at 18th-century
bordellos, and composing highbrow smut was a favorite pastime of
many a Provencal noble. In fact, she notes, some of the century's
finest erotica can be traced to the pen of Sade's distant cousin,
the future revolutionary Mirabeau. As for Sade himself, much of
what we know about his illicit activities, Gray justly points out,
comes from reports filed by a high-ranking inspector on the royal
vice squad, a man whose job was not to stamp out moral deviance but
to record its prevalence in exacting detail for the king's
titillation. This same monarch maintained a brothel of adolescent
beauties for his personal use in a mansion near Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Among Sade's other misfortunes, Gray contends, he was a victim
of circumstance. He was an easy target for the rebellious municipal
courts in their war against the arbitrary -- and for aristocrats
exceptionally preferential -- juridical treatment meted out by the
crown. In 1768, already in detention in a royal jail on charges of
whipping a woman until she bled, the marquis was pursued with
single-minded zeal by the Paris court, which publicly denounced his
crime and issued a (thoroughly redundant) warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The marquis, however, was a repeat offender, and no amount of
historical context can explain away his penchant for
self-destruction. Typical of his escapades, Sade blithely engaged
six adolescents to ``work'' at his estate, despite serious
continuing legal trouble and heavy surveillance by the authorities.
Six weeks later, the region was buzzing with news of wild orgies at
the castle, and the parents of the young hires were suing the
marquis on charges of abduction and seduction. Like other Sade
biographers before her, Gray at this point turns to Freud. And
while diagnoses of narcissism, delusional identity and infantile
anality may not entirely satisfy, her larger point is sound.
Lusting, raging and whining his way through life, Sade was no
revolutionary hero or infernal fiend, just one very big, very bad
baby. ``With Pelagie acquiescing like some cosmic wet nurse to his
every longing,'' Gray writes, ``he howled like an infant to be
readmitted to the paradise of instant gratification, constantly
schemed for yet stronger orgasms, yet more baroque choreographies
of desire.'' Here, presumably, lies his value as a writer: an
unmediated access to the presocialized id, to the whole terrible
underworld of the psyche that Gray believes lurks inside us all.

 Work in Progress 
 By Michael D. Eisner with Tony Schwartz 
 450 pp. New York: Random House. $27.95  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The autobiography of Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Walt
Disney, is a true Disney production: a PG-rated adventure with
broad family appeal where the hero, by dint of hard work, sound
judgment and -- yes -- brilliance, triumphs over adversity. It's
``The Lion King'' in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work in Progress'' tells the story of how a boy from an
affluent Jewish family in Manhattan first succeeded in television,
then in the movies, then in theme parks. Eisner's infatuation with
the entertainment business began during a 1963 summer vacation when
he was an NBC page on the set of ``The Price Is Right.'' After
returning for his senior year at Denison University in Ohio, he had
a passing romance with writing plays but realized he lacked the
touch when he titled his first endeavor ``To Metastasize a River.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after graduation, Eisner landed at ABC, whose
researchers had found that audiences preferred movies to any other
form of programming. Eisner, whose rise was rapid, worked with
Barry Diller to create films for television. They also improved the
network's ratings with sitcom hits like ``Barney Miller'' and
``Happy Days.'' However, after Diller left to join Paramount
Pictures, ABC bypassed Eisner, picking the more experienced Fred
Silverman, the head of CBS, to take over. In 1977 Eisner followed
his mentor to Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Their reign at that studio is the subject of some of the most
entertaining pages of ``Work in Progress,'' in part because
Eisner's boss was the irrepressible Charles Bluhdorn, the chief
executive of Gulf and Western. During one afternoon of hot tub
schmooze at Bluhdorn's home in the Dominican Republic, Bluhdorn
proposed a film ``in which Sitting Bull meets Hitler. We ought to
get Dustin Hoffman involved.'' Then, Eisner reports, ``he suggested
a 'Bad News Bears' sequel set in Cuba, in which Castro hits the
winning home run.'' Ever the diplomat, Eisner made but one
suggestion: the Americans ought to win.
</P>
<P>
   At Paramount, Diller and Eisner imposed their television
experience on the film business. Having put together hundreds of
hours of television shows on fixed budgets under tight deadlines,
the pair chose to develop film projects internally. ``Why wait for
writers to come to us with ideas or for agents and producers to put
us into bidding wars?'' Eisner writes. He and Diller sought ``high
concept'' stories that could be explained in a single sentence.
Paramount's record -- ``Flashdance,'' ``Terms of Endearment,''
``Ordinary People'' and ``Raiders of The Lost Ark'' -- was
extraordinary, and in the early 80's the studio was a huge success.
</P>
<P>
   But Bluhdorn died in 1983, and his successor, Martin Davis, was
more envious of Diller's and Eisner's growing celebrity than
pleased by it. Diller quickly decamped to run 20th Century Fox. In
1984 Eisner was forced out of Paramount and immediately accepted an
offer from Roy Disney and his partner, Stanley Gold, to form a
management team as a replacement for Disney's chairman, Ron Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner as the chairman of the Walt Disney Company and Frank
Wells as its president expanded the Disney brand so methodically,
first in the United States and then abroad, that it is hard to
remember when Disney did not control the world. But the
Disneyfication of the universe was not without hitches. During the
development of Euro Disney, outside Paris, the company had trouble
finding suitable executives for the project. Those who spoke French
were not necessarily knowledgeable about theme parks, and those
savvy about theme parks refused to learn French. And how could
Disney build its castle on Main Street in a country that was full
of its own spectacular authentic castles? The redesign cost a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and his co-author, Tony Schwartz, are most fascinating
when describing the growth of ABC, Paramount and Disney. Eisner is
unusual among entertainment moguls because he has had both creative
and corporate experience: he knows how you put a show together and
avoid going broke doing it. The book includes some of the more
absurd details of corporate leadership rarely captured in
newspapers or magazines -- like Eisner's 3 A.M. sneak visit over
the fence of a construction site in Orlando, Fla., to learn whether
Universal had really begun work on a rival theme park.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney chairman is a king of marketing, and his
recollections of personal relationships carry some of the same
simplistic qualities that give Disney movies a gloss of unreality.
His descriptions can be so calculatingly self-serving that they
lack both credibility and nuance. Like many celebrated chief
executives, he has an ego that leaves little room for perspective.
Describing his childhood visits to summer camp, he recalls: ``I was
comfortable having authority at the head of a team, but I also
learned a lot about teamwork and the simple congeniality of pulling
together for a common goal. It was hokey stuff, but I believed in
it.'' C.E.O. material, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   To round out Eisner's claim to be the ideal chief executive
officer of a family-oriented company, there are frequent references
to his 31-year marriage, his three sons, his bypass surgery and his
efforts to come to terms with it. But Eisner makes no effort to
address some of the criticisms of his management style, notably
what some critics say is an unusually large compensation deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner is often condescending in presenting his nemesis, Jeffrey
Katzenberg, the former head of Disney productions with whom he
worked side by side for more than 15 years, as diligent but jealous
of his own power base and lacking the stature to be a chief
executive officer. Eisner also describes Katzenberg as overly
aggressive, tactlessly pushing to become president of Disney soon
after Frank Wells's death in a helicopter accident.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Eisner is uniformly complimentary to Sid
Bass, a leading Disney investor. He describes a trip to New York
for final meetings on the Capital Cities/ABC purchase when he went
out of his way to pick Bass up in Fort Worth. ``If having Sid by my
side required a 2,000-mile detour, it hardly seemed an undue
burden,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It will require an unauthorized biography to learn whether
Katzenberg was really so difficult or Bass so easy. Meanwhile the
ideal place for this heroic version of Disney's history is probably
somewhere between Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in the window of a
Disney store. But Eisner has already thought of that.

KA
</HEADLINE>
  By Roberto Calasso 
 Translated by Tim Parks 
 Illustrated. 446 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50 
 ------ 
 THE FIRST SYLLABLE 
 By SUNIL KHILNANI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was as if everybody were suddenly tired of doing things
that had meaning. They wanted to sit down, in the grass or around a
heap of smoldering logs, and listen to stories.'' Roberto Calasso's
gloss on the epic intricacies of the Mahabharata, the longest story
in the world, might also stand as a caption to his own new book,
sleepless in its storytelling. But we should not be disarmed, for
the book, ingeniously translated from the Italian by Tim Parks, is
equally quick with meanings.
</P>
<P>
   The third in a planned five-volume work, ``Ka'' -- which the
publisher describes as ``stories of the mind and gods of India'' --
follows the high torsion of ``The Ruin of Kasch'' (1996), which
evoked the emergence of the modern from the collapse of the past,
and the more languorous seductions of ``The Marriage of Cadmus and
Harmony'' (1994), which subsumed the whole of Greek mythology in a
single meditation.
</P>
<P>
   To read ``Ka'' is to experience a giddy invasion of stories --
brilliant, enigmatic, troubling, outrageous, erotic, beautiful. Yet
``Ka,'' like the two previous books, is not a novel. Calasso's
form-defying works plot ideas, not character. A writer with
philosophical tastes, he thinks in stories rather than arguments or
syllogisms. The two epigraphs to ``Ka'' announce this style:
Spinoza's remark that ideas are only narratives or mental figures
of the real world and, from the Yogavasistha, a definition of the
world as being ``like the impression left by the telling of a
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ka'' is the emotional and philosophical nub of Calasso's
five-volume project. His acutely nominalist temperament finds its
ideal home in the stories of India, especially those early stories
of the Aryans, which affirm always the power and sovereignty of
mind. As Atri, one of the seven rsis, or seers, of the Aryas (the
people that migrated from central Asia to India and became the
upper castes there), says, ``Every true philosopher thinks but one
thought; the same can be said of a civilization.'' The one
crystallizing insight of the Aryan intellect, as Calasso sees it,
is that the existent world ``only exists if consciousness perceives
it as existing. And if a consciousness perceives it, within that
consciousness there must be another consciousness that perceives
the consciousness that perceives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to this vertigo-inducing thought that the stories of
``Ka'' constantly return. The book opens and closes with a flight
by Garuda, the great eagle best known as the steed of Vishnu but
here cast in a central role. At the beginning and at the end, he
reads the Rig-Veda, intrigued by the incantatory question of Hymn
121 of the 10th book: ``Who (Ka) is the god to whom we should offer
our sacrifice?'' Like Garuda's inky feathers, this question rustles
through the book. The answer (if a reply so mysterious may be
called that) is Prajapati: the ``nameless and shapeless'' one,
whose secret name is itself Ka, or ``who.'' He precedes even
Brahma, the creator and first god of the later Hindu triad of
deities (the others being Siva and Vishnu). Alone, Prajapati is
without identity: ``He didn't even know whether he existed or
not.'' In fact, Prajapati is nothing less than mind, manas; and,
desiring to know himself, to gain self-consciousness, he creates
the world, bringing forth beings able to perceive one another.
</P>
<P>
   In the span between Garuda's taking wing twice, the stories of
``Ka'' enact the emergence of consciousness, always split between
the self and the I, atman and aham. As Garuda perches on the
immense tree of life, puzzling over the identity of Ka, ``the very
syllable from which everything had issued forth,'' the stories
stream out.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Rig-Veda, the book navigates the narrative
ocean of the Brahmanas, the Upanishads, the Mahabharata and the
Puranas, as well as stories of the Buddha. The stories become more
orotund as we move ``from the allusive cipher of the Rig-Veda and
the abrupt, broken narratives of the Brahmanas . . . to the
ruthless redundance of the Puranas.'' And, in the vast wake of
stories that succeed the Rig-Veda, the names of the gods change, as
do the literary genres and the demands on the listener: ``There was
a time when he'd been obliged to solve abrupt enigmas, or find his
head bursting. Now he could heap up rewards merely by listening to
the stories as they proliferated. The shift had to do with a
growing weariness: the era of the bhakti had begun, the era of
obscure and pervasive devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Calasso regrets that shift, and the imaginative heart of his own
book is in the austere hymns and narratives of the Aryans -- the
Rig-Veda and the Brahmanas. These stories -- of sacrifice, of the
mind and the world, of sovereignty -- are superbly narrated here.
We know very little about the Aryans. There are no Aryan monuments
or artifacts -- only ``words and gods. They left nothing else.''
The Aryans, ``more interested in grammar than in glory,'' were
``masters of the goaded, greased, hard-brushed, well-honed word.''
Their world revolved around contemplation of ``the simple fact of
being conscious,'' and around sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable passages of ``Ka'' re-creates for us
the asvamedha, the sacrifice of the horse. This eerie ceremony
begins with the release of a stallion. It must wander for a year,
never retracing its steps, thus establishing the boundaries of the
King's dominion. During the wait for the horse's return, narrative
is born -- a 10-day-long story cycle is repeated 36 times. On its
return, the horse -- which, in that favored Sanskrit locution, iva,
has ``in a certain sense'' become the world through its wandering
-- is strangled after an elaborate ritual. Then, in an odd
maneuver, the first wife of the King takes the dead horse as her
lover; finally, its body is ``broken up like a line of poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   As Calasso sees it, the ancient world of sacrifice, of
prohibition and authority, is ruined by the coming of the Buddha.
The Buddha wishes to ``eliminate the residue,'' the leftovers from
which everything new is generated (the pursuit of nirvana is
nothing less than a wish to extinguish the residue of a lived life
-- rebirth). His doctrine prefigures our own world: ``What would
one day be called 'the modern' was, at least as far as its sharpest
and most hidden point is concerned, a legacy of the Buddha. Seeing
things as so many aggregates and dismantling them. . . . An arid,
ferocious scholasticism. . . . Total lack of respect for any
prohibition, any authority.'' Here, Calasso's hieratic nostalgia is
apparent: Aryan India suggests to him a comforting pastorale, just
as it did to those scholars of religion, Mircea Eliade and Georges
Dumezil.
</P>
<P>
   Calasso has drawn on a wealth of Western Indological scholarship
in preparing his book. But he is no po-faced purveyor of
Orientalist bookishness, and he freely recomposes to suit his own
intellectual obsessions. If firmly with the ancients in his
political tastes, Calasso has a modernist enthusiasm for formal
experiment: his narratives are a literary analogue of the painterly
technique of anamorphosis, juxtaposing disparate events, ideas and
styles, and only yielding up their meanings from a hidden vantage
point. ``Ka'' has horse-headed gods joke fearfully about ending up
as a ``papier-mache sign over the door of some boucherie
chevaline,'' and he does not disdain the occasional post-modernist
wink (``Hybridization is de rigueur these days'').
</P>
<P>
   Prajapati is compared to Kafka's K., Proust is a ``Vedantic
master though unaware of being such''; the elusive meaning of
``brahman'' is given a Wittgensteinian gloss, while the seekers of
the mysterious substance called the soma become Baudelaire's
``prophetic tribe with blazing eyes.'' Proust is in fact a key to
the narrative constellations of ``Ka'': Proust, for whom the
inescapable puzzle of the self, its elusiveness and mutability, is
so intimately tied to the recognition that the mind is the world,
and who writes ``as if the universe was captive, lost in the midst
of my consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Calasso shares Proust's ambition to create a work that surpasses
literature: like Wagner's ``Ring'' or Mallarme's notion of
literature as simply the ``Book,'' which was emblematic of the
creativity of the entire universe -- in a word, a work that enfolds
within itself all there is. The Mahabharata is perhaps the fullest
realization of that intention, ``the first of those 'works that are
too complete, works in which everything is expressed.' '' As Vyasa,
its composer, says of it, ``Whatever is here, on Law, on Profit, on
Pleasure and on Salvation, that is found elsewhere. But what is not
here is nowhere else.'' Such works, like the world and like our
selves, will always ``mean too much.'' And whenever we get tired of
worrying away at their meanings, we can always settle down to
listen to the stories they also tell.

A MAN IN FULL
</HEADLINE>
  By Tom Wolfe 
 742 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. $28.95 
 ------ 
 MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA 
 By MICHAEL LEWIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Norton Simon Museum, in Pasadena, Calif., there hangs a
self-portrait of the 18th-century French painter Maurice Quentin de
La Tour. The artist wears an expression of intense
self-satisfaction and the foppish attire of the flaneur. Just below
him is a note from the curators that tells you who he was and why
he looks so pleased with himself. Unlike most academy painters of
his day, the note explains, Quentin de La Tour chose to work in
pastels rather than oils. Pastels were widely dismissed as
superficial by the oil painters, but the effects this artist
achieved were so powerful that the oil men were forced to take
notice. And with each new pastel the oil painters became more
fearful that Maurice Quentin de La Tour would put them all out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the note, I couldn't help thinking of Tom Wolfe. Wolfe
has spent the better part of 35 years sketching America with
pastels. Time and again his work has achieved effects as impressive
as those of oil-based prose. In the early part of his career he was
treated by serious literary people as an annoying distraction. But
then he went deep in 1987, with his first novel, ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' and he wrote a flamboyant end zone jig of an essay
in Harper's Magazine, in which he argued that his sort of novel
writing was the best sort of novel writing. At that point Wolfe
ceased to be merely annoying. He became a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent dust-up has been billed, and not only by Wolfe,
as Tom Wolfe versus the Academy. It was never as simple as that. I
recall in particular a letter to Harper's approving of Wolfe's
essay from Walker Percy, who was, and is, about as welcome in
academia as a writer can be. And even at their most shrill the
academicians did not appear to view Wolfe as a serious threat. They
did not feel they had anything to fear from this Master of Pastels.
And perhaps, back then, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   But now they do.
</P>
<P>
   If there was in fact some wan spirit disturbed by the success of
``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' he will be suicidal after ``A Man
in Full.'' The novel contains passages as powerful and as beautiful
as anything written not merely by contemporary American novelists
but by any American novelist. The book has its flaws (what book
does not?) and there are things that can and will be said against
it. But that is what happens when a writer has the audacity to
attempt what Wolfe has attempted: the stuffing of the whole of
contemporary America into a single, great, sprawling comic work of
art. He may not have quite managed to fit it all in. But he has
come closer to doing it than even his admirers could fairly expect.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``A Man in Full'' does not really lend itself to
simple summary. The protagonist, Charlie Croker, is a
megalomaniacal white Atlanta real estate developer whose empire,
along with his identity, is hurtling toward bankruptcy. Meanwhile,
a black football star at Georgia Tech, Fareek (the Canon) Fanon, is
accused of raping the daughter of a prominent white Atlanta
businessman. The two events converge like a pair of churning
rivers, and all of Atlanta is swept away in the deluge. Charlie's
wives, his bank officers, his white business friends, his black
legal adversaries, his former employees -- all these characters
find themselves in their own peculiar jams. (All Wolfe's characters
seem to start out in trouble on their way to even bigger troubles.)
Nevertheless, each finds time to visit misery upon Charlie Croker.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to say that ``A Man in Full'' is about race.
Certainly it contains a great deal about race. But race is
subsidiary to the book's great theme, which is the decline of Old
South agrarian values -- or, at any rate, the New South's idea of
Old South agrarian values. The author doesn't appear exactly to
mourn the decline, at least not in the usual, sentimental fashion
of the Confederate widow. He seems simply to wish to make a study
of the phenomenon. And Charlie Croker, the embodiment of Old South
agrarian values, is his lab rat. Having created Charlie, Wolfe sets
the whole of the modern world in opposition to him. And truth be
told it is not always clear who gets the better of the struggle.
Here he is on Charlie's chief aide-de-camp:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wiz was young and fit, but he was neither manly nor
unmanly. He was a financial officer and a technogeek. He ran six
miles before dawn every morning solely to keep the Wismer Stroock
cardiovascular system lubricated and tuned up for the long-term
project, which was to live forever. . . . He produced an HP-12C
calculator from the side pocket of his jacket, and the ditch down
the middle of his forehead deepened, and he began pecking away.
That damned HP-12C was the Wiz in hardware form. It was the
wizard's wand of the technogeeks. Charlie couldn't stand the sight
of it, because it utterly baffled him and made him feel how cut off
he was from the new generation coming out of the business schools.
Curious about the thing, he had once asked the Wiz to let him try
it for a second. He tried to enter 2 + 2. He couldn't get 4!
Couldn't get 2 + 2  &QC;  4! Turned out that with this damned machine,
you had to enter + 2 plus + 2. It worked backwards or something.''

<P>
   In many respects ``A Man in Full'' is the sort of novel you
would expect Tom Wolfe to write. His instincts remain those of an
especially acute and zealous tour guide. He insists on grabbing
hold of your lapel and showing you all the strange sights he has
seen with his own eyes. You want to hear the 14 different dialects
spoken in the greater Atlanta area? Look . . . here! You want to
see how a man in full captures a rattlesnake with his bare hands?
Look . . . here! You care to see a world gone mad, in much the same
way the world is mad, only more intricately and amusingly so? Look
. . . here! A fair criticism of ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was
that Wolfe's reportorial interests stopped just short of the
ghetto. He didn't much sully his white suit. That criticism is not
likely to be reapplied to ``A Man in Full,'' which offers a
harrowing tour of the American underclass, starting in a meat
freezer and ending in a prison. And if there was ever a more
chillingly persuasive depiction of the inside of an American
prison, I haven't read it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-TOM-WOLFE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: read it.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The novel also has the same deliciously irresponsible feel of
much of Wolfe's work. He toys with human fears and anxieties the
way a mischievous boy might play with a new chemistry set. No
sooner has Wolfe invented a character than he is asking himself,
``What can I do to this human being to cause him the most searing
social pain?'' A light-skinned black with a middle-class
upbringing? Toss him into the black ghetto! A homophobic throwback
who owes his bankers $200 million? Force him to buy a table at the
museum's retrospective of a gay painter of lurid homosexual scenes!
It sounds contrived, and it is. And yet somehow -- don't ask me how
-- these characters and their situations rarely feel contrived or
stereotypical. They're real! There were moments when I would not
have been surprised to turn the page and find a glossy section with
their photographs.
</P>
<P>
   All very Tom Wolfe. But in at least one way this book is not at
all what you might expect. There is something more going on here.
The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written; at the
same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting. This may be
because Wolfe runs a risk here that he has never before run in
fiction: he takes one of his characters dead seriously. That
character, Conrad Hensley, is a young man who, with a kick from
Charlie Croker, falls rapidly to the very bottom of American
society. Conrad believes the world is just, and his insistence on
that belief drives him mad. He is easily satirized; but Wolfe
declines to satirize him. Instead he gazes up at the reader from
between the lines as if to say ``who can blame him?''
</P>
<P>
   In sparing one poor soul from his satire, Wolfe runs a pair of
risks. The first and most obvious is artistic: it is hard enough to
compose a monumental comic novel without tossing in the
complication of a tragic figure. (For God's sakes man, keep it
light!) The second is . . . well, I'm not quite sure what you'd
call it. Personal risk, I suppose. In his refusal to expose Conrad
as he exposes everyone and everything else, Wolfe inevitably
exposes himself. There is something moving in that, in the great
writer taking risks that he does not need to take. He could very
easily have had himself another whopping great hit without sticking
his neck quite so far out of his lemon-meringue collar. But he
stuck out his neck anyway, and for no reason other than that he
wanted to take a chance on his very best.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has a couple of obvious soft spots. The sheer
unbridled pleasure Wolfe takes in showing you things for the first
time -- Look . . . here! -- tempts him to turn all his characters
into tour guides. When a white male bank officer who has spent two
decades envying Atlanta's rich citizens arrives in the best Atlanta
neighborhood he is unlikely to gaze upon it as if he has dropped in
for the day from Mars. (``Peepgass was all eyes. Rolling lawns,
absolutely perfectly cut.'') The ending is also typically
disappointing. It's unfortunate that Wolfe doesn't know how to end
his novels but there isn't much to be done about it. He achieves so
many of his comic effects from the clashing of points of view, and
he spawns such an extraordinary number of characters whose points
of view we care to see clash, that there is no hope of anything
approaching a satisfying resolution to it all. As he roars toward
his climax Wolfe must himself realize that he would require another
500 or so pages to gather up all his split ends. And so, with a
horrible thunk, he just drops a hairball on the reader.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no note to end on. It's just too fine a book to
dwell on its weaknesses. Too fine, and too long in the making. The
moment I heaved ``A Man in Full'' up into my lap a distressing
thought crossed my mind: ``My God, this one could be his last.''
Hard as it is to believe, Wolfe is pushing 70, and he seems
incapable of writing a masterpiece inside of a decade. How sad to
think of the world without some book by Tom Wolfe in the works. And
how dull! In any case, rather than open the novel at the beginning,
I leafed immediately to the end, to read Wolfe's final words: ''
'Oh, don't worry,' said the man of the world, 'I'll be back.' ''

TURBULENT SOULS
</HEADLINE>
  A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family 
 By Stephen J. Dubner 
 Illustrated. 320 pp. New York: William Morrow &AMP; Company. $24 
 ------ 
 UNCONVERTED 
 By JONATHAN WILSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excitements of religious conversion continue to exert a
dramatic hold on the contemporary imagination. In 1996, when
Stephen J. Dubner, an editor and writer at The New York Times
Magazine, published in that magazine an abbreviated account of his
parents' choice of Catholicism over Judaism and his own subsequent
return to the Jewish fold, he was deluged with mail: letters of
approbation and disgust, accounts of parallel stories and so on.
John Cardinal O'Connor quoted from the article in a Sunday sermon
at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York (albeit against the grain of
the narrative), and Dubner quickly became, in his own words, ``a
sort of Jewish poster boy,'' a speaker in demand at synagogues,
Hanukkah candle lighting ceremonies and even a Hasidic bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   All this he recounts in the final chapters of his intense,
acutely observed and, in its documenting of both his intimate and
extended family's move through history from intolerance to
open-mindedness, exigent memoir. ``Turbulent Souls,'' in a manner
appropriate to the spiritual oscillations of the personalities
under scrutiny, features two distinct narrative voices (third
person for the parents' story, first person for Dubner's own), each
of which manages to incorporate and elucidate a number of points of
view, including those of Dubner's grandparents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the book charts the constantly fascinating
journey of Brooklyn-born Solly Dubner and Florence Greenglass, as,
at first independently and then in powerful compromise, they move
away from the rigid Jewish orthodoxy of their parents to embrace
what frequently appears to be an equally uncompromising set of
Roman Catholic dogmas. Elated by their crossover, and freshly
transplanted to a rambling, Spartan farmhouse in upstate New York
(the rundown place and its nonetheless ``magical'' ambience are
splendidly evoked), Florence and Solly emerge as Paul and Veronica
Dubner, pillars of the local church, and the spiritually charged,
if materially impoverished, parents of a thriving brood of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubner, the youngest of the children, separated by 16
years from his eldest sibling, Joe, characteristically knows the
least about his parents' former lives. Inevitably, perhaps, he
surfaces as the most inquisitive of the children, the one who in
later life comes to fill in the cultural spaces that ultimately
explain why, on Sunday afternoons, his father would occasionally
break into ``My Yiddishe Mama'' as he danced through the kitchen to
``grab a hunk of gefilte fish from the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stephen learns as an adult, from both his mother and other
relatives (frequently new discoveries) as they approach or inhabit
old age, engages a story that is at once enlightening and baffling,
as the ways of the spirit tend to be. It is not that his parents
have ever hidden the fact that they were once Jews; quite the
contrary, but the major players in and the texture of their
pre-Catholic lives have remained a secret history. Among the
secrets are the facts that his mother was first cousin to Ethel
Rosenberg (Communism was, of course, anathema to the strictly
devout Dubners, and his mother's reaction to the electrocution of
her cousin is both subdued and conflicted) and that, after learning
of his son's conversion, Stephen's grandfather, Shepsel, rent his
clothes and sat shiva, mourning Solly/Paul as if he were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Solly's and Florence's roads to conversion are laid out
carefully and sympathetically with the mystery at their heart,
especially where Solly is concerned, both respected and carefully
guarded. Has the Holocaust played a part in influencing decisions?
It isn't clear. Years later Stephen's Uncle Sam trenchantly remarks
that ``the why is a never-known.'' Solly comes to Christianity
after the death of his mother and via the loneliness and depression
that accompany him through his experiences as a G.I. in the
Pacific, where he is the only Jew stationed, suggestively enough,
on Christmas Island during the last years of World War II.
Florence's journey begins with an existential childhood experience
during sickness: lying in bed with a cold she hears her friends
playing outside and thinks, ``Boy oh boy, life goes on all by
itself whether I'm there or not.'' But the meanderings of her
spirit are truly shaped by two Catholic mentors: her ballet teacher
Mme. Asta Souvorina, and a priest, ``a tall, handsome young
Irishman,'' Father Conroy of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of ``Turbulent Souls'' has Stephen Dubner echo the
steps of one or the other of his parents as he turns from
Catholicism to Judaism. His mother, after a moment of profound
revelation, abandoned a promising future as a dancer to embrace the
church. Similarly, Dubner deserts a rock band on the edge of
stardom because he takes stock and finds rock life empty. His
father, it seems, was at the deepest level drawn to the Virgin Mary
by the loss of his own mother, for whom Mary is a replacement.
Stephen Dubner, although he never quite wants to acknowledge it,
appears pulled to Judaism, which he feels instinctively like a
melody in his soul, as at least a partial substitute for his
father, whom he lost to death at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way on his spiritual excursion Dubner is nudged, and
sometimes shoved, by powerful mentors and guides, like Ivan
Kronenfeld, his girlfriend's acting teacher; Simon Jacobson, a
Hasidic rabbi for whom Dubner ghost-edits a collection of teachings
by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch leader; and,
most bizarrely, a high-gloss matron from Miami whom he meets at a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubner's Jewish incarnation is, however, strikingly
moderate in comparison to his parents' radical Catholicism. Where
Paul and Veronica pushed the envelope of religious experience both
spiritually and politically by organizing groups of charismatic
Christians to practice glossolalia or, in his mother's case,
picketing at abortion clinics, Stephen is content to learn a little
Hebrew, study a little Talmud, utter a few prayers, light his
Shabbos candles, amiably discuss Jewish issues with Upper West Side
friends and yearn for a Jewish wife who will give his mother ``her
first Jewish grandchild.'' Nothing wrong with this picture unless
you believe that the Truth must come in blows. Indeed it is
Dubner's admirable and relentless pursuit of the middle road (a
calling that leads him to Cardinal O'Connor for advice on how to
handle Mom's persistent objections to his newfound faith -- she
presses on him a coffee-table book called ``The Living Gospels of
Jesus Christ'') that ultimately secures a poignant gathering of
both the Catholic and Jewish members of his family: those alienated
from one another by the events of the distant past and those who
for years have simply been unaware of the others' existence. The
family reunion, a model of religious harmony and mutual respect,
looks like progress, and it is. It also looks like a personal
resolution for Dubner.
</P>
<P>
   But the story doesn't end there: slipping into the Church of the
Blessed Sacrament for a Jewish look-see at midnight Mass last
Christmas Eve, ``I instinctively dipped my hand into the holy water
and crossed myself,'' Dubner writes. Habit, he thinks, not heresy.
It's O.K. Nevertheless, while it is clearly better for Stephen
Dubner if his turbulent soul stays quiet, I think readers of this
wonderful book will rather hope that a continued measure of
unsettlement inspires him to write more.

SOUTHERN FAVORITE BRUNSWICK STEW MUSCLES IN ON CHILI AS FALL
FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHRYN HOPPER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before there was chili, there was Brunswick stew.
</P>
<P>
   Years before the first Texas cowhand threw some beef, chili
powder and cornmeal in a simmering pot, Southerners were enjoying
their own cold-day concoction, blending the region's traditional
meats _ pork and chicken _ with its favorite vegetables _ corn,
beans and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texans were oblivious to the glory of Brunswick stew until
six months ago when the Virginia-based barbecue chain Red, Hot &AMP;
Blue made it part of an all-you-can-eat lunch special. The chain
recently opened restaurants in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano, Texas,
and has plans to open soon in nearby Arlington and Southlake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken off like you wouldn't believe,'' said Victoria
Mitchell, the Georgia-born general manager of the chain's Plano
location. ``Once they try it, they're sold on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick stew now reigns as the restaurant's No. 1 takeout
item, surpassing even chili as the tailgating centerpiece of
choice. A gallon of the chain's stew _ which features pork, beef
and chicken, sweetened with turmeric and barbecue sauce _ runs
$29.99.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds expensive until you realize that Brunswick stew can have
upward of 20 ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the time involved. Traditionalists maintain that a
decent stew should be simmered 12 hours or more in an iron pot over
a hardwood flame, and stirred with long oak paddles.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Brunswick stew is as thick and murky as the
mixture itself. Southern food historians generally credit Creed
Haskins, a slave who lived in Brunswick County, Va., as the father
of Brunswick stew.
</P>
<P>
   On a hunting trip in 1828, he decided to beef up his vegetable
soup by adding squirrel meat _ and Brunswick stew was born.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Brunswick County, N.C., and Brunswick, Ga., dispute
this origin and stake their claim as the concoction's birthplace.
In all likelihood, the dish dates back to Native Americans who
simmered game, corn and other indigenous vegetables in bubbling
pots centuries before there was a Brunswick anything.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe has evolved in modern times, adapting to modern
tastes and time-pressures. Chicken and pork are the chief meats
used today, good squirrel being so hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Vat-quantity recipes that once were seemingly geared toward
Volunteer Fire Departments (''210 pounds chicken, 100 pounds
onion'') have been pared down to crockpot-size.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good Southern dish, Brunswick stew is fodder for fierce
debates: To okra or not to okra? Thin and soupy, or thick and
chunky? Served in a bowl or over rice?
</P>
<P>
   And like chili, it's a perfect dish on a crisp autumn day, and
an easy way to clear out your cupboards.

BEHIND SMART BATHROOM FIXTURES: NO GENIE, JUST TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Wis., Ill.)  (af) 
 By TINA KELLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sinks, toilets and urinals in many public restrooms use infrared
sensors to detect the presence of a person and activate the
plumbing. There's no creepy voyeur lurking behind that small, dark
sensor panel, just a lot of circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall or on the faucet, depending on the fixture, there is
a black window about an inch long. Behind it is a light-emitting
diode that is about the diameter of a ballpoint pen and gives off
infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   It has a wavelength of 850 nanometers (850 billionths of a
meter) and is not visible to the human eye, which can see only the
spectrum from violet to red, ranging from 350 or 400 nanometers to
750 or 800 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to save water by keeping people from
leaving the faucets on and to reduce the spread of germs on
faucets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No-hands operation promotes hygiene and helps prevent the
spread of dangerous bacteria,'' the Sloan Valve Co.'s promotional
materials say. The use of automatic plumbing fixtures ``provides a
hygiene-rich environment that projects a positive message to the
user,'' Sloan adds.
</P>
<P>
   Because faucets and fixtures are touched less often, they need
fewer repairs and less scrubbing, which lowers maintenance costs,
faucet manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   But automatic fixtures can also make life more complicated.
Especially when it comes to toilets.
</P>
<P>
   With the automatic toilets at the new electrical engineering
building at the University of Washington in Seattle, ``it's a
riot,'' said Martin A. Afromowitz, a professor. ``You sit down and
sit forward or back, and if your head's down, it flushes. We get
triple-flushed and quadruple-flushed. It can give you a heart
attack when you don't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other variables can also fake out the automatic-flushing system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of women hover,'' said Steve Bissell, senior
product manager for the Kohler Co. in Kohler, Wis. ``They never sit
on the fixture, or they sit much farther from the sensor. But the
average man is the one who sets up the sensor.'' Such confusion can
keep the toilet from flushing on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler has built in a system to keep the toilet from flushing at
the wrong time. It programs the sensor to wait for three seconds
after the end of the reflected-light signal indicating that the
toilet is in use before flushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are a problem because they can be very tiny,'' said
John Lauer, manager of installation engineering at Sloan, in
Franklin Park, Ill. ``We always have on toilets a manual override
button. It gives the person a little bit of personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   The sensors may react differently to different colors because
lighter shades reflect more light. But that was more of a problem
in the early 70s, when sensors were less precise and underreacted
to dark colors.
</P>
<P>
   While the sensors generally seem to have worked well enough to
have gained broad acceptance, at least in airports, there are still
a number of factors that can cause malfunctions. Sensors' functions
can be affected by a change in the amount of light in a room,
perhaps caused by dying fluorescent light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``touchless faucets'' are not cheap _ they range in price
from around $300 to around $600. The assumption is that they will
reduce water use, perhaps by up to 50 percent, even though they
also consume power for operation. Most of them use AA or AAA
batteries, which can last for two years, manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   Infrared plumbing technology has been around longer than one
might expect. It has been a big hit since the opening of the
40-year-old Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo, which has what it calls
a ``world famous'' men's bathroom and ``caveman'' room. Both
feature urinals made of heavy rock formations. When motion is
detected in the room, waterfalls run over the rocks, ready to
serve.

 EMERGENCY HOUSING IN A HURRY 
</HEADLINE>

 By LAURA CASTANEDA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a friend needed to find emergency housing, Marina Rodriguez
made a quick stop at a new electronic kiosk at the Camden
Transportation Center in Camden, N.J. By simply touching the
screen, she could instantly view listings of temporary shelters and
other housing programs. ``This is a great way to reach people,''
Ms. Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, which resemble souped-up ATMs, are part of a new
effort by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The project is the brainchild of HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Each kiosk offers around 100 pages of information. Roughly 80 of
the pages are direct reproductions of the pages available on the
agency's Web site, while the rest provide local information
specific to each community.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, which cost about $16,000 each, are connected by
telephone lines to an Internet service provider so new content can
be pulled from HUD's Web site, which is updated every night.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 26 kiosks have been placed across the country in
federal buildings, public libraries, shopping malls, city halls and
even groceries, said Candi Harrison, Web manager for HUD's home
page. That number is to increase to 30 by the end of the year, and
to 80 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great need for housing for low- to moderate-income
families,'' said Laura Pelzer, senior community builder coordinator
for HUD's Camden office. ``We need to assist people in any way we
can. The kiosk is one way of letting them know we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although access to the Internet is available through public
libraries, schools and HUD offices, the kiosks were developed
because many people are less intimidated by touch-screen technology
than they are by computers.
</P>
<P>
   HUD worked with three companies that are considered experts in
kiosk design _North Communications, Summit Research and Gensler, an
architectural firm _ to design an attractive machine that is easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Each kiosk has a video narrator who walks users through the
program. The buttons are big and easy to use, and the screens are
tilted so even people in wheelchairs can use them. A touch of the
screen calls up the main menu, which provides eight categories to
choose from: HUD in Your Community, HUD on Your Side, HUD. Next
Door, Buy a Home, Find Housing, Keep Your Home, Get a Refund and
File a Complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Some kiosks provide information in Spanish, and all screens can
be printed, although there have been some glitches. Ms. Rodriguez,
for example, could not get a printout because the kiosk had run out
of paper.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned the next day, the paper drawer had been
restocked, but she still could not get the printer to work.
</P>
<P>
   Security has not been a big problem so far, even though some of
the kiosks are on the street. ``If people want to break into them,
I'm sure they can,'' Ms. Harrison said. ``But I'm not aware of any
problems yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At $16,000 apiece, are the HUD kiosks worth the price? An
accurate reading of the number of hits each kiosk gets will not be
available for three months, but Ms. Harrison said the terminals
were a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, she said, a single mother who buys her first home or a
homeless family that manages to find shelter for the night. ``What
value do you put on that?'' she asked.

<P>
   Within three seconds of logging on to America Online from her
room on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, Debbie Shapiro, a junior
at Stuyvesant High School, got an instant message from her best
friend's brother's college roommate, who was on his dormitory room
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey there, Deb,'' the message flashed, as the twinkle sound
that accompanies every instant message alerted her to check her
screen.``Hey,'' she fired back, rolling her eyes. ``This guy is
always bugging me,'' she said to a companion. ``I don't know why. I
have nothing to say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Debbie's computer screen was peppered with several
more instant messages _ one from a friend wanting to know if any
jocks had been at the party Debbie went to the night before, one
from a classmate inquiring about math homework and one from a
friend just wondering what was up.
</P>
<P>
   For the next half-hour, Debbie performed an epistolary juggling
act that had her holding four different online conversations
simultaneously. When Debbie's best friend called, Debbie picked up
the cordless phone next to her computer, cradled it between her ear
and shoulder to talk and continued typing.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of the household with a computer and multiple phone
lines, the teen-ager who years ago would have secreted herself away
in the closet with her Princess phone now has vastly expanded
communications, thanks to America Online or other instant-message
services.
</P>
<P>
   AOL began offering instant messages as soon as it signed up its
first members, in 1985. But the service has now moved as far into
the mainstream as MTV because it has been letting people outside
AOL sign up for Instant Messenger since May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, 100 million instant messages were being sent by
AOL members each day. Now that the service is open and free for
anyone, AOL says, the number of daily messages is 200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with scores of teen-agers showed that AOL's Instant
Messenger is indeed popular among that age group. And although
adults debate whether impressionable adolescents should have
unregulated Internet access, the main thing teen-agers seem to do
when they log on for instant messages is use their keyboards to
talk to their friends.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to move beyond anecdotal evidence of this
phenomenon to specific numbers. AOL does not track the way
teen-agers use the service.
</P>
<P>
   But many parents can testify that all of a house's telephone
lines can be monopolized for hours at a time by teen-agers chatting
on computers and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our peak hours are 8 to 11 p.m.,'' said an AOL spokeswoman,
Pam McGraw. ``But we do know that when kids get home from school,
they have a tendency to sign on and chat with their friends, just
like they normally would have talked on the phone in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL added its Buddy List to Instant Messenger in February 1996,
and that has contributed to the huge increase in instant messaging
among the under-18 set.
</P>
<P>
   Your Buddy List includes the online names of the people you want
to exchange instant messages with; you are notified each time a
person on your list goes on line, and those on your list are told
when you go on line. Before the advent of the Buddy List, you had
to type in someone's name to find out if that person was on line.
</P>
<P>
   Similar lists are now offered by other chat and instant-message
services, like those offered by Yahoo, Excite, ICQ, Internet Relay
Chat and Pow Wow. One reason for AOL's popularity among teen-agers
may be the fact that a majority of parents with Internet access
have AOL accounts.
</P>
<P>
   What urgent missives are imparted via instant messages that
can't wait until the next school day? ``We complain about school
mostly, and teachers and guys,'' said Sara Mulnix, a high-school
sophomore from Herndon, Va., whose Buddy List runs 83 names long.
She said she spendt two to three hours a week on line with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Scott, 16, from Reading, Mass., said: ``I I-M friends
about various social dilemmas, and all other kinds of craziness.
It's a quicker way to get answers than calling someone on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teen-agers use instant messages strictly to keep in touch
with friends from summer camps or catch up with friends from old
neighborhoods. ``I go on, read my mail, write back a couple of
sentences and get off,'' said Sara Shepard, a sophomore at Trinity
High School in New York City. ``I used to be much more into it, but
I don't have the time anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For other teen-agers, however, AOL's Instant Messenger system is
nearly as important as the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big social tool,'' said Jocelyn Nubel, 15, of
Northport, N.Y., adding that virtually everyone she knew at school
and in her town had access to AOL's Instant Messenger. ``To some
extent, it takes the place of the phone. We'll all be at a party
and when we leave, we say, `Bye, see you guys on AOL.' Then when I
get home, at like 1 o'clock, I'll go on line and get all these
instant messages. People asking me, `Did you have fun tonight?'
`Who did you go with?' and `Did you hear about so-and-so?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn said it was easier to approach boys on line than on the
phone. ``You don't have to deal with the awkwardness of phone
silence when you instant-message someone,'' she said. ``When you
call someone, it's more personal. If I I-M someone, it's not such a
big deal because that's what everybody does. You can get the
general stuff about each other out of the way so when you see him,
it's easier to start talking.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers who frequently send instant messages often find it
more helpful than the phone for negotiating problems with friends.
``I'm not good at confronting people,'' Sara Mulnix said. ``On the
phone, you have to worry about someone's sarcastic response to what
you're saying. When you type it out, you have unlimited space to
let it all go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Scott prefers sending instant messages to talking on the
phone for similar reasons. ``People act very differently on line
than they do in real life,'' he said. ``Everyone seems a little
more thoughtful, maybe because the conversation is a little slower.
The best thing about talking on line is that you can look at what
you're saying before you send it and ask yourself, `Do I really
mean this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not all heartfelt earnestness on line, Jacob was quick
to point out. Last year, he said, he and his track teammates
engaged in ``electronic warfare'' when Reading High School lost the
finals for the first time in 27 years to nearby Woburn. ``We went
into AOL's Member Profiles, typed in ``Woburn'' and ``Track,'' and
sent harassing messages to a lot of Woburn kids. It got to be an
all-out war.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also use chat rooms to talk to one another on line.
Hundreds of Web chat rooms oriented toward teen-agers require
little more than a screen name and a password to sign up. Susan
Herring, a linguistics professor at the University of Texas at
Arlington who recently completed a yearlong study, was surprised to
find that even though chat rooms afforded teen-agers a relatively
new medium for communication, sex roles remain extremely
traditional.

   The chats Dr. Herring surveyed inevitably moved in one of
several directions, she said. ``There was the chivalry scenario,
where a boy will rush to the protection of a girl, do battle
verbally with the other boys and then proceed to woo the girl,''
she said. ``Then there was the `belle of the ball' scenario, where
a lone girl in a chat room full of boys will play the part of queen
bee, demanding that all the boys court her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because they can't see each other in a chat room,
but you usually don't have to wait beyond four or five lines before
there's some expression of gender or sexual identity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is to be gained from all this chitchat? Dr. Herring (who
said she was not even allowed to call boys on the phone when she
was growing up), said computer chats, especially those in chat
rooms with many participants, were simply another tool for social
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest approximation would be to imagine a large social
event, such as a party, where multiple conversations are taking
place at the same time, equally audible to all participants,'' she
said. ``The Internet just creates a lot more opportunities for this
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many parents of teen-agers who spend a lot of time on AOL's
instant-message service, Susan Mulnix, Sara's mother, is a little
bewildered by her daughter's zealous keyboard conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to be on the soap opera level,'' she said. ``It's
very `he said this' and `she did that.' '' But she also said her
daughter is closer to her friends than Ms. Mulnix was with hers
growing up, partly because of the freedom that online conversation
allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're able to say things to each other that we never would
have in person,'' Ms. Mulnix said. ``Instant messages and chat
rooms are a little like riding in the car with your mother. You're
not looking at each other, so it's easier to say things you
wouldn't otherwise bring up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ms. Mulnix has concerns about how worthwhile
talking on line to friends for hours on end can possibly be. Since
the school year started, she has tried to keep Sara from going on
line until she has finished her homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's hard,'' Ms. Mulnix said, ``because unlike the
phone, I can't hear her talking.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Termites are voracious insects that can literally eat a person
out of house and home. Sometimes termite activity is apparent when
it appears as mud tubes on walls. Often, however, the infestation
goes undetected until the homeowner discovers serious damage in
wooden studs, beams and joists. That's why it is important to have
a termite inspection conducted every year by an experienced pest
control technician.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners who live in brick or stone houses wrongly assume
that termites pose no threat to their homes. What these people fail
to realize is that there is a great deal of wood in the structure
of any house, and that the termites will penetrate through hairline
cracks in the concrete and mortar to get at that wood.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the recent problems on Liberty Island, s
the site of the Statue of Liberty. It would seem that an all-metal
statue positioned firmly on a stone base in the middle of an island
surrounded by water would be invincible against termite attack,
but, in 1994, the National Park Service found that it had a serious
termite problem. It's unclear how the insects made their way to the
island; one theory is that they traveled over with lumber that was
to be used for scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   The termites attacked the furniture and display cases inside the
museum. Eventually the museum had to be temporarily closed so pest
control technicians could attack the problem. The technicians
installed bait devices around and in the museum. Thirteen months
later, the multiple termite colonies were virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional termite control measures these bait devices
do not rely on pouring toxic chemicals into the earth. Instead, a
series of monitoring stations are placed in strategic locations in
the ground surrounding a home. If termite activity is detected, the
monitoring devices are transferred into a bait tube that contains a
substance called Hexaflumuron.
</P>
<P>
   Hexaflumuron does not contaminate the environment because it
does not penetrate into the surrounding earth. Termites feed on the
bait matrix containing the Hexaflumuron and return to the colony to
feed the colony members. They also send other termites out so they
too can feed on the bait. The bait stops the molting process so the
termites cannot grow to the next level. Hence the termites die a
natural death and the entire colony is eliminated. The bait control
system has been available to homeowners through qualified pest
control experts for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   As good as this system is, it still has limitations. To be
effective, the bait stations must be implanted into the ground
where termites forage for food. Suppose, however, the area
surrounding a home is largely concrete or asphalt. It is difficult
to make a hole large enough to position the station. In addition,
the bait stations work by stopping termites before they enter a
structure. But suppose the insects have already penetrated into the
home?
</P>
<P>
   To meet these problems, manufacturers developed a variation of
the in-ground bait stations. These devices have just recently
become available to homeowners through authorized pest control
technicians. It is a simple above-ground station that also contains
Hexaflumuron.
</P>
<P>
   The station can be secured to walls or ceilings with screws,
caulk or double- sided tape, depending upon the surface. Thus the
bait station can be installed in any home without drilling through
walls, floors or ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The bait stations are not only for interior use; they can be
placed on the exterior walls if there is evidence of termite
activity. Used in this way, the bait boxes serve as a complement to
the in-ground stations. Ideally both devices should be installed,
whenever possible, to eliminate the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Since these bait stations have no moving parts or electrical
hook-ups, it might seem that almost anyone can install them and
eliminate their termite problem. But it's not that simple. The
Hexaflumuron bait does not attract termites, it only exists as an
alternate food source. It is essential that the stations be
positioned in strategically to allow foraging termites to find
them. Otherwise, they will be ineffective. In addition, they must
be inspected frequently to check for termite feeding. Bait that has
been consumed must be replenished until the termites stop feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Katz, president of Knockout Pest Control, and a
recognized authority on pest control techniques, points out that
the bait systems are the wave of the future in controling termites.
However, it is essential that pest control technicians have the
proper training in using this technology or else it will be of
limited value.

   REQUESTS: Jeanette Crowson, Burleson, Texas, writes with several
requests. One is for a cake her 86-year-old mother used to make.
Called a paradise cake, it was a layer cake with dates and had a
sugar-milk/water frosting with a praline texture.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also like the recipe for ``old-fashioned'' dumplings.
These aren't biscuit dough dropped by the spoonful, but instead are
made from dough rolled out and cut into strips. The strips were
either dropped into a hot mixture or used as a crust for a cobbler
with more dumplings inside.
</P>
<P>
   And one last request from her is for the tartar sauce served at
Dallas' Jay's Marine Grill in the '50s and '60s. It's not the same
as tartar sauce served today. She's not sure if it included either
mayonnaise or relish. It was served with hot popovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Bielicke, Granbury, Texas, would like a recipe for date
nut bars.
</P>
<P>
   May Dean Braddock, Burleson, Texas, would like a recipe for
ambrosia cake. Her mother made this cake at Christmas. The cake is
made with four thin layers of chocolate with fresh apples chopped
in the batter. The cooked icing was made with coconut, pecans and
chunks of fresh oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Burgess, Fort Worth, would like a recipe for biscotti
that uses a cake mix.

 By TINA KELLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the English author George Moore once wrote, ``A man travels
the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find
it.'' For business travelers, those needs may be as simple as an AC
outlet, an incoming phone line, a chair and a flat surface for
spreading out papers.
</P>
<P>
   But just try finding them near most airport departure gates.
Instead, you're likely to encounter a business employee in a suit,
sitting on the dusty carpet between the Coke machine and the
utility closet, typing away on a recharging laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new company, Laptop Lane, is trying to make it easier to
do business on the fly. In the Cincinnati and Seattle airports,
Laptop Lane leases offices offering what it calls ``peace, quiet
and a T-1 line.''
</P>
<P>
   For $8.95 a half-hour, travelers can use a cubicle with a Micron
Pentium PC equipped with major e-mail and business software and
computer games; a dedicated, incoming fax line; four telephone
lines; a laser printer; a place to plug in their laptops; free
local calls; 25-cents-a-minute long-distance service; and a
lockable door.
</P>
<P>
   Peripatetic executives can connect their laptops to a 56K modem
or, if they have an Ethernet card, a T-1 line that moves data at
1.5 megabytes per second. Conference calls for up to six parties
can be arranged, and a color laser printer is available.
</P>
<P>
   The offices are separated by partitions, over which the muffled
tones of business conversations in many languages and requests for
copy machines (they're provided) can be heard, but no more loudly
than in most offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, someone could be in here on a notebook, reading
e-mail, getting a fax, talking to four people and charging the
laptop battery,'' said Bruce Merrell, the company's chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   More Laptop Lanes are scheduled to open in Atlanta and O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago by Christmas, and in Laguardia
Airport, Philadelphia and Los Angeles by the first quarter of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar technical services are now available in some airports,
but seldom in such concentration. Terry Colegrove, a project
manager with Siemens, which provides consulting services to
airports, said many airports offer kiosks in which travelers can
log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not taken off to that great an extent, but it will in
the near future, probably,'' he said. ``Airports have got to look
into more in the way of holding rooms and plug-in facilities for
laptops.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell helped establish Laptop Lane, which is based in Seattle,
after spending a year commuting from there to South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became surgically attached to my laptop,'' he said, ``and a
life member of United's Red Carpet Club, but I found I needed more
services'' _ in particular, privacy. ``Give me five minutes in any
club room in America,'' he said, ``and I can tell you what
everyone's working on.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 cubicles in the Laptop Lane in Cincinnati/Northern
Kentucky International Airport, and 7 in Seattle/Tacoma
International Airport, as well as a conference room. Both centers
serve 30 to 40 people a day, for an average stay of 35 minutes,
Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   As a side benefit, Laptop Lane offers travelers a chance to
test-drive high-tech products and try their own applications on
advanced hardware. There are also plans to lease cellular
telephones and laptops.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are worried about sharing an office with many
fellow travelers, there's little chance that bugs, viruses or
cookie crumbs of any kind will be left on the desks, telephones or
computers.
</P>
<P>
   After each patron leaves, Laptop Lane's cyber concierge quickly
slips in a disk to reboot each computer's hard drive and get rid of
any files or Internet tracks. The concierge then spritzes the
telephone, desk and doorknob with disinfectant, readying the office
for the next traveler.

<P>
   According to recent news reports, I have a cousin by the name of
Julia Jefferson Westerinen who lives on Staten Island. Next year,
when the Monticello Association has its annual meeting, I'm going
to invite Julia and her family to be my guests. We'll be welcomed
to the main house late in the afternoon for a family reception.
We'll be able to go upstairs to rooms that have long been closed to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Children will romp across the grassy lawn behind the house.
Everybody will stand around drinking Virginia wine and talking
about how much the youngsters have grown since last year, the way
they always do. That night, the family will have its annual
barbecue somewhere in Charlottesville, and the following morning,
we'll all gather at the graveyard for a memorial prayer for Thomas
Jefferson and more than 100 other relatives who are buried there.
</P>
<P>
   But that afternoon, when the Monticello Association meets in a
hotel ballroom downtown, its doors will be closed to Julia and her
family, despite the fact that as a descendant of Sally Hemings' son
Eston Hemings Jefferson she is also, according to new DNA evidence,
descended from Thomas Jefferson himself. Almost two centuries after
Jefferson's death, most of the members of the association, which
comprises 800 descendants of his daughters Maria and Martha, of
which I am one, have yet to come to grips with the notion that the
great man fathered children not only by his wife, Martha, but by
Martha's half-sister, his slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   I hope all that will change in the next year, and Julia and my
other cousins who are descended from Hemings and Jefferson will
have the same right I have to join the Monticello Association and
the same right I have to be buried in the graveyard on a hill
behind Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   The excuse that has always been given to deny descendants of
Sally Hemings membership in the Monticello Association is that
there is not ``enough evidence'' that Jefferson and Sally Hemings
had children together. The association has relied upon reams of
``evidence'' from historians over the years that such a
relationship would have been impossible. It's a sad commentary on
the association and on the historians friendly to its point of view
that its members have had to be dragged kicking and screaming by
the production of DNA evidence into admitting to this possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Monticello Association and the historians upon
whom they have relied have put no value on the oral histories of
the families descended from Sally Hemings, which have held all
along that Jefferson fathered children by her. Over the years,
there have been two sides to this question _ the ``white'' side and
the ``black'' side.
</P>
<P>
   On the white side, there is voluminous written material from
Jefferson himself, from his friends and relatives, from his
journals and records, from contemporaneous histories and records
kept by others that establish his whereabouts on particular days
and months of various years. On the black side, there is no written
material, because slave owners enforced ignorance and illiteracy as
powerful tools to keep their slaves under control.
</P>
<P>
   Historians ignored or denigrated the oral histories of the
slaves Jefferson owned, while valuing the written histories of him
and his contemporaries. There will doubtlessly be defenses of their
methodology, now that DNA seems to have proven that an oral
tradition of the Woodson family was wrong on the ancestry of
Hemings' oldest son, Thomas Woodson. Jefferson evidently fathered
her youngest son, Eston.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real point is that historians didn't even listen to
the voices of the ancestors of slaves in the first place, which is
racist on its face. Historians should not be permitted to skate
sideways out of the trap they set for themselves with the kind of
mea culpa we have heard from Joseph Ellis, the author of ``American
Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson.'' While only a year ago
Ellis was declaring a relationship between Jefferson and Hemings to
be impossible, this year he says: ``Now, with impeccable timing,
Jefferson reappears to remind us of a truth that should be
self-evident. Our heroes _ and especially presidents _ are not gods
or saints, but flesh-and-blood humans.''
</P>
<P>
   That truth didn't seem so self-evident to him a year or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gillespie, the president of the Monticello Association,
has been quoted as saying that Jefferson was not the kind of man
who would have children out of wedlock. He said he believed
Jefferson was somehow different from the slave-owning tobacco
farmer down the road who had his way with female slaves any time he
wanted, and different even from Jefferson's own father-in-law, John
Wayles, a plantation owner who had two daughters of note:
Jefferson's wife, Martha, and, with his slave, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   That it has taken DNA to establish, finally, that Jefferson was
in fact no different from these men reveals the painfully short
distance this nation has come from the days of slavery and how far
it has to go. What Gillespie should be ashamed of is not
Jefferson's sexual history but slavery itself.
</P>
<P>
   Historians like Ellis have wanted Jefferson to be a more
``perfect'' exemplar of America and of democracy. Without saying
so, they wish he had done the right thing and freed his slaves the
morning he sat down to write the Declaration of Independence. They
have tried to push aside what Annette Gordon-Reed, the author of
``Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,''
has pointed out so eloquently: that this nation is a family not
just in democratic theory, but in blood. They have done so because
it makes them nervous that in the matter of Thomas Jefferson,
blacks and whites share not just a common history, but indeed a
common father.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I have been afraid that nervousness about shared blood between
blacks and whites will make it difficult to open up the Monticello
Association, and comments this week by Gillespie have borne out my
fears. At the last meeting of the association, in May, he announced
that ``if DNA is authoritatively established, there will be no
option but to allow membership.'' But he seems to have changed his
mind since the new DNA evidence came in. He now opposes allowing
any descendants of Jefferson and Hemings into the graveyard because
the all-white membership of the Monticello Association owns the
graveyard and, alas, we're running out of space. We don't have
enough money to maintain a larger graveyard. (Cremations are
already being encouraged.)
</P>
<P>
   The size of the graveyard has been increased one time already,
and it can surely be increased again. We don't need any more DNA
analysis. We don't need to split hairs over who is, and who isn't,
descended from Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. And we don't
need to worry whether further easements will be granted to enlarge
the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Foundation, which owns the grounds of Monticello, would actually
deny an easement to make room for the descendants of Jefferson and
Hemings. Hard to imagine, too, the Monticello Association, grown
larger by its new Jefferson/Hemings members, couldn't raise the
money to maintain a larger graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't problems; they're excuses. And they ignore and
disrespect the humility and patience of my cousin Julia, and of all
my other Hemings cousins who want only to be treated as descendants
of Jefferson, the same way I am. ``I have four children and two
grandchildren,'' Julia said wistfully. ``It would be nice if they
did decide to let us come in. Even a little stone would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   We've gone on for far too long believing the fiction that one of
the great Founding Fathers was something akin to a god. He wasn't.
He was a man. It is now clear that there is a strong likelihood
that after the death of his wife, he fell in love with Sally
Hemings and fathered at least one of her children. The fact that
the only slaves he freed upon his death had the last name Hemings
serves as a further reminder of his attachment to Sally Hemings,
her brothers and her children. It's time to put aside the
hairsplitting and get on with reconciling ourselves to the fact
that this nation was founded on the backs of so many slaves who
made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   I have always been proud that I'm a sixth-generation grandson of
Thomas Jefferson, but pride in one's heritage has come cheaply over
all these years. Now it's time to pay up. Even if Thomas Jefferson
didn't do the right thing two centuries ago, we can do the right
thing now. As members of the Monticello Association we can start by
opening our hearts and our arms to Julia, and to all our other
Hemings cousins. Hopefully, they'll accept an invitation that was
way, way too long in coming.

SETTING, AND ENFORCING, LIMITS WHILE RESPECTING PRIVACY

<P>
   Esther Shapiro has a sneaky way to make her daughter Debbie to
log off of America Online and do her homework. She goes into
Debbie's brother Andre's room and picks up his phone receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Since Debbie and Andre share a phone line, the move
automatically cuts off Debbie's online connection. ``It's a little
trick I learned,'' Ms. Shapiro said. ``I use it as a last resort,
when telling her to get off doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shapiro is among the legions of parents trying to monitor
their children's online time, but who feel that exercising too much
control could disrupt their children's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about her being disciplined about school work,'' Ms.
Shapiro said, ``because this seems like too much time talking with
her friends. But at the same time, I know I have to try and trust
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Short of using any of the countless e-mail and Internet filters
now available, which can offend the average 16-year-old, what is
the beleaguered online chaperone to do?
</P>
<P>
   Barbara J. Feldman, a San Diego-based newspaper columnist who
writes a guide for parents on online safety (www.surfnetkids.com)
and other issues, enforces one steadfast rule in the home she
shares with her two teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't allow a computer with Internet access in a room where
you can close the door, like in their bedrooms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman also periodically looks at the browser history files
stored on the three computers in her house to check for visits to
any Web sites she deems inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   To do so for America Online running in Windows, go to Programs
in the Start menu, choose Windows Explorer to find the Windows
folder and then look at its History file. Mac users will find the
History file in System Folder: Preferences: History. Most browsers
also have History buttons, as well as Preference buttons, which let
you determine how long Internet addresses stay in the folder.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important element in monitoring kids' online
activity is to start out with a mutual agreement on a few ground
rules, and then to stick to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain level of trust has to be established,'' Ms. Feldman
said. ``You have to have a discussion about what you expect their
behavior to be, and they have to have a clear understanding about
the fact that if they don't follow that behavior, they're going to
lose access.''

WEB RADIO EXPANDS LISTENING HORIZONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By RACHEL LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was taught not listen to the radio while I worked. One of the
fastest-growing Internet industries, Web radio, is based on
breaking that very rule.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of Web radio, both of which can be heard via
streaming-audio technology. One kind is really ordinary radio that
is heard over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Web now makes it possible to tune into an out-of-state
baseball game or listen to your favorite college radio station
without leaving town. The other kind of Web radio was created
exclusively for the Internet. Together, traditional broadcasters
and Internet-only start-ups offer more than 1,700 audio channels
that you can listen to through your computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical mass of choice,'' said Larry Magne, editor of
the original edition of ``Passport to Web Radio'' (International
Broadcasting Service, 1997), which describes stations from Texas to
Taipei. (An updated edition, edited by David Walcutt, appeared
earlier this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like www.broadcast.com and the BRS Radio Directory
(www.radio-directory.com) act as portals to thousands of
traditional and Web-only stations.
</P>
<P>
   Magne said that in traditional broadcast markets, many genres,
like classical, are losing out to programming that draws better
advertising. The Web provides a broader range of choice. For
example, Magne said that Radio Beethoven, a tiny classical station
that broadcasts from Santiago, Chile, is one of the best classical
radio stations around (www.beethovenfm.cl/RealAudio/ index.html).
</P>
<P>
   Many Web-only radio stations were founded on the idea of
countering a trend toward less broadcast diversity. Web technology
allows stations to offer niche programs. Some are homespun pirate
stations or stations devoted to only one band, like
www.deadradio.com, which exclusively plays the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the many independent stations, there are larger
Internet-only networks that offer multiple channels of music and
talk. Three of those reviewed here _ Imagine Radio, Netradio and
Spinner _ have eliminated audio advertisements and disk jockey
chatter. They offer a wide variety of programming and, in the case
of Imagine, personalizing programming.
</P>
<P>
   But personalized programming has made many record labels and the
Recording Industry Association of America worry that Web radio will
threaten CD sales. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was
recently signed into law, further secures copyright protection on
line.
</P>
<P>
   While all Web radio stations are required to pay fees to artists
through Ascap and BMI, this new legislation will force Web radio
stations to pay a licensing fee to record labels as well.
</P>
<P>
   The act says customized stations must negotiate individual
contracts with all the labels whose artists they play, and it
forbids stations to play more than two songs in a row from a single
artist in a three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Record companies don't yet understand the power of user
customization,'' said John Adams, director of programming for
Imagine Radio. ``They have to realize that it can expose new
artists and increase record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   To listen to Web radio, you need Real Player, a technology
developed by the Real Networks Corp. that enables an audio signal
to be ``streamed'' over the Internet. Real Player is available free
at www.real.com and takes between 10 and 20 minutes to download.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be found through most Web radio portals and
networks. If your modem uses dial-up access, Web radio will eat up
half your bandwidth, and on any connection slower than an ISDN
line, Web broadcasts are accompanied by an AM radio-style buzz.
</P>
<P>
   But if choice and control are more important, and if you like
the retro charm of the AM buzz, then Web radio can be a listening
adventure.

DAVIS RIDES MODERATION TO VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis capitalized on his
moderate, workhorse image to capture the governorship of the
country's most populous state, becoming the first Democrat to head
California in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Winning by a margin that defied even the most optimistic polls,
Davis won 58 percent of the vote to 38 percent for Attorney General
Dan Lungren, the widest margin of victory for an open governor's
seat since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this great victory tonight is more than just electing a
candidate for governor,'' Davis told supporters in Los Angeles.
``It is a clear affirmation that Californians want to take a
moderate path to the future. That is who I am, that is how I ran,
and that is how I'll govern.''
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of staff to Jerry Brown, California's last
Democratic governor, Davis beat Lungren across the board, according
to exit polls. He tied with Lungren in only two areas: each took 49
percent of white men and 49 percent of voters over 65, groups
Lungren was expected to sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won 78 percent of the Hispanic vote, with the Republicans
only showing slight gains after huge losses in the wake of
Proposition 187, the anti-immigration initiative championed by
retiring Gov. Pete Wilson during the 1994 gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   Davis captured 65 percent of self-described moderates, an
important voting bloc in California, and 21 percent of
conservatives. And exit polls showed Davis getting 61 percent of
women voters, which political analysts say can be attributed in
part to Lungren's strong anti-abortion positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When women vote, good men and good women win,'' said Rep. Jane
Harman, D-Calif., who lost to Davis in the primary. ``It's a great
year for California and it's a great year for women.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the most expensive gubernatorial race in American
history, with Lungren and Davis spending more than $50 million, and
Davis' two Democratic challengers in the June primary spending $57
million.
</P>
<P>
   As the governor of the nation's most populous state, Davis will
preside over the re-drawing of California's congressional and
legislative districts after the 2000 Census, giving Democrats a
decided edge.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 55, successfully portrayed Lungren as an extremist by
using a powerful weapon: Lungren's votes in Congress from 1979 to
1989. Davis' most effective television advertisement, which went
largely unanswered by Lungren, said the Republican voted against
school lunches and Head Start and received a ``0'' score out of 100
from the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are not looking for rigid ideologues,'' Davis said
Monday. ``They are looking for leaders who solve their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, 52, spent much of the campaign attempting to link Davis
to his liberal former boss, Brown, now the mayor-elect of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In a gracious concession speech, Lungren noted that his loss was
only the second for him out of 18 campaigns since he first ran for
Congress in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who we were unable to convince of our vision
of the future,'' he said. ``But to those millions out there who did
support us, I thank you, and I want to tell you that our dreams do
not die because we lose one fight.''

<P>
   Perhaps Bill Teel's job is an ingenious punishment for something
diabolical he did as a child. He must concentrate carefully on
hunted-and-pecked lines like these cascading down his computer
screen: ``I'm 11 but I'll be 12 in 5 months,'' ``I look like the
singer Jewel or Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and, ``Do eney of you
like Leonado Deicapreo.''
</P>
<P>
   Each week Teel, who lives near Seattle, spends 20 to 25 hours
reading as much as possible of the contents of a chat room for
children 8 to 14 at the Headbone Zone (www.headbone.com).
</P>
<P>
   His job at the Web site, which is run out of a former grange
headquarters in downtown Seattle, is to make sure that up to 200
youngsters play nice in its virtual sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   There are unmonitored chat sites all over the Internet, which
children can easily reach. But there are also sites for children
that keep an eye on things. Some of the children's chat sites rely
on filters to monitor language, like the Kids Club at www.
galacticgalaxy.com, while others, like Headbone, Child.net
(www.child.net) and Free Zone (www.freezone.com), have human
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Headbone is the realm of people named Smoochycutie, Imdaman,
Burntsquirrel, Schwinnrider and ThePeople'sElbow. (``Now Hotspice _
there have been a number of them,'' Teel said. ``And they're always
troublemakers.'')
</P>
<P>
   He and the eight other monitors he manages must be ever watchful
for nicknames of body parts.
</P>
<P>
   An hour into Teel's watch, Headbone Chat looks like a giant game
of Red Light, Green Light, with the children trying to sneak by and
feigning innocence if they get caught. After two hours, it's more
like a storm-the-fortress video game, as Teel moves quickly to foil
the culprits trying to erode the restraints.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the third hour, it's quitting time. He has
completed a few six-hour shifts, he said, but that is far too long
for maintaining sanity.
</P>
<P>
   While it sometimes frightens him that these are his future jet
pilots and gerontologists, Teel, 43, enjoys monitoring the
children. ``I love it _ I love it completely,'' he said. ``I really
enjoy watching the kids have fun. And there's a lot of camaraderie
about making this place safe for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The children love virtual pool parties, where a few play
lifeguards, somebody's a deejay, the girls' on-screen characters
change into name-brand string bikinis, and the monitors have to
stay on the alert for near-drownings, which are just cheap excuses
for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had weddings in here,'' Teel said. ``But we don't
allow them to have honeymoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The children used to like virtual food fights, but those could
get out of hand. ``They'd be throwing Pepsi in bottles, hitting you
on the head, and before long there'd be blood all over the floor,''
Teel said. ``Sometimes it would start off with spaghetti.''
Provided, of course, they could spell it.
</P>
<P>
   There are rules here. Teel has authority, and his justice is
swift _ he clicks on a naughty child's screen name, chooses 30, 90
or 720 minutes in the penalty box and boom, that kid is outta here.
</P>
<P>
   Teel, a single parent of three teen-age sons, one of whom works
with him as a monitor, is serious about the chat room rules. To
protect children, Headbone forbids them to give out their last
names, non-Headbone e-mail addresses and the names of their schools
and hometowns, unless they live in large cities. No ZIP codes, no
phone numbers, no instructions for anything like Internet Relay
Chat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on a crib sheet of 30 ready-made warnings, messages
that can go out with two keystrokes, warning A reads: ``Posting
personal information like that can be unsafe. And Headbone Chat's
No. 1 rule is a rule against it.''
</P>
<P>
   That warning gets used slightly more often than this one:
``Please, no Hanson fights in Headbone Chat, OK? Passions run high
on this subject, and tempers can flare up, but let's move on to
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no such prefabricated answer for one question often
posed to the monitors: ``Are you real or a computer?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Headbone has 134,592 members and gets about 368,616 visits per
month _ the site is free but carries advertising. While there is no
good way to verify age over the Internet, children who say they are
younger than 13 have to get their parents to sign and fax a
permission slip to use Headbone chat and e-mail. Still, people with
impure motives might try to fake their way in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the monitors are there,'' said Jennifer DeJoy, a
Headbone spokeswoman. ``They're trained to look for behaviors that
are not kid behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   The site does not allow sex talk, explicitly violent talk,
fights, talk about weapons or racist or other abusive language.
There is also a filter to prevent swearing.
</P>
<P>
   Insults are still allowed. ``Oh yeah u have buzerd lips'' is not
a big deal. The rules seem to encourage weasling. Kids try to get
around the filters by typing spaces or asterisks in between
letters, or by transmitting phone numbers one digit at a time or by
using the shift key to disguise numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The world of chat for children is an anthropologist's dream, a
society with its own quirks and customs, where a boy types
-(AT))---)------ to a girl to give her a rose. It's a land without
spell checkers, where the pre- and post-pubescent swing between
Beanie Babies and gangsta talk.
</P>
<P>
   Teel, who often watches over the chat room from his home
computer, finds himself in a panic if the monitors' oversight is
interrupted _ by power glitches, ISP problems, phone disconnects _
and the children are left unmonitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most down time we've ever had was five or eight minutes,
but that's like an eternity,'' he said. ``Your heart's going
boom-boom-boom.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees the messages scroll by quickly on his screen. The
monitors see them in red if they were caught in the swear filter
(and thus not posted), orange if they might be questionable
(usually anything with an (AT), which might be an e-mail address)
and green for people entering the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes too much sense, especially when messages from all
five chat rooms appear in real time on a single screen.
</P>
<P>
   Teel, who worked on the beta version of the Microsoft Network as
a forum monitor before going to Headbone in 1997, said he had been
a chat fan ever since 1987 or 1988, when he would chat back and
forth to people on Genie, the former online service of General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   He met his second ex-wife in a chat room, when he called himself
Farmer Bill on line. He and the other monitors work at home in
various time zones for ``more than minimum wage,'' he said,
declining to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Teel talks to himself as he scans the screen. Noticing Becka12's
comment ``they can kiss my beap----,'' he remarked, ``She was being
mean to Pooh a little while ago.'' He warned her about her
language.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are kicked out, even briefly, often resort to the
Rants page. Sissy99, for example, was booted out for a day for
giving out her e-mail address. She was furious, and her threats
became downright ominous _ ``Let me in or I will never
return!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   But Teel remains unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to provide a safe place for the kids to have
fun,'' he said.

MICROSOFT'S LATEST: A TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. does not go softly into hardware. When it
decides to enter a hardware niche, it typically has a good reason.
The rise of graphical user interfaces like the Windows shell
demanded a mouse, and Microsoft is now the big cheese in computer
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's game-software division is a powerhouse, so the
company is trying to conquer the market for game paraphernalia like
joysticks, steering wheels and stereo speakers. William H. Gates
became a daddy, and now there is the Microsoft Actimates
Interactive Barney doll.
</P>
<P>
   And now Microsoft is going after the cordless phone business,
which says a lot about the company's vision for the future. It is a
future that blends telecommunications, consumer electronics and
computing, and it envisions increasing reliance on voice commands
to control common household devices _ that, not coincidentally, use
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest hardware product is a $199 cordless telephone
that connects to a personal computer and uses Windows-based call
management software. In theory, the Microsoft Cordless Phone
System, officially known as the PC Phone System MP-900, is supposed
to harness the power of the PC to improve the way we use the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of weeks of testing the MP-900, I find it hard to
give it a ringing endorsement. Even so, the ideas behind the PC
Phone System MP-900 are so compelling that I eagerly await version
2.0.
</P>
<P>
   The MP-900 is a black, 900-megahertz cordless phone that comes
with a desktop cradle, a base station that connects to a PC and a
CD-ROM disk with call management software. In general,
900-megahertz phones are significantly superior to the
first-generation cordless phones, which operated at 46 to 49 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables the user to set up a voice mail system,
with separate voice-mail boxes for each member of a family or small
business.
</P>
<P>
   A voice command system lets the user make calls by simply
speaking the name of the recipient, once that name and phone number
are entered in a speed-dial directory. Up to 40 names can be
entered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to call one's bookmaker, one simply presses the
voice command button on the handset and says, ``Call Weasel.''
(Your bookie's name may vary.) The phone looks up Weasel's number
in the PC database, dials it and logs the call.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first successful examples of speech recognition
in my house, certainly more impressive than when I try to summon my
teen-ager by voice.
</P>
<P>
   If the user subscribes to a Caller ID service through the phone
company, the software can recognize calls from certain individuals
and play a custom greeting whenever that person calls.
</P>
<P>
   The phone handset also uses voice synthesis to announce incoming
calls. ``Gates, Bill, calling.'' Thus, the user can screen calls
even when away from the PC. Voice messages are stored on the
computer's hard disk and can be played back, even from a remote
location.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great in theory. But to be broadly successful,
consumer electronics devices have to be relatively inexpensive,
simple to learn, easy to use, reliable and so compelling that
people eventually wonder how they ever survived without one.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone is one example, and the radio, the television, the
VCR, the stereo and the microwave oven are others.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, the Microsoft Cordless Phone has not quite
made the connection. First, $199 is a lot to spend on a
single-line, 900-megahertz analog cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   For just a few dollars more, you can get 2.4-gigahertz digital
spread-spectrum cordless phone with greater range, two-line
capability and protection against electronic eavesdroppers. (The
problem with many analog cordless phones is that your conversations
can sometimes be picked up on the neighbor's baby monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy a 900-MHz digital cordless phone with many useful
features for much less than $199. Sony just introduced several new
900-MHz digital phones, for slightly more money, that match some of
the more appealing features of the Microsoft phone, without the
need for a PC.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 70 percent of American households have a
cordless phone already, fewer than 45 percent have a PC, and of
those, not all have the features needed to operate the Microsoft
phone. These include a Pentium 90 processor (or faster) running
Windows 95 or 98, a vacant serial port, 32 megabytes of RAM, up to
100 megabytes of hard disk space and a Windows-compatible 16-bit
sound card with a microphone and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more appealing features require Caller ID, a
subscription service offered by local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The phone will not work with Windows NT, and there are no plans
to create a Macintosh version, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the MP-900 to my Windows PC was harder than I thought
it would be and required much fussing over serial ports. The
software installed easily, but it refused to work until other phone
extensions on the line were disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The phone's battery must be charged for 10 hours before use,
which might frustrate users who require instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The special call management software is relatively easy to
configure. But it was unnecessarily difficult to import the
hundreds of names and telephone numbers I have collected in
Microsoft Outlook into the new phone's directory. The idea of
re-entering all those numbers manually was too much to bear. The
thought of attempting a link with Sidekick or some other
non-Microsoft contact-management software was truly odious.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I tweaked the software, the phone refused to play
the custom announcements I lovingly recorded for special callers _
the Wicked Witch theme song for one, the submarine ``battle
stations'' sound effects for another, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest drawback is that to take advantage of all
the advanced features, you must leave the PC turned on. If the PC
is switched off or crashes, the MP-900 becomes a very expensive
cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a headset option for the MP-900, which disqualifies
it for use as my primary office phone.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of messages played back through my computer's
speakers was erratic, fading in and out. On the flip side, my
digital cellular phone is much less reliable, and I still put up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the MP-900 is a clever device, and its call
management software deserves to be incorporated into future
generations of desktop and cordless phones. But the price is still
a bit steep, the inconveniences still outweigh the advantages, and
non-PC cordless phone technologies offer some of the same
features. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column about Macintosh OS 8.5, a brief reference
was made to the ``Revision B'' iMac computer. Apple would neither
confirm nor deny what it said were ``rumors'' about the existence
of the new model. Here are the details: Since introducing the iMac
in July, Apple has made several improvements to the original model,
including adding a faster graphics chip and more video RAM (6 MB
versus 2 MB). These Revision B iMacs come from the factory with Mac
OS 8.5 installed instead of 8.1.

 &HT;    CRUISE, KIDMAN NOT NECESSARILY GETTING THE 'STAR' TREATMENT IN
LONDON
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Actor Tom Cruise is learning that stardom has its
tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise and his superstar wife Nicole Kidman have been living
with their two children and entourage in London for two years while
the star couple has been making a film with famed director Stanley
Kubrick, who only shoots in England.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Kidman also has been spending her nights performing
naked in a West End play. But more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city as cosmopolitan as London, the glamorous couple
has created quite a stir, and the newspapers here have been eagerly
following their every move. It even made news when a member of the
Paparazzi corps recently consented to Kidman's entreaties not to
take her picture while she was out shopping one evening.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always gone so easy with the local press. Last week,
the couple obtained a six-figure libel settlement against the
tabloid Express, which had reported that their marriage was a
purely business arrangement intended to mask the fact that the two
were homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing somber yet stylish in a pony tail last Thursday,
Cruise said he took no pleasure in winning his case. ``It is a last
recourse against those who have printed vicious lies about me and
my family,'' Cruise said. ``I have to protect them. It is not about
the money; every penny of this substantial sum will be donated to
various charities.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, entitled ``Cruising for a Bruising: What's the
Inside Story on Hollywood's Golden Couple?'' also asserted that
Cruise was impotent and sterile.
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuit was filed, the newspaper admitted the story
was false.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the ``Top Gun'' star last month seemed the very
picture of virility when he intervened to help a neighbor who was
being mugged in the street outside her home. Cruise went to the
woman's aid while dispatching his bodyguard in hot pursuit after
her attacker. Cruise was heralded as being as heroic as the parts
he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, superstardom has its limits. Last week, when Cruise, the
star of such big Hollywood hits as ``Rain Man,'' ``Jerry McGuire,''
and ``Mission Impossible'' attempted to join his neighborhood
Blockbuster, he ran into the time-honored English devotion to
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having one of the most recognizable faces on Earth,
Cruise apparently had insufficient identification. The staff of the
Bushy Heath Blockbuster held its ground and sent a bewildered
Cruise home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Management beamed with pride. ``There is no special dispensation
for household names,'' a spokesman for the chain told The Times of
London. ``We always ask for two forms of ID, so the member of the
staff was simply following company sign-up procedures and doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that Tom Cruise wants to become a member. But
for security and mailing purposes, we need to know who and where
our customers are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cruise's exploits have been of only passing note compared to
the attention generated by his wife's $65-a-night performances of
the play ``The Blue Room'' in the 250-seat Donmar Warehouse
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It's a demanding role in which Kidman doffs here clothes to play
five characters, each of whom has sex with a different man. The
show, which closed Saturday, was sold out for its entire six-week
run as soon as news spread of Kidman's risque business. Scalpers
were getting more than $l,500 per ticket. Each day, lines of
hopefuls -- an inordinate number of them juvenile boys -- stood
outside the box office praying for returned tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews have been, well, rave, if not all suitable for a
family newspaper in America.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Spencer of the Daily Telegraph was fairly typical in
solemnly describing the experience as ``theatrical Viagra.'' He
said he liked her acting, too.
</P>
<P>
   The play -- starring Kidman -- is scheduled to open on Broadway
in New York City before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's film featuring both Cruise and Kidman, ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' is expected in theaters some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   And with luck and proper ID, Cruise should be able to rent the
video several months later.

   One of the most striking images in ``Fat'' on ``Frontline'' is
that of triathlete Dave Alexander, in peak physical condition at 5
feet 8 inches and 250 pounds. A veteran of 264 triathlons,
Alexander embodies what the program's producer, Antony Thomas,
calls a ``revolutionary'' notion: It's possible to be both fit and
fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' interviews a Dallas reasearcher whose long-term
studies of fitness levels in 25,000 people found that men who were
fat but fit had no increased mortality rate. Professor Steven Blair
thinks that since people come in so many different shapes and
sizes, applying a predetermined ``ideal'' weight to an individual
is faulty logic.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the program, which airs this week on PBS, will be no
news at all for those who closely follow the fortunes of fat. But
it's an interesting overview of the state of a subject close to the
hearts, so to speak, of many Americans. A lot closer to some hearts
than others. ``Frontline'' reminds us that 39 million Americans are
obese, defined as 20 percent above the medically determined
``ideal'' weight.
</P>
<P>
   Experts interviewed by ``Frontline'' say scientists are finding
increasing evidence of genetic susceptibility to obesity. Some
people can't help gaining weight, caught as they are in what one
expert calls the ``fat trap'' of the American diet and our
increasingly sedentary way of life. And obesity is becoming a
serious problem in other parts of the world, as we export our
fast-food, leisure-centered lifestyle to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   It may be easier than ever to become fat, but it's never been
harder to be fat. ``You see our society does not accept very well
the obese individual,'' one doctor tells ``Frontline.'' ``They are
being treated today as the modern moral equivalent of lepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn McAffee, a 500-pound woman, is shown talking to
pharmaceutical employees about her weight struggle and about
anti-fat prejudice. ``If you are a super-size person, you are a
target,'' she says. ``I've personally had experiences where people
try to run me down in cars, laughing at me.''
</P>
<P>
   In another segment, elementary school students are handed
photographs of four children and asked to pick the one they would
least like as a friend. The most rejected photo by far is of a fat
child. The students interviewed are candid about why they wouldn't
want to befriend him. ``Because he's fat,'' one after another says.
The teacher asks what they think fat people are like. ``Lazy,''
says one little boy.
</P>
<P>
   Fat (and formerly fat) people can be just as hard on themselves.
When ``Frontline'' interviews patients who have undergone risky and
painful stomach bypass surgery to lose weight, they eagerly revile
their old selves. ``I was pitiful,'' says one. ``I looked like a
blimp,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   Anorexia and bulimia are the other side of obesity. The program
visits a British clinic where children as young as 6 are treated
for eating disorders. A very slim teenager says that when she looks
in the mirror, she sees ``a fat person _ a person who I just don't
like because it kind of repulses me.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment and fashion industries, and the media, are as
usual blamed for holding up an unrealistic ideal of slimness that
fosters eating disorders. Vidal Sassoon denies the connection,
saying he has seen very few models that he would consider anorexic.
``Frontline,'' meanwhile, shows footage of stick-thin models behind
the scenes of his latest fashion show. But can all models be
anorexic? If some people are genetically programmed to be fat,
surely there must be some who are genetically programmed to be
skeletal. Is this an example of anti-thin bias? Can there even be
such a thing in our culture?

 &HT;    CRUISE, KIDMAN NOT NECESSARILY GETTING THE 'STAR' TREATMENT IN
LONDON
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Actor Tom Cruise is learning that stardom has its
tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise and his superstar wife Nicole Kidman have been living
with their two children and entourage in London for two years while
the star couple has been making a film with famed director Stanley
Kubrick, who only shoots in England.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Kidman also has been spending her nights performing
naked in a West End play. But more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city as cosmopolitan as London, the glamorous couple
has created quite a stir, and the newspapers here have been eagerly
following their every move. It even made news when a member of the
Paparazzi corps recently consented to Kidman's entreaties not to
take her picture while she was out shopping one evening.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always gone so easy with the local press. Last week,
the couple obtained a six-figure libel settlement against the
tabloid Express, which had reported that their marriage was a
purely business arrangement intended to mask the fact that the two
were homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing somber yet stylish in a pony tail last Thursday,
Cruise said he took no pleasure in winning his case. ``It is a last
recourse against those who have printed vicious lies about me and
my family,'' Cruise said. ``I have to protect them. It is not about
the money; every penny of this substantial sum will be donated to
various charities.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, entitled ``Cruising for a Bruising: What's the
Inside Story on Hollywood's Golden Couple?'' also asserted that
Cruise was impotent and sterile.
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuit was filed, the newspaper admitted the story
was false.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, the ``Top Gun'' star last month seemed the very
picture of virility when he intervened to help a neighbor who was
being mugged in the street outside her home. Cruise went to the
woman's aid while dispatching his bodyguard in hot pursuit after
her attacker. Cruise was heralded as being as heroic as the parts
he plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, superstardom has its limits. Last week, when Cruise, the
star of such big Hollywood hits as ``Rain Man,'' ``Jerry McGuire,''
and ``Mission Impossible'' attempted to join his neighborhood
Blockbuster, he ran into the time-honored English devotion to
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having one of the most recognizable faces on Earth,
Cruise apparently had insufficient identification. The staff of the
Bushy Heath Blockbuster held its ground and sent a bewildered
Cruise home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Management beamed with pride. ``There is no special dispensation
for household names,'' a spokesman for the chain told The Times of
London. ``We always ask for two forms of ID, so the member of the
staff was simply following company sign-up procedures and doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted that Tom Cruise wants to become a member. But
for security and mailing purposes, we need to know who and where
our customers are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cruise's exploits have been of only passing note compared to
the attention generated by his wife's $65-a-night performances of
the play ``The Blue Room'' in the 250-seat Donmar Warehouse
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   It's a demanding role in which Kidman doffs here clothes to play
five characters, each of whom has sex with a different man. The
show, which closed Saturday, was sold out for its entire six-week
run as soon as news spread of Kidman's risque business. Scalpers
were getting more than $l,500 per ticket. Each day, lines of
hopefuls -- an inordinate number of them juvenile boys -- stood
outside the box office praying for returned tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews have been, well, rave, if not all suitable for a
family newspaper in America.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Spencer of the Daily Telegraph was fairly typical in
solemnly describing the experience as ``theatrical Viagra.'' He
said he liked her acting, too.
</P>
<P>
   The play -- starring Kidman -- is scheduled to open on Broadway
in New York City before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's film featuring both Cruise and Kidman, ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' is expected in theaters some time next year.
</P>
<P>
   And with luck and proper ID, Cruise should be able to rent the
video several months later.

 &HT;    TROUBLED CHILDHOOD LINKED TO CHRONIC ILLNESS IN ADULTS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Children who are abused are more likely to become
adults with health problems, say scientists in Atlanta and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   And they also may be more likely to have children who have
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at a Kaiser Permanente health maintenance
organization in San Diego and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta say they have found a statistical link
between childhood's marked by neglect and physical, emotional or
sexual abuse and adult behaviors that lead to diseases like cancer,
heart disease and even AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The research comes at a time when federal officials are becoming
increasingly interested in ways preventive health practices can
reduce the burden disease imposes on society.
</P>
<P>
   A conference Thursday and Friday at the National Institutes of
Health will hear from researchers in a variety of preventive health
areas. Speakers will describe programs ranging from efforts to
change the sexual behaviors of high-risk adolescents to helping
prevent depression among seniors with exercise programs.
</P>
<P>
   The studies showing links between childhood trauma and adult
disease were described in a recent article in the American Journal
of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   CDC chronic disease specialists and Dr. Vincent Felitti, an
internist who heads the department of preventive medicine at the
Kaiser Permanente HMO in San Diego, compared the health and habits
of more than 8,000 adults at the San Diego center with the
patients' own descriptions of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Each participant in the study was asked to fill out forms which
asked such questions as whether the patient had experienced any of
seven categories of abuse or neglect as a child: sexual, physical
or emotional abuse, witnessing the physical abuse of his or her
mother, or living in a home in which at least one parent was a
substance abuser, had been suicidal or had been incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaires were then compared with the patients' life
styles.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis showed that patients who had been subjected to at least
four of the abuse or neglect categories were 12 times as likely as
other adults to abuse alcohol or drugs, suffer from depression or
attempt suicide.
</P>
<P>
   They were twice as likely to smoke, to have had more than 50
sexual partners or to suffer from sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Felitti said in an interview that the data are now being
studied further to see if abused girls are more likely to become
pregnant as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, then it will mean an adult's behavior can end
up affecting the health of his or her grandchildren, since the
babies of teenaged mothers are more likely to be low birthweight
infants and suffer other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The research is the first to move cause and effect in health
matters across a generational divide.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Foege of the department of international health at
Emory University in Atlanta, said the study opens a scientific door
into what might be called a ``battered adult syndrome.''

GOP TO MAKE CONVENTION SITE ANNOUNCEMENT THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from an election in which Republicans
suffered setbacks, the party's national chairman said Wednesday
that a decision will be made this week on where the GOP will hold
its presidential nominating convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the final days of making a decision about where we
are gong to have the 2000 convention,'' said Jim Nicholson, the
Republican National Committee chairman. ``We hope to announce the
city of choice by the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have narrowed the selection to Indianapolis, New
Orleans, New York, Philadelphia and San Antonio. Party officials
made one last round of visits to the cities last month.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson stressed that landslide re-election victory of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and his strong showing among Hispanic voters
would not tip the scale toward San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The selection ``really boils down to the ability of the city to
deliver a good arena, have a good hotel package, a good
transportation system,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials are going through the fine-print details of the
various proposals from city leaders to ensure ``that there is a
confidence they can do all those things that they represent they
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has pledged more than $40 million to host the
convention, considerably more than other cities. Philadelphia is
offering $35 million; Indianapolis, $25 million; San Antonio, $21.5
million; and New Orleans, $22.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The search was narrowed from eight cities _ Charlotte, N.C.,
Chicago and Minneapolis didn't make the final cut. The previous GOP
convention was held in 1996 in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Bush won re-election with 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, prominent Hispanic Republicans, including former Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan of New Mexico, were lobbying to have the
convention in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding the convention in San Antonio gives the RNC an
unprecedented opportunity to reach out to the Hispanic community to
share our message and discuss our shared values,'' Lujan, an RNC
member, wrote committee officials.
</P>
<P>
   The party conventions are highly coveted by cities because the
week-long events, which culminate in the nomination of the party's
presidential nominee, are a boom, injecting as much as $100 million
into the local economy, according to RNC estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also are reviewing sites for their 2000 convention.
Cities seeking that party's convention include Denver, Los Angeles
and Philadelphia.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE MYSTIFIED, AMUSED BY VENTURA'S VICTORY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like much of the country, the White House was
mystified Wednesday by the election of former pro wrestler Jesse
''the Body'' Ventura as governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart, veteran of many a political
campaign, gave Ventura credit for a well-run race, and speculated
that ''obviously the voters in Minnesota were looking for some
change in the Democratic-Republican dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   The bespectacled and self-effacing White House chief of staff,
John Podesta, who must have a 27-inch waist and would probably
dress out somewhere under 145 pounds after a heavy meal, quipped to
reporters, ''I've decided to change my nickname from 'Skippy' to
John 'the Body' Podesta.''
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton weighed in, saying that while he didn't
know what the Ventura victory means for American politics, but ''I
think that you're going to have a lot of politicians spending time
in gyms now.''

   ELN-NATION-RDP _ Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the
mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other
Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to score the
traditional opposition party gains in the sixth year of a
presidency. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-ASSESS _ The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday,
like it or not. The millennial election will be fought on a
political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact
boundaries, were drawn by the voters in Tuesday's elections, which
delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the
Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing
Democrats. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-DEMOCRATS _ Politicians and strategists in both parties said
the Democratic successes in the elections on Tuesday stemmed from a
fundamental misreading of the electorate by the Republicans: In the
face of polls for nine months showing that voters were not
particularly exercised by the White House sex scandal, Republicans
persisted in trying to make it an issue. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-MINN-VENTURA (Bloomington, Minn.) _ Jesse Ventura has given
up body-slamming Hulk Hogan. He's quit wearing a pink feather boa
and glitter shorts. He no longer pummels alien invaders with Arnold
Schwarzenegger or plays characters who snarl things like ``I ain't
got time to bleed.'' In an earth-rattling political upset Tuesday,
the former ``bad boy'' on the pro wrestling circuit, action flick
actor, Navy SEAL, and talk radio shock jock, became the next
governor of Minnesota. By Pam Belluck.

   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ Russia will be unable to pay its foreign
debt next year and will seek to restructure the loans, Russia's top
economic aide said Wesnesday. The warning by the aide, Yuri
Maslyukov, was the first time that the Kremlin has stated it will
be unable to meet its debts. The admission comes as Russia is
reeling from a collapsing currency, a disastrous harvest and a
yawning budget deficit. By Michael R. Gordon.

   If I may say so, the e-mail I was writing to my brother the
other night was a sibling-to-sibling classic: a delicate balance of
wheedling, teasing and reminders of embarrassing childhood moments.
``What do you mean you have to work on Thanksgiving?'' I typed.
``You just want to avoid flashbacks to 1976, when you locked
yourself in your bedroom after being denied a drumsti__.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom!'' A voice interrupted my reverie. ``The cat brought some
animal inside, but it got away and it's behind the radiator.''
</P>

   For the next few minutes, I forgot that I had been online as I
chased a truculent cat into the basement, found the kitchen broom
(in the shed, behind a bike _ why?), then poked at a frightened
chipmunk until it skittered out the door.
</P>
<P>
   But then I heard another voice, eerily wafting down the stairs
from my office. ``Goodbye,'' my computer called in a tinny
electronic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Because my computer had been idle for more than 10 minutes,
America Online had disconnected me from its network. Again.
Clearly, the online provider did not understand the pressures of my
life. Otherwise, why would it accuse me of being idle when I had
merely taken a short rodent break?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, AOL once knocked me off while I was actually sitting
attentively at my computer, waiting for a file to finish
downloading. A reconstruction of the events surrounding that
incident revealed that the problem was more complicated that time.
I had been running a non-AOL browser that the network was unable to
detect. And since I had minimized the AOL window to run the other
browser, I could not see the reminder: ``You have been idle for
awhile. Do you want to stay online?''
</P>
<P>
   (Even more curious, the other day I used a non-AOL browser and
was not bumped off until after 20 minutes. And although AOL
officials insist that the idle timer is consistent, sometimes I use
a non-AOL browser for long periods without losing my connection.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more sanguine home computer user would accept these
vagaries and simply log back on. But this time the distraction of
being disconnected had caused me to forget an incredibly humorous
comment I had been about to hurl at my brother. Plus, I got three
busy signals before finally reconnecting at a poky 28.8 kilobits
per second.
</P>
<P>
   I needed a solution. Rather than abandon AOL altogether _ my new
membership still entitled me to some free hours, after all _ I went
to a shareware site and downloaded a software tool to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   The Stay On Pro 2.6 program, distributed by RC Computer Labs of
Colorado Springs (and downloadable from its Web site,
rclabs.simplenet.com), prevents AOL _ and most other online
providers that employ an ``idle timer'' _ from disconnecting you.
The program works by feigning computer activity even if you are
away from your desk. It automatically sends requests to connect,
every minute or so, to various Web pages that you specify,
convincing an online provider that a human is typing.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Brock, the programmer who created the original version of
the program two and a half years ago, was inspired by his own
frustration. ``I'd say that 90 percent of ISPs will disconnect idle
users after some period of time, which can get to be annoying,'' he
said. Stay On Pro also has a special feature to protect AOL users
from a second disconnect feature. ``After you've been on AOL for
about 46 minutes, whether you're idle or not, a box pops up to ask
if you want to continue,'' Brock said. ``You have to hit OK;
otherwise it disconnects you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at $19.95 (after a 30-day trial period), the program
sounded good. I learned why as soon as I phoned America Online.
``Programs like that are specifically prohibited,'' said Wendy
Goldberg, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg referred me to the company's Terms of Service
(that's keyword TOS, for anyone else who might be contemplating
rebellion), where I read, ``We reserve the right to log off
accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time, and we
prohibit the use of tools that defeat AOL's automatic log-off
feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I faced a moral dilemma. As I stared at the cute little Stay
On Pro icon on my screen, I had to admit that I could understand
AOL's position. After all, the more users connected at once, the
more equipment _ modems, routers, phone lines _ an online provider
has to invest in to prevent unnecessary traffic jams. It is
important to bear in mind that the Internet is a shared resource.
If you used a program like Stay On Pro to stay connected for a week
straight, you would be hogging more than your fair share.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, sometimes you get called away
unexpectedly for a short period and do not want to risk aborting a
download of a crucial shareware game like, say, Bust-a-Move 2,
which you need as soon as possible so you can practice secretly for
hours before challenging your husband to a round.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the punishment for using Stay On Pro?'' I asked Ms.
Goldberg, just so I would know my options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have different remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever caught anyone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that people will read the Terms of Service and
then they won't use it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But would you have any way of catching them if they did use
it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have to decide for myself?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your enforcer,'' Ms. Goldberg said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. I spent the first three decades of my life trying
to please parents, teachers, bosses and AOL rule makers _ and the
last six years fighting that same good-girl impulse. So I opened
Stay On Pro.
</P>
<P>
   The program worked beautifully. And after I stopped worrying all
the time about being disconnected, I even remembered the line I had
meant to write to my brother. And it was still hilarious.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, N.Y. _ All the way in the back of the N.Y. State
Agricultural Experiment Station's orchard here stand several
jumbled rows of the oddest apple trees you've ever seen. No two are
alike, not in form or leaf or fruit: this one could pass for a
linden tree, that one for a demented forsythia. Maybe a third of
these six-year-old trees are bearing apples this fall _ strange,
strange fruit that look and taste like nothing so much as God's
first drafts of what an apple might be.
</P>
<P>
   I saw apples with the hue and heft of olives or cherries, next
to glowing yellow Ping-Pong balls and dusky purple berries. I saw a
whole assortment of baseballs, oblate and conic, some of them
bright as infield grass, others dull as dirt. And I picked big,
shiny red fruits that look just like apples, of all things, and
seduce you into hazarding a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Hazard is, unfortunately, the word for it: Imagine sinking your
teeth into a tart potato, or a mushy Brazil nut sheathed in leather
(``spitters'' is the pomological term of art here), and then
tasting one that starts out with high promise on the tongue _ now
here's an apple! _ only to veer off into a bitterness so profound
that it makes the stomach rise even in recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apples, indeed: all of these trees were grown from seeds
gathered in Kazakhstan, in Central Asia, the wild apple's Eden,
where botanists now believe the domestic apple has its ancient
roots in a species called Malus sieversii. The orchard where I made
the acquaintance of M. sieversii is the U.S. Agriculture
Department's National Germplasm System's apple collection in
Geneva, probably the world's most comprehensive collection of apple
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 different varieties have been gathered from all over
the world and set out in pairs, as if on a beached botanical ark.
The card catalog to this arboreal archive, on 50 acres, runs the
gamut, from Adam's Pearmain, an antique English variety, to the
Zuccalmaglio, a German apple. A browser will find everything from
the first named American variety (the 17th-century Roxbury Russet)
to experimental crosses that bear only numbers. In this single
orchard one can behold the apple's past and also possibly glimpse
its future, for the wild apples I tasted represent the latest
accessions to the collection. And if the curator, Philip Forsline,
is right, this new germ plasm will alter the course of apple
history.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery in the last decade of the apple's wild ancestors
is big news in the apple world. Problematic as these apples might
be on the palate, to breeders they represent unprecedented
opportunity. Roger Way, Cornell University's legendary apple
breeder (the father of the Empire and the Jonagold, among many
others), said that he expects the genes of these oddballs to yield
new cultivars that will be ``more disease and insect resistant,
more winter hardy, and higher in eating quality'' than the apples
of today. Breeders are particularly hopeful that in M. sieversii
they've found the genes that will help apples better withstand
their numerous afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with an apple tree in his yard knows how pathetic these
trees can be. By September, my own unsprayed apples are grossly
deformed by cankers, rusts, pimples, scales, harelips and the exit
wounds of coddling moths. No other crop requires quite as much
pesticide as commercial apples, which receive upwards of a dozen
chemical showers a season. Asked how it is that apples seem so
poorly adapted to life outdoors, Forsline said that it hasn't
always been the case, that a century of growing vast orchards
populated by a small handful of varieties has rendered the apple
less fit than it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial apples represent only a fraction of the Malus gene
pool,'' he said, ``and it's been shrinking. A century ago there
were several thousand different varieties of apples being grown;
now, most of the apples we grow have the same five or six parents:
Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Jonathan, McIntosh and Cox's
Orange Pippin.''
</P>
<P>
   That genetic uniformity makes the apple a sitting duck for its
enemies. In the wild, a plant and its pests are continuously
co-evolving, in a dance of resistance and conquest that can have no
ultimate victor. But co-evolution freezes in an orchard of grafted
trees, since they are genetically identical. The problem is that
the apples no longer get to have sex, which is nature's way of
testing out fresh genetic combinations. The viruses, bacteria and
fungi keep at it, however, continuing to evolve until they've
overcome whatever resistance the apples may have once possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, total victory is in the pest's sight, unless people
come to the tree's rescue with the heavy hand of modern chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution is for us to help the apple evolve
artificially,'' Forsline explained, by bringing in fresh genes
through breeding. Which is precisely why it is so important to
preserve as wide a range of apple genes as possible. Since it takes
decades to develop a new apple variety, it will be some time before
we know for sure whether the Kazakh trees hold the key to a better
apple. Already, though, plant pathologists at Cornell have
determined that some of the wild trees are resistant to fire
blight. The challenge now is to breed that trait into an edible
apple.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of biodiversity,'' Forsline said, as we walked
down rows of antique trees, tasting apples as we talked. Every time
an old apple variety drops out of cultivation, or a wild apple
forest succumbs to development (as is happening today in
Kazakhstan), a set of genes vanishes from the earth. There would be
no Fuji today if apple fanciers hadn't preserved the Ralls Janet,
an antique apple (grown by Thomas Jefferson) that happens to
contain a gene for late blooming that Japanese breeders were
looking for. (Fuji's other parent is the Red Delicious.)
</P>
<P>
   We're accustomed to thinking of biodiversity in connection with
wild species, but the biodiversity of the crop species on which we
depend is no less important. The greatest biodiversity of any crop
is apt to be found in the place where it first evolved, where
nature first experimented with what an apple, or potato or peach,
could be.
</P>
<P>
   The recent discovery of the apple's ``center of diversity,'' as
botanists call such a place, was actually a rediscovery: in 1929,
Nikolai I. Vavilov, the great Russian botanist, had identified the
wild apple's Eden in the forests near what was then Alma-Ata (now
known as Almaty), in Kazakhstan. ``All around the city one could
see a vast expanse of wild apples covering the foothills,'' he
wrote. ``One could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site
was the origin of the cultivated apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Vavilov fell victim to Stalinism's wholesale repudiation of
genetics (he died in prison in 1943), and his discovery was lost to
science until the fall of Communism. In 1989, one of Vavilov's last
surviving students, Aimak Djangaliev, invited American plant
scientists to Kazakhstan to see the wild apples that Djangaliev had
been studying during the years of Soviet rule. Djangaliev was 80 at
the time, and wanted their help saving the great stands of M.
sieversii.
</P>
<P>
   The American scientists were astonished to find 300-year-old
trees 50 feet tall with the girth of oaks, some of them bearing
apples as big and red as modern cultivars. ``In the towns, apple
trees were coming up in the cracks of the sidewalks,'' Forsline
said. ``You see some of these apples and feel sure that you're
looking at the ancestor of the Golden Delicious, or the McIntosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsline and his colleagues made several trips to the area, each
time returning with cuttings and seeds. The silk route passed
through Kazakhstan, and botanists now speculate that centuries ago
nomads and traders took wild apples with them on their journeys
west. Along the way, M. sieversii probably hybridized with at least
two species of tiny, green sour apples, M. orientalis and M.
sylvestris; the result is the apple domesticated by the Romans and
eventually carried to America.
</P>
<P>
   American settlers played a crucial part in the apple's progress.
Since their chief interest was hard cider, they didn't bother with
grafts, planting apples instead from seed. Because of the vagaries
of apple genetics, most seedling trees produce inedible fruit, good
for little but cider. Yet if you plant enough of them, as Johnny
Appleseed set about doing, you're bound to get a few exceptional
ones. And that Americans did.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the great American varieties _ the Newtown Pippin, Rhode
Island Greening, Jonathan, Baldwin and Red Delicious _ were chance
seedlings found in cider orchards in the 18th and 19th centuries.
The Geneva orchard is, among other things, a museum of the apple's
golden age in America; to wander along its leafy corridors of trees
is to set off on a multisensory voyage of the historical
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the better part of a recent morning browsing the rows of
trees, tasting all the famous old apples I'd read about, fruits
that, you quickly appreciate, are as much cultural as natural
artifacts. One bite of an Esopus Spitzenberg disclosed Thomas
Jefferson's idea of the perfect apple: spicy and hard.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered that the original Delicious, called the Hawkeye by
its discoverer, was crisper, paler and not nearly so saccharine as
its flashier offspring. The aromatic Golden Russet, considered one
of the great cider apples of all time, has the coarse flesh of a
pear, running with juice as rich (and sticky) as honey. Much was
lost when civilization decided that russeting _ matte brownish
mottling like that of a potato _ was a fatal flaw in an apple.
</P>
<P>
   So, were the old apples better? It's not quite that simple. Many
of the ones I tasted were unqualified spitters, and only a few of
the oldies could hold a candle to, say, the Macoun or the Jonagold.
Yet the old apples offer a striking catalog of flavors (apples
tinged with nutmeg and reisling, mango and nuts) and colors,
intriguing qualities that have been trampled in the rush to breed
apples brimming with sugar and red pigment.
</P>
<P>
   Tasting these relics, you realize just how much else an apple
can do besides being sweet and red. You also realize what a high
cultural achievement it is to transform a tart potato into a
delight of the human eye and tongue. The Geneva orchard is a
testament to domestication, our knack for marrying the fruits of
nature to the desires of culture. Yet the story of the modern
apple, which has become utterly dependent on us to keep its natural
enemies at bay, suggests that domestication can be overdone.
</P>
<P>
   When we rely on too few genes for too long, a plant loses some
of its aptitude for getting along on its own. As Way, the Cornell
apple breeder, put it, the modern apple's ``vulnerability to a
surprise attack is tremendous.'' A surprise attack is precisely
what got the potato in Ireland in the 1840s; what saved it from
that particular blight were genes for resistance found in wild
Peruvian potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when all the wild potatoes and wild apples are
gone? All the biotechnology in the world can't create a new gene.
Which is why Forsline is bent on saving all manner of apples, good,
bad, indifferent and, above all, wild.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of all possible worlds, we'd be preserving the wild
apples' habitat in the Kazakh wilderness. In the next best world,
though, we'd preserve the quality of wildness itself, something on
which it turns out even domestication depends.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for us, wildness can be cultivated, can thrive even in
the straight lines and right angles of an apple orchard. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The Center for Science in the Public Interest,
which warned Oct. 21 against the increase in soft-drink consumption
among young people, issued a correction in its data Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization said it had erroneously reported that the
average 13- to 18 year-old male who drinks soda consumes more than
three 12-ounce cans of it a day. The correct figure is half that
amount, or about one and two-thirds 12-ounce cans.
</P>
<P>
   It also erroneously reported that the average 13- to 18-year-old
female soda-drinker consumes more than two cans a day. The correct
figure is one can a day.
</P>
<P>
   The group, a food research organization, maintained Wednesday
that even with the corrected figures, overall soft drink
consumption among teenagers is alarmingly high. Teenagers drink
more soda pop than milk and twice as many soft drinks as they did
25 years ago, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization said it stands by its original report warning
that excessive soda consumption can lead to obesity, tooth decay
and bone-density loss in teens and kidney stones and heart disease
in adults.

`BELLY' STYLISH BUT MUDDLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past few years, ``Belly'' director Hype Williams has been
a more ubiquitous MTV presence than Madonna. Williams has been
behind the camera for some stylish hip-hop and R&AMP;B videos; his
clips for the Notorious B.I.G.'s ``Hypnotize'' and Mariah Carey's
``Honey'' especially have a cinematic look.
</P>
<P>
   Williams would seem to be a natural to graduate to feature-film
work, and ``Belly'' is an urban drama that has style to burn. What
it doesn't have is coherence. As a filmmaker, Williams appears to
have visited some sort of cinematic Tower of Babel _ he speaks the
language, sometimes eloquently, but he doesn't know how to put it
together so that it makes any sense.
</P>
<P>
   At ``Belly's'' center are Sincere and Tommy (rappers Nasir
``Nas'' Jones and Earl ``DMX'' Simmons), friends since childhood
who have grown up to live the gangsta life in 1999 New York.
Sincere, who's a new father, is starting to think about getting out
of his life of crime, but his loyalty to his friend Tommy keeps
dragging him back in.
</P>
<P>
   From there, things get a little confusing. No, that's being
nice. They get flat-out muddled. Williams, who also wrote the
screenplay, appears to be going for a hip-hop ``Mean Streets'' with
millennial overtones, as Sincere, Tommy and their posse get
involved with, among other things, some particularly lethal heroin,
a turf war in Omaha, a Jamaican drug lord (with a patois so thick,
he should be subtitled), vengeful ex-friends and an assassination
attempt on a benevolent religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure out just what links these things; it's
certainly not Williams' directorial style. He has a lot of tricks,
and he pulls them out regardless of whether they serve the story or
not. The early scenes have an eerie, one-toned lighting design
(when they HAVE lighting; the movie is so dark at times, it's as if
somebody forgot to plug something in). The later scenes are a
dazzling-but-pointless collection of long shots, shadows and
showoff edits. They're cool to watch, but they don't work in
context. In fact, they don't have any context, period.
</P>
<P>
   Nas and DMX bring a grittily believable street persona to their
roles, and a cast of familiar hip-hop faces such as TLC's Tionne
``T-Boz'' Watkins and the Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man is appealing.
Nobody gives a bad performance, but virtually everyone becomes lost
in Williams' flamboyance.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the movie, one of the characters gives an
inspiring stop-the-violence, increase-the-peace and
respect-women-and-yourself speech. But it comes after 90 minutes of
black-on-black violence, casual and brutal misogyny, and clouds
upon clouds of chronic smoke. Although it's a little too easily
P.C., the speech is the best thing in the movie _ but if it had
come in the beginning, the whole movie never would have happened.
Maybe it's proof that Williams is still better off working in
five-minute segments.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Cate Blanchett in
``Elizabeth.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's the buzz of Hollywood: suddenly a front-runner for a best
actress Oscar for her stunning portrayal as England's Queen
Elizabeth I. It's a role that every actress in Britain would have
killed for.
 &HT;    But Australia's rising star Cate Blanchett has only one thing on
her mind: Getting home to Sydney with her husband of just over a
year Andrew Upton so they can spend Christmas with their families.
 &HT;    ``I have a very small family but Andrew's is enormous,'' she
said, ``so I'm hoping for a chaotic, loud, happy family
Christmas.''
 &HT;    The 28-year-old actress has already earned rave reviews for
portraying the troubled and naive English monarch in the film which
costars fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, John
Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes (brother of English actor Ralph Fiennes)
and Christopher Eccleston.
 &HT;    Since finishing Elizabeth she has worked nonstop. She is just
finishing up ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' opposite Matt Damon and
Gwyneth Paltrow in Italy for ``English Patient'' director Anthony
Minghella, as well as ``Pushing Tin,'' a black comedy about air
traffic controllers with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. Both
films are due out in l999.
 &HT;    There follows a movie version of Oscar Wilde's play ``An Ideal
Husband'' and next March (Oscar time in Hollywood) she's returning
to Britain to appear on the London stage in David Hare's ``Plenty''
_ which was made into a movie in l985 with Meryl Streep and Sam
Neill, with direction by Australian Fred Schepisi.
 &HT;    Looking pale but beautiful after such a hectic work schedule and
sipping iced water in a Los Angeles hotel suite, Blanchett is
buoyed by all the talk of Oscar nominations. However she admits
that getting the role of Elizabeth was something of a coup.
 &HT;    Word was that she was going to be passed over because she was
not well known internationally, despite great reviews for l997's
``Oscar and Lucinda'' opposite Ralph Fiennes. Producers were
looking for someone more famous in Britain to star in a role about
a British monarch and so she had to do a screen test for Indian
director Shekhar Kapur.
 &HT;    The movie is a spectacular costume drama set in London in the
middle of the 16th century. Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII
and Anne Boleyn, is imprisoned at 16 by her half-sister Mary, but
swept onto the throne and crowned Queen of England at 23. To
survive she must sort out the machiavellian agendas on the
battlefield, in the church and in her court. Her enemies, most of
them powerful men, would appear to have the advantage, but
Elizabeth deploys whatever means necessary to keep her crown.
 &HT;    ``The main thing about getting the part was that the director
had confidence in me,'' she recalls. ``He had seen me in a trailer
of 'Oscar and Lucinda' and thought I was right for the part.
 &HT;    ``I must admit though, I was flabbergasted to get 'Oscar and
Lucinda.' And then 'Elizabeth.' I asked myself how did I find the
courage to do it. But I plunge into something and when it's done
sit back and say, my God.''
 &HT;    Blanchett grew up in Melbourne and says in her early years she
didn't yearn to be an actress. She was just 10 when her Texan
father Bob, a flamboyant advertising man, died suddenly, leaving
her mother June, a teacher, to bring up her and two siblings.
 &HT;    ``I was so fortunate that my mother was remarkable and held
things together for us. She introduced me to acting when I was 12
when she took me to see a production of 'They Shoot Horses Don't
They?' I was smitten by it.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless she started out studying economics and fine arts.
``I failed miserably at the economics and so I became sort of the
black sheep of the family,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    Unlike many Aussie actors, Blanchett didn't get her start on
Aussie soaps but learned her trade at the National Institute of
Dramatic Art in Sydney where she won plaudits on the boards in
``The Tempest,'' ``Hamlet,'' ``The Seagull'' and David Mamet's
``Oleanna.'' Her first film splash was as Susan McCarthy in Bruce
Beresford's ``Paradise Road.''
 &HT;    Just as her international movie career was taking off in June
l997 she married boyfriend Upton in a ceremony in the Blue
Mountains in New South Wales. Their home is in a Sydney beach
suburb, in a non-movie-star house which they've seen very little
of.
 &HT;    ``When I made 'Elizabeth' I saw very little daylight and had
virtually no social life,'' she says. ``I wore elaborate costumes
and very tight corsets. I had my eyebrows bleached, my eyelashes
bleached, my hairline shaved, half my hair dyed white _ so I didn't
get out much looking like that.''
 &HT;    She says her husband understands the demands her career makes on
her _ professionally and personally. ``I am very fortunate to have
a partner who is incredibly supportive of me.''
 &HT;    However she does admit she is a little torn between the demands
of a burgeoning career which could take her to the very top and her
desire to enjoy a normal life with her husband out of the
limelight.
 &HT;    For instance there's the question of a family _ to start one or
not. ``I think children are one of the few miracles left,'' she
says carefully.

LAPTOPS ON THE SHUTTLE: AGE DOES NOT MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ When the company sent them on a
nine-day, round-the-world business trip last week, Col. Curtis
Brown Jr. and his six colleagues took along their laptop computers
and a new color printer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other business travelers, they are using the laptops
to send and receive e-mail, transmit digital pictures back to the
home office, turn strings of drab data into colorful graphs and
perform calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other business travelers, however, Brown and his
co-workers _ the astronauts in weightless orbit aboard the space
shuttle Discovery _ attached their laptops to the ceiling and walls
of their office with Velcro. And they have to take special care not
to kick out the power cords and Ethernet cables while doing
somersaults near the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time a color printer has been sent into space,
and the astronauts wasted no time in putting it to use. On
Halloween, mission control sent them via e-mail a graphics file of
a life-size portrait of Sen. John Glenn, which the crew printed and
fashioned into Halloween masks.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had his own makeshift costume: he used a laptop computer
to gather data from a nest of electrodes fastened to his head, part
of an experiment to analyze sleep patterns. He will also use a
laptop to collect data from a bottle-cap-sized electronic pill he
swallowed, which broadcasts information on his temperature and
other vital signs to a computer peripheral he clips to his belt.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 18 laptop computers are aboard the Discovery spacecraft
now orbiting more than 300 miles above Earth, more computational
firepower than on any earlier space mission. While the five main
avionics computers that control the shuttle's flight are closer to
the technology of the 1960s than to that of the 1990s, the laptops
are similar to those that anyone stuck on terra firma can buy at a
local computer store.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs down, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has shifted to using off-the-shelf products as much
as possible. So NASA bought dozens of IBM Thinkpad computers and
one Epson Stylus Color 800 printer to send into space with the
shuttle fleet and the new international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of the space station will begin next month, and more
than 40 Thinkpads are expected to be aboard when it is completed in
about five years.
</P>
<P>
   Two printers will be aboard the space station. They will come in
handy for homesick astronauts, who will be able to print
photo-quality pictures snapped on Earth with digital cameras to
keep them current on soccer games and family gatherings and in
touch with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, astronauts aboard the Discovery were reported to
be delighted when mission control sent them a picture showing them
their own launching, which took place a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   One laptop on Discovery is equipped with an Intel Proshare video
card that allows the astronauts to hold private video conferences
with their families and their doctors, on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the computers aboard Discovery are older Thinkpad 755Cs
_ not that anyone on this mission thinks that there is anything
wrong with sending older models into space. The 755s are based on
the Intel 486 microprocessor, which Intel replaced with the Pentium
chip several years ago. They use Windows 95 as the operating
software, which Microsoft stopped making this year.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the laptops aboard Discovery are a relatively newer
model, the Thinkpad 760XD, which is making its first trip aboard a
shuttle. The 760XD has a 166-megahertz Pentium microprocessor with
MMX multimedia capabilities. Nothing that would impress a
tech-savvy 6th-grader, but not an embarrassment, either.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to replace all the 755Cs with more 760XDs on future
flights. On the space station, some of the 760XDs will be used not
just to gather data, but also to control important systems. On
those machines, Windows will be replaced with a version of a rival
operating system, Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Some might wonder why NASA flies with older computers when
newer, faster, more powerful, lighter _ and less expensive _
laptops are easily available.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Klausman, an engineer with United Space Alliance, the
main contractor for the shuttle program, said the answer was
simple: They have been thoroughly tested, and they work. To certify
new machines for flight requires months of expensive testing, and
once NASA has put its trust in a given machine, it is loathe to
change it.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for the five main avionics computers,
each about the size of a large suitcase, that control the primary
functions of the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The computers, highly advanced when the shuttle program was
being developed in the late 1970s (the first shuttle flight was in
1981) might at first glance seem to be relics today. Each has a
maximum of 1 megabyte of system memory, compared 36 to 64 megabytes
for each laptop aboard. Hard-disk sizes on the laptops range from
540 megabytes to 3.1 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The avionics computers are basically obsolete by PC
standards,'' said George McMullen, team leader for the data
processing group at Boeing Reusable Space Systems, the division of
the aircraft company that made the shuttle. But, McMullen noted,
the code that runs on the older avionics computers is exquisitely
compact, and the older computers are able to move a tremendous
amount of data in real time, performing 24 different operations at
once.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although they lack the dense circuitry and greater speed of
modern processors, the antiquated chips used on the main ship
computers are hardened to withstand radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newer and faster chips are more susceptible to cosmic ray
events up in space that can lock a computer up,'' said Andris Matt
Karklins, a Boeing engineer. ``We can't afford to have one lock up
when we're flying.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the laptops are delicate. Last year,
when a Russian cargo ship collided with the space station Mir and
punctured a compartment on the craft, several laptops were exposed
to the broiling heat and sub-freezing cold of space for months.
When one of the Thinkpads was finally retrieved and returned to
earth, the only problems were bad batteries and a burned-out
backlight on the computer screen, said Klausman of U.S.A., who has
the machine on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, there have been no computer ``anomalies'' on
the current mission, said Stephen Quenneville, NASA's portable
onboard computer coordinator for this flight. That performance is
remarkable considering the number of computers aboard and the
rigors of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Both the laptop computers and the Epson printer have been
modified only slightly for the peculiar demands of weightlessness.
The power plug on the laptops has been secured with a locking
mechanism to prevent astronauts from inadvertently knocking it out
with their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional magnetic hard disks are augmented with solid
state memory cards for the ascent phase, because the 3G force of
the first three minutes of takeoff _ three times the force of
gravity at sea level _ could harm the delicate mechanics of a
conventional hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit boards inside the laptops are specially coated to
prevent tiny impurities, like flecks of solder, from floating
around and causing short circuits inside the computer or in the
ships other electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the paper handling mechanism of the printer has been
changed to keep paper from floating out of the tray. And because
ink droplets are not absorbed by a sponge in microgravity, the
regular method for cleaning a print head does not work in space.
So, a felt-like material is used instead of a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   The pringer was ``tested it in the `Vomit Comet,' and it did
fine,'' said Jay Shears, director of printer product marketing for
Epson America. He was referring to the notorious airplane NASA uses
to simulate weightlessness for astronauts and, apparently, for
computer equipment as well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier astronauts are impressed with the new technology, but
only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our computers were quite simple compared to what we have
now,'' said Col. L. Gordon Cooper Jr., one of the original Mercury
Seven astronauts, pausing to chat here after watching his old
colleague John Glenn ride into orbit for the second time in 36
years. ``We all use personal computers and laptops today that are
much more sophisticated than what we had in the early days.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was being charitable to the early computers, which could
not always be counted on. On his 34-hour Project Mercury flight in
1963, the onboard computer failed and Cooper scribbled re-entry
calculations with pencil and paper, averting possible disaster just
minutes before his return through the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   On his next flight, the eight-day Gemini 5 mission with Charles
Conrad in 1965, another computer glitch caused their capsule to
splash down more than 100 miles short of their recovery ship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, on the Apollo 11 mission that first took astronauts to
land on the moon, the lunar lander's on-board computer was guiding
the craft into a crater pocked with boulders. The commander, Neal
Armstrong, shut off the computer and flew the lander to a safer
spot in the Sea of Tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, when all else fails, the human on
board turns out to be the link that's the most reliable,'' Cooper
said.

  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.)

<P>
   QUESTION: Here I am at age 28 with a boyfriend who says I
shouldn't get mad at him when he hollers because he grew up in a
family where everybody screamed at each other. He says his family
is more dysfunctional than mine. _ Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Jeez! Dueling dysfunctions? I don't think you want to
go there and I definitely don't. Everybody's family _ and I do mean
everybody's _ is dysfunctional. I'm not sure where this national
obsession with blame began, but it's past time to put the
family-as-doomed-destiny thing to rest. We choose how we behave. If
you're unhappy about your boyfriend's behavior, talk with him about
it. Don't let him duck the issue by invoking the Ghost of Family
Past. The dysfunctional family blues are a variation of ``Woe is
me.'' Let's all repeat together: ``I'm in charge of my own life.
I'm responsible. I can function.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I feel guilty all the time. I don't spend enough time
with my kids. My wife complains that I'm cold and indifferent. My
mother, recently widowed, needs me. I'm in the really competitive
field of sales, so my free time is limited, but I try to get in a
couple of workouts each week because my dad had a bad ticker. I
can't please anyone, and when I find some time for myself, I feel
even worse. What should I do? _ Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: First, take a deep breath here and relax. Guilt is
feeling good about feeling bad, and it's a colossal waste of time.
You've got a lot on your plate. Feeling tired and under the gun all
the time doesn't help anyone. Adding a huge dollop of guilt will
only sap more time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sort through your priorities and get better at scheduling. If
you block out specific time to spend with your kids and schedule
private time for you and your wife to keep the spark alive, your
loved ones won't feel they have to beg for your attention. Make
sure you budget some time for yourself _ even if that means going
grocery shopping after work without the kids.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm afraid to let anyone get close to me because I've
been hurt too often. I know the right person will be patient. But
at 44, I've sure kissed a lot of frogs while looking for that
handsome, understanding prince. I'm really a good person. Why am I
still alone? _ Fort Pierce, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Everyone over 16 feels at some point that someone's
done 'em wrong and they're probably right. But this is the time to
take some emotional risks, not wallow in self-pity. I'm not
suggesting you march down to the harbor and pick up the first
sailor you meet. I am suggesting that it's time to get out of your
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Try the ``life is a daring risk or it's nothing at all''
blueprint for a month or two. Come out of your shell a bit. This
may mean taking tango lessons or flirting at the bus stop or
knocking that chip off your shoulder. You're making all those
inattentive men the bad guys. If you're a bristly ball of anger,
everyone will stay away.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for a
year, and I want to get married. I work for him because he's trying
to get his business off the ground. We're living in his house,
which I'm helping to fix up. I love him, but I'm upset because but
every time I bring up the ``m'' word, he changes the subject. _
Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You write ``welcome'' on your forehead and then you're
surprised when he steps on your face. Your boyfriend isn't
exploiting you. YOU are exploiting you.
</P>
<P>
   If you want your boyfriend to marry you, set a deadline and tell
him about it. If he refuses, move out and get on with your life. No
tears or cajolery. And don't even think about ``accidentally''
getting pregnant. If he wants to spend the rest of his life with
you, give him the opportunity to sort it out. If not, volunteer
with Habitat for Humanity to fix up someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My parents divorced 16 years ago when I was 3. I
always thought Dad abandoned us. I've recently gotten in touch with
him and he says Mom and her parents said they'd sic the law on him
if he didn't clear out. I don't know who's telling the truth and
who's lying. _ Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: A long time ago somebody said there are three sides to
every story: my side, your side and the truth. I think this person
was overly optimistic. Most of us can figure out several
``sensible'' versions to support our perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to worry if one of your folks is lying. They
could both be telling the truth -- THEIR version of the truth. If
you look for your own version and leave them to do the same, you
can save a whole lot of wear and tear on your head, heart and
internal organs.

VINES TO FILL THE INDOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY LESLIE LAND    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Are there any vines that will grow indoors? I would love to
grow some in pots in my living room, which has plenty of windows
and a southern exposure. Are there any that would flourish, or even
just live, in such an environment?
</P>
<P>
   A. Philodendron, possibly the world's most common houseplant, is
a vine, but perhaps you were hoping for something more unusual.
What about a passionflower? There are several species from which to
choose. Many will flower in the winter, and almost all are
guaranteed to please, since this is a plant that is almost as
beautiful out of flower as it is when blooming.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves are usually three-lobed and deeply cut, though those in
the species vitifolia are nearly as broad as grape leaves. The
flowers have a flat ring of petals with crowns of filaments in the
center and are usually purple, violet, lavender or one of those
three plus white.
</P>
<P>
   Vitifolia, however, has red flowers, as does the
knock-your-socks-off coccinea, which is further distinguished by
black filaments.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Incense, caerulea, and St. Rule, also offer
strong fragrances. Several even produce passion fruit, though I
wouldn't expect big crops from anything in the living room. In
short, it is hard to go wrong as long as you remember, when reading
catalogs, that ``everblooming'' means ``blooms in all seasons,''
not ``blooms all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Passion vines, as they are often called, do best indoors where
they get lots of light and temperatures that stay from 70 to 80
degrees, though they will tolerate cool nights if they have to.
Most are fairly well-behaved, but a robust specimen with sufficient
root room and ample fertilizer may act like a sort of indoor kudzu,
crawling around the window frames, infiltrating drapery rods, light
fixtures and anything else it can get its tendrils into or around.
If you want to move yours outdoors in the summer, be sure to train
it onto a free-standing frame of some sort.

   HASBROUCK HEIGHTS, N.J. _ John Beirne looks a bit like a
missionary in his plantation whites, sipping a cola as he strolls
through his tropical garden. But the nearest island is Manhattan,
10 miles away. With evangelical zeal, Beirne is bent on convincing
the uninitiated that equatorial plants are the perfect autumnal
alternative to mounds of mums and heads of flowering kale. He's got
a point. Other gardens have closed for the season; his glows like a
supernova until November's killing frost.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Beirne, 26, is a psychiatric case manager for Newbridge
Services in Pompton Plains, N.J. But every free moment, he indulges
his passion for audacious tropical plants. Around an unassuming
brick house, in tidy beds and burgeoning pots, red-green cannas
soar 10 feet to the sky; chartreuse sweet potato vines stretch to
the sidewalk; and coleus is growing in so many colors and shapes,
it might wake a dead Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, you would have been hard-pressed to find plants
like cannas north of a gas station in Georgia. Then a handful of
gardeners began putting indoor plants in outside gardens, including
tropical and subtropical shrubs and bulbs. They wanted to test the
plants' tolerance, as well as extend the growing season. They also
wanted to create something new, perhaps even shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Beirne has never been skittish about unrestrained color. In
1994, his biology class at Manhattan College in the Bronx took a
trip to St. John in the Virgin Islands to study marine life. But
for Beirne the terrestrials proved too distracting. ``The lushness,
the colors,'' Beirne said, reeling at the recollection. ``There was
a brilliance I'd never witnessed before. Things I used to see
struggling in the corner of the living room were 100 feet tall and
covered with bloom. I saw ficus trees with trunks as big as cars,
and people planted bougainvillea the way my neighbors plop down
azaleas.''
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Beirne also discovered a less exotic spot. He
went for a walk in Fieldston, the neighborhood next to the college,
and saw a sign for Wave Hill, the public garden. There he saw
plants he had known only from books, tropicals from remote
mountainous slopes, all growing happily outside.
</P>
<P>
   When he was offered a job at the garden as a summer helper, he
couldn't believe his luck. ``I was actually going to work around
the plants I fell in love with,'' he said. ``And if they could grow
there, they could grow in my garden!''
</P>
<P>
   Beirne has been gardening since he was four years old. In grade
school, he forced winter branches to bloom for show-and-tell. ``I
would get my parents to take me to nurseries for fun,'' he said.
When a classmate brought a Kelly Nurseries catalog to school, young
Beirne saw a chance to order a plant by mail. ``There was a
beautiful picture of a tree wisteria, and I saved up from my paper
route to buy it. You can imagine how I felt when I opened the
package and found a little stick,'' he said, sighing. ``But I
planted it, and it grew 30 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, herbaceous tropical plants burst out of beds around the
house in Hasbrouck Heights. Red-leafed castor bean plants,
originally from North Africa, grow against the garage, and by the
end of the season tower five feet above its roof. Containers line
up against the back wall to catch the oblique afternoon rays of the
autumn sun.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking are Hibiscus acetosella Red Shield, whose
pointy, maroon leaves are like those of a Japanese maple, and the
climbing Mandevilla Alice du Pont, whose pink trumpet flowers are
slow to bloom, but by fall are so profuse that you can't even see
their leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The most unexpected planting, however, is in front of the house.
``I call this the Psychedelic '70s Island,'' Beirne said. An
acid-green sweet potato vine (Ipomea batatas Margarita) threads up
into the bed's focal point, the towering Canna Grande from Central
America. Canna Pretoria, its green leaves striped with
creamy-yellow, grows there, too, as does Canna Phaison, from South
Africa, with striped leaves and a bonus of luminescent
papaya-orange flowers. Beirne also planted tubers of giant
Southeast Asian elephant ears (Colocasia esculenta), Imperial black
taro (C. illustris) and pink caladium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They remind me of watermelon slices,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Summering house plants also share the small space, including
seven varieties of ficus.
</P>
<P>
   Beirne is always looking for indoor plants that he can turn into
showy outdoor annuals. This year he experimented with Persian
shield (Strobilanthes dyerianus), with lance-shaped leaves of
metallic violet and silver. And throughout the yard are the coleus
that are making a dramatic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Grandmother's coleus. Instead of that familiar
mottled red leaf, the new generation includes varieties with leaves
of striking shapes and intricate patterns as well as vivid solid
colors. The plants are selected from experimental sowings, then
reproduced from cuttings. Every color but blue is represented, with
evocative monikers like Inky Fingers, India Frills, Purple
Duckfoot, Ella Cinders and Evil _ Beirne's grows them all.
</P>
<P>
   Beirne takes cuttings of his favorites to carry through the
winter. That's especially important for the coleus selection he
plucked from a wholesale nursery's batch of mixed seedlings. A
fellow gardener at Wave Hill named the coppery-pumpkin coleus
Beirned Orange.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the next hot plant? Beirne is placing bets on the
dahlia. Not the dinner-plate behemoths from the 1950s, but quirky
new ones or rediscovered antiques, like Bishop of Llandaff, a 1927
introduction with three-inch-wide scarlet-orange flowers, which
have already been resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   After years of encouragement from friends and the staff of Wave
Hill, Beirne has applied to schools to study horticulture. So the
end of this season may herald a new beginning for the young
gardener. But John Beirne knows one thing for sure: in the waning
days of autumn, nothing succeeds like excess.

THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ENTERS THE SILICON AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By MARGALIT FOX    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filed carefully away in the offices of the Oxford English
Dictionary are millions of handwritten index cards, many dating
back to James Murray, the master lexicographer who presided over
the dictionary's first edition at the turn of the century. For
decades these cards, which document the appearance in English
literature of words from abacination to zumbador, were the raw
material from which the dictionary was made.
</P>
<P>
   The cards, 6 million or 7 million at last count, are still used
in the continuing work of revising and updating the dictionary. But
they now compete for office space with a dozen Sun Microsystems
servers, 80 Sun workstations and a battery of PCs running Windows
NT. The dictionary's lexicographers, in turn, are assisted by a
team of systems engineers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the OED, the esteemed lexicon that
conjures up images of paper, ink and a heady dust, has gradually
entered the silicon age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still straddling the electronic world and the paper
world,'' said Royalynn O'Connor, the online product director for
Oxford University Press, which publishes the OED.
</P>
<P>
   But before the entire OED can be put online, it must overcome a
host of technical challenges, some common to all electronic
dictionaries, others resulting from the singular and unwieldy
nature of the OED itself.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the dictionary's editors and technicians must take a
20-volume, 22,000-page reference work containing some
three-quarters of a million entries and turn it into an electronic
database that can be searched rapidly by machine and be read
comfortably within the confines of a 15-inch computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary's staff is currently field-testing a prototype of
its online edition with invited groups of scholars, researchers and
librarians around the United States. In January, Ms. O'Connor said,
an outside contractor will be hired, after bids are submitted, to
create the online edition and its search engine according to
Oxford's minutely detailed specifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most publishers let their vendors design,'' said Ms. O'Connor,
whose office is in New York. ``We're designing it first because
it's so critical and so complex.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of online publication grew out of a major revision to
the dictionary that has been under way since the early 1990s. The
OED's first edition, shepherded by James Murray, was published in
10 volumes between 1884 and 1928. In the years that followed,
various supplements were issued. In 1989, Oxford published the
second edition, which comprised the first edition, the supplements
and about 5,000 new words, in 20 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, besides adding contemporary words (Ruthian, hyperlink),
editors are revising the entire content of Murray's dictionary for
the first time, updating Edwardian-era definitions, adding new
bibliographic citations and correcting etymologies, based on
advances in linguistic research. Work on the revised edition, which
is expected to run to at least 30 volumes, is scheduled to last
until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to go online was twofold, Ms. O'Connor said. ``One
is, we are making discoveries about the English language that it
would be very unfair to ask people to wait until 2010 to read.''
</P>
<P>
   The other motivation was economic. Throughout its history, the
dictionary has never been profitable; the current revision alone is
budgeted at $55 million. ``There's some sense of, `Can we get a
return before 2010?''' Ms. O'Connor said. ``We have to pay the
lexicographers.''
</P>
<P>
   The online edition, which is scheduled to be available to the
public by the end of 1999, will be accessible for a fee through the
OED's home page. It will consist at first of the dictionary's
second edition, plus some revised entries and new words. As the
revisions to the dictionary progress, new entries will be added
quarterly, complementing but not replacing the earlier ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things we get loud and clear from our
market research,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ``Say a new entry comes up
for `restaurant.' People still want to see what the old entry
was.''
</P>
<P>
   For every electronic dictionary, there are two paramount
considerations: It should be easy to search and easy to read. Open
the OED to any page. Each entry contains certain standard elements:
the word itself, its variant spellings and etymology and _ the
dictionary's defining characteristic _ citations of the word as it
has been used in English literature through the centuries. It must
be possible to search for each of these elements independently in
the online OED. Someone researching words with Basque in their
pedigree, for example, should be able to summon up online a list
that includes anchovy, jingo and jai alai.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the OED has actually existed in electronic form
since the late 1980s, when it was put into Oxford's computers, a
task that took 120 typists a year and a half. (The profusion of
special characters in the dictionary made it impossible to scan
using optical-character recognition.) The text was then tagged
using SGML, a markup language designed to encode and organize large
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutions, including academic libraries and the
Bloomberg News Service, purchased copies of the SGML text on
magnetic tape, added their own search engines and offered the
result to users as a computerized OED. ``In the past few years,
universities have been in essence publishing the OED online,'' Ms.
O'Connor said. ``The problem with it is the cross-references don't
work. There isn't the kind of consistency Oxford University Press
would want.''
</P>
<P>
   To make their dictionary fully searchable, the OED's editors
must standardize a tangle of inconsistencies left over from
Murray's day. Suppose you want to search for words quoted from
``Treasure Island.'' The dictionary currently renders the book's
title as Treasure Island, Treasure Isl., Treasure Is., Treas. Isl.
and Treasure I. Until those entries are standardized, a search
engine cannot easily retrieve them all together.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fairly large process of normalizing this
bibliographical data,'' said John Simpson, chief editor of the OED,
in a telephone interview from Oxford, England. ``In the old days,
it didn't really matter if you gave a different short title for a
text in Volume 1 as you gave in Volume 2 because the reader knew
what it meant. But now there's a requirement that people can search
for what they want and get the appropriate matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is representing the welter of special
characters that appear in the dictionary text. There are more than
600 in all, including letters of the Greek alphabet, diacritical
marks, mathematical symbols and the signs of the zodiac. (The
CD-ROM came with special fonts that the user had to install,
something the OED editors want to avoid for the Internet edition.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these characters have to be legible and printable,
they must be searchable as well. ``Making sure you have a display
that is configured so that it can be handled by that many computers
operated by that many people in a consistent way is a huge task,''
said Kara Noble, director of electronic product development for
Merriam-Webster, whose Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition, is
published on the Web (www.m-w.com/dictionary.htm). ``It's easy for
a schwa to look correct on my computer here in the office and
totally different on your computer where you're sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   On the printed page, an OED entry is a crowded affair. But what
readers can tolerate in a book will not always work on a computer
monitor. As a result, the overall design of the OED's screen
display is crucial. ``It's important that on first glance it has to
look elegant, which isn't necessarily that first thing you think
about with a dictionary,'' Simpson said. ``The OED has a reputation
for being elegant. It mustn't put the reader off by having so much
information compacted together that it's difficult to read.''
</P>
<P>
   To unclutter the screen and reduce the need for scrolling,
Oxford is experimenting with allowing features to be switched on
and off within each entry. In an early version of the prototype,
for example, small buttons labeled S and D represent a word's
spelling and derivation, respectively. Call up the entry for the
word merchant and click on the S, and up comes a list of variant
spellings recorded over the centuries, including marchaund,
marchande, mayrchand, maircheant, mairchantt and marchawn. The list
can be hidden with another click. Clicking on D reveals the word's
derivation, or etymology.
</P>
<P>
   To streamline the display even more, the OED is shunning the
electronic bells and whistles common to many Internet sites, like
video streaming, audio clips and even illustrations. ``There won't
be a multimedia aspect to this,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ``Because the
entries are so complex, we're really aiming for something very
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   As the specifications for the online edition are being
finalized, the huge task of revising the century-old printed
dictionary continues. As in Murray's time, the OED maintains a
stable of outside ``readers'' in England and the United States who
scour libraries _ and these days, literature databases as well _
for bibliographic citations. In many cases, their labor has
uncovered far earlier citations for words than were previously
known. (Simpson was delighted to report that ``market-basket,''
first cited in 1807 in the OED's second edition, has been antedated
to 1585.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, the readers send in their findings by modem, using what
Simpson calls ``the electronic equivalent of index cards'' _
specially prepared database shells installed on their laptop
computers. As in the past, lay people are also encouraged to
contribute. And while some of these lay lexicographers still send
in quotations the old-fashioned way, using pen and paper or even
mailing in pasted-up pages torn from books (not recommended), many
more, Ms. O'Connor said, now transmit their findings via e-mail or
the guest book section of the OED Web site. The site maintains a
list of words for which editors need additional citations (glatt
kosher before 1973, grandkid before 1948).
</P>
<P>
   There is still no decision on how much it will cost to use the
OED online and what kind of access first-time browsers will get,
Ms. O'Connor said. ``Is it free one weekend?'' she wondered aloud.
``Is it free on Sunday? Can you use it for two weeks? Can you look
up 30 words? We have to decide, and that's one of the fun things
about the Web _ you can do all of those things. It's a fun way to
give away information without giving away the whole store.''
</P>
<P>
   As the OED lumbers genteelly into the new millennium, it is
heartening to note that however vital its computers have become,
they can never fully replace the work of its pencil-wielding,
flesh-and-blood staff. ``An awful lot of it will remain having to
be done by the individual editors,'' Simpson said. ``The actual
defining, for example. You can't ask a computer to define for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the OED's file cards, too, seem assured of a place in the
21st-century life of the dictionary. ``It's actually quite
efficient to use the index cards,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he riffled through a small batch on his desk
containing words beginning with the letter M. ``You can put them
into little piles,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to denigrate
them.''

EXOTICS THAT NEED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with GARDEN-COLUMN) 
(js) 
 By KEN DRUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been written, some of it by this writer, warning about
the invasive tendencies of hardy exotic plants. But tender exotic
plants will die in the cold unless stored or propagated from
cuttings, so they do not pose a threat to native populations.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem daunting to dig up plants and take cuttings to carry
them through the winter. But years ago, gardeners routinely dug
canna rhizomes and caladium and dahlia tubers for storage. (Of
course, they also had root cellars to put them in.) Yet now that
people are lusting after tender plants, it's becoming just another
part of gardening, and well worth the effort. The roots and tubers
are easy to deal with, but the coleus must have cuttings taken
before frost blackens all the garden foliage.
</P>
<P>
   John Beirne digs up cannas and dahlias after the killing frost _
sometimes as late as Thanksgiving. He shakes most of the soil from
their swollen underground stems and cuts the foliage and stems back
to four-inch stumps. Then he places varieties in individual labeled
plastic bags with plenty of dry leaves and stores them in an area
of the cellar that's cold but doesn't freeze _ 50 degrees is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   For the coleus, however, Beirne in October puts a few stem
cuttings _ three or four nodes long _ in water or moist perlite.
When they're rooted, he plants them in a peat moss-based potting
soil in plastic pots, two-and-a-half inches square. The plants go
to a cool, bright window, and the soil is allowed to dry almost
completely between waterings. The low temperature and minimal
moisture keep the plants somewhat dormant. Otherwise, they'd push
fleshy new growth that couldn't be supported outside of a
greenhouse. He spritzes the plants with water every other day. The
mist raises the humidity only slightly, but it discourages some
insects and dislodges others before they can get a foothold. And
Beirne admits, modestly, that he has shared a shower with a ficus
or two.

 &HT;    How the Red Cross keeps standing
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Based on the International Red Cross, which was founded in
1864 as a volunteer humanitarian effort to care for sick and
wounded during war. Over the years, it expanded to disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ In America, founded in 1881 by Clara Barton, a Massachusetts
schoolteacher who helped wounded soldiers during the Civil War. She
became known as the ``angel of the battlefield'' and led the charge
to start the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Cross emblem: Sometimes called the Geneva cross, in
recognition of the Geneva Convention, the 1864 international treaty
that established the organization. The red cross on a white
background is the inverse of the Swiss flag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual budget: $1.9 billion, raised through individual
donations, United Way campaign, and funding from corporations and
foundations. On occasion, it's reimbursed for services. Also
collects revenue from patented research innovations, contracts and
investments. About 92 cents of every dollar donated goes directly
to Red Cross services that help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staff: More than 1.3 million volunteers and 29,850 paid staff
nationwide. Policy is set by an all-volunteer board of governors,
which oversees the 1,300 local chapters. Elizabeth Dole has been
its president since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   _ Research: Begun in 1961. Contributed to ensuring the safety of
the nation's blood supply, developing screening tests for HIV,
hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Also developed transfusion
and other blood-related technology. Budget: $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blood services: Started in 1948 for civilians after first
being directed to World War II soldiers. Yearly collects about 6
million units of blood from 4.5 million donors, approximately half
of the amount of blood donated annually in the United States. The
blood is separated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets, used
for trauma victims, cancer patients and surgeries in 3,000
hospitals. Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible to
give blood actually do so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every year, 4 million patients receive transfused blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every day, 40,000 units of blood are needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every second, someone needs blood.

 &HT;    Red Cross scientists close in on faster ways to stop the
bleeding that can kill trauma victims
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILE, Md. _ Help! The pot roast is bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gunshot, Dawson Beall deftly deduces. He picks up a
silver canister, shoots white powder into the wound, then adds a
squirt of water. In seconds, the roast erupts with white foam, like
a second-grader's volcano science project.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding stops.
</P>
<P>
   Another pot roast is saved.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the laboratories of the American Red Cross, where
tomorrow's lifesaving techniques are perfected today on pigs, pot
roasts and other props.
</P>
<P>
   Inventions and innovations to help trauma victims are just some
of the ongoing research projects under way at the Jerome H. Holland
Laboratory for the Biomedical Sciences. The unpretentious two-floor
building is full of the usual quirky clutter that comes when white
lab coats rule: shrines to white mice and rats, quotes from
Sherlock Holmes, happy and sad-faced posters of T cells.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the world's most recognizable symbol for
help-is-on-the-way takes on a different meaning, more along the
lines of
help-is-on-the-way-as-soon-as-it-undergoes-the-rigors-of-science _
from chalkboard theory to clinical trials to Food and Drug
Administration approval, a process that can take a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, developing screening tests to ensure the
safety of the nation's blood supply has filled the research plate
at the Red Cross labs. But in the next century, its scientists may
well be known for such discoveries as making therapeutic proteins
for hemophilic patients with the milk of genetically altered
(transgenic) pigs, and pinpointing the gene that triggers blood
flow to cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, an invention called fibrin sealant is
being tested. On a bandage, it acts as an instant clot on wounds as
soon as it becomes wet with blood. In its foam form, it reacts on
penetrating injuries, such as gunshots and knife stabs, by
expanding like shaving cream, then sealing off blood vessels. Every
year, nearly 50,000 people die of excessive bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This here is a slightly injured pot roast standing in for
wounded muscle tissue of a person,'' said Beall, one of 230 Red
Cross researchers at the lab. ``We care more about pot roasts here
than most of the world put together, I bet.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $6 million grant from the Army, Beall and colleague
Martin MacPhee have perfected the recipe of fibrinogen and
thrombin, two clotting proteins of the blood that form the scab on
skin. The proteins are found in a person's plasma _ one of blood's
three main components, along with red blood cells and platelets.
</P>
<P>
   Since half of all battlefield fatalities are from soldiers
bleeding to death, the military has long dreamed of a portable and
fast-acting way to patch massive wounds temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept for a fibrin sealant goes back to World War II,''
said MacPhee. ``The thinking was to purify the two proteins out and
form a blood clot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first liquid concoctions were cumbersome, so they
weren't good for medic and ambulance rescues, said MacPhee. These
liquid ``glues,'' however, are useful in surgery and are used
widely in Europe. One of them, called BioGlue, is made by the
Kennesaw firm of CryoLife Inc. and is undergoing clinical approval
for use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Red Cross holds the intellectual rights to further
develop the fibrin sealant idea into a foam, spray and external and
internal bandages, no other company can develop or manufacture
them. But finding a way to replicate the remarkable natural
clotting reaction of blood was not easy, because when the two
proteins of fibrinogen and thrombin touch, they instantly start
forming a scab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to figure out how to put the two proteins on a
bandage so they didn't react until they were needed,'' MacPhee
said, holding up a fibrin sealant bandage that looks like a
standard piece of gauze except for the sticky backing. ``The idea
was to be able to apply direct pressure with this bandage and let
the fibrin form on the wound and then form a clot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the invention is still pending a patent review, MacPhee
cannot disclose exactly how the fibrin sealant bandage is made.
</P>
<P>
   All he'll say is that it's a freeze-dried substance and it
works. Really, really well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the sealant bandage capable of controlling external
life-threatening injuries, it creates a clot 10 times stronger than
that formed by the body on its own. And used internally, it can
even disappear because it's made of the same absorbable material as
internal surgical stitches. Versions of the bandage have been
created for massive internal injuries, such as those sustained in
automobile crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around a steering wheel, a victim of an automobile crash
often hemorrhages from a ruptured liver, bleeding that even
surgeons cannot stop. The reason: The bandage technique used is
unwieldy and ineffective, and it hasn't changed in 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unrolling a huge piece of gauze the length of his office,
William Drohan, who heads the Red Cross' plasma development branch,
demonstrates that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they pack into your belly to put pressure on your
liver to stop the bleeding,'' he said. ``This is 15 feet long and 3
feet wide. It's left inside (the patient) but the gauze has to be
replaced the next day, and when it's removed it pulls on the part
of the wound that's healed.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of people suffering severe liver injuries die,
Drohan said, because the bleeding cannot be stemmed. But a new
4-inch-square surgical bandage sealed with the clotting fibrin
formula could change that statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bandage is absorbable. Once we stop the bleeding, we
simply close (in surgery) and we don't have to reopen to put in
another bandage,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Army has conducted successful experiments using the
fibrin bandages internally on pigs' bleeding livers.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to test the bandages on surgical patients is under review
by the federal government. Clinical trials could begin next year
involving men having their prostate removed, a procedure usually
triggered by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time next year, we could finally be getting close to
using these fibrin bandages,'' MacPhee said. ``This is an
opportunity to help a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And save some precious pints of blood?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably help somewhat, but I don't think it will
affect the need that much,'' MacPhee said. ``And there's always two
sides to everything. We need people to give blood because that's
where we get the plasma. We need their plasma to create the
bandages to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's always junk-food Genie should blood plasma donations
go dry.
</P>
<P>
   She's a 1,500-pound porker genetically altered to produce
therapeutic human proteins in her milk. Genie and other
experimental pigs used in Red Cross and Army research are bred at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., where scientists
specialize in transgenic technology. Making human proteins in pigs'
milk with clotting factors needed to make the fibrin sealant
bandages is under way.
</P>
<P>
   But first you have to milk the pigs _ something rarely done.
``But with pigs, you can always bribe them with food,'' MacPhee
said. ``We found Genie loves cheese Doritos. Put them in the
feeding trough and you can milk them as much as you want.

ARIZONA SENATOR MCCAIN MULLS PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - With his re-election behind him, Sen. John McCain says
he is turning his attention to one of the toughest decisions of his
political career: Whether to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, in an exclusive interview Wednesday with ``The Arizona
Republic,'' said the most daunting obstacle is trying to raise the
$18 million to $20 million a serious candidate will need to enter
the 2000 Republican presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to figure out how you do that before I would decide
whether to run or not,'' said McCain, who has a well-known distate
for raising campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of other things I'd rather do - like bang my
head up against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's vote, McCain crushed a little known Democrat, Ed
Ranger, and two other dark-horse candidates. Exit polling showed
McCain won strong support among virtually every sector of the
electorate, including traditionally Democratic Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming victory gives him a political boost, but McCain
said Wednesday he has no timetable for making a decision about his
political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't worked on that, really. Honest to God,'' he said.
``I'm going to sit down and start talking about it here, now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, McCain leaves for a 10-day Asian trip with Texas
GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, who ran an unsuccessful bid for the GOP
presidential nomination in 1996. McCain played a key role in that
campaign, and the Texan is sure to have plenty of advice about the
pitfalls of seeking national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that topic will come up,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old senator, who occupies the seat once held by the
late Sen. Barry Goldwater, has a national presence that most
politicians would die for. He has been the subject of glowing
profiles in news magazines and CBS' ``60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest shot at national exposure comes Sunday night, when
A&AMP;E will air a two-and-half-hour McCain profile on the popular
``Biography'' program.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as he dislikes it, McCain is no slouch when it comes
to raising money. In the last two years, he has built a national
portfolio of high-profile donors, including Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates, real estate tycoon Donald Trump, Time Warner vice chairman
Ted Turner and the heads of CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   He is likely to be left with $2 million in unused Senate
campaign funds that could be rolled into a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet national polls have put Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the
GOP's front-runner in a crowded field. Steve Forbes and former vice
president Dan Quayle, who lives in the posh Phoenix suburb of
Paradise Valley, are expected to announce next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that (McCain) would like to take a shot at it,''
Arizona GOP chairman Mike Hellon said. ``He's concerned about the
effect on his family. I don't think he is yet convinced that it's
worth the sacrifice and the aggravation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellon predicts McCain will decide ``in his own mind which way
he's going to go'' by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to let the rest of us know certainly by March,''
Hellon said. ``As we speak, other candidates are lining up the big
fund-raisers around the country. If you don't get in and get the
help of people who can help you raise funds by March, all the big
boys are going to be in someone else's camp.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain displayed the kind of broad appeal that could
help him in a national race.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polling, McCain led his Democratic opponent
among men and women and in all age groups.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he captured 52 percent of the traditionally
Democratic Hispanic vote, even though he spent only about $12,000
on one Spanish-language radio spot.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been a leader in GOP efforts to woo Hispanic
voters, said the results show ``that we can reach out across a
broad spectrum of the citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, that's the challenge to the Republican Party in the
next century as we see this dramatically growing Hispanic
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, McCain said, the Republican Party has sent a message
to Hipsanic voters ``unintentionally, that we're an exclusionary
party. That hurts us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My position on their issues have been consistent,'' McCain
said. ``I favor bilingual education that works, I'm opposed to
`English only,' I favor legal immigration. That's a long history of
consistency and policies which I think they support.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, McCain said, Tuesday's lukewarm GOP showing shows that
nationally, his party has ``a lot of work to do in honing our
message and renewing our appeal to a majority of Americans.''

CAN WE CHARGE `GRAMMAR POLICE BRUTALITY'?

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It seems like every time I open a piece of mail, I get
in more and more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Silly me. Here I was, carelessly spending the million dollars I
was sure to get for winning the Nobel Prize for literature when I
got pulled over by the Grammar Police. Or is that Grammer Puleese?
Not only was I cited, but I got beat up in the bathroom with a
dangling participle and a sentence fragment by someone with shaky
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Then I tore open another envelope only to discover that I
disgust people and that my columns have no socially redeeming
value. Maybe I should make up stories about orphaned crack kids
wandering the streets of Boston, or steal some lines from George
Carlin's last book while writing a column about single-handedly
conquering world hunger.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for another mail bag!
</P>
<P>
   _ Your command of grammar is abysmal. A person is someone
``who'' does something, not ``that'' does something. If you want to
be a writer, have someone proofread your work. You wrote a cute
story but you embarrass yourself with poor English usage. Please
try.
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned, Scottsdale &QR;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Mrs. Gaio, is that you? My ninth-grade English
teacher? You moved to Scottsdale? You must have gotten a raise! If
this is you, it's good to hear from you, but also kind of creepy.
This is just like a seance! If this is not Mrs. Gaio, I think
someone got the letter writer's high blood pressure medication
mixed up and gave them a Cranky Pill instead. It's very important
to read labels! And try eating more fiber, too. While you're in the
bathroom, you should read a book called On the Road. Bring a red
pen. That will keep you busy for a long time. By the way, my
dictionary _ which takes both my hands to lift because it's very
heavy, so this must be right _ says that ``cute'' means
``attractive or pretty in a dainty or delicate way.'' Which part of
my story was cute? The cute typeface or the cute little picture at
the top? Oh, and one other thing: My mom wants to have a talk with
you. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   _ You slay me! Every week!! Explaining Clinton's No-No to your
Nana was my favorite. You see, us smooth jazz folks do have a sense
of humor! Question: What did Kenny G. say when he got on the
elevator? Answer: ``This place rocks!''
</P>
<P>
   I want to be you when I grow up! Thanks for the yuks!
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Sharpe, &QR; 
KYOT Morning Show
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) You don't want to be me when you grow up. Don't do
it! After recently passing another birthday, I realized I still
can't pay my bills on time, eat far too many Hostess products for a
girl my size and have a car so dirty that Nana won't even get into
it without sitting on a towel first. Now what kind of life is that,
I ask you? When my mom was my age, she had three little girls.
Three other mouthy human beings to feed, dress and wipe. I only
have a dog that I forget to feed at least three times a week, and
that doesn't even require unbuttoning my shirt. Be my mom when you
grow up _ but if you do, just don't ask for my phone number. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   _ I don't usually write letters regarding articles I don't like,
I just don't read that writer's work in the future. However,
reading your segment on ``The Top Six People Who Have No Business
Being Naked in the Movies'' disgusted me.
</P>
<P>
   What gives you the right to criticize, in a very personal
manner, other individuals who have done nothing to warrant such
criticism? Conan O'Brien has said that it's inappropriate to poke
fun at or insult innocent people. Apparently you are more the
mean-spirited sort of person, like Jay Leno or David Letterman, who
likes to use your ``platform'' to display your ``power'' by
enhancing yourself at other people's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Your article was unnecessary, and lacking in humor, depth and
any socially redeeming value. If it sounds like I'm overreacting,
perhaps I am; but, I feel it's about time that the people with the
platform in this country start taking the high road, and when you
communicate, communicate something of value and worth.
</P>
<P>
   Janis, Scottsdale &QR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) It's OK if you didn't like the column, Janis, I
understand. Not everybody likes everything. Did you know that there
are even people who don't like LeAnn Rimes? Really, it's true! But,
at the same time, the right I had to write that column was the same
right you used to write the letter above. It's called the First
Right, or First Commandment, something like that. You know, the one
that comes before the right we all have to stick a .45 in our
waistband and walk into Kmart. And, honestly, the people I wrote
about really don't have any business being naked in movies. I think
it would be mean to know about these crimes against humanity and
NOT tell other people about the danger. Go out right now and rent
``Bad Lieutenant,'' and after you see Harvey Keitel in the absolute
buff, I think you'll know what I'm talking about. As for these
folks doing nothing to warrant the criticism, I've learned one
thing in my life, and that's if you don't want people to make fun
of you naked, don't get naked in front of people.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit I laughed out loud when you mentioned my
``platform'' and my ``power.'' My husband laughed, too. My
``platform'' has a water tank and a handle you have to jiggle, and
the only ``power'' I have is scolding my dog after I catch her
drinking out of it. Actually, my husband says I should use it to
run for Congress, and it's become something of a running joke in
our house, well, especially in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, what's John McCain's answering machine doing on our
coffee table?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not now, honey! I had the special at Juan's for lunch! I'm
working on the platform!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, hurry up! I just finished a 200-ounce Thirst Terminator
from Circle K!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not now, honey! I'm working on the platform! I thought of a
campaign slogan! I'm thinking about wearing a blue Gap dress and
saying over and over again, `This dress is clean!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'd better go. I hear lapping sounds coming from the
bathroom and I'm feeling rather powerful. Oh, and one other thing,
Janis: My mom wants to have a talk with you, too. &QL;

SYMINGTON-APPEAL (Undated) - One of the three judges in the Ninth
Circuit panel reviewing the trial of Fife Symington appeared to be
sympathetic to the argument that ousted juror Mary Jane Cody should
have been allowed to make up her own mind in the case, however
inelegantly. Meanwhile, the irony was not lost on a second
panelist, Judge Ishima, that he never could have foreseen the day
50 years ago, when he was a child in a Japanese internment camp
during WWII in Arizona, that one day the fate of an Arizona
governor would lie partly in his hands. By JERRY KAMMER. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCCAIN (Undated) - With his re-election behind him, Sen. John
McCain says he is turning his attention to one of the toughest
decisions of his political career: Whether to seek the presidency.
McCain, in an exclusive interview with ``The Arizona Republic,''
said the most daunting aspect is trying to raise the $18 million a
serious candidate will need to enter the Republican presidential
primary. ``I've got to figure out how you do that before I would
decide whether to run or not,'' said McCain, who distate for
raising campaign funds is legendary. The senator also talks about
the measning of his strong showing among Hispanic voters. McCain
picked up a majority of Hispanic voters, even outdoing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who had targeted Hispanics as a test of his
presidential mettle. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story moved in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOUSE-REVOLT (Washington) - Congressional conservatives, including
Arizona's Matt Salmon and John Shadegg, are talking about big
changes in leadership, and a revolt is likely even if an actual
overthrow of Speaker Newt Gingrich, upon whom much of Tuesday's GOP
debacle is being blamed, is premature. Gingrich and his lieutenants
were already on shaky political ground for backing down on key
budget issues this year. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLEAN-ELECTIONS (Undated) - The most revolutionary measure approved
by Arizona voters on Tuesday may have been the vote to have the
public rather than lobbyists pay for state elections. In tandem
with the vote to open up the primaries, the control of the
political parties has been shaken. Even the power to redistrict,
which has made the state the virtual captive of one party or
another for the last 50 years, may be broken if enough candidates
take advantage of this law. By CHRIS MOESER and MARTIN VAN DER
WERF. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARIJUANA (Undated) - We try to put Arizona's extraordinary
reaffirmation of medical marijuana in national perspective. And we
add a medical dimension. Will physicians now be encouraged to write
some scrip for pot? Will the DEA now drop its threat to arrest
doctors who follow state law rather than federal law? By STEVE
YOZWIAK and ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WILLEY-COLUMN (Undated) Arizona has made history. Not just state
history. But national history. It elected five women to the five
top state offices. This has never happened anywhere in the country
before. By KEVEN WILLEY. Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - It seems like every time I open a piece
of mail, I get in more and more trouble. Silly me. Here I was,
carelessly spending the million dollars I was sure to get for
winning the Nobel Prize for literature when I got pulled over by
the Grammar Police. Then I tore open another envelope only to
discover that I disgust people and that my columns have no socially
redeeming value. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L''

BLANCHETT FITS RIGHT INTO ROLE OF FAMED MONARCH IN `ELIZABETH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She is not your
ancestor-who-came-over-on-the-Mayflower's Queen Elizabeth. But she
may be the most persuasively human virgin monarch ever portrayed on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, the rising young Australian actress (``Paradise
Road,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda''), plays Britain's most famous queen
as a vibrant young princess and shrewd student of court intrigue,
but definitely not as a virgin in ``Elizabeth.'' Influenced in
about equal measure by ``The Godfather,'' Machiavelli and
Shakespeare's bloodier takes on royalty, the film occupies both a
different time frame and a different conceptual realm than the
``Masterpiece Theatre'' rendition or those old Bette Davis movies
did.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries' worth of conventional British history might say
that ``Elizabeth'' operates on a whole other planet. But that's why
Blanchett was so intrigued by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deals with a lesser-known part of her reign,'' the blond,
willowy actress explains. ``It's very easy, when someone is as
iconic a part of British history as Elizabeth is, to make
assumptions about her character in light of her achievements. I
think that Shekhar was very much interested in a more personal sort
of historics, seeing how she and the kingdom progess from a state
of chaos to a state of logic and order.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE EARLY MONARCH &QL; 
Shekhar (pronounced Shaker) is director Shekhar Kapur, whose last
film, ``Bandit Queen,'' told the true contemporary story of an
unusually powerful female outlaw in his native India. He wanted to
focus ``Elizabeth'' on the pre-icon years, immediately before and
after Henry VIII's 25-year-old daughter inherited the throne from
her devoutly Catholic half-sister Mary in 1558.
</P>
<P>
   With Spain and France vying to keep England in the Vatican fold,
royals from both countries sought Elizabeth's hand in marriage _ or
else. Meanwhile, Catholic-leaning noblemen such as the Duke of
Norfolk conspired to prevent Elizabeth from re-establishing her
father's Protestant Church of England as the nation's official
faith.
</P>
<P>
   As threats from both within and without increased, Elizabeth had
to put politics and power consolidation ahead of personal
satisfaction _ which had included, according to the film, a
passionate affair with the Earl of Leicester (played by Joseph
Fiennes, younger brother of Blanchett's ``Oscar and Lucinda''
co-star Ralph Fiennes).
</P>
<P>
   Kapur rejected many young actresses for the sought-after role
before catching a glimpse of Blanchett quite by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tradition in England, and perhaps all over the
world: The prime roll every actress wants to play is Elizabeth,''
Kapur says. ``Why? Because she was the fantastically greatest and
most powerful woman who ever lived. But all the films about
Elizabeth, so far, have taken place after the image was created.
They have started where we end, with this very powerful woman.
We've gone back and said, let's see how this power evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I was looking for a girl to play Elizabeth, A) she had
to be younger, and B) she had to have the possibility of going into
that journey, of being able to look vulnerable, in love, inept. You
would never believe that this girl would have the qualities you
associate with Elizabeth, but through the film she has to become
harder, lifeless. So I needed an actress who could look extremely
strong and extremely vulnerable in the same movie.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`OSCAR' PAYOFF &QL; 
Blanchett fit that bill; Kapur knew she would the first time he saw
a promo reel of ``Oscar and Lucinda'' at a producer friend's
office. There were other first impressions, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a face that, at times, looked like it belonged to a
spirit and not a person,'' Kapur notes. ``That was great for a
character who some would say becomes a shell, an image. And Cate
also had a face that looked like it could belong to 400 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Good as she's been in them, though, Blanchett takes some
exception to being labeled a period-piece actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could say I've had the depth of planning to shape my
career like this,'' says the actress, a graduate of Australia's
National Institute of Dramatic Art and a veteran of the Sydney
Theatre Company. ``It's really been what's come up and what's been
the best thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when people say `period piece,' I think they're really
saying `dull, boring and quaint,''' she reckons. ``So one really
has to find a reason why one wants to delve back into history for
one of these. You can't patronize or make it a history lesson; it's
got to be a dramatic work.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOVING FORWARD &QL; 
Blanchett will get more up to date in her next couple of films:
``Pushing Tin,'' a comedy about air traffic controllers in which
she'll play an American opposite John Cusack and Billy Bob
Thornton; and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' a Patricia Highsmith
thriller directed by ``The English Patient's'' Anthony Minghella
and co-starring Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly a modern streak in Blanchett's Elizabeth
portrayal. Something, you might say, that a movie star of the 1990s
could easily relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone is as enigmatic a monarch as she was, you'll
never know the internal mechanics,'' she says. ``But because she
was thrust into the public eye, utilized in rebellions before she
even ascended to the throne, she realized that she needed to be all
things to all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had a very strong sense of performance. It was
really interesting to play that interface between what's going on
internally and that mask that she presents at various points.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett herself avoids the trappings of movie royalty. The
Melbourne-raised actress, whose father was from Texas, lives apart
from the show-business crowd in a beach suburb of Sydney with her
husband, writer Andrew Upton.
</P>
<P>
   But people are already touting Blanchett as an Oscar contender
for her fresh take on the Virgin Queen. Rather than turning into an
ego-princess, however, she seems to be taking the buzz in the same
humble spirit that her old Australian stage pal and ``Elizabeth''
co-star, Geoffrey Rush, dealt with his Academy Award for ``Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to be in `Oscar and Lucinda,' where Oscar was
just in the title,'' she jokes. ``I guess it's that time of year.
It's flattering, but not personally; it means that people are
excited by the film. That's all it means, and the rest is in the
lap of the gods, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanchett is just thankful for the opportunity to play unique,
resourceful and totally unpredictable women, regardless of what era
or level of society they may come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``These haven't been simple women in male-dominated worlds,''
she says of her screen roles. ``I was lucky to have people to play
who were fleshed-out in a three-dimensional way. It's much harder
to make a thinner character richer.'' &QL;

   THE 1998 MID-TERM ELECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ Taking up where he left off
before the election, President Clinton planned Wednesday to ignore
the prospect of impeachment and focus on Social Security and the
other high-profile issues that served his party so well at the
polls. And now, he has more political capital to spend on push
them. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-COALITION _ WASHINGTON _ The basis of the Democrats'
election success was a coalition of black, Hispanic and women
voters. These groups, which all find something to dislike in top
Republican issues, represent a major challenge for the GOP as its
prepares for 2000. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ Talking to House Judiciary
committee members and others about what the election results mean
for impeachment. (Carr, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-BLACKS _ An examination of the black vote coming out
stronger than expected. We focus on Georgia, looking at the exit
polls, but also look at national efforts to get out the black vote
by Democratic Party, Clinton, black churches and radio stations and
some specific groups. Also who was advising Clinton on this
strategy? (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-AHEAD _ Campaign 2000 begins today, for U.S. president,
another third of the seats in the U.S. Senate, more governors and
lots of mayors. (ABrice, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-GINGRICH _ ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich holds morning press
conference in Atlanta to discuss election. We'll see what he and
Rep. John Linder have to say about the results. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-POLLS _ WASHINGTON _ The election results may have been
a surprise to some people, but not America's leading pollsters, who
all claim they predicted the Democratic gains. They problem, they
say, is TV talking heads, who refused to let public opinion
research shake the inside-the-Beltway conventional wisdom that
Republicans would gain seats. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>

Cruise's failure to get a Blockbuster card last week because he

still a chance that Microsoft could call the Real Bill in from his

we do not. As damaging as virtual Bill was, he may have been better

THE SPIN ON JEFFERSON'S BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA tests verified that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child by his
slave Sally Hemings. The finding confirms 200 years of black folk
history and vindicates some (but not all) of Hemings' descendants,
who have argued for generations that Jefferson was an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalent historical spin: This further complicates our
understanding of the third president, who preached against
miscegenation while practicing it.
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful historical spin: This may make whites more willing
to acknowledge their common heritage with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The gleeful pro-Clinton spin: Jefferson's affair proves that a
president's private foibles shouldn't overshadow his public
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The grouchy anti-Clinton spin: Jefferson was a widower at the
time of his relations with Hemings, never lied about his affair
under oath, and Clinton's accomplishments hardly rival the
Declaration of Independence.

THE EXPLAINER: WHY IS THERE NO JURY IN THE MICROSOFT TRIAL AND WHAT
DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Slate is owned by Microsoft.) 
 By BRUCE GOTTLIEB and KATE GALBRAITH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: Why is the case being tried before a judge, not a
jury?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: If the plaintiffs (the Department of Justice and 20
states) were seeking ``damages'' (money) from Microsoft, then
either side would be entitled to request a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plaintiffs are not seeking money--they only seek
injunctive relief such as stopping Microsoft from packaging its
internet browser in Windows 98. The Microsoft trial thus falls
under a category of law called ``actions in equity.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a tradition dating back to English law, ``actions
in equity'' are tried before a judge not a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ complaint does seek to recover ``costs'' from
Microsoft--such as the money spent while preparing depositions.
Likewise, the states' complaint filed Aug. 17 seeks to be ``awarded
their costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees.''
However, costs and fees are minor sideshows of the case, and
neither of these constitute ``damages.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: What Does the Government Want From Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   answer: The government thinks Microsoft violated the antitrust
laws. But what does the government wish to do about this? What
remedy is the government proposing?
</P>
<P>
   The reason the newspapers don't tell you is that the Justice
Department hasn't said what it wants to happen. This antitrust
suit, like all civil cases, begins with a plaintiffs' complaint
detailing the alleged offenses. (The Department of Justice and 20
state attorneys general are the plaintiffs.)
</P>
<P>
   It is common, though not mandatory, for the complaint to suggest
so-called ``remedies.'' For example, a person who is hit by an
automobile will declare that $2 million cash will alleviate her
pain and suffering. Or parties to a bitter divorce will sue for
exclusive custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the Justice Department is waiting to see
how the court rules before deciding what remedy to ask for. The
antitrust laws are both vague and in flux. The remedy request will
depend not merely on whether the government wins the case, but on
the judge's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Potential remedies the government might seek include, among
others: 1) requiring Microsoft to separate its browser from the
Windows operating system; 2) requiring Microsoft to provide details
of its products to competitors; or 3) breaking the company into a
number of smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge may accept the government's proposed remedy or fashion
one of his own. And of course any remedy can be appealed to a
higher court.

THE ONLY PLAYERS ARE THE PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The central dilemma in the current NBA lockout is that the
workers control the means of production because the workers are the
means of production.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners contribute almost nothing to the product that they
put out, and while the current lockout represents their attempt to
re-establish control over the players, it's both difficult to
imagine that attempt succeeding and, even more, unclear whether
that attempt should succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that when it comes to the NBA players we're
talking about men who on average take home more than $1 million a
year while getting the summers off, it's undoubtedly hard to see
these guys as the vanguard of the working class. But you can
recognize the logic behind the players' demands without mistaking
them for proletarian heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The current impasse began, after all, because the existing
players' agreement had a provision saying that the owners could
reopen contract discussions if player compensation reached more
than 52 percent of annual revenue. Last season, compensation
totaled 57 percent, and the owners want to reduce that to 48
percent, while the players' best offer so far is 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are just having a hard time grasping reality. While
they may have legal title to their teams' names, and in some cases
to the stadiums they play in, they don't really do very much to
bring in any revenue. The players do the lion's share of the work.
It's not clear why they shouldn't bring in the lion's share of the
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could argue that this is true of any business.
Shareholders in a company don't do any work, so why should they get
paid any dividend (or why should profits be reinvested rather than
paying them out in salaries)?
</P>
<P>
   But in most businesses workers are fairly interchangeable.
Nobody goes to McDonald's because Megan is behind the counter
(well, unless you're a high school boy who has a crush on Megan).
People go to McDonald's because of the name and the food, both of
which are the product of the company, not of the workers. And, in
any case, those employees who are judged to have a
disproportionately important impact on the business--the
executives--are compensated exceedingly well in most corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA--indeed, all of professional sports, but the NBA above
all--is different from these other situations because the workers
are the reason people come to the games.
</P>
<P>
   People come to see NBA games not because it's the NBA, but
because they know that's where they'll see the very best basketball
players in the world. If the NBA disappeared tomorrow, people would
still want to see those players. If those players moved on, people
would not still want to see the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the owners put up the capital and deserve a return
on investment to compensate them for their risk. But cutting costs
by cutting salaries may make sense in a business world where
workers are fungible commodities. It makes no sense in a business
where the workers are the only resource that matters.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the players deserve 67 percent of the league's
annual revenue. But to decry their position as greedy or
unreasonable is simply to misunderstand the nature of the game.

   &QL;  PENNSYLVANIA SHAPES UP AS BATTLEGROUND IN 2000
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, Murtha in jeopardy
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 -- By swinging support between Democrats and
Republicans as if they were playing with a yo-yo, Pennsylvania
voters have ensured that the Keystone state is a prime battleground
for the 2000 elections, party activists say.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's overwhelming statewide victories by Gov. Tom Ridge and
U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, both Republicans, left GOP leaders in
Washington claiming that they have an edge for the
turn-of-the-century elections. More importantly, they said, Ridge
and the GOP-controlled state legislature will be in charge of
redrawing Pennsylvania's 21 congressional districts after the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of momentum in Pennsylvania right now,'' said
Mike Russell, spokesman for the National Republican Senate
Committee, the Washington-based fundraising and strategy panel for
GOP Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats pointed to the upset victory of Democrat Joseph
Hoeffel over U.S. Rep. Jon Fox in suburban Philadelphia as an
example of their message winning in Pennsylvania, even in a year
when Democrats mounted almost non-existent challenges at the top of
the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And Beltway Democrats are already talking about putting a lot of
resources into an effort to knock off U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, the
freshman Republican who is up for reelection in 2000 and who many
think is vulnerable because he is such a staunch conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Santorum's on the top of the (vulnerable) list,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the incoming chairman of the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``We know from our
polling that Santorum's weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win that seat,'' said Steve Grossman, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And if Pennsylvanians flip back to the Democrats in 2000, that
just may happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the state sent liberal Democrat Harris Wofford to the
Senate, which they followed up by giving its 23 electoral votes to
Bill Clinton in 1992. But in 1994 Keystone state voters sent
Wofford packing, voting instead for Santorum and also giving
Republican Ridge the governor's mansion. By 1996 Pennsylvania swung
back to the Democrats and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the Democrats couldn't even mount a significant
challenge against Ridge or Specter, making 2000 almost
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can really say with a degree of certainty is the
Republican Senate candidates have the momentum right now,'' said
Russell, the GOP Senate committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   But Torricelli and Grossman said they are already talking to
potential Democratic opponents. Torricelli added that the DSCC will
try to rally the state's Democrats around one candidate to avoid a
costly and potentially divisive primary to pick Santorum's
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Two names that are floated as possible candidates are Rep. Ron
Klink, the western Pennsylvania congressman, and Marjorie
Margolies-Mezvinsky, the former congresswoman from suburban
Philadelphia. Neither politician has name recognition across the
state, and Margolies-Mezvinsky was just part of the miserable
showing in the governor's race as the Democratic nominee for
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable that they're talking about a pick-up when they
don't even have a challenger (to Santorum),'' said Russell.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing is certain: Ridge's big reelection ``certainly
makes him one of the bright stars'' of the Republican Party, said
Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's name is frequently batted around as a potential
vice-presidential candidate in 2000, and his easy victory --
combined with growing GOP disappointment in its Washington leaders
-- did nothing to dispel that possibility. ``It is a very good
example for the rest of the party,'' Fitzpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't end up in Washington, Ridge's biggest legacy may
be how he shapes the new congressional districts after the 2000
census, when Pennsylvania is expected to lose one or two seats in
the House because of its stagnant population growth.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans have their way, they will most likely take away a
seat in the Democratic strongholds of Philadelphia and western
Pennsylvania, likely to be Rep. John Murtha's Johnstown-based seat.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1990 census, Democrats held a majority of the
governor's mansions, and people like then Gov. Bob Casey oversaw
redistricting. Now, Ridge and 30 other Republicans dominate the
governorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a relatively much better position now than we were
in 1988,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Pennsylvania's fickle voters could make things more
difficult for the GOP by the year 2000 by supporting a Democratic
presidential candidate and giving Democrats control of the state
legislature. ``I'm more optimistic about Pennsylvania,'' said
Grossman, the Democratic counterpart to Nicholson.

 &HT;    PUNDITS AND POLLSTERS EXPLAIN THEIR PREDICTIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pundits and pollsters joined Republicans on
Wednesday in spinning the surprising results of the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been calling these things for about 30 years, and this is
the first time that I totally screwed up,'' admitted columnist Bob
Novak, the conservative host of CNN's ``Crossfire.'' Novak had
predicted Republicans would pick up five Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging Democrats would avoid a blowout in
congressional races, political analysts had been nearly unanimous
in proclaiming that the Republicans would pick up at least a few
seats in both the House and Senate. Pollsters had cautioned Senate
races from California to the Carolinas to New York were too close
to call, but Democrats often ended up winning comfortably when the
votes were counted Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Few _ if any _ members of TV's so-called ``chattering class'' of
commentators were wise or bold enough to foresee what actually
happened: Democrats picked up four, perhaps five, House seats, with
one race still being tallied late Wednesday. Democrats also gained
two Southern governorships and held their own in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Novak said he had relied on his time-honored reporting methods _
traveling around the country and talking to voters and politicians
of both parties, studying polls, relying on his instincts. He said
his predictions were wrong partly because the African-American
turnout was higher than projected and because he underestimated the
negative feelings toward Republicans, not only over the impeachment
inquiry of President Clinton but among the party's base over the
acceptance of a ``pork barrel budget'' at the end of the
congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   However, Novak was just a bit farther out on a rotten limb
shared by almost all the pundits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it wrong. What can I say?'' said a laughing Merle Black,
an Emory University professor and expert in Southern politics who
predicted in Sunday's edition of The Washington Post that the
Republicans would pick up three Senate seats and nine House seats.
``I didn't think the Republicans were inept enough'' to buck a
century or so of precedence in which the president's party lost
seats in such elections.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, pundits must rely on the pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it was technical,'' said Andrew Kohut, director Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press. While several
national surveys showed the Democratic strength, he explained,
smaller ``weighted'' samplings used by some local pollsters,
employed by campaigns and media organizations to gauge voter
opinion in individual states and congressional districts, contained
distortions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these polls underestimated the strength of frontrunners
_ who turned out to be Democrats who won by surprising margins, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But more than that was the mindset that the Republicans had to
gain seats'' in the sixth year of a scandalized Democratic
president, Kohut said. ``It takes an awful lot of facts _ sometimes
an atomic explosion of facts _ to overcome the conventional wisdom
in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The national polls were ``much more accurate than the pundits,''
agreed Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Polling from Thursday through Sunday before Tuesday's election,
Gallup found 49 percent of registered voters favored Democratic
congressional candidates, compared with 45 percent for Republicans.
Polls by the Pew Research Center, ABC News and CBS News also showed
Democrats leading in this ``generic'' preference.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup said this ``generic'' vote is generally a good predictor
of individual races and flatly predicted Monday that ``if Democrats
gain a majority of the overall national House vote on Tuesday,
history would indicate that Democrats would gain seats, reversing
the usual pattern by which the party not in the White House loses
House seats in midterm elections.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have been any more dead accurate than we were,''
said Peter Hart, whose Peter D. Hart Research Associates conducted
the NBC-Wall Street Journal Polls. ``We clearly said there was
movement toward Democrats in the congressional races.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pollsters got it right, but the pundits got it wrong. It
was a little of both for me,'' said John Zogby, president of Zogby
International Polls and a TV political analyst. Zogby's polling had
shown Democrats ahead in the generic vote, but he had personally
predicted a Republican gain of five House seats and one to three
Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said telemarketers have made the science of political
polling considerably more troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ringing of a phone at 9 p.m. has gone from a welcome
signal of excitement to a nuisance in many homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The response rate to telephone surveys also has been reduced as
more Americans screen calls through call-waiting, caller ID and
answering machines, he said. In polling for a House race, for
instance, a relatively small sample is used, anyway, so the
response rate must be carefully assessed to avoid skewing results.
</P>
<P>
   Hart agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response rate is down as telemarketing goes up,'' he said.
``People are more resistant to legitimate telephone surveys''
because they are frequently annoyed by telephone sales people.
</P>
<P>
   However, the national polling firms begin with larger samples
and have devised systems to avoid any response bias, Gallup's
Newport said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the declining response rate, Kohut said Pew even
conducted a survey last year to determine if either Republicans or
Democrats were more likely to refuse to answer a pollster's
questions. The poll found no such partisan bias, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman was unapologetic about his
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said on 'Face the Nation' two weeks ago that I thought we
would lose, at most, one or two Senate seats,'' he said. ``I
thought we would lose a handful of House seats, based on the
historical precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   The national ``generic'' vote is hard to translate into
individual House races, he noted. While the Democrats may have won
this total vote of all congressional races, the Republicans still
won more individual House races.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're measuring against is history and expectations,''
he said.

   CREATINE-HIGHSCHOOLS _ ATLANTA _ The new rage in workout
supplements is creatine monohydrate, a legal muscle builder that is
available over the counter nearly everywhere (even at Kroger's
grocery stores). Very little is known about the long-term effects
of the substance, but millions of people, including teenagers, take
the stuff to get ripped. In light of a recent position statement

   BKN-ABL-FUTURE _ The ABL begins its third season on Thursday
amid even stronger questions of its long-term viability. Although
the women's pro basketball league added two network games on Fox, a
lack of television exposure is still a major problem. League
officials suddenly shut down its franchise in Long Beach, which

   CREATINE-HIGHSCHOOLS _ ATLANTA _ The new rage in workout
supplements is creatine monohydrate, a legal muscle builder that is
available over the counter nearly everywhere (even at Kroger's
grocery stores). Very little is known about the long-term effects
of the substance, but millions of people, including teenagers, take
the stuff to get ripped. In light of a recent position statement
released by the National Federation of State High School
Association concerning creatine, we look at how Georgia high school
football programs approach its use. Who condones it, who doesn't?

   FBN-COWBOYS-MIDSEASON _ At the midway point of the NFL season,
Chan Gailey wonders what happened in the Denver, Oakland and
Chicago games. The coach of the Dallas Cowboys wants to win every
Sunday, and makes no excuses when they lose. He is a perfectionist
who has found fault three times this year. ``I expect to win them
all,'' Gailey said. With that said, the first-year coach has plenty
to be thankful about. (Cantu, Austin American-Statesman)

the steal of the century two years ago when it recruited Adrian
Peterson out of Alachua High School in Florida. Peterson was a
football star with incredible talent, but a speech impediment
caused major schools to back away thinking he might be an academic
risk. So GSU assistant Tracy Ham, an Alachua graduate, convinced
Peterson to come to Georgia Southern and he has taken Division I-AA
by storm. Peterson broke GSU single-season rushing record in last
week's victory over The Citadel. (Reese, Atlanta

   BKN-ABL-FUTURE _ The ABL begins its third season on Thursday
amid even stronger questions of its long-term viability. Although
the women's pro basketball league added two network games on Fox, a

officials suddenly shut down its franchise in Long Beach, which
reached the finals last season, and dissolved the Atlanta franchise
because of poor support. Founding player Dawn Staley recently
jumped to the WNBA, which figures to nab Tennessee's Chamique
Holdsclaw next year. Still, ABL brass insists the league is here to

MAXIMIZING 3-D GAMES

   Q. What do I need to get proper images in 3-D video games for my
PC? Or does that depend on only the game software?
</P>
<P>
   A. To play a three-dimensional video game on your computer with
optimum results, it helps to have a lot of everything _ processor
speed, RAM and hard disk space _ and an add-in hardware card for
3-D graphics. Games designed for 3-D play, where being able to
judge distance or see minute details can help you navigate, often
come with the claim that they run just fine with certain minimal
hardware requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But minimum requirements can often mean minimum performance, and
many games list recommended requirements as well. For example, the
maker of a game that is supposed to need a minimum of a Pentium 133
with 32 megabytes of RAM, a standard SVGA video card and no
additional 3-D card might recommend that you actually have at least
a Pentium 200 with 64 megabytes of RAM, a 2-megabyte SVGA card and
an add-in 3-D expansion card.
</P>
<P>
   You should check the game's box before you buy to see what the
manufacturer lists as the minimum and recommended software and
hardware. The game may require a specific kind of 3-D card as well.
Good gaming information is available at Gamecenter
(www.gamecenter.com) and Gamespot (www.gamespot.com).

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   The long dry spell in Florida will end on Thursday as the
moisture associated with Tropical Storm Mitch merges with a
disturbance along a cold front crossing the state. Very heavy rain
will taper off from southwest to northeast across the peninsula.
More than 3 inches of rain will drench the southern and eastern
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds will reach gale force along the southeast coast as
the pressure difference increases between the storm near Florida
and a huge fair-weather system nosing into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a cold rain will spread along the immediate coast,
perhaps as far north as Cape Hatteras. Onshore winds will keep low
clouds over parts of the Piedmont plateau. Sunshine will return to
the central Gulf Coast, but patches of low clouds will persist over
the Tennessee Valley. A brisk wind from the northeast will enhance
the chill.
</P>
<P>
   While the northeast coast will be mainly sunny and very cool,
patches of low clouds will make the interior dull. A few snow
showers will dust the communities east of lakes Ontario and Huron.
Sunshine and clouds will be mixed over the upper Mississippi
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the southeast will ascend the western Plains leading
to low clouds and patches of drizzle from the Texas panhandle to
southern Montana. A cold front pushing across the northern Rockies
will promote valley showers and mountain snows in the Cascades and
Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southwest and California will be bright, but cooler.
Clouds will be interspersed with sunshine over the central Rockies.
Gusty winds will develop along the central part of the Pacific
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hybrid Storm
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Mitch was reborn on Tuesday, as the remnants of
the devastating Atlantic hurricane reorganized in the southern Gulf
of Mexico. On Wednesday, the system began interacting with a
frontal zone to its north. Advancing cool air was causing falling
temperatures in Mitch's wake, while the center of the storm
retained its warm, tropical identity. Now a subtropical storm,
Mitch had evolved into a hybrid between a tropical storm and the
low-pressure systems that roam the middle latitudes. On Thursday,
Tropical Storm Mitch will complete its transition to a
middle-latitude storm after exiting Florida.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Miller thought of dancing, even skating, atop
its 22-foot golden-oak tables. Joan Didion called it ``a convent
for those who live in the world.'' Richard Eberhart, the poet,
found an unlikely love, ``all gaudy pelt, and sleek, gracefully
moving'' among the tables, and Bill Blass donated enough money to
have his name set in stone outside its main door. Since it opened
on May 23, 1911, the main reading room of the New York Public
Library has lent itself to fancy flights of literacy. And when it
reopens on Nov. 16, after a year of restoration and a week of
previews, its curious mix of gaudy hauteur and inviting domesticity
will be more evident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf blowers have blasted grime from the gilded crevices in the
coffered ceiling; the last of the World War II black-out paint has
been stripped from the 17-foot arched windows looking west over
Bryant Park. The linings of brass lampshades have been painted
white to soften the glow on those beloved reading tables, most of
them with bronze plates for laptop plug-ins. And as if the space
weren't already aspirational, the ceiling panels _ once as murky as
a witch's brew _ have been repainted with billowing white clouds
piled high in a pure azure.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million restoration returns high-mindedness to one of
the world's favorite solitary occupations _ reading. There may be
48 computers on six of the 42 reading tables, but they were
installed without a nick to the inlaid ebony and oak bases
extravagantly carved with the city's seal. Here is elegant proof
that preparations for the future don't have to mean a wrenching
break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   From the start in 1897, when the founding director, John
Billings, a former Army surgeon, drew a sketch putting the reading
room on the top floor, far from the dust and noise of the city, the
library, and especially the reading room, as designed by John
Merven Carrere and Thomas Hastings, was to be an ennobling space.
Great scholars and crank-letter writers alike sat at the communal
tables: Alfred Kazin wrote most of ``On Native Grounds'' in the
reading room, stopping occasionally to play Ping-Pong in Times
Square with a fellow toiler, the historian Richard Hofstadter.
Norbert Pearlroth sat there for 50 years, surrounded by open
shelves weighted with the works of Sigmund Freud, Diderot's
Encyclopedia and volumes of baseball statistics, as he researched
Ripley's ``Believe It or Not'' column.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has always been part of the library's ennobling
mission. It was one of the earliest large buildings _ constructed
for the then princely sum of $9 million _ to be fully equipped with
electric lights so that working people would be able to use it in
the evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   Once simply Room 315, the reading room, with a capacity for 636
bookworms, will officially be known by the unwieldy name Deborah,
Jonathan F.P., Samuel Priest and Adam Raphael Rose Main Reading
Room, in honor of the children of Sandra Priest Rose and Frederick
Phineas Rose, the real estate developer who put up the entire
restoration cost. The Rose Reading Room, as it is more likely to be
called, is one of the grandest of spaces in New York City entirely
open for public use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the key symbolic space within a library that rivals the
great European libraries,'' said Paul LeClerc, the library's
president, as he sat in his own glorious office, its walls covered
in dark-green damask, with a fireplace carved from oxblood-red
marble. ``And its essence is the most pluralistic, democratic
access imaginable. The only criterion one needs to get in is
curiosity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LeClerc started coming to the reading room when he was a
19-year-old from Queens doing term papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember distinctly how upset I was when I came back after
an absence and the chairs were different,'' he said. ``They'd all
been replaced by these '70s knockoffs; they were total misfits.''
The original oak reading-table chairs, with their easy curve to the
back and graciously scrolling arms, have been returned or, as
necessary, copied. (Reproductions of the chairs and reading lamps
will be sold in the gift shop.)
</P>
<P>
   While past presidents steered clear of the huge undertaking of
restoring the reading room, LeClerc embraced it. ``You want to make
your mark,'' he said, more matter-of-factly than immodestly.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Davis of Davis Brody Bond, the architectural firm that has
worked on library-renovation projects since 1980, couldn't fathom
it. ``What would you do with the 400 people in there?'' the
architect said. ``Then LeClerc decided he wanted to make it his
legacy. And he went out and got the money and figured out what to
do with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, getting the money turned out to be quick work.
``We had a campaign going on,'' said LeClerc, still relishing the
moment. ``The Roses were planning to donate $5 million and had come
to talk with me about what that would get. We were eating chicken
sandwiches. I told them, you can name a division, you can create
endowment gifts and so on. Rose said, `What else do you have?' ''
</P>
<P>
   LeClerc then divulged his heart's desire and offered to show the
couple a master plan for the reading room. He left for a few
moments, and when he returned, they had decided. ``It was just
spectacular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rose knew firsthand how desperately the reading room needed
a face lift; she'd spent time there herself as what she calls ``a
retread student'' in the 1970s. ``It was tragic,'' she said. ``You
knew you were in this marvelous space, but it was dim and grim.''
Parts of the room were set off with temporary walls to shield
copying machines and researchers' cubicles. Cumbersome microfilm
reading machines were a hulking presence.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, the reading room was closed, and construction
started in earnest. More than 30 construction specialists and
artisans were brought in to lay hands on the room, which is one of
the world's largest uncolumned spaces _ roughly the length of a
football field. No surface was left unrefreshed, from the 18 bronze
chandeliers with 1,620 light bulbs to the undersides of the reading
tables, from which decades of gum wads were scraped. Richard Nix of
Du-Well furniture refinishers lost count of how many chairs and
tables he stripped, stained and coated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The craftsmanship on these tables is a wonderment,'' he said
of the ornately carved gadroons, astragals, volutes, acanthus,
leering dolphin designs and other classical elements that few could
call by name (and that's just on the table's waist-high base). ``I
don't know where they found the people who could do it in the first
place,'' said Nix, adding that while there was virtually no
graffiti defacing the woodwork, he had to sand off plenty of
cigarette burns. ``Now there's a little insight to another time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling was ``simply a mess,'' Davis said. Grime, water
damage _ even the occasional hole punched through by a foot _ had
rendered the murals unrecognizable. ``The ceiling became our
obsession,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little to go by to recreate the color in the murals:
old photographs were of no use; a glass lantern slide offered some
guidance because it had been hand painted. Rather than paint
directly on the plasterwork, the architect commissioned Evergreene
Painting Studios of Manhattan to recreate them on canvas sections,
which were then affixed to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the room is no Merchant-Ivory stage set. Forty-eight
computer workstations, 32 with their own printers, secure the Rose
Reading Room's reach into the next century. Twenty-four of the
computers will offer access to more than 100 electronic databases,
free to all library users; the other 24 are linked to the Internet.
LeClerc noted that even the new $843 million British Library does
not give the public Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The computers make an eerie impression _ like emissaries from
the future that have crashlanded in this genteel Beaux-Arts world.
Most other signs of the present are artfully hidden. The digital
call numbers that announce when books have arrived from the stacks
are encased in a bronze frame. The original pneumatic tubes still
shuttle call slips to the stacks. Cables have been deftly threaded
into table bases through holes bored up through the
two-and-a-half-foot-thick floors.
</P>
<P>
   But with 33 printers, will noise levels be as low key as the
wiring? Jean Bowen, the central library's director, is optimistic.
``That's the beauty of the new reading room,'' she said. ``If you
don't like the sound of tapping keys, there's plenty of room to
move someplace else. The last six tables at both ends of the room
don't even have plug-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   The architects favor more noise, not less. ``It shouldn't be a
quiet room,'' Davis said. ``The idea is that if there's a certain
amount of constant noise, people will accept the sound of chairs
scraping the floor. A room this size can take a lot.'' But can it
absorb the sound of the seven new copy machines sure to be in
constant use?
</P>
<P>
   While the notion of an ennobling space, classically adorned,
seems an anachronism in today's utilitarian world, the reading room
is still a rich source of inspiration for architects intent on
their own derring-do. Will Bruder, who designed the much-praised
Phoenix Central Library in Arizona _ a glass and corrugated copper
box with Teflon-coated fabric sails to shade the sun _ freely
borrowed from the New York Public Library. Not by chance did he
place his one-acre reading room at the top of the building. It was
in tribute both to the mesas of the Southwest and the unusual site
of the reading room.
</P>
<P>
   But no Gilded Age ornament for this architect. Known for his
experiments in technology-driven, environmentally oriented design,
Bruder employed computer-tracked mirror louvers and 32-foot columns
topped with circular glass to catch sunlight, turning his library
into a kind of space age Stonehenge. ``Technology has become
ornament,'' Bruder said. (The library has yet to install computers
for general use, however.)
</P>
<P>
   The architect Michael Graves, who just completed the library at
the French Institute/Alliance Francaise, has been inspired by
something more quotidian than the New York Public Library's
grandeur. ``I don't want to sound saccharine,'' he said, ``but
there's something of a domestic quality about the way the table
lights surround you so you never feel lost in a larger group. They
provide a measure of privacy, without destroying the communal
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own library projects, Graves has sought to recreate that
effect. ``It's easy to make a little room where you can squirrel
away with a book,'' Graves said. ``And it's easy to make a space
that's grand and anonymous. But to create a place that does both _
making room for the individual within the collective whole _ now
that's difficult, and really essential.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before opening day, Joan Kirwin, a staff librarian
since 1961, was methodically restacking the shelves with books. She
was almost alone in the room. Her cart squealed as she rolled it
across the floor, but she spoke softly, almost awkwardly. ``It's
never been a quiet place,'' she said. ``More like Grand Central, in
fact. I'm so looking forward to people coming back in.''

   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The first time federal prosecutors thought
they had former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards on the ropes, he
warned them not to underestimate him. Leaving a meeting with the
U.S. attorney preparing to prosecute him for allegedly taking
bribes to influence hospital licensing, Edwards turned and said:
``Remember one thing. You need 12 votes. All I need is one.'' In
the end, the charismatic, silver-haired bad boy of Bayou State
politics charmed the New Orleans jury and got 11 votes. The jury
deadlocked. At a second trial held two years later, everyone voted
to acquit him. That was more than a decade ago, but the colorful
character who combines arrogance with unstoppable charm remains a
populist hero in Louisiana even as he faces his most serious threat
yet. By BARRY SHLACHTER. Story has moved in ``a'' general news

pork and chicken _ with its favorite vegetables _ corn, beans and
cabbage. By KATHRYN HOPPER. Story has moved in ``d'' food and

   UNDATED _ Corn bread seems like such an innocent food. It's
simple to make: a little flour, a little cornmeal, an egg, milk,
baking powder and some shortening. Right? Well, there is one
important ingredient left: sugar. Now the howling begins. Corn
bread is no longer benign. I'm told there was recently a battle on
the Internet among members of a discussion group that rivaled a
Civil War skirmish. Sugar in your corn bread apparently, to some,
indicates the blood in your veins. If you like your corn bread
rough and coarse and totally unsweetened, you are, by God, Sir, a
Southerner. By ART CHAPMAN. Story has moved in ``d'' food and

`KNIGHTS AND MERCHANTS': COUNTING SWORDS WITH THE ENEMY AT THE
GATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: CD-ROM release notes are at the end of review.) 
(af) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A German company, SAP, produces the best electronic
inventory-control software in the world. Another German company,
Joymania, produces Knights and Merchants, a strategy game that
involves managing a medieval economy from the village up, fighting
off marauding armies from neighboring provinces, building roads,
maintaining efficient supply lines and maximizing serf
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have I experienced a yearning for automated
inventory-control software. But you practically need it to run this
medieval village. The depth and intricacy of economic ties in this
little burg is awe inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   You can't just generate random food units, for instance. You
must make sausages. And the sausage procurement process goes all
the way back to the wheat fields. The wheat goes to the swine
farmer, who supplies the butcher, who delivers the sausages to the
inn, where industrious laborers and artisans down them with loaves
of bread and tankards of wine.
</P>
<P>
   This entails a vineyard, a windmill and a bakery, which must be
separately constructed and staffed.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Knights and Merchants works this way. Every suit
of armor, shield, sword, pike and crossbow must be individually
ordered from the appropriate armorer or weapons workshop, which
means that the miners and metallurgists have to dig the coal, smelt
the iron and so on.
</P>
<P>
   And they can't do any of that if the woodcutter isn't doing his
job properly. Even the schoolhouse runs with clockwork precision;
everyone in this village must be properly trained, including the
serfs. Even the people who haul rocks around are certified rock
haulers, and they need to go to school for this.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the educational system is the only thing
in this game that runs on cash. All the workshops run on raw
materials. The schoolhouse eats gold bars and spits out personnel,
which is why it's important to build the metallurgy shop next door,
so the freshly smelted ingots don't have far to travel.
</P>
<P>
   As the manual notes: ``You should always have enough gold on
hand to train the people you need. Having enough personnel is a
vital factor in the smooth, organized and trouble-free running of
your whole economic system.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the schoolhouse has to go up before you can build
anything else. After that, you are required to build an inn (``the
commoners must be supplied with food'') and are strongly encouraged
to build it in the town center. The designers of this game have
very firm, well-founded ideas about urban planning, and you will
follow them. You have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the game, scrolls arrive to tell you what
you're allowed to build next. The windmill has to be fully
operational before you can construct a bakery. You can't build the
barracks until the weapons workshop is done. Planned growth: it's
the law.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when construction is proceeding apace but you're
not allowed to lay the foundations for anything else (the serfs
seem to have some kind of amazing collective-bargaining agreement).
At those times, all you can do is watch the village going about its
business: the woodcutter chopping trees, the mason hewing stone,
the baker turning out loaves of bread, the vintner stomping grapes,
and the laborers chewing their loaves and sausages at the inn.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the hammers and saws and milling and mining and
trees falling over, the sounds of peacetime productivity and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thought balloons float above the heads of these little people.
Icons _ a pickax, a knife and fork, a house _ tell you if they're
off to work, if they're hungry, if they're going home to rest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You can see the farmer walking back from the fields, thinking of
his house. You can peek into the windows of the buildings and see
tiny Z's rising from the butcher as he sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the buildings are going up, brick by brick. The
supporting beams are nailed into place. Even though they will
eventually be bricked over, you know they are underneath, and that
somehow makes the virtual buildings seem more solid.
</P>
<P>
   The scene generates an almost palpable sense of well-being.
Everyone's working. Everyone's secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These god games, where you have to build up an empire and see
all these little people running around doing things, are very
important over here,'' said Frank Michaelis, marketing director in
the German office of the game's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what people like. The No. 1 PC game right now (in
Germany) is Bundesliga Manager, which is a soccer management game.
You have to buy players, sell players. You have to set up a
training plan for them _ how much they have to do in running, how
much tackling. And you have to set up your own stadium, buy a lot
of marketing stuff, fan material like scarves or posters, build up
shops where you sell that stuff in the stadium. So everything
around soccer you have to do. But you're not playing yourself. It's
just management.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the polar opposite of an American sports game, which is
all about action, the thrill of the moment, the virtuosity of a
star athlete and the ability to be that athlete, that celebrity _
to score the goal, dunk the basket, hear the crowd go wild.
</P>
<P>
   American war games are the same. Be the pilot. Fight the Civil
War again. Take over the world. Even in a strategy game like
Command and Conquer, which superficially resembles Knights and
Merchants, every non-military activity is there to fuel the war
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to generate as many generic soldiers as possible
and send them somewhere to destroy the enemy. That is, after all,
how we fight our wars. We send some planes, pound a place with
bombs and fly home. The fighting takes place Over There, and it's a
visceral experience.
</P>
<P>
   In Knights and Merchants, fighting takes place Over Here, and
it's an economic experience. When the game opens, your village is
burning. Every building has been set on fire by a foreign army. You
have to fight off the soldiers, then put out the fires and rebuild
your village, your entire economy, from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   When you fight, the enemy is at the gates. And if you lose, the
village will be demolished. If you lose, the woodcutter is going to
die. If you lose, everything you have built will be destroyed
again. So you're fighting to keep that from happening because it's
expensive to rebuild economies. No one understands this better than
the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Their games reflect their reality, just as our games reflect
ours. Computer code may be the global language of the future. But
like all languages, it is marked by culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   We speak the language differently. That's why it's important to
see what other countries do with digital media. Not so we can
understand foreign computer games, but to understand Duke Nukem',
Total Annihilation and Warcraft _ to understand our own games, and
what makes them particularly American. &QL;

<P>
   PUBLIC-RADIO-ISAY (Undated) _ A look at David Isay and his
public radio documentaries, which appers frequently on `'All Things
Considered,'' including ``Stonewall Remembered'' and ``Ghetto Life
101.'' By Samuel G. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   DOYLE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ An interview with Christopher Doyle,
46, the Australian-born cinematographer whose collaboration with
directors like Wong Kar-Wai has won him a legion of fans in Asia
and who is working on his first American film, Gus Van Sant's
remake of ``Psycho.'' By David Hay. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   VELVET-GOLDMINE-FILM (Undated) _ Anyone who watches ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes's extravagant, silver-spangled, $7 million
valentine to glam rock, is bound to wonder if the filmmaker was
himself once a glitter-crazed teen-age rebel who hennaed his hair,
experimented with cross-dressing, and pranced around in six-inch
platform shoes. The answer is no. ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which is set
mostly in London in the early 1970s, follows the rise, fall and
mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade, a David Bowie-like
superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, bears striking
similarities to Bowie's most notorious invention, that
flame-haired, extraterrestrial androgyne Ziggy Stardust. By Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   CITY-CENTER-DANCE (New York) _ City Center used to be a place
where, as one critic complained, a cloud of dust rose when Tosca
stamped her foot. The neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street had
begun its second life in 1943 as a ``people's theater,'' where the
performing arts could be enjoyed for a mere $5.95 an orchestra
seat, a price raised only in 1968. The former Shriners' temple soon
became known as a lovably dowdy home for the arts, where
generations of audiences grew up watching all-American companies
like the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet and the Joffrey
Ballet grow with them. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-THEATER-DANCE (Undated) _ George C. Wolfe, the music
director of the Public Theater, has hired a new choreographer.
Keith Young, 45, a choreographer from Los Angeles and a total
stranger to the Great White Way. What drew Young was the chance to
work on Broadway with Wolfe, whom he considers to be the top man in
American theater. He also liked the show in current production ``On
the Town'' from 1944. By Valerie Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews Kennth
Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth''; Hilary Bell's ``Wolf Lullaby''
and John Henry Redwood's ``The Old Settler.''
</P>
<P>
   TOP-BRITISH-ACTRESS (London) _ Who is the greatest living
British actress? Maybe the question is silly, since it makes an
infinitely demanding art sound like a steeplechase for mature
fillies, and maybe it is meaningless. After all, it is not exactly
easy to measure Maggie Smith, with her droll wit and sly timing,
against Diana Rigg, who is currently giving a fierce, febrile
performance as Racine's Phedre in the West End. Or Dame Maggie
against Vanessa Redgrave, who, sadly, seldom brings that wonderful
emotional clarity of hers to the stage these days, or Dame Diana
against Helen Mirren, of whom more in a moment. But if I were to
nominate a woman for top spot at the theater's top table today, it
would be Judi Dench. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ANNA-KARENINA-THEATER (London) _ The stripped-down version of
Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' arriving on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, is a production by
Shared Experience _ another London theater company that makes
imaginative use of relatively few props. But this is no simple
exercise in minimalist theater. For more than two decades, the
touring troupe has put the actor at the center of the event,
enhanced by only as much set design as is needed to release the
affective heart of the story. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   BEL-CANTO-OPERAS (Undated) _ A new generation of bel cantists
has arrived, and some notables among them are represented in a wave
of new recordings: from RCA, Bellini's ``Capuleti e i Montecchi,''
featuring the exciting Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova
and the Italian soprano Eva Mei; from Decca/London, Rossini's
``Turco in Italia,'' with the acclaimed mezzo-soprano Cecilia
Bartoli, and from Sony, ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with the Hungarian
soprano Andrea Rost, and Charles Mackerras conducting the
period-instrument Hanover Band. The overall affinity for the style
manifested by the singers and conductors in these releases is most
striking. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BABBITT-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about music? If Milton
Babbitt were a painter, and not a composer, his work would be a
familiar part of the mental landscape. By now, at 82, he would have
had a major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Tableware
decorated with his imagery would be available at the Museum of
Modern Art gift shop. No museum would be able to consider its
collection of contemporary American art adequate if it did not own
an earlyish example of his work. If, as a composer, Babbitt has so
far failed to make it with the large public, the first performance
of his Piano Concerto No. 2, next Sunday at Carnegie Hall, may
start a turnaround. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUTATIONS-ALBUM (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Beck sees dead ends
everywhere on his new album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity and culture
are played out, love has faded away. There aren't even any new
jokes to be told. ``Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, to
harness dead horses?'' he sings. Well, for the length of the album,
it seems that Beck does. He contemplates entropy and decay with his
most lucid and unguarded songs, as he renounces his old studio
tomfoolery. Some of the songs could be about long-lost love, but
nearly all of them also read as impressions of a time when the only
certainty is a free-floating sense of loss. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   HANK-WILLIAMS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If there has been a
gravitational center to country music since World War II, Hank
Williams occupies it. As a performer he had few peers; as a
songwriter he had none.
</P>
<P>
   In the roughly six years in which he recorded commercially, he
scored a staggering number of country hits. His nasal, impassioned
vocals and cleverness as a lyricist made him one of the most
popular country music performers of his time. By Tom Piazza.

<P>
   WHITNEY-MUSEUM-MAXWELL (New York) _ Maxwell Anderson, the new
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At 42, he is poised
and polished, with slicked-back hair and a rich, gravelly voice.
His arrival at the Whitney has prompted speculation that New York's
most trendy museum has decided to atone and go conservative,
entrusting its future to a seeming traditionalist, a man who's the
grandson of the celebrated playwright Maxwell Anderson and who
received his academic training in, of all things, Greek and Roman
art. By Deborah Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   SALVADOR-DALI-ART (Restabal, Spain) _ In January 1986, Ian
Gibson received a message he had awaited for years: Salvador Dali
was ready to see him. An Irish-born author, Gibson was writing a
biography of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Andalusian poet, and Dali
had finally agreed to talk about his intimate friendship with
Garcia Lorca, forged during their school days in Madrid. Though
this was Gibson's only meeting with the artist, who died in 1989,
he went on to know him all too well. He spent six years working on
an 800-page biography, ``The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali,''
which was published here this month by Norton. By Robin Cembalest.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KIASMA-MUSEUM-ARCH (Undated) _ I recently went to Finland to see
Kiasma, Helsinki's new museum of contemporary art. The building,
which opened in May, was designed by Steven Holl, one of New York's
most gifted architects. It shouldn't be necessary for a New Yorker
to endure jet lag to check out one of his buildings. Fortunately,
Helsinki's new museum is worth the trip, in part because it is
informed by an awareness of the twists and surprises of
contemporary life, the unexpected departures from plans, the vast
tracts of unknown experience that reside even in a built-up,
shrinking world. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BECKER-TV (Undated) _ ``You know who I want to meet?'' the good
doctor asks. ``The sick, twisted little bean counter who came up
with the health maintenance organization.'' As a prickly but
secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's
John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus Welby
was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom
``Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more
and more often, on and off television. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MAORI-WARRIOR-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The near-life-size wood
carving of a Maori warrior exudes raw power. The eyes, made of
shells, gleam white with seeming rage against the tatooed face, and
the large, claw-like hands and the short, thick, muscular legs
project brute strength. The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori
chief and symbolizes the pride of a tribe. The figure originally
served as the base of the central post of a mid-19th century
meeting house on the eastern coast of New Zealand. It will be sold
at Sotheby's on Nov. 22, and the auction house expects it will
bring between $1 million and $1.5 million, 10 times what its owner
paid in 1978. By Rita Reif.

DIANA IS DEAD; LONG LIVE CAMILLA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 8.)   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prince Charles's apparent decision to help rekindle the
bitter controversy over his marriage to Princess Diana may have
stemmed from a desire to change his mother's mind about his wish to
wed his longtime lover, Camilla Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new account, British Queen Elizabeth II bears a
deep animosity to Parker Bowles going back nearly 25 years _ long
before Diana entered the picture. The monarch's antagonism dates
from her eldest son's initial liaison with Parker Bowles when he
was still a young bachelor. She was already married to an officer
in the elite Brigade of Guards, a British army unit dedicated to
service to the sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Graham Turner, writing in the London Spectator
magazine, said Elizabeth was told of the affair by senior military
officers who expressed their ``deep unhappiness'' at the betrayal
of a fellow officer by the heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Although the queen didn't directly reproach Charles, she issued
orders that Parker Bowles should never be received at Buckingham
Palace, according to Turner. From then on the queen steadfastly
refused to attend an official event if Parker Bowles was going to
be present.
</P>
<P>
   The historian claimed that the queen, like many of her subjects,
blames Parker Bowles for the breakup of her son's marriage and is
opposed to his marrying her now under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This may explain why, just when it seemed Charles was regaining
public favor, his advisers committed a monumental gaffe by
providing help to the author of a new book debunking the still
hugely popular Diana, who was killed in a car crash Aug. 31, 1997,
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Charles: Victim or Villain?'' by British journalist
Penny Junor, alleges that Diana made late-night phone calls to
Parker Bowles threatening her life. Junor also claims that Diana,
not Charles, was the first to have an adulterous affair during
their marriage and had a ``string'' of lovers while still wed.
</P>
<P>
   Junor's generally sympathetic tone toward the prince and Parker
Bowles led the couple to take the unprecedented step of issuing a
joint denial late last month that either of them had talked to the
author or had seen a draft of the work before publication.
</P>
<P>
   But the London Sunday Telegraph, which is usually a supporter of
the royal family, said last week that Charles's aides had read the
book before publication and had furnished information for it. Those
who know royal protocol said the officials in question would not
have acted without Charles's consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable that anyone connected with the palace
would have spoken (to Junor) without first clearing it with the
prince; things simply aren't done that way,'' Anthony Holden,
author of numerous royal biographies, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But technically Charles could claim that he personally had not
furnished Junor with help with her book, Holden added.
</P>
<P>
   Another biographer of the royals, Barry Lintott, said that ``the
basic purpose of Junor's account is to persuade the queen to look
on Parker Bowles in a new light and to consent to a marriage
between her and Charles. At the same time, it portrays Charles as a
more decisive character than most people think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also claims that the queen tried to play down the
official nature of Diana's funeral following her death. It says
that Charles sought from the start to make the funeral a mark of
recognition of the nation's affection for his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   The royal family was severely criticized for its initial cool
reaction to Diana's death. Popular anger shook the throne and, at
its height, appeared to threaten the British monarchy's future.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing 14 months, the royals have shown remarkable
resilience and have won back a substantial part of their lost
esteem.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a crowd-pleasing wife who invariably stole the
spotlight from him, Charles has proved to be engaging and likable,
winning more sympathetic media treatment than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as political analyst Geoffrey Wheatcroft put it: ``All he
has gained could go out the window if Junor's book convinces the
British public that he remains spiteful toward his former wife.''

APPROACHABLE WEIRDNESS MAKES `GOLDMINE' WORTH EXPLORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Velvet Goldmine,'' a drama, is rated R for strong sexual
content, nudity, language and drug use. Running time is 2 hours.
Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Todd Haynes has made festival hits like ``Poison'' and
``Safe'' that are just too weird for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Velvet Goldmine'' is weird as well, but weird in a much
more approachable _ even commercial _ manner.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes has taken his fascination with the glitter rock era of
the late '70s _ when David Bowie was metamorphosing from
dress-wearing guitar strummer to his magenta-haired, silver-suited
Ziggy Stardust persona _ and combined it with a parody of Orson
Welles' ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie of dazzling visual virtuosity, whose
rococo explosion of color and images and parodistic impulses nicely
gloss over its narrative and emotional lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Goldmine'' centers on the investigation
of a famous figure by a journalist. Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale)
was a young music fan who witnessed the onstage ``assassination''
of rock idol Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) at a London
concert. It was later asserted that the whole thing was faked to
allow the burned-out Slade to achieve anonymity. (Remember the Jim
Morrison rumors?)
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade later, Arthur is a writer for a New York magazine
and is assigned to do a big piece on Slade's fate. The journey will
inundate Arthur with memories of a time when sexual orientation and
rock 'n' roll were in transition, when hippie-grunge was fading and
gender-blending glam was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Slade's rise to rock fame is told in flashback as
Arthur looks up old acquaintances. In an AIDS hospice he finds
Slade's original agent (Michael Feast), who fills him in on the
early days, before Slade dumped him for a more ruthless manager.
</P>
<P>
   He also makes contact with the former Mrs. Slade, a broken-down
club singer (Toni Collette) who gives the lowdown on the couple's
sex-and-drugs excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The figure of Brian Slade that emerges in Rhys Meyers'
performance is that of an elusive chameleon, a talented young man
with a theatrical bent who can change personalities and sexual
orientation as quickly as he changes platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Rhys Meyers creates an eerily seductive presence _ now pouting
celeb, now musical visionary, now androgynous icon. (Look for this
young Irish actor in ``Ride With the Devil,'' filmed here last
spring.) Granted, we never get a handle on this remote, maddening
figure. But that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   A secondary figure _ but an absolutely captivating one _ is
American proto-punker Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), a self-destructive
anarchist who is adopted by Slade. Clearly based on Iggy Pop
(though McGregor looks uncannily like the late Kurt Cobain), Wild
more than lives up to his name. In one amazing concert scene he
whips the crowd into an atavistic frenzy, drops his blue jeans and
makes love to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Even though David Bowie wouldn't allow the use of his songs in
the film, Haynes has found solid substitutes, some vintage and
others newly penned for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   And if its characters and plots tend to blend together in a
now-languid, now-fiery dream of things past, the film almost always
finds the right look and the right sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rock `n' roll's a prostitute and should be tarted up,''
asserts Brian Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haynes thinks that philosophy applies to movies, too.

FILM _ AND FILMMAKER _ INSISTS `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful,'' a comedy, is rated PG-13 for
Holocaust-related thematic elements. Running time is 1 hour 54
minutes. Italian with English subtitles. Four out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way ``Life Is Beautiful'' should work.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust, after all, was no laughing matter, and the idea
of a comedy set inside a concentration camp ... well, you've got to
wonder about the sanity of anybody who would even suggest it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Life Is Beautiful'' does work _ magnificently. It's a
sublimely stirring experience that deftly mixes laughter and tears
and emerges as a triumph of the human spirit, quite unlike any
other film you can name.
</P>
<P>
   In one deft swoop, Italian funnyman Robert Begnini has
catapulted himself into the front ranks of international cinema _
not because he's an innovative cinema stylist but because he
employs heart and humor to tell a story that defies all our
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, Begnini and co-writer Vincenzo Cerami have
made two movies, one overtly comic and the other dead serious,
which bleed into each other in the most unexpected manner.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of ``Life Is Beautiful'' is set in 1939 in a
Tuscan town where Guido (Begnini) has shown up with a pal looking
for work. Guido, we immediately comprehend, is an inveterate jester
and something of a good-natured con man who loves to tweak the nose
of authority. But there's nothing mean-spirited about this beaming
clown. He simply loves life.
</P>
<P>
   Guido, a long-assimilated Jew who thinks of himself first and
foremost as an Italian, wants someday to open his own book shop.
Meanwhile, he gets a job waiting tables at a hotel under the benign
eye of his maitre d' uncle (Giustino Durano). And he quickly falls
for a pretty schoolteacher, Dora (Begnini's real-life wife,
Nicoletta Braschi).
</P>
<P>
   That Dora is engaged to a pompous right-wing official poses only
a minor obstacle to the unstoppable Guido, who cocks his hat,
cranks up the charm and simply sweeps Dora and the audience off
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fairy-tale aura of the Guido//Dora romance, we see
trouble looming. Guido's uncle has been harassed by anti-Semitic
hooligans, and when Guido matter-of-factly asks about a shop
owner's politics, the man delays answering to quiet his
caterwauling young sons: ``Benito! Adolf! Stop that!''
</P>
<P>
   The film's second half finds Guido and Dora in the fifth year of
their idyllic marriage. They have a small son, Joshua (Giorgio
Cantarini), and their own book shop. Life is, indeed, beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways a child himself, Guido tries to protect Joshua from
the growing threat to the family. When the boy asks about a shop
with a sign announcing ``No Jews or Dogs Allowed,'' Guido shrugs
and says he's thinking of putting up his own sign: ``No Spiders or
Visigoths.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon the little family finds itself in a railway cattle car
en route to a concentration camp. Suppressing his own fear and
desperation, Guido shields Joshua with a huge lie: He convinces the
boy that the camp is actually a resort where an elaborate game is
being played. The guards are referees who assign points to players
(i.e., the inmates) for following orders.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that mixes horror and hilarity, Guido volunteers as a
translator even though he doesn't speak German. While a bellicose
storm trooper barks out the camp's rules, Guido mimics his gruff
delivery, substituting for Joshua's benefit the convoluted rules of
his imaginary game (``No crying for your mother!''). The other
terrified inmates can only stare in open-mouthed confusion,
hijacked by Guido's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the film, the concentration camp sequence has a
curious dreamlike quality. There are references to gas chambers and
piles of corpses, but they're oblique, not graphic. Perhaps we're
seeing things through young Joshua's eyes, with the horrors kept
just out of sight thanks to Papa's ingenious game.
</P>
<P>
   Hilarious and heartbreaking, ``Life Is Beautiful'' finds
laughter in sadness and life in death. In an era of disposable
movies, this one will stick with you for a long, long time.

LENO, ASTRONAUTS ENGAGE IN COMIC SPARRING

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's oldest astronaut, John Glenn, and Tonight Show host
Jay Leno engaged in a little comedic sparring on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Curt Brown, the normally soft spoken commander of the
shuttle Discovery, who won the match hands down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me,''
gushed Leno, as NASA's mission control linked him from Burbank,
Calif., with Glenn, Brown and pilot Steve Lindsey, all aboard the
shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, who had previously suggested that NASA allow the elderly
Glenn to pre-board Discovery before it blasted off Oct. 29, dug
right in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Sen. Glenn keep telling you how tough it was in the old
days, how cramped it was, how small it was, how lucky you young
punks are?,'' wondered Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Jay, actually no,'' said Brown. ``He doesn't always do
that, only when he is awake.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Glenn took a solo flight in a Mercury capsule to become
the first American to orbit the Earth. He campaigned successfully
for a second mission aboard Discovery, agreeing to serve as a
subject in medical experiments assessing similarities between the
rigors of spaceflight and the natural aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Would the shuttle crew furnish his audience with a demonstration
of life in weightlessness, Leno asked. Lindsey tucked for a quick
somersault as Brown and Glenn looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty good,'' said Leno, obviously pleased. ``That's what our
band is like most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've heard them,'' quipped Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Then it dawned on Leno that with Brown, Lindsey and Glenn
speaking with him simultaneously, Discovery was on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is driving right now,'' Leno asked with mock alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Jay,'' said Brown. ``It's just like California. No
one is driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, asked Leno, what can the shuttle astronauts see of
Earth from 340 miles up _ the Great Wall of China?
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts assured the lantern-jawed comedian that when the
atmosphere is clear, they see not only the Great Wall, but
prominent rivers, the pyramids, even large airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay, every time we fly over California, we see your chin,''
said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Discovery crew spent most of Wednesday conducting
science experiments. Glenn provided the last of the blood and urine
specimens required of him while in space, for the muscle loss and
sleep experiments he is participating in.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts Steve Robinson and Scott Parazynski maneuvered
Discovery's 50-foot robot arm above the shuttle's cargo bay to
refine a new control system. The robot arm will be employed
extensively by shuttle crews in the orbital construction of the new
U.S.-led international space station. The assembly begins later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's nine-day mission is scheduled to end Saturday with a
landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predict that Tropical Storm Mitch will sweep across
the Florida peninsula well before the shuttle's scheduled return,
leaving mostly sunny skies and light winds. &QL;

OBJECTIONS TO `SIEGE' SHOULD FOCUS ON DILUTED MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Siege,'' an action melodrama, is rated R for violence,
language and brief nudity. Running time is 1 hour 53 minutes. Two
and a half out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this fall Muslim groups loudly objected upon learning
that ``The Siege'' centered on a jihad waged by Islamic terrorists
against the citizens of New York City. And who could blame them? In
recent history no other ethnic or religious minority has been so
routinely picked on by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ``The Siege'' is less interested in
vilifying its handful of Arab terrorists than in examining how the
rest of us react to their bombing campaign _ and how innocent
Arab-Americans get caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that this is basically background stuff. Mostly
``The Siege'' is about watching two beautiful actors racing around
in dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ed Zwick (``Glory,'' ``Courage Under Fire'') is out to
teach us a lesson about civil liberties, government oppression and
the dangers of prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's also making a big-budget Hollywood action film,
so expect to have the movie's good intentions considerably diluted
by the dictates of the blockbuster mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington stars as Anthony Hubbard, head of the FBI's
New York anti-terrorist team, who is faced with a mounting war of
atrocities. It begins with the hijacking and blowing up of a city
bus, then escalates with a hostage situation at a school, the
bombing of a Broadway theater filled with the city's cultural
leaders and the leveling of the federal building in which Anthony
works.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists are demanding the release of a Muslim cleric they
claim is being held in the United States. The president's security
adviser, Gen. Devereaux (Bruce Willis), denies that the U.S. has
the sheik. (We in the audience know better, having witnessed his
kidnapping at the beginning of the film.)
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Hubbard, along with CIA Islamic specialist Sharon
Bridger (Annette Bening), to find the truth. Which isn't easy,
because Sharon is one of those career spooks who hates to share
information and has her own agenda. The early dialogue between
these two characters is sharp and satisfying, filled with verbal
feints and jabs as each jockeys for superiority.
</P>
<P>
   When conventional law enforcement fails to stop the campaign of
terror, Gen. Devereaux gets the president to declare martial law
and turns Brooklyn into a police state. Civil rights are suspended.
Squads of soldiers patrol the streets. All Muslim men between the
ages of 14 and 30 are rounded up and placed in makeshift
concentration camps. And Devereaux doesn't stop there _ not when he
has torture and summary execution at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' is quite indignant, but this single-minded
didacticism has drawbacks. We never really care much about the
characters as people, despite Washington's and Bening's
considerable charisma. Zwick and co-writers Lawrence Wright and
Menno Meyjes are more concerned with making us think about abuse of
power and the evils of prejudice than in having us cozy up to their
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, `The Siege'' forcefully makes its point but only by
having Willis play a one-dimensional Curtis LeMay-type jingoist of
almost laughable simplicity. The terrorist bombers seem practically
benign compared with this right-wing martinet.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has the virtuous leading man bit down pat; Bening has
several good scenes as a duplicitous professional spy with her own
agenda. Lending strong support are Tony Shalhoub as a Lebanese-born
FBI agent who becomes a victim of Devereaux's witch hunt and Sami
Bouajila as a college teacher caught between Islamic fundamentalism
and his new life in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick's direction delivers some effective suspense and develops
an appropriately grim aura of doom, but in the final analysis ``The
Siege'' is a bit too much like a rather preachy civics lesson.

<P>
   CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   Proving his enduring popularity among Connecticut voters, Sen.
Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, won a fourth term by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Republicans hoped that the incumbent, a
close friend of President Clinton, would be hurt by the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal. But Dodd strongly criticized Clinton over his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and the Republicans' strategy lost
steam.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Republican candidate, Gary Franks, whose effort was
crippled by scandal. Franks was dogged by questions over delinquent
loans and was unable to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, a 41-year-old Republican, swept back into
office on a wave of voter enthusiasm over the state's robust
economy. His challenger, Rep. Barbara Kennelly, 62, a nine-term
congresswoman, could not match Rowland's buoyant campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland's popularity was not strong enough to help carry
Republican candidates to office in two key congressional races. A
Democrat, John Larson, a former state senator, beat a Republican
candidate, Kevin O'Connor. And a Republican challenger, Mark
Nielsen, was unable to unseat Rep. John Maloney, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   DELAWARE
</P>
<P>
   Voters gave Rep. Michael Castle, a moderate Republican with a
reputation for bipartisanship, an easy ride to a fourth term as the
holder of Delaware's at-large seat. Castle, a former two-term
governor, overwhelmed the Democratic candidate, Dennis Williams, an
aviation company accountant who mounted a similarly underfinanced
and unsuccessful effort against Castle two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other statewide races, voters showed an inclination to split
the ticket. A Republican, M. Jane Brady, won re-election as
attorney general, an office whose recent occupants have seldom
served more than one term. And another Republican, R. Thomas Wagner
Jr., was re-elected as auditor. But voters turned the longtime
state treasurer, Janet Rzewnicki, a Republican, out of office,
choosing instead her Democratic challenger, Jack Markell, a
corporate financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Williams, a Democrat and the city's former financial
control officer, outpolled the Republican nominee, Carol Schwartz,
by 2 to 1 in the race for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was little surprise in a city that is heavily
Democratic. But some residents may be surprised by the new
governing style in the mayor's office. Williams is an outsider (he
only moved to Washington three years ago) who built a reputation as
a straightforward manager. All of which contrasts sharply with the
man he is succeeding, Marion S. Barry Jr., whose larger-than-life
presence dominated the city's politics for much of two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The city's nonvoting congressional representative, Eleanor
Holmes Norton, a Democrat, was easily elected to a fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Angus S. King Jr. made history, becoming the first
independent governor in Maine's 178 years of statehood to win a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was no contest. King, a former talk show host,
benefited from the state's healthy economy and rolled over Thomas
Connolly, the Democrat, and James B. Longley Jr., the Republican.
Patricia LaMarche, the Green Party candidate, made a respectable
showing with 7 per cent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two members of the House, Thomas Allen and John
Baldacci, both Democrats, faced only token opposition.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Parris Glendening, a Democratic county executive from a suburb
of Washington, D.C., won his first term as governor four years ago,
by a mere 6,000 votes out of 1.4 million cast, and his Republican
opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, said for weeks the election had been
ston. She tried again this year, but in a good year for incumbents
in Maryland, he won again, by more than 160,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sauerbrey, seeking to become the first Republican governor
of Maryland in 30 years, emphasized her background as a former
teacher and promised to build more classrooms. Glendening's ads
attacked Mrs. Sauerbrey for her positions against abortion and gun
control, and tried to link her to polluters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, won a third
term, defeating Ross Pierpont, a retired doctor. All eight members
of the House of Representatives were re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS
</P>
<P>
   Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci, a Republican seeking a full
term in office, swept to a narrow victory over his Democratic
challenger, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger. Cellucci, a fiscal
conservative and social moderate, ran on a record of tax cuts and
budget surpluses and benefited from the state's strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   His victoryn means Republicans will continue to control a
governor's office they have held since 1990. But there was little
else they could cheer about in Massachusetts, where Democrats won
most other statewide offices and maintained their lock on the
10-member congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Voters re-elected two Democrats, Secretary of State William
Galvin and Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci, and elected Shannon O'Brien,
a Democratic former state senator, as treasurer, breaking an
eight-year Republican hold on the office. Another Democrat, Thomas
Reilly, the Middlesex County district attorney, was elected
Attorney General.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sixth District congressional race, the only one
considered competitive, John Tierney, a first-term Democrat,
soundly beat Peter Torkildsen, a Republican who had held the seat
until Tierney narrowly defeated him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By 2-1, voters approved a measure to provide public financing of
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   NEW HAMPSHIRE
</P>
<P>
   All the state's incumbents _ a Republican senator, the
Democratic governor, and both Republicans in the House _ handily
won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Judd Gregg easily beat George Condodemetraky, who did not
have nearly as much money to spend as the incumbent. Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen, the state's first female chief executive, drew heavily
from Republican and independent voters to defeat Jay Lucas, a
businessman, according to surveys of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's race featured sharp debates over taxes and
education spending. New Hampshire has no income tax and its system
of financing public schools with local property taxes has been
ruled unconstitutional.

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WIN BIG IN ELECTION
 &HT;    BY EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans beware: green is in.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message environmental groups stressed Wednesday as
they boasted the toppling of targeted ``anti-environmental''
candidates in Tuesday's midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, voters spoke loud and clear. And today, Congress is
greener,'' said Chuck McGrady, president of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   While environmental groups did not restrict their wrath to
Republicans, GOP candidates dominated the hit lists.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of several
environmental groups, spent $2.3 million trying to defeat 13
candidates, commonly referred to as ``the Dirty Dozen,'' which was
actually a baker's dozen. The campaign included more than 5,000
television spots, about 200,000 pieces of direct mail and nearly
230,000 phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of those candidates lost _ all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The League's successes include the tight North Carolina Senate
race in which GOP incumbent Sen. Lauch Faircloth was ousted by
Raleigh attorney John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Four other GOP Senate candidates on the list won't be heading to
Washington: Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash.; Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis.;
Rep. John Ensign, R-Nev.; and Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Sierra Club's 43 ``priority races'' in which it spent
$500,000 and conducted extensive get-out-the-vote campaigns, 38
races went its way. Of those, 35 of the defeated candidates were
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Those races included several tough matches such as the victory
of Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., over incumbent GOP Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign results, as well as our polling findings, prove
the power of the environment in this election,'' said Deb Callahan,
president of the League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   As another part of its campaign, the League steered $269,000 in
contributions to 10 ``EarthList'' candidates it considers
``environmental heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   All 10 were elected, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who
fended off a tough challenge from GOP candidate Matt Fong. Boxer
received $73,000 in contributions from League members.
</P>
<P>
   Of the winning ``EarthList'' candidates, eight are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to election results, environmental groups point to
recent polling data as evidence that environmental issues can be
critically important to voters even in conservative districts.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the League's polling data showed 83 percent
of voters viewed the environment as a ``very important'' or
``somewhat important'' issue affecting their voting decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In that state, pollution from animal waste runoff became a major
issue in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, a hog farmer, was portrayed as an
anti-environmentalist in large part because of a 1996 incident in
which North Carolina's water-quality division fined one of his
farms nearly $50,000 after it discharged more than 80,000 gallons
of potato sludge into a nearby river. Faircloth apologized for the
incident, which killed more than 6,000 fish.
</P>
<P>
   The Faircloth campaign responded to the attacks by pointing out
that he had used his position on the Senate Appropriations
Committee to steer millions of dollars to North Carolina
environmental causes such as funding research into the fish-killing
pfiesteria toxin and protecting coastal estuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards won the Senate seat with about 52 percent of the vote to
Faircloth's 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the importance this year of environmental issues
in North Carolina and many other states is a sign of the future
because ``environmentalism is a fundamental American value.''
</P>
<P>
   She pledged that environmental groups would continue to be
aggressive watchdogs for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped put the environment on the electoral agenda in 1998,
and we intend to keep it there in 2000,'' she said.

THINKING OUT LOUD, HOLLY HUNTER DOES SMART COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 CALVIN WILSON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud,'' a comedy, is rated R for sexuality and
language. Running time is 1 hour 40 minutes. Two and a half out of
four stars.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine ``Living Out Loud'' without Holly Hunter.
Her edgy charisma carries us through the occasionally uncertain
terrain of this ambitious and refreshingly unsentimental romantic
comedy about a woman picking up the pieces of her life.
</P>
<P>
   It's the directorial debut of screenwriter Richard LaGravenese
(``The Fisher King''), who displays a mildly experimental
sensibility. Although not all of LaGravenese's narrative ploys
work, for the most part the film is effortlessly engaging and
refreshingly free of cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of glib, sitcom-style pap (as in ``As Good as It
Gets''), LaGravenese offers a challenging, sophisticated tale of
people struggling to discover what they really want out of life.
And if that means defying 100 years of audience expectations
regarding how romantic comedies must be resolved, he's ready to
take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter plays Judith, a recent divorcee who's unsure of what to
do next. Still nursing a grudge against her ex-husband, a wealthy
doctor who has left her for a younger woman, Judith flounders. Her
nights are spent watching news programs whose bleak reports only
reinforce her sense of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Only when she meets Pat, an elevator operator (Danny DeVito),
and Liz, a club singer (Queen Latifah), does Judith begin to regain
her balance.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese tells this small, character-based story with
confidence and wit. Some of his forays into the surreal may remind
you of the later films of Woody Allen, while his exploration of
Pat's working-class milieu recalls the kitchen-sink drama of Paddy
Chayefsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and DeVito are deeply affecting as two people testing
each other and trying to see if they can work something out.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Hunter has the range to make us care about
a character who is, at times, flat-out unlikable. In bravely giving
us a woman of warts as well as smarts, Hunter ratchets up our
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation here is DeVito, who eschews his usual shtick
to make Pat the sort of Everyman you don't see every day. His
performance is so natural and convincing that all memories of Louie
DiPalma (his character on the television series ``Taxi'')
evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Latifah, whose acting range was already obvious in the
underrated film ``Set It Off,'' reveals formidable jazz chops as
Liz, whose stoic acceptance of life's vicissitudes is an
inspiration for Judith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' isn't perfect. But at a time when some
movies settle for dogs jumping out of windows and dubious hair gel
to keep the masses laughing, it's that increasingly rare thing: a
smart comedy.

   NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats won control of New Jersey's House delegation with
the defeat _ for a time, wrongly called _ of first-term Rep.
Michael Pappas. Pappas, a conservative 12th District Republican,
was unable to fend off a challenge by Rush Holt, a physicist who
got contributions from 16 Nobel Prize winners and strong financial
support from the Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it was a night for incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pallone Jr., the four-term Democrat from the Sixth
District, was re-elected despite having been battered by attack
advertisements run by his well-financed Republican opponent,
Michael Ferguson, a 28-year-old political science professor. A
Green Party candidate, Carl Mayer, who used his own money to
finance his campaign, had also been expected to take votes away
from Pallone.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Rothman, a Democrat from the Ninth District, defeated
Steve Lonegan, who received the support of prominent Republicans
like Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Another freshman, William Pascrell Jr., a Democrat from the
Eighth District, defeated Matthew Kirnan, the mayor of Verona.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers said 18 years was enough for Alfonse M. D'Amato, as
they handed Rep. Charles Schumer a decisive victory in the Senate
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But, in one of the year's keenest political paradoxes, the
voters also gave D'Amato's protege, Gov. George Pataki, a healthy
margin in his re-election contest. The governor's supporters said
his resounding victory made it clear that Pataki was presidential
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer had a large war chest and seemed to capitalize easily on
D'Amato's errors, like his use of a Yiddish vulgarism to refer to
Schumer.

<P>
   But the Democratic candidate for governor, Peter Vallone, never
seemed able to draw Pataki into the contest. When Vallone, the New
York City Council Speaker, was injured slightly in an automobile
accident during the final days of the campaign, the incident seemed
to underscore how arduous a task he had taken on in challenging
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, the race for attorney general is little more than
a footnote. But this year's contentious campaign became one of the
state's most watched as the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco,
battled Eliot Spitzer, the son of a wealthy real estate developer,
who had the money to conduct an aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The election-night vote count left Vacco and Spitzer so close
that the race is likely to be decided only by paper ballots that
could take days to count.
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA
</P>
<P>
   Incumbency and Republicanism ruled the day as Gov. Tom Ridge,
Sen. Arlen Specter, and virtually every sitting House member won.
Republicans prevailed, however, in the race for the two open House
seats. Don Sherwood, a wealthy car dealer narrowly defeated Patrick
Casey, the son of former Democratic Gov. Robert Casey in the 10th
District and Pat Toomey, the owner of a sports bar and a
Republican, beat State Sen. Roy Afflerbach for the seat being
vacated by Rep. Paul McHale.
</P>
<P>
   McHale gained notoriety when he became the first Democratic
House member to condemn the president after Clinton admitted having
an ``inappropriate'' relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The one looming exception to these trends was the race in the
13th District. There, Joseph M. Hoeffel 3rd, a Democrat decisively
defeated Rep. John Fox. Fox was the only incumbent House member in
the state to lose. ``The people of the 13th Congressional District
have spoken,'' Hoeffel told his supporters Tuesday night, ``and I
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel was an exception in other ways. he was one of the few
Democrats around the counrty to try to distance himself from the
president. But, after he won, Hoeffel attributed his victory to
voter disgust with Republican efforts to remove Clinton. `I think
there was a backlash to the Republican treatment of the president,`
he said.
</P>
<P>
   RHODE ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lincoln Almond, the Republican incumbent, beat Myrth York,
the challenger, in a civil, almost boring, rematch that lacked any
galvanizing issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 election, when the big issue was gambling _ Almond
was adamantly opposed, Ms. York less so _ he won 47 percent of the
vote and she got 44 percent. The rest went to the Cool Moose Party
candidate, Robert Healey Jr., who was back for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the race was not quite as tight between Almond and
Ms. York. Almond, who lacks natural political ease, ran on his
success in bolstering what had been a weak state economy, and
portrayed Ms. York, a former state senator, as too liberal. Ms.
York argued that the economy could, and should, be much better.
</P>
<P>
   VERMONT
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, won election to a fifth term
with almost three-quarters of the vote. Leahy, an outspoken
advocate of civil liberties and farm and nutrition programs, did
not face a serious challenge. His Republican opponent, Fred Tuttle,
a 79-year-old retired dairy farmer who received the nomination
after he was featured in a political spoof film, spoke well of
Leahy and said he did not really want to go to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Dean, who has been governor since 1991, won another
two-year term by defeating the Republican candidate, Ruth Dwyer, a
member of the state House. Dean, who has long been popular among
Democrats, was also endorsed this year by some moderate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   . Dean, a doctor, is a former chairman of the National
Governors' Association. He combined moderate fiscal policies with
liberal positions on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Sanders, an independent, won his bid for a fifth term in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEST VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia confirmed its status was a ``yellow dog'' Democrat
state, re-electing three Democratic incumbents who faced either
token or no Republican opposition. Rep. Alan Mollohan and Nick Joe
Rahall, easily beat Libertarian candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Wise, an eight-term incumbent, was one to draw a
Republican challenger.The Republican, Sally Anne Kay, did not raise
any money, broadcast any commercials or show up for scheduled
debates with Wise. Still she garnered 21 per cent of the vote, to
Wise's 73 per cent. Joe Whelan, the Libertarian, came in third with
14 per cent of the vote.

WITH THE GREAT SURPLUS DECEPTION, VOTERS HAVE BEEN HAD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The unfortunate aspect of the first federal budget
surplus since 1969 is that it has become most significant as an
instrument of deception for duplicitous politicians.
</P>
<P>
   When Uncle Sam closed his books on fiscal 1998, the final
accounting showed income exceeding outgo by $70 billion. It was the
largest surplus ever in dollar terms and the biggest, relative to
the size of the economy, since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, however, the national debt was a mere $272.6 billion.
At the end of fiscal '98, total federal indebtedness totaled $5.4
trillion. Moreover, the much-heralded fiscal 1998 surplus was a
surplus only because of the magic of government accounting
practices. The national debt actually grew by $112 billion during
this year of ``surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the surplus actually derived from excess Social
Security receipts and unspent revenue from tax collections
dedicated to other specific activities such as highway
construction, air transportation improvements and unemployment
insurance coverage. These revenues were spent on general budget
outlays, and the respective trust funds were credited with a
nonmarketable Treasury security _ an IOU representing a claim on
the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all the fiscal legerdemain, though, and try to pretend
that the surplus is real. Then ask yourself a question: Has this
grand achievement improved the quality of life for most Americans?
Has it been transformed by political leaders into a symbolic source
of pride for the citizenry?
</P>
<P>
   No, and no. Early in this decade, annual budget deficits were
climbing toward $300 billion and most Americans believed these
tidal waves of red ink were the greatest single threat to the
national welfare. The implication of this view was that American
life would be substantially better if Washington could rein in the
chronic deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit monster has been slain, ostensibly at least, but
life goes on pretty much as usual. America is easily the most
prosperous country in the world, but the sense persists in
working-class circles that average folk aren't participating fully
in this prosperity. Americans paid about 10 percent more in taxes
to Uncle Sam this fiscal year than they did the year before, but
what did this added tribute buy?
</P>
<P>
   Congress decided against sharing its surplus-year windfall with
the taxpayers who made it possible. Meanwhile, many lawmakers
defended their parsimonious ways with the specious claim that the
budget surplus could be used to ``save'' Social Security. This
cynical scam is easy to work, because most Americans don't
understand federal finance well enough to see it for what it is.
</P>
<P>
   As duplicity goes, though, it's genius. The budget surplus was
made possible by expropriating and spending excess Social Security
tax revenues. It's then claimed that Social Security's future
viability is enhanced by plowing the budget surplus back into the
Social Security trust fund from which it was taken in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nobody bothers to point out that the federal
government cannot ``save'' money. It can pay down debt or it can
spend available revenues. Since the debt grew, the surplus
obviously didn't help there. And when the final phase of budget
negotiations occurred, much of the surplus that really didn't exist
in the first place was appropriated to finance election year pork.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans, however, understood any of this when they went to
the polls Tuesday.

TEEN ACTOR COMES OUT OF NOWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES LOS ANGELES _ He's a nice boy, really. Wouldn't
hassle a weak old man. Wouldn't run a concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Brad Renfro, a 16-year-old Tennessean who has been
impressing ever since he was picked out of nowhere to play the
title role in ``The Client,'' is unnervingly convincing in ``Apt
Pupil.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Stephen King adaptation, Renfro plays Todd Bowden, a
suburban Southern California kid who discovers a Nazi war criminal
(played by Ian McKellen) hiding out in his neighborhood. Rather
than call Simon Wiesenthal, Todd browbeats the old monster into
sharing the grotesque details of his Holocaust duties.
</P>
<P>
   Todd, obviously, is a proto-fascist waiting to happen. When the
old man tries to gain advantage over his young master, it triggers
a tricky, escalating war of nerves. Todd soon proves he has the
ruthlessness that would have gotten him very far in the Third
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Or Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no moralistic point here,'' observes Renfro,
sporting a wispy adolescent goatee and cordial Knoxville drawl.
``It's a very character-driven movie, not a plot-driven one. It's
about power and control with this kid. The hard part about it was I
had to believe it, so you'd believe it _ and I'm not that evil!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I auditioned many, many, many young actors, and Brad was the
brightest, the most intense and the most real,'' says ``Pupil''
(and ``The Usual Suspects'') director Bryan Singer. ``Not only
could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness
that he could convey, and by the end of the picture he had to
become this empty vessel.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro doesn't just play a quick study. He is one. A poet and
blues guitarist as well as an actor, he's already developed the
attitude of a serious artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was going on (while making) `The Client'; I
was just being myself,'' says Renfro, who was picked out of a
school anti-drug play for the demanding role. ``Everybody said,
`Wow, great job!' and all that, but I wasn't sure if I could really
be an actor. So that's why I've waited for roles that were really
different. Something in me just said that I want respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Renfro catches on fast in other life lessons, too. Busted in
June for possession of marijuana and cocaine, he's now making the
most of a rehab program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I got arrested _ it was a hard-core learning
experience,'' he says. ``I'm getting my stuff together at 16 years
old. I've got four months sober, which is the first baby step, but
I want to keep going. I don't aspire to be Jim Morrison anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he aspire to conventional fame. Renfro still lives with
his grandmother in Knoxville, which he says helps keep him grounded
in reality. And even though he disdains the whole teen idol thing,
he's grown a mature attitude about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' he says, shrugging
good-naturedly. ``When I was younger, I wanted to sue the Teen
Beats and magazines like that. Now, I've learned, if someone snaps
a picture of me, that photographer would be dumb not to get a
couple of meals out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even kind to paparazzi. Like we said, a nice boy. Really.

BLACK PILOTS COMMEMORATE 1933 TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAI HUYNH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1933, two pilots broke through aviation's color barrier by
becoming the first black men to make a round-trip transcontinental
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Albert E. Forsythe and Charles Alfred ``Chief''
Anderson became role models for generations of aspiring black
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, they felt blacks didn't have the IQ to handle a
plane,'' said Houston businessman Danny R. Perkins, who will take
part in a relay-style re-enactment of the Forsythe-Anderson flight.
``Their contributions opened doors for blacks all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins and fellow pilot Fred Lewis will pay homage to the
aviation pioneers by participating in the Black Pilots of America's
nationwide re-enactment of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The first pilots in the re-enactment left Atlantic City
Wednesday. Perkins and Lewis, an educator, will fly their
one-engine Piper Archer plane from Hobby Airport to Amarillo
Thursday to start their leg of the trip, which will take them to
Albuquerque, N.M., and Winslow, Ariz. The commemorative flight will
continue with other pilots flying on to Glendale, Calif., and then
back to Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has spent nearly a year preparing for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a part of this from the beginning. I'm ecstatic
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Perkins and Lewis are members of the Bronze Eagles of
Texas, an organization that annually sponsors aviation programs for
Houston inner-city youths. The group is affiliated with the Black
Pilots of America. &QL;

LORDS IN LONDON HEAR APPEAL ON PINOCHET IMMUNITY DECISION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ England's highest court was asked Wednesday to overrule
a decision that granted Augusto Pinochet immunity from prosecution
for ``savage and barbarous crimes'' in the 17 years that he ruled
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Spanish authorities, who have brought the
charges against the 82-year-old former dictator, argued that it was
a ``repugnant notion, offensive to all notions of human rights'' to
categorize crimes like genocide and torture as ones committed ``in
the course of official functions as head of state.''
</P>
<P>
   The High Court in London ruled last week that Pinochet's status
as a ``former sovereign'' entitled him to immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the argument of the Spanish authorities that the savage
and barbarous crimes committed in Chile and the territories of
other states, including the U.S.A., Spain and Italy, are not within
the functions of a head of state in English law, the law of nations
or the law of Chile,'' said Alun Jones, the Crown Prosecution
Service lawyer who represents the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Jones questioned whether the general had even been head of state
in the months after he had deposed President Salvador Allende
Gossens and led a military junta. The distinction is important,
Jones said, because 28 people were ``kidnapped, tortured and
executed'' on the first day of the coup. The Spanish charges say at
least 3,178 people were murdered or ``disappeared'' while Pinochet
ruled Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Clive Nicholls, representing Pinochet, rejected that, saying,
``There's no suggestion that anyone else was head of state at this
time.'' Nicholls also protested admitting new evidence from Spain
on the grounds that it did not figure in the High Court decision
under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-page document from the authorities in Madrid details ``a
most ferocious oppression'' and a systematic criminal plot to
eliminate ideological enemies of many nationalities in the Pinochet
years, from 1973 to 1990. The judges said they would consider the
new material and rule later on its admissibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was detained on Oct. 16 in a surprise arrest here on a
request from Baltasar Garzon, a Spanish magistrate who is
investigating atrocities in the ``dirty wars'' in Latin America in
the 1970s and 80s. The general is under police guard at a hospital
North London, recovering from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people, including supporters and Chilean exiles and
relatives of those who ``disappeared,'' crowded into an ornate
committee room of the House of Lords for the first of two days of
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Among those watching were Isabel Allende, daughter of the former
president, who died in the overthrow of his government; Juan Pablo
Letelier, whose father, Orlando Letelier, Defense Minister before
the coup, was murdered in 1976 in Washington in a car-bomb attack;
and Joyce Horman, whose husband, Charles, was taken into custody in
Chile and never seen again, inspiring the film ``Missing,'' which
starred Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords, the upper house of Parliament, is the ultimate court
of appeal for England and Wales, and Wednesday's case was heard by
five of the 12 Lords of Appeal, senior judges who are also life
peers.
</P>
<P>
   They are apparently hoping to decide the appeal this week, and
if they rule in Pinochet's favor he could depart at once. Separate
moves by Chilean exiles in Europe and other European governments
seeking his extradition to Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Sweden or Switzerland would most likely fail.

 &HT;    Fortune puts stock behind small caps
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stocks of smaller companies, which have miserably
underperformed the larger blue chips for more than a year, are
booming and Fortune (Nov. 23) says there's reason to think that
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities analyst Claudia Mott told the magazine
``for the first time in years you can actually create a positive
case for small caps.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason has been the dissipation of ``blind faith'' in the
biggest and best names.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, now convinced the era of double-digit returns is
over, are looking for values elsewhere and finding them in
small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's interest rate cuts also helps smaller stocks. Rate
cuts tend to come at the bottom of an economic cycle. Small-cap
stocks perform well in an economy coming off a bottom, Fortune
says.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based ASA Holdings, parent of Atlantic Southeast
Airlines, was cited by Fortune as the kind of small-cap stock
attracting mutual fund managers' attention.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also looks at the strategy of Atlanta-based home
improvement retailer Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's next boss
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy is about the size of Denmark's, but it would be
a mistake to take its internal problems lightly, Forbes (Nov. 16)
says in a cover story on ``the next ruler of Russia.'' After all,
it was Russia's currency devaluation and debt default that
triggered the U.S. stock market sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes says the contest to succeed Boris Yeltsin is between a
``slick city boss'' _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov _ and a
``rough-edged populist general'' _ Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vast, potentially rich country with a talented
population awaiting future leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   Ticker (November) says investors looking for safety in a
volatile stock market should consider industries that create profit
growth regardless of the economy. The magazine suggests drug
companies, supermarket chains, phone companies, utilities and
banks. Smart Money (November) says it's not too soon to start
thinking of the January effect _ the annual first-of-the-year surge
in stock prices resulting from tax loss trading: selling
money-losing stocks to gain deductions against income on next
year's tax return. Finding losers should not be hard this year, the
magazine points out.

   DOYLE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ An interview with Christopher Doyle,
46, the Australian-born cinematographer whose collaboration with
directors like Wong Kar-Wai has won him a legion of fans in Asia
and who is working on his first American film, Gus Van Sant's
remake of ``Psycho.'' By David Hay. (Moved). Photo.

   VELVET-GOLDMINE-FILM (Undated) _ Anyone who watches ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes's extravagant, silver-spangled, $7 million
valentine to glam rock, is bound to wonder if the filmmaker was
himself once a glitter-crazed teen-age rebel who hennaed his hair,
experimented with cross-dressing, and pranced around in six-inch
platform shoes. The answer is no. ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which is set
mostly in London in the early 1970s, follows the rise, fall and
mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade, a David Bowie-like
superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, bears striking
similarities to Bowie's most notorious invention, that
flame-haired, extraterrestrial androgyne Ziggy Stardust. By Stephen
Holden. (Moved). Photo.

   CITY-CENTER-DANCE (New York) _ City Center used to be a place
where, as one critic complained, a cloud of dust rose when Tosca
stamped her foot. The neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street had
begun its second life in 1943 as a ``people's theater,'' where the
performing arts could be enjoyed for a mere $5.95 an orchestra
seat, a price raised only in 1968. The former Shriners' temple soon
became known as a lovably dowdy home for the arts, where
generations of audiences grew up watching all-American companies
like the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet and the Joffrey
Ballet grow with them. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). Photo.

   PUBLIC-THEATER-DANCE (Undated) _ George C. Wolfe, the music
director of the Public Theater, has hired a new choreographer.
Keith Young, 45, a choreographer from Los Angeles and a total
stranger to the Great White Way. What drew Young was the chance to
work on Broadway with Wolfe, whom he considers to be the top man in
American theater. He also liked the show in current production ``On
the Town'' from 1944. By Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). Photo.

   TOP-BRITISH-ACTRESS (London) _ Who is the greatest living
British actress? Maybe the question is silly, since it makes an
infinitely demanding art sound like a steeplechase for mature
fillies, and maybe it is meaningless. After all, it is not exactly
easy to measure Maggie Smith, with her droll wit and sly timing,
against Diana Rigg, who is currently giving a fierce, febrile
performance as Racine's Phedre in the West End. Or Dame Maggie
against Vanessa Redgrave, who, sadly, seldom brings that wonderful
emotional clarity of hers to the stage these days, or Dame Diana
against Helen Mirren, of whom more in a moment. But if I were to
nominate a woman for top spot at the theater's top table today, it
would be Judi Dench. By Benedict Nightingale. (Moved).

   ANNA-KARENINA-THEATER (London) _ The stripped-down version of
Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' arriving on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, is a production by
Shared Experience _ another London theater company that makes
imaginative use of relatively few props. But this is no simple
exercise in minimalist theater. For more than two decades, the
touring troupe has put the actor at the center of the event,
enhanced by only as much set design as is needed to release the
affective heart of the story. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.

   BEL-CANTO-OPERAS (Undated) _ A new generation of bel cantists

of new recordings: from RCA, Bellini's ``Capuleti e i Montecchi,''
featuring the exciting Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova
and the Italian soprano Eva Mei; from Decca/London, Rossini's
``Turco in Italia,'' with the acclaimed mezzo-soprano Cecilia
Bartoli, and from Sony, ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with the Hungarian
soprano Andrea Rost, and Charles Mackerras conducting the
period-instrument Hanover Band. The overall affinity for the style
manifested by the singers and conductors in these releases is most
striking. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).

<P>
   BABBITT-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about music? If Milton
Babbitt were a painter, and not a composer, his work would be a
familiar part of the mental landscape. By now, at 82, he would have
had a major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Tableware
decorated with his imagery would be available at the Museum of
Modern Art gift shop. No museum would be able to consider its
collection of contemporary American art adequate if it did not own
an earlyish example of his work. If, as a composer, Babbitt has so
far failed to make it with the large public, the first performance
of his Piano Concerto No. 2, next Sunday at Carnegie Hall, may
start a turnaround. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   MUTATIONS-ALBUM (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Beck sees dead ends
everywhere on his new album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity and culture
are played out, love has faded away. There aren't even any new
jokes to be told. ``Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, to
harness dead horses?'' he sings. Well, for the length of the album,
it seems that Beck does. He contemplates entropy and decay with his
most lucid and unguarded songs, as he renounces his old studio
tomfoolery. Some of the songs could be about long-lost love, but
nearly all of them also read as impressions of a time when the only
certainty is a free-floating sense of loss. By Jon Pareles.

<P>
   HANK-WILLIAMS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If there has been a
gravitational center to country music since World War II, Hank
Williams occupies it. As a performer he had few peers; as a
songwriter he had none. In the roughly six years in which he
recorded commercially, he scored a staggering number of country
hits. His nasal, impassioned vocals and cleverness as a lyricist
made him one of the most popular country music performers of his
time. To commemorate his 75th birthday comes ``The Complete Hank
Williams'' (Mercury 314 536 077-2), in which the long procession of
boxed sets that have sprouted in the wake of the compact disk
explosion reaches something of an apotheosis. About the size and
weight of a small tombstone, the 10-disk set contains all of
Williams's commercial recordings, and many _ but not, despite the
title, all _ of his broadcast and demo recordings. By Tom Piazza.

   WHITNEY-MUSEUM-MAXWELL (New York) _ Maxwell Anderson, the new
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At 42, he is poised
and polished, with slicked-back hair and a rich, gravelly voice.
His arrival at the Whitney has prompted speculation that New York's
most trendy museum has decided to atone and go conservative,
entrusting its future to a seeming traditionalist, a man who's the
grandson of the celebrated playwright Maxwell Anderson and who
received his academic training in, of all things, Greek and Roman
art. By Deborah Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   SALVADOR-DALI-ART (Restabal, Spain) _ In January 1986, Ian
Gibson received a message he had awaited for years: Salvador Dali
was ready to see him. An Irish-born author, Gibson was writing a
biography of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Andalusian poet, and Dali
had finally agreed to talk about his intimate friendship with
Garcia Lorca, forged during their school days in Madrid. Though
this was Gibson's only meeting with the artist, who died in 1989,
he went on to know him all too well. He spent six years working on
an 800-page biography, ``The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali,''
which was published here this month by Norton. By Robin Cembalest.

   KIASMA-MUSEUM-ARCH (Undated) _ I recently went to Finland to see
Kiasma, Helsinki's new museum of contemporary art. The building,
which opened in May, was designed by Steven Holl, one of New York's
most gifted architects. It shouldn't be necessary for a New Yorker
to endure jet lag to check out one of his buildings. Fortunately,
Helsinki's new museum is worth the trip, in part because it is
informed by an awareness of the twists and surprises of
contemporary life, the unexpected departures from plans, the vast
tracts of unknown experience that reside even in a built-up,
shrinking world. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

   BECKER-TV (Undated) _ ``You know who I want to meet?'' the good
doctor asks. ``The sick, twisted little bean counter who came up
with the health maintenance organization.'' As a prickly but
secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's
John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus Welby
was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom
``Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more
and more often, on and off television. By Caryn James. (Moved).

   MAORI-WARRIOR-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The near-life-size wood
carving of a Maori warrior exudes raw power. The eyes, made of
shells, gleam white with seeming rage against the tatooed face, and
the large, claw-like hands and the short, thick, muscular legs
project brute strength. The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori
chief and symbolizes the pride of a tribe. The figure originally
served as the base of the central post of a mid-19th century
meeting house on the eastern coast of New Zealand. It will be sold
at Sotheby's on Nov. 22, and the auction house expects it will
bring between $1 million and $1.5 million, 10 times what its owner
paid in 1978. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

<P>
   Two young lovers head out to look at the stars. They have all
the proper amenities: a blanket, a bottle of wine, crystal glasses
_ and a hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, a gadget called the Night Navigator ($130), is
designed to make it easier to discern stars, constellations and
planets in the night sky. Users enter their location and the time
and date, then select the constellation they want to identify.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator, which has a built-in magnetic compass, will tell
them where to look. ``You can program `Cancer,' '' said Shane
Samole, president of Excalibur Electronics, which manufactures the
device, ``and the computer, like a divining rod looking for water,
will say `turn, turn, turn and stop. You're looking at Cancer.' ''
The Navigator will also identify nearby heavenly bodies and
highlight them on a small LCD screen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If You Can Spell Subpoena, You Can Play the Game
</P>
<P>
   Name calling, duplicitous strategizing, coercing family and
friends. It's the kind of all-American fun that is sweeping
Washington, and now just about anyone with a modem can join in.
</P>
<P>
   A new online game, Capitol Affair (www.2am.com), gives Netizens
a chance to join in the power grab without having achieved any of
the usual prerequisites, like running for office, owning a
newspaper or appearing on ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, which went online on Nov. 3, lets players identify
with one of five entities: the president, the Republicans, the
Democrats, the CIA and the media. The object is to lock up
territory on a virtual board by convincing the other players to
agree to terms or by creating coalitions with them _ and then
turning on them.
</P>
<P>
   Each player defines winning in terms of his identity: the
president wants to stave off impeachment, the Republicans want to
jettison him, the CIA is seeking secret control of the government,
and the media wants the most turbulent story possible.
</P>
<P>
   The free game, which is supported by advertising, is played
entirely in cyberspace, with players dialing in and communicating
in real-time chat rooms. ``It's an Internet comment by Americans on
the Washington scene,'' said Eli Ehrman, president of 2 AM, the
game's creator. ``There are no serious statements being made
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds as if the game may imitate Washington pretty accurately. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Online Shoppers' Attitudes: A Case of Bahhumbug.com?
</P>
<P>
   Online shoppers evidently haven't grasped the concept that it is
better to give than to receive.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by Jupiter Communications, a market research
company in New York City, projects that online shopping will hit
$2.3 billion during this holiday season, up from $1.1 billion a
year ago. However, the survey also finds that only 16 percent of
the purchases will be gifts; the majority will be for the shoppers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the holiday spirit? Has the Net turned
otherwise nurturing souls into self-gratifying surfers? According
to Jupiter, there is a ``large source of untapped revenue'' for
companies that can persuade online shoppers not just to purchase
for themselves, but to take a chance on a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent Jupiter survey indicates that retailers can fuel
the growth of electronic commerce simply by offering lower prices
or very attractive specials.
</P>
<P>
   It seems obvious, but therein lies a noteworthy change in the
thinking of prospective online shoppers, said Nicole Vanderbilt,
director of the digital commerce practice for Jupiter. She said
that, not long ago, the biggest hindrance to online shopping was
the fear that transactions would not be secure; now, she said, a
greater obstacle appears to be that people are not finding the
bargains they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``This marks the next phase of consumer adoption of the online
channel,'' Ms. Vanderbilt said. ``If we did this survey two years
ago, the focus would've been on security. Now it's on incentive.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get It Wholesale on the Net: A Web Site for Coupon Clippers
</P>
<P>
   Note to fans of the coupon: it's time to fire up the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Val Pak Direct Marketing Systems, one of the nation's largest
distributors of coupons, whose familiar fat blue envelopes
periodically arrive in mailboxes nationwide, has gone digital. The
Largo, Fla., company has started an ambitious site to put thousands
of coupons on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site (www.valpak.com) can type in their zip
codes and the types of businesses they're interested in, and Val
Pak will spit out a list of related coupons in their geographic
areas. Then the coupon surfers can print out the coupons _ as many
of each as they please.
</P>
<P>
   Val Pak, which circulates 12 billion coupons a year the
old-fashioned way, is a bit late in arriving online. It joins a
growing number of services and individual merchants already
offering coupons on the Internet, and analysts project explosive
growth for the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Leiser, the vice president for Internet technology services
for Val Pak, said one reason the company took its time in going
online was to make sure that it had a critical mass of
participating advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the site now has 30,000 coupons from some 22,000
advertisers, including national chains and numerous mom-and-pop
operations in local communities, Leiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Some hesitation on the digital front isn't surprising, given
that coupon clippers can print unlimited supplies of digitally
delivered discounts. But Leiser said that tests of the concept
showed few, if any, people engaging in rampant redeeming.
</P>
<P>
   Leiser said businesses are careful not to offer certain types of
coupons online, like ``buy one hamburger, get one free'' offers
that can be gobbled up in big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the result of the online coupons, Val Pak will not stop
sending the familiar blue envelopes via snail mail. ``We have no
plans to cut back or change that,'' Leiser said. &QL;

   This Might be What You Need for Those Papers, Mr. Bond
</P>
<P>
   The latest innovation from the Hewlett-Packard Co. should come
with a disclaimer that it is not necessary to be an international
spy to use this product.
</P>
<P>
   The gadget, called the Capshare 910, is a hand-held digital
scanner that can capture and store an image, text or data when it
is swept over it. The information can then be observed on a small
LCD screen on the front of the device, or sent by cable to an
e-mail address or a hard drive, or delivered via infrared signal to
a printer.
</P>
<P>
   The $699 Capshare has the look and feel of something cooked up
by James Bond (or Julia Child, as it is the size and shape of a
sandwich). Alas, Hewlett-Packard insists that the target markets
are everyday consumers and some business users, who want a simple
way to capture and store information while they are ``on the go,''
said Irv Christy, a program manager for Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for college students or active learners, people doing
things away from house or office,'' he said. ``We found that those
people need to have an easy way to collect information.'' &QL;

   Can't Program that VCR? Just Click for Help
</P>
<P>
   If a New Jersey Internet company has its way, the telephone will
no longer be the only means for seeking assistance from
corporations' technical support or customer service lines.
</P>
<P>
   IDT Corp. is marketing a new service called Click2Talk that uses
the Web to dial into various companies' telephone banks. To place
the call, a user merely clicks on a Click2Talk icon on a company
Web site: the call is placed over Internet lines while, at the
other end, a service or support employee receives the call as if it
were placed via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The caller then conducts the question-and-answer session by
speaking into the PC microphone and listening to the computer's
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 70 companies have signed up with Click2Talk, including
1-800-Flowers and some Sheraton Hotels, according to Yonah Lloyd,
director of the Click2Talk business at IDT.
</P>
<P>
   But what was wrong with using a telephone in the first place?
Besides, isn't it tough enough to get technical support without
having to rely on a computer and an Internet connection _ which
seems more fragile than reliable old Ma Bell?
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said the service offers several advantages, notably that
it eliminates long-distance tolls, enabling callers to make contact
from anywhere in the word. ``We're trying to educate people that
they can universalize and globalize their business at no cost,'' he
said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where Are You?
</P>
<P>
   Police-scanner fans who are bored with the local airwaves can
now go online to hear police palaver from other cities.
Broadcast.com offers live feeds of scanners from New York, Los
Angeles and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, the company's president and chief executive, reports
an average of 15,000 to 20,000 daily hits on the scanner sites,
some from other police. ``There is a great camaraderie between
police departments,'' he said. ``They love listening to other
departments' scanners.''

ANALYSIS: WITH VOTERS SETTING PACE, POLITICIANS START RUNNING FOR
2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP) 
(htv) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday, like it or
not. The millennial election will be fought on a political playing
field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn
by the voters in Tuesday's elections, which delivered a crushing
disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an
unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called it an ``astonishing'' triumph of issues
over investigations and said the Democrats had won so many major
victories ``because they had a clear message.'' Republicans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the next 18 months will bring many surprises and many
reversals of fortune. But the election results offered important
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a great day for Vice President Al Gore, for at least
three reasons. He worked furiously and successfully in the last ten
days before the balloting to persuade Democratic loyalists not to
stay home and sulk, appearing on behalf of no fewer than 224
candidates, according to his office. A moderate within the spectrum
of his own party, he watched moderates win crucial elections,
notably in the California gubernatorial race, where Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, a cautious pragmatist like Gore, won a smashing victory.
</P>
<P>
   The returns _ an even break in the Senate and a Democratic gain
of five in the House of Representatives _ also made the impeachment
of President Clinton less likely. And the better shape Clinton is
in as his term ends, the better chance Gore, his sidekick for six
years now, stands in the presidential nomination process and,
ultimately, the election.
</P>
<P>
   But California voters also complicated the nominating process
and set Gore strategists to work on tactics to uncomplicate it,
because he and they consider the state absolutely central to his
presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   In a referendum in 1996, California adopted a primary system
under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would all
receive the same ballot, with candidates of all parties listed.
That violates the rules of both major parties, and a measure on the
ballot Tuesday, Proposition 3, would have rescinded the 1996
change. But it failed, raising the possibility that California's
March 7 primary will be a mere political popularity poll, with
convention delegates chosen in caucus or convention _ a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a bad day for the Republican right. High-profile
right-wingers lost across the country, from Attorney General Dan
Lungren in the California governor's race to Sen. Lauch Faircloth,
denied re-election in North Carolina, to Rep. Mark Neumann of
Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate race despite a huge spending
advantage over Sen. Russell Feingold, to Ellen Sauerbrey in
Maryland, who proved unable on her second try to prevail over an
unpopular Democratic governor, Parris Glendening.
</P>
<P>
   Both conservatives and moderates in the party said the
Republicans had to get back to basics. Even Speaker Newt Gingrich
conceded that the results ``should sober every Republican'' and
called for new strategic thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 per cent
approval rating, as they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if
the election goes against you,'' said Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, a moderate whose promoters mention him weekly as a
possible vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a conservative who tends to steer
away from divisive social issues, won re-election with 68 per cent
of the vote. He is studying the possibility of a presidential race,
but before he or any other Republican nominee can hope to win, he
said in an interview Wednesday, congressional Republicans and their
leaders need to learn some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope this debacle is a wake-up call for our people,''
he said. ``You've got to be for something _ smaller government,
better education, something. We're seen as the party that's against
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken late in this year's campaign bore McCain out. They
showed that the Republicans are no longer identified with issues
that were once their electoral bread and butter, such as low taxes
and law and order.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was also a fresh demonstration, for anyone who needed
one, of the political utility of pitching a tent big enough for
almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Black politicians in North Carolina, Maryland and California
reported that their fears of an indifferent black turnout had
proved groundless. Black votes proved indispensable to a
considerable number of hard-pressed Democratic candidates,
especially where they felt their interests directly threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The figures on Hispanic voting, assembled from exit polls and
from the candidates' own precinct analyses, showed dramatic
differences. In California, where the outgoing Republican governor,
Pete Wilson, had played the anti-immigration card with a vengeance,
both major Democratic candidates _ Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer,
who won re-election after trailing in early polls _ cleaned up
among Hispanic voters. He took 78 percent, she 72.
</P>
<P>
   But both of the Bush brothers, Jeb in Florida and George W. in
Texas, took more than half the Hispanic vote in their highly
successful gubernatorial campaigns. So did McCain. Jeb Bush is
married to a Hispanic woman, he and his brother both speak Spanish
fluently and frequently, and Senator McCain has long espoused
Hispanic causes.
</P>
<P>
   Both George W. Bush and McCain will draw strength, if they
decide to run, from their proven ability to appeal to Hispanic
voters, as well as their general electoral strength. George W. Bush
took 69 percent of the vote in Texas, where a Democrat sat in the
governor's chair only four years ago, and which has the
second-largest bloc of electoral votes. Florida has the
fourth-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush of Texas uttered a rallying cry for the moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leader who is compassionate and conservative,'' he said in
his victory speech, ``can erase the gender gap and open the
Republican party to new faces and new voices.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But figures on the right saw things differently. James Dobson, a
leading religious broadcaster, said that Republicans had fared
poorly because Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, had caved in to the president on the budget and
de-emphasized social issues such as abortion and flag desecration.
He called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, another
probable candidate in 2000, said the leadership ``will have a lot
to answer for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday proved the potency of education as an issue, and
suggested that it will emerge as a major theme of the 2000
campaign. Clinton, in his limited involvement in the campaign, and
Gore, in his extensive participation, both stressed Democratic
programs to build more schools and hire more teachers. Almost a
quarter of California voters _ and there are now almost twice as
many voters in California as in any other state _ named education
as their most pressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Democrats won the governorships of Alabama and South
Carolina against the odds, partly by emphasizing their rivals'
opposition to lotteries that will help to pay for schools. In Iowa,
a Democrat was elected governor for the first time since 1969 on a
platform that featured the dilapidated condition of the state's
schools and a promise to remedy it.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday demonstrated the overriding importance of money in
modern American politics. Feingold, one of the principal backers of
campaign-finance reform, survived to fight another day, but so did
opponents of reform. And the returns in House races, showing that
all but six of 401 members who sought re-election had won,
underlined once again how hard it is, under the present system, for
a challenger to raise enough money to compete effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties of raising money may doom many would-be
presidential candidacies. Gore will have what he needs, as will
Bush, Forbes and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. But how
many others will?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tuesday delivered an indecisive message about
impeachment. Close to two-thirds of voters nationwide told exit
pollsters that they intended to send no message about Clinton, but
they made it clear in response to other questions that they
disliked the House inquiry into the president's alleged misdeeds
and wanted to see it end. In only two states, Kansas and Nebraska,
did a majority of voters say they favored even a congressional
censure of Clinton, a much milder form of punishment advocated by
many Clinton backers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said privately that there should be no hearings
at all in the Clinton matter, and some Democrats began talking
about a deal, the equivalent of a plea bargain that would bring the
matter to an early close.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republican members of the House Judiciary
Committee said they needed to press ahead with the Constitutional
process that the House has set in motion. Among those taking that
view were Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, a fierce foe of the president,
and Rep. Mary Bono of California, whose tone has been more muted.
But Rep. David Dreier of California, the incoming Rules Committee
chairman, said that ``the election has played a role in ensuring
that one of us has a desire to drag that out.''

 &HT;    U.S. PRIVATE SECTOR ANSWERS CENTRAL AMERICA APPEAL FOR
INTERNATIONAL AID
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. and Central American governments continued
Wednesday to assess what disaster relief is needed in the wake of
Hurricane Mitch, hundreds of private-sector relief groups were
rapidly mobilizing to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, American schools, religious groups, chambers
of commerce, hospitals, businesses and individuals have flooded
Nicaraguan and Honduran embassy phone lines with calls offering
money and services.
</P>
<P>
   While government officials were not able to give specific
numbers of how much private-sector aid has poured into the
devastated region, Honduran Embassy spokesman Benjamin Zapata puts
it ``in the hundreds of thousands if not millions'' of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones don't stop,'' an obviously grateful Zapata said.
``We've received an immeasurable number of aid from these
businesses and agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Central America, Hurricane Mitch has killed an estimated
9,000 people and destroyed roads leading to areas where authorities
say thousands were still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials estimated their country's death toll at 7,000
on Wednesday, though no one knows how many really died. Some 11,000
people officially were listed as missing. As many as 1 million are
homeless, said Col. Rene Osorio of the national emergency
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relief efforts haven't been limited to simply gathering
supplies in drop boxes. Some groups have sent hundreds of
volunteers to the region, and chartered planes and ships to
directly deliver goods.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CARE has already sent a staff of 400 to the region
to help distribute nearly 6,000 metric tons of food, and provide
emergency assistance to 70,000 families. The group is also running
shelters in Nicaragua to aid about 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Brands International, which suffered an estimated $50
million in losses from banana crops, chartered rescue boats and
other equipment to retrieve victims from the roofs of their buried
homes, said Joe Hagin, a spokesman for the Cincinnati, Ohio-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has also teamed up with such groups as the Red Cross,
the Church of Latter-Day Saints and others to ship canned goods,
medicine and other supplies on boats normally used to ship exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal here was first to save lives,'' Hagin said. ``The
second goal was to re-establish some basic semblance of life by
providing food and what rudimentary shelter we could help with.''
</P>
<P>
   With a crippled economy and a crushed infrastructure, getting
goods into the region has been a challenge. Downed bridges and
washed out roads have made transporting much-needed aid expensive
and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many relief agencies are requesting monetary
donations instead of food contributions. Continental, American and
Taca airlines -- all of which serve Central America -- have offered
to ship donated goods for free, Zapata said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has already pledged $3.5 million in
assistance, and U.S. Agency for International Development officials
said Wednesday that number is expected to ``increase dramatically''
once the region's needs are further assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has funneled more than $45 million to the Dominican
Republic and Haiti since the island of Hispaniola, which the two
countries share, was ravaged by Hurricane Georges in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 15 disaster relief specialists have been sent to the
region, and more emergency supplies were expected to arrive
Thursday.

THE CASE OF THE BORN-AGAIN APARTMENT BUYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last spring, Samuel Levin, a 39-year-old money
manager and investor, was looking for just the right million-dollar
co-op apartment in one of the doorman-bedecked buildings lining
lower Fifth Avenue or facing Gramercy Park.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Karl Steinbrenner, a 66-year-old corporate
communications writer (and no relation to George), was trying to
find a $350,000 two-bedroom apartment in the Carroll Gardens
neighborhood of Brooklyn for himself, his companion and her
20-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Also scuffing their shoes in search of the ideal apartment were
Rob Cronin and Audrey Mann Cronin, newly married public-relations
executives in their 30s, searching for a two-bedroom condominium
below 34th Street.
</P>
<P>
   All were horrified at the high prices, and after the stock
market's 512-point plunge at the end of August, all decided to back
off _ to ``keep our hands in our pockets,'' as Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Within the last two weeks, they have come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market started to go wonky, we said: `Whoa!
Wait a minute! This may not be the right time,''' Steinbrenner
said. Now the couple are back in the market again, although they
are bidding lower than they would have a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. Although there are no statistics available
for market changes as recent as the last few weeks, real estate
brokers and agents are full of anecdotes about the Born-Again
Buyer, those cautious souls who were scared off by the stormy
market but have returned to the want ads and the open houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tiptoeing back in with a lot of caution,'' said
Barbara Corcoran, the chairwoman of Corcoran Group. ``We haven't
seen a rise in accepted offers yet, but attendance at open houses
is way up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other brokers testified that Born-Again Buyers are returning in
droves. Betsy Dean, the managing director at Stribling Associates,
said, ``In the last two weeks it's been very active.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope and Cobble Hill, ``things have
sure picked up during the last two weeks of October,'' said
Christopher Thomas, the head of William B. May's Brooklyn offices.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Peters of Ashforth Warburg Associates agreed. ``We had
probably a month in which everything seemed frozen,'' he said.
``But now the buyers are coming out of the woodwork, people we
haven't heard from in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Dr. Jim Gibboney, a 36-year-old physician from San
Francisco. He and Paul Blanchard, a marketing researcher, were
planning to move to New York but were scared back to California by
what Gibboney called the volatile real-estate market. ``We left it
at that,'' he said. But this week, they will dive back into the
fray. ``Prices have come down,'' he said, ``and we'll try it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the would-be buyers interviewed this week are still wary.
``Next week, we'll probably put in a bid on something we saw, but
I'm going to bid very low,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Maybe they'll
counter, and we'll meet in the middle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rob and Audrey Mann Cronin signed a contract on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delighted _ it was obvious to us that the stock
market's taking a downturn was good for us,'' Cronin said. The
Cronins had spent July and August _ ``every day, every night, every
Sunday, out inspecting,'' Ms. Cronin said. They now plan to have
three children in five years, ``God willing,'' he said, with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They said they make ``very good incomes'' but could not afford
the whopping 50 percent down payments required by co-op boards in
the best buildings. They considered moving to the suburbs and
decided they would stay in Manhattan and wait ``until things cooled
off,'' Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   So they waited, playing a Sunday morning real-estate game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey would read the real-estate classifieds to me _ you
know, the descriptions,'' he said. ``And after a while, I'd be able
to guess the prices to within $5,000 and $10,000.'' Then came the
plunge. And within the last few weeks, he said, they have been
noticing that prices, especially those for the newish condominium
towers, which are easier to calculate since the prices are based
primarily on square footage _ have come down a peg.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of October, they firmed up their wish list:
They wanted to be downtown, in Chelsea, Greenwich Village or
TriBeCa. They found exactly what they wanted: a new two-bedroom,
two-and-a-half bath condominium in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, which has three terraces, had a price that was
already reduced $30,000 after the stock market began its most
recent gyrations, and the couple said they paid $30,000 less than
that. Because the sale is not final, they did not want to reveal
the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could've gotten it without that 512-point drop,''
Cronin said. ``We were waiting. Maybe we were a little bit smart
and a lot lucky.''

FRESH FROM VICTORY, BUSH FACES QUESTIONS ABOUT PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, tired but triumphant over
his re-election and the Republican sweep of the statewide offices,
brushed aside presidential questions again Wednesday, saying it's
time to get back to work for Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there's a time for politics _ that ended last
night. Now, it's time for policy. Now it's time for doing right for
Texas,'' he told a post-election news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, flattened Democratic opponent Garry Mauro in a
landslide victory Tuesday that helped push other GOP candidates
into the winner's column as well.
</P>
<P>
   Voters elected a Republican lieutenant governor, Rick Perry, for
the first time since Reconstruction. They also chose GOP candidates
in the races for attorney general, comptroller, agriculture
commissioner and railroad commission.
</P>
<P>
   Bush credited his huge win _ with 69 percent of the vote _ to
his message, rather than his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed Texans that one can adhere to the conservative
philosophy and implement policies that are compassionate for our
fellow Texans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I showed people you can adhere to a conservative
philosophy and win a sizable portion of the Hispanic vote and close
the gender gap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking Bush captured 49 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a record for a Republican candidate, according to his chief
political consultant, Karl Rove. Bush also captured three
Democratic strongholds _ El Paso, Hidalgo and Cameron counties _ a
feat that no other GOP gubernatorial candidate has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats better take notice of that,'' said Austin political
consultant Chuck McDonald, who worked for Bush's predecessor,
former Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won 27 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I readily concede that I've got more work to do (in the
African-American community) as do all Republicans. There seems to
be a mind-set that Republicans don't care. I care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took Texas and his brother, Jeb, won the Florida governor's
race in part by appealing to minorities in a way that often eludes
Republicans. They are the first brothers since the 1960s to govern
two states simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor refers to himself a ``compassionate
conservative,'' while others are calling the Bush brothers ``new
Republicans,'' candidates who have rejected harsh, isolationist
rhetoric in favor of a more moderate, inclusive approach.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the Bush brothers focused on issues important to
people, stayed positive and reached out to non-traditional
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no mean-spirited feelings to any of it,'' McDonald
said in contrasting the Bushes' political styles ``to the level of
nastiness that politics has reached in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff coming out of there is truly hateful. People are
extremely uncomfortable with the dialogue were seeing, frankly,
from the Republicans in Washington,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans would be wise to emulate what they did, they
really would,'' he added. ``A segment of that party has to tone
down some of its rhetoric and exclusive behavior of saying: `Unless
you're with us 100 percent on our litmus test, you're not on our
team.' That isn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged the Republican Party has an image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that Republicans sometimes tend to
do is say what we're against,'' he said. ``I like to say what I'm
for. I like to lay out what's positive about my agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spent part of the day talking to state lawmakers from
both parties about the legislative session that begins in January,
he also had to answer questions again about whether he would run
for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The son of former President George Bush is considered a top
candidate for the GOP nomination, and Tuesday's win only increased
the speculation that he was positioning himself to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the campaign I told the truth on this
issue ... I don't know whether I'm going to run for president or
not,'' he told a crowd of state, national and international
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Texas knew loud and clear when they went in that
voting booth that Governor Bush did not know and still doesn't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the truth and Texans, I think, appreciated that,'' he
said.

 &HT;    U.S. PRIVATE SECTOR ANSWERS CENTRAL AMERICA APPEAL FOR
INTERNATIONAL AID
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. and Central American governments continued
Wednesday to assess what disaster relief is needed in the wake of
Hurricane Mitch, hundreds of private-sector relief groups were
rapidly mobilizing to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, American schools, religious groups, chambers
of commerce, hospitals, businesses and individuals have flooded
Nicaraguan and Honduran embassy phone lines with calls offering
money and services.
</P>
<P>
   While government officials were not able to give specific
numbers of how much private-sector aid has poured into the
devastated region, Honduran Embassy spokesman Benjamin Zapata puts
it ``in the hundreds of thousands if not millions'' of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones don't stop,'' an obviously grateful Zapata said.
``We've received an immeasurable number of aid from these
businesses and agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Central America, Hurricane Mitch has killed an estimated
9,000 people and destroyed roads leading to areas where authorities
say thousands were still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials estimated their country's death toll at 7,000
on Wednesday, though no one knows how many really died. Some 11,000
people officially were listed as missing. As many as 1 million are
homeless, said Col. Rene Osorio of the national emergency
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relief efforts haven't been limited to simply gathering
supplies in drop boxes. Some groups have sent hundreds of
volunteers to the region, and chartered planes and ships to
directly deliver goods.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CARE has already sent a staff of 400 to the region
to help distribute nearly 6,000 metric tons of food, and provide
emergency assistance to 70,000 families. The group is also running
shelters in Nicaragua to aid about 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Brands International, which suffered an estimated $50
million in losses from banana crops, chartered rescue boats and
other equipment to retrieve victims from the roofs of their buried
homes, said Joe Hagin, a spokesman for the Cincinnati, Ohio-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has also teamed up with such groups as the Red Cross,
the Church of Latter-Day Saints and others to ship canned goods,
medicine and other supplies on boats normally used to ship exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal here was first to save lives,'' Hagin said. ``The
second goal was to re-establish some basic semblance of life by
providing food and what rudimentary shelter we could help with.''
</P>
<P>
   With a crippled economy and a crushed infrastructure, getting
goods into the region has been a challenge. Downed bridges and
washed out roads have made transporting much-needed aid expensive
and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many relief agencies are requesting monetary
donations instead of food contributions. Continental, American and
Taca airlines -- all of which serve Central America -- have offered
to ship donated goods for free, Zapata said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has already pledged $3.5 million in
assistance, and U.S. Agency for International Development officials
said Wednesday that number is expected to ``increase dramatically''
once the region's needs are further assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has funneled more than $45 million to the Dominican
Republic and Haiti since the island of Hispaniola, which the two
countries share, was ravaged by Hurricane Georges in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 15 disaster relief specialists have been sent to the
region, and more emergency supplies were expected to arrive
Thursday.

 &HT;    Gotta move on, gotta have Faith
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering what rhythm-and-blues singer Faith Evans has been
through between albums, it wouldn't have been surprising if she had
come back doing gospel. Or something reflective of her hurt. And
yet, while the death of her estranged husband, rapper Notorious
B.I.G., left her a widow whose grief the whole world knew about,
she officially returns to the public eye happy. Hopeful. Spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Check out her soaring contralto gliding along a Chic sample on
the vibrant ``Love Like This,'' bouncing with the affecting bass
line in ``All Night Long'' and witnessing _ testifying, even _ on
``Life Will Pass You By'' that, even though she's ``been in all
kinds of drama in my life series, the world needs to know that
(you) gotta move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Evans obviously kept the faith, she gives listeners
15 reasons to want to hold on to it _ in the CD player, certainly,
and maybe in their lives. Which, when you think about it, is what
gospel records try to do.

 &HT;    Brews ever worthier of good food
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quite frankly, I had no idea what Poire Williams Gateau was. But
I like pears and I like porter, so why not?
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth course of an artfully prepared dinner at the
downtown Ritz-Carlton. We had sipped from the spicy, delicate White
Ale, gone on to the maltier Octoberfest, taken a deep draught of
the cream stout and now we were into the porter.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the end of it. To top everything off, snifter
glasses were set before us and pinch bottles of 1994, 1995 and 1997
Samuel Adams Triple Bock Reserve were uncorked. Tasting notes were
compared. This one was more figlike, that one more minty/peppery.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of fine dining is supposed to be simplicity, but
nothing was simple about this. It was complicated from first course
to last. Also delicious.
</P>
<P>
   One expects to be pleased at the Ritz-Carlton, and we were not
disappointed. The surprise was how expertly Jim Debore, a brewer
with Boston Beer Co., and Peter Zampaglione, sous chef at the
Ritz-Carlton, could meld their talents and match beer with food.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first planning it,'' Zampaglione says, ``I had to
adjust my palate a little. I was used to matching food with the
oaky flavors you get with wine. With beer you get the more hoppy,
herbaceous flavors, so you want to take that into account. But once
we got going, everything flowed together naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Zampaglione attended the Western Culinary Institute in Portland,
Ore., a mecca of craft brewing, and he acquired an avid
appreciation of beer in its myriad styles. ``It's so big out there,
we did a lot of dinners with beer when I was in school,'' he says.
``There's a lot you can do with food and beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoked duck, for example, was accompanied by aged goat cheese
and sweet potato chips. A frisee salad was tossed with a toasted
coriander vinaigrette. What kind of wine might you serve with such
a dish? My guess would be a burgundy or one of the lighter
zinfandels, and Zampaglione agreed. The roasted sea bass, with a
white bean cassoulet on the side? A sauvignon blanc. No question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Samuel Adams White Ale mated perfectly with the smoked
duck and aged goat cheese. And although I might have substituted a
golden pilsener with the sea bass, Zampaglione and others thought
the richer profile of an Oktoberfest was just right, given the
accompanying cassoulet, dried tomatoes and basil broth.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, folks weren't accustomed to thinking of
beer this way. Now beer dinners such as the one last month at the
Ritz-Carlton are a popular feature at many of the best restaurants,
and the number of draft offerings has increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   No brewery has done more to change perceptions than Samuel
Adams. Other breweries _ notably, Anchor and Sierra Nevada _ were
the pioneers, but many Americans became interested in better beer
because of Sam Adams. It is the most aggressively marketed craft
beer in the country. Indeed, less than 15 years after founder Jim
Koch left a $250,000 Wall Street job to follow in his forefathers'
footsteps, it's the country's eighth-largest brewery. It not only
has fought off the predatory advertising of Anheuser-Busch, but has
become as mainstream as Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   With devotees, though, have also come detractors, especially in
the craft beer industry. Almost from the outset, competitors
criticized Koch for not being candid about where his beer was
brewed _ not in Boston, but on contract in Pittsburgh and
elsewhere. Apart from a pilot operation in Boston, Samuel Adams was
a label without its own brewery. Now it has one _ in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   If truth-in-labeling is a dead issue, full acceptance has still
been grudging. Few would rank Samuel Adams at the very top in any
one style (except for its Triple Bocks) and yet it wins awards
regularly at the Great American Beer Festival. This year, its
flagship Boston Lager took the gold medal in the Bohemian Pilsener
category _ prompting some to ask whether, in fact, it was such.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that beer is a pilsener of any kind _ not in
hopping rate, not in body, not in color,'' says Glen Sprouse of
Phoenix Brewing Co., as knowledgeable as anyone in lager styles.
``If anything, it's an American version of a Vienna lager.''
</P>
<P>
   These disputes, acrimonious in one sense, only prove the point
that craft brewers have been making all along. Where Americans once
thought beer's just beer, craft brewers knew that, as with any art,
as with fine cuisine, styles were open to interpretation and
sometimes debate. Once they're not, there's no reason to be
interested. Ever wonder what hops taste and smell like fresh,
before they're put in the brew kettle? You can go to a homebrew
store and buy a bag of Chinooks or Fuggles, East Kent Goldings or
Mount Hoods. Or you can experience them out of the bottle in one of
Bert Grant's seasonal brews.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in the Yakima Valley of Washington state, one of the
world's prime hop-growing regions, Bert Grant's produces each
season a single-variety beer made with fresh-picked hops. For
autumn, Grant has chosen Cascades, the piney, citrusy hop that is
the signature of many West Coast pale ales. Unlike many pale ales,
Fresh Hop Ale is not especially aggressive. What comes across is
the aroma of hops right off the vine.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Bert Grant's winter ale, brewed with Mount
Hoods, arrives on shelves. For my money, the winter ale was the
best of Grant's seasonals last year. But the Fresh Hop Ale that
will be available through most of this month is just what its name
suggests, and one of the best beers this venerable contrarian has
brewed yet.

 &HT;    One knife, countless uses
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a beautiful carving set that I took from my dad's house
after he passed away. It consists of a sleek, two-pronged fork and
a 10-inch knife that nestle inside a smooth walnut box lined with
royal blue velvet.
</P>
<P>
   My dad kept the set on the top shelf of the hall closet and took
it out once a year, at Thanksgiving. He sharpened the knife, then
laid it out with the fork on the sideboard. When dinner came, he
carved the turkey with some difficulty, wiped the knife and fork
clean and tucked them away in their velvet bed for another year.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to use the carving set last Thanksgiving and for the
first time looked at the knife with a cook's appraisal. The blade
was a flimsy thing stamped from a sheet of thin stainless and
welded to the handle. It was so dull it couldn't slice through a
hothouse tomato, much less a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   So I put the set back in its new spot and took out my trusty
chef's knife. A good, sharp chef's knife can do a fine job on the
Thanksgiving bird.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a chef's knife can take care of almost any kitchen
task. With one in hand, you can ignore that clutter of gizmos and
gadgets that cram every American kitchen. You don't need a food
processor to chop onions or a press for garlic. You certainly don't
need a Veg-o-matic to cut carrot sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is finding the chef's knife that's right for you. Find
one that fits snugly in your hand. That feels balanced between
blade and handle. That has a weight and a length you find
comfortable. Next, learn to hold it: Grasp the handle like you're
shaking someone's hand and crook your index finger over the top of
the blade to steady it. Learn to rock it from tip to heel when you
chop. Learn to keep the fingers on your other hand curled under and
away from the blade when you slice.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper knife, you'll find that cutting vegetables for
dinner needn't be a stressful chore. It can be as tonic and
relaxing after work as a martini, as an evening jog, as ``Wheel of
Fortune.'' The right knife will make you a better cook.

 &HT;    Be cutting-edge in the kitchen with these 25 ways to chop, slice
and dice
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the don'ts. Don't use your chef's knife to pry apart
pieces of frozen chicken. Don't use it to core an apple, crack
steak bones or scoop the seeds out of a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   But do take a look at these other uses. Precisely cut food,
you'll find, brings intriguing textures to your cooking. Tough,
fibrous vegetables needn't be overcooked if they're sliced or cubed
into pieces small enough to tackle. Difficult tasks like pitting a
ripe avocado or opening a fresh coconut can be completed in a
flash.
</P>
<P>
   But the major advantage of a sharp chef's knife is the endless
possibilities it affords. With a good knife in hand, you don't see
raw ingredients as a chore. You see dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Open nuts: Place the nut on a cutting surface, lay the knife
sideways over it and butt the side of the blade until the shell
cracks. You can also crush shelled nuts easily this way.
</P>
<P>
   Open a coconut: Hold the coconut in your left hand (if you're
right-handed) and hold the knife, blade side up, in your right
hand. Strike the coconut forcefully on its equator with the lower
back part of the blade. Rotate the coconut and continue striking it
around the equator until cracks in two. Don't use your chef's knife
to remove the flesh; a paring or butter knife does that job nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Dice an onion like a professional: Trim both ends of the onion
and cut it in half lengthwise, making sure to bisect the solid root
end. Place the half-onion cut side down and make two or three
horizontal slices up to the root. Make four or five lengthwise
slices straight down. Rotate the onion, then slice it crosswise.
Small, even dice will fall from your knife.
</P>
<P>
   Julienne bell pepper perfectly: When appearance matters, try
this trick. Cleanly slice off 1/2 inch from the cap and base of the
pepper. Cut down the side and open the pepper into a large, long
rectangle. Trim out the seeds and veins. Now slice the pepper into
even slivers.
</P>
<P>
   Shred greens: Here in the American South, we cook collard greens
for a long time to break down their tough connective fibers. In
South America, cooks take care of this with a knife. After washing
the leaves, select three or four at a time and furl them tightly.
Slice straight down, trying to sliver the greens as thinly as
possible. Saute them in olive oil and garlic, and you won't believe
it's the same vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Make leek frizzles: A cap of fried leek frizzles adds equal
measures of sweet crunch and architectural glamour to most entrees,
especially fish. Cut 2-inch lengths of the white part of the leek.
Slice this in half lengthwise. Unfurl three or four layers and
slice thinly. Repeat. Fry the leeks in batches in 1/2 inch oil in a
small skillet over a medium-high flame. When they start browning,
they crisp, and you can remove them with a slotted spoon to drain.
Keep at room temperature until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Cut ginger threads for stir-fry: Most Asian-style recipes call
for grated ginger, but Chinese cooks often prefer to use tiny
strips of ginger so that its pungent presence dances in the mouth
in small bursts rather than lending an overpowering presence to the
sauce. Peel a 2-inch length of very fresh ginger (old ginger is too
fibrous). Cut a flat facet on one side so the ginger rests on the
cutting surface without rolling. Cut long, thin cross sections.
Sliver these sections, a few at a time, into the finest threads you
can cut.
</P>
<P>
   Improve soups with vegetable brunoise: In classical French
cuisine, ``brunoise'' refers to small, even dice. A nice brunoise
of carrots, celery and even turnips can be thrown into a soup five
minutes before serving to lend an appealing, firm bite.
</P>
<P>
   Chop parsley right from the bunch: Need 1/4 cup of chopped
parsley? Wash the bunch, furl it tightly and chop closely from the
outside in. Three or four slices and you've got plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Section citrus fruit: Cut the top and bottom ends from the fruit
and stand it up on the cutting surface. Slice off the peel in
strips, curving your knive to remove as little fruit pulp as
possible. Then pick up the denuded fruit and cut the sections away
from the pith. Oranges and grapefruit cut like this can make a
gourmet fruit salad. And lemon sections work well in sauces. A true
lemon-caper butter sauce, called ``sauce grenobloise,'' should
contain pulpy bits of lemon that are sectioned from the fruit and
then diced. Those little bursts of acidity stand up to the salty
capers much better than plain juice.
</P>
<P>
   Shave fennel: To make this fibrous bulb a pleasantly crunchy
addition to a salad, cut the fennel in half lengthwise, remove the
tough outer leaves and sliver the halves as thinly as you can.
</P>
<P>
   Butcher your own chickens and save money: Cutting up a chicken
takes no time at all once you get the hang of it. Snap the thighs
out of their sockets. Cut through the skin and flesh, but between
the bones, to sever the tendons. Separate the drumsticks from the
thighs and the wings from the breast the same way. Cut the breast
in half through the breastbone (actually soft cartilage) and down
one side of the backbone, breaking the small ribs. Repeat on the
other side of the backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Crush garlic: Remove the garlic clove from its husk by smashing
it with the side of your knife. Coarsely chop it and top it with
1/2 teaspoon salt. Holding your knife like a putty blade, smear it
onto the cutting surface until the garlic becomes a paste. No more
garlic presses to clean.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish on the cheap with scallion ``chevrons'': Cut the green
part of a scallion at a very sharp angle to make these pointy
garnishes for soup or pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Crack lobster claws: A couple of cooked lobsters are all you
need for a glittery first-course salad, pasta or risotto. In the
kitchen, you can make easy work of the claw meat. Pull the small
bottom pincer straight away from the claw to break it off, removing
the piece of cartilage attached to it. Hold the claw upright on a
cutting board and, holding your knife in the other hand blade side
up, bring it down forcefully against the claw until the shell
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly a flank steak: Holding the knife parallel to the
cutting board, carefully slice through the center of the flank
steak, almost to the end, until you can open it like a book. Then
cover it with a stuffing (sauteed spinach and roasted peppers work
well), roll it up, tie it and cook it like a roast.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanly pit an avocado: Cut the avocado in half and twist to
separate the halves. Take the side with the pit stuck to it, hold
it in your left hand (if you're right-handed) and carefully swing
the knife blade into the pit with your other hand. Twist the
avocado half to remove the pit, still stuck to your blade. Using a
kitchen towel to protect your hand, ease the pit off the blade.
</P>
<P>
   Curl chocolate: These swank decorations can be piled atop a
chocolate cake for a stunning presentation. Pour melted white or
dark chocolate over a marble slab or scratchproof countertop and
spread it with a large chef's knife or pastry knife. Take a clean
chef's knife and hold the top of the blade with both hands. Place
it in the chocolate at the edge at a 30-degree angle and push it
along the surface. This takes a trial run, but you figure it out
quickly. By adjusting the angle and the speed of pushing, you can
achieve different kinds of curls.
</P>
<P>
   Roll-cut a carrot: Peel the carrot and trim the ends. Cut off a
1-inch piece, slicing diagonally through the carrot. Roll the
carrot a quarter-turn and cut another piece on the diagonal. Repeat
until you have enough wonderfully pointy carrot chunks for dinner,
and served them boiled or glazed.
</P>
<P>
   Behead a fish: Don't like your trout staring back at you from
the plate? Then cut off its head before you cook it, starting at
the collarbone and slicing at an angle under it to get all the
flesh. Repeat on the other side, snapping the backbone. Beheaded
fish fit more easily into a skillet for pan frying.
</P>
<P>
   Make a perfect hamburger: You wouldn't want to do this for a
neighborhood party, but if you're making just one or two burgers,
get a nice piece of beef chuck or sirloin and a very sharp knife.
Continue to chop and chop and chop until it looks like hamburger.
Yum.

   Cut pork medallions: Pork tenderloins should first be trimmed of
the silver skin: Stick the tip of the knife under this membrane and
pull it first in one direction, then the other, to remove it in
strips. Next, cut the tenderloin into 1 1/2-inch medallions, season
well on both sides and saute.
</P>
<P>
   Make basil chiffonade: For the ultimate garnish for fresh
tomatoes or Italian food, stack a few basil leaves, roll them up
tightly and sliver.
</P>
<P>
   Pare an apple: Most people use a paring knife, but most paring
knives are pretty dull. An 8-inch chef's knife can be tucked into
your four fingers (two on the blade, two on the handle) and do a
surprisingly nimble job on an apple.
</P>
<P>
   Prep fresh romaine lettuce in
</P>
<P>
   seconds: Cut a head of romaine lettuce lengthwise, rotate a
quarter turn and cut again. Then cut 1-inch slices down to the
stem. Perfect, bite-size pieces of salad are ready to go.

 &HT;    Hungarian torte excellent choice for any occasion
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meredith Conklin of Atlanta wanted to revisit a part of her
youth by finding a Dobos Torte like those she remembers buying in
the city for special occasions. This recipe, sent by Betty Dunn of
Roswell, Ga., is adapted from George Lang's ``The Cuisine of
Hungary,'' who says the fabulous dessert was created by Jozsef C.
Dobos in 1887 for his food specialty shop in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dunn's family is Hungarian and she said her grandmother who
lived in Pittsburgh made the torte for any occasion. Her
grandmother's recipe is lost but she said Lang's sounds close to
what she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the version in Lang's book called for the addition of
risky raw eggs in the chocolate filling, our tester substituted
Chocolate Mousse Filling from ``The All New Joy of Cooking''
(Scribner, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Dobos Torte
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Chilling time: 3 to 4 hours
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CAKE:
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   5large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon ice water
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup pastry or cake flour
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CHOCOLATE FILLING:
</P>
<P>
   2large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2cups confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup milk, strong coffee or water
</P>
<P>
   1/8teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   6tablespoons ( 3/4 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CARAMEL GLAZE:
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon water
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line a 17-by-12-inch baking sheet
with wax paper, and lightly spread it with the butter. Set aside.
In a large bowl of an electric mixer, whip 5 egg whites with 1
tablespoon ice water and a pinch of salt until stiff. Add the egg
yolks, one by one, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Add
1/2 cup of the sugar, spoonful by spoonful, whipping all the time.
If you are using an electric mixer, turn down to lowest speed. Add
flour, little by little, making sure that it is completely blended
into the egg mixture. Pour the batter onto the baking sheet. Tap
sides a few times to even it out. Bake in the preheated oven for 10
to 12 minutes, until golden brown. Cut the cake into 6 equal
rectangles, 8 1/2 by 4 inches each. Pull off the wax paper. Cover
the pieces with cloth or fresh wax paper while cooling in order to
retain some of the moisture.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chocolate Filling: In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk
together eggs, confectioners' sugar, milk and salt. Set the bowl in
a large skillet of barely simmering water and heat, stirring
constantly until the mixture registers 160 degrees on an
instant-read thermometer. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate,
butter and vanilla. Stir until the chocolate and butter are melted
and the mixture is smooth. Set the bowl in a larger bowl of ice
water and beat on high speed until the filling holds a shape. Use
immediately or refrigerate for up to 4 days. Soften and beat until
smooth before using.
</P>
<P>
   Put five cake layers together with filling, setting aside the
most attractive layer to be covered with the caramel glaze and set
on top. Spread the filling between the five layers and on their top
and sides. Put the rest of the chocolate filling in a pastry bag.
</P>
<P>
   For the Caramel Glaze: In a medium, heavy saucepan over very low
heat, combine sugar and water. Cook until sugar is dissolved,
stirring occasionally with a clean spoon each time. Increase heat
to medium and cook mixture until it turns into a walnut-colored,
shiny liquid. Immediately remove it from the heat and spoon it
directly from pan onto the top of the reserved cake layer. Score it
to intended portion sizes with the tip of a buttered knife, then
cut it all the way through with the buttered knife. You must work
quickly because the caramel hardens in less than a minute. Be
careful not to touch the sugar with your hands.
</P>
<P>
   When the caramel is cool, lay the pieces on top of the five
filled layers. Fit a No. 6 tube to the pastry bag and pipe a
decorative border of chocolate filling around the top edge of the
torte.
</P>
<P>
   Cool the cake in the refrigerator until the filling is firm, 3
to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the cake with a knife dipped into hot water.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Les Miserables'' (PG-13) _ A handsome, well-acted version of
the Victor Hugo epic ... though you may miss the songs. Police
inspector Javert (Geoffrey Rush) once again tracks former convict
Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson, right) through the countryside and
alleyways of 19th-century France. Directed by Bille August (``Pelle
the Conqueror''), the movie is worth a look even if it lacks the
novel's breadth and vision. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Man Blues'' (PG) _ Woody Allen takes his shtick on the
road in this documentary. Touring Europe with the New Orleans-style
jazz band he performs with every Monday night in New York, Allen
travels with his then-girlfriend, now-wife Soon-Yi Previn.
Basically, they go from one sumptuous hotel suite to the next,
playing to enthusiastic crowds. Allen whines about shower drains,
Previn mocks him and the cycle starts again in the morning. No real
insights here. Grade: C

 &HT;    Ho-hum, the monster is here
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
yearlong hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short of being
even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla comes to
nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family matters.
Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-generated effects are decent. But director Roland
Emmerich shoots most scenes in a gray downpour, designed to hide
the seams of the effects. The whole film suffers from murkiness,
and the script is virtually suspense-free. At two hours and 19
minutes, the movie wears out its welcome fast. Does that matter?
Not if you have kids. The tape is priced to buy; get used to it.

 &HT;    As Fashion Week wraps up, things look good for next spring
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seemed like everyone here for Fashion Week had
something good to say about the spring/summer '99 womenswear
preview John Bartlett staged under The Tent at Bryant Park late
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In one post-show conversation, the cargo-pocketed bikini bottoms
Bartlett showed were likened to the greatest thing to come along
since women _ who spend their winters at resorts _ stopped eating
sliced bread.
</P>
<P>
   In another post-show chat, with an attendee who was more
star-struck than style-conscious _ kudos went to Bartlett for
drawing the highest number of celebs to a show so far. On one side
of Bartlett's black lamp-lit runway, the celeb roster included:
ghetto gear-wearing songstress Mary J. Blige,
``whatever-happened-to'' actress Debi Mazar, cell phone-posing rap
phenom Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, the awfully bored-looking actor
Gabriel Byrne, and actress Lauren Holly.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's show _ which featured music from one of Jane Fonda's
workout tapes _ received further commendations for the innovative
construction of some of the skirts, blouses, pants and jackets.
Skirts and pants were fitted with straps to allow women to adjust
hemlines up or down. The hemlines of tops were wired so women could
twist them into loose or tight-fitting shapes.
</P>
<P>
   The summary description Bartlett supplied for this collection of
clothes ranging in color from olive drab to pastel pink was,
``surplus couture''. And while everyone had at least one positive
remark about either the chino tube tops or the peacock-feathered
gowns or the white canvas tuxedo pants, few raved about the
collection as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his relatively recent graduation from The Parsons
School, Bartlett's been hailed around Manhattan as the young
designer most likely to succeed. But the ``utility chic'' styling
of his latest collection is too reminiscent of looks shown
previously in London, Milan, Paris and New York to distinguish him
as a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren's no great visionary either, but his commercial
success proves his mastery of the art of assimilating new trends
into his overall vision of All-American style. The collection he
showed early Wednesday morning looked bankable because he made the
elements of ``surplus chic'' dressing _ boat neck sweaters, flight
jackets, panchos, and all things khaki _ look as if they'd started
out as his idea in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Lauren's clothes were cut to look sexy yet fit
comfortably. His khaki silk skirts and dresses widened down to the
calf-length hem for easy walking, and were slung low on the waist
to flash the midriff and pulled taut in the seat for obvious
reasons. His beltless, deep-pocketed linen trousers were cut full
in the legs and cuffed at a floor-dusting length. His linen-silk
jackets and sweaters danced divinely about the models' upper
contours.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren's few ventures into territory that could aptly be called
unfamiliar or all-too-familiar came in the form of a series of
monochromatic, sweater-cargo pant combinations in precious pastel
shades of blue, pink and green. Tan, olive drab, and cream rounded
out his color palette. For eveningwear he showed white silk dresses
and skirts worn with sweaters in simple, sporty shapes. Silk and
suede, by the way, are the luxury fabrics he picked as a cashmere
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Post-show applause intensified from gracious to congratulatory
as Lauren _ looking curiously muscular in a skintight sweater and
faded cargo jeans _ strode the entire length of the runway and
embraced at least half of his front-row well-wishers on his way
backstage. You had to hand it to the man: he might not change much
when it comes to his designs, but when he does, it's for the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Friday: Backstage with makeup artist Bobbi Brown and
runway looks from Bill Blass.

BUSH BASKS IN GLORY OF CROSSOVER RE-ELECTION VICTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush Wednesday basked in the
glory of a crossover re-election victory that brought Democrats,
Hispanics and even some liberals into his fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed people who pay attention to politics that one can
adhere to the conservative philosophy and implement policies that
are compassionate for our fellow Texans,''Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defeated Democrat Garry Mauro with a stunning 69 percent of
the vote. But the full nature of Bush's landslide only became
apparent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had Bush fulfilled his desire to win heavily Hispanic
El Paso County _ with 50 percent _ but Bush also carried the twin
pillars of the Lower Rio Grande Valley: Cameron and Hidalgo
counties. He carried Cameron with 59 percent of the vote and
Hidalgo with 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the final exit polls conducted for the television networks,
Bush received 49 percent of the Hispanic vote, up from the 28
percent he received in 1994. The previous high for a Republican
candidate was 36 percent obtained by attorney general nominee Roy
Barrera in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had targeted El Paso as a place where he could show that a
conservative message will sway Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more Hispanic voters in Houston than there are in El
Paso,'' said Bush political consultant Karl Rove. ``But as far as
symbolic value, this was a community that was overwhelmingly
Hispanic and overwhelmingly Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro campaign manager Billy Rogers said El Paso was the
only place Mauro ever ran competitive television commercials
against Bush. He noted that Bush spent about $12 million on
statewide television advertising in the last 14 weeks of the
campaign while Mauro spent $450,000 in the final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``What El Paso clearly showed is that in an area where we had
fire power we could run a strong race against Bush,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said Mauro closed a 50 percentage point gaps in the poll
to just fall short of depriving Bush of his El Paso victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush's other major gain among voters occurred with
those age 60 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush received 48 percent of the older-voters in 1994,
but he got 71 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also received 26 percent of the vote of self-identified
Democrats, 28 percent of those calling themselves liberal and 32
percent of those who voted for President Clinton, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush almost doubled his support among African-American voters,
receiving 27 percent of the vote, up from 15 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubled the African-American vote, but I readily concede
that I have more work to do, as do all Republicans,'' Bush said.
``There seems to be a mindset that Republicans don't care. I
care.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also enhanced talk of Bush as a likely contender for
the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 as a Republican with broad
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed that talk for now, saying his first task is to
push his agenda through the legislative session that begins in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time for politics. That ended last night. Now it's
time for policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a job to do in Texas and I intend to do it. I will
make decisions on the future later on. I don't know whether I'm
going to run for president or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first post-election decision was to reappoint Mike Moses
as the state's education commissioner. He also accepted the
resignation of state Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer, who will
join Bush's staff in January as a senior aide.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also is working to quickly make two major
appointments. One is a seat on the railroad commission to fill the
vacancy left by Carole Keeton Rylander, who won the state
comptroller's post Tuesday. The other is a seat on the Texas
Supreme Court being vacated by Democratic Justice Raul Gonzalez,
who has has resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also met privately with state Senate Republican caucus to
push his proposals on education and his plan for a $2 billion
property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is a mandate for tax cuts,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times legislatures want to spend all the money,'' he
said. ``I have no evidence that there is going to be resistance to
the tax cuts, I just know the legislative tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said he hopes the 2000 Republican National Convention
will be held in San Antonio because it will demonstrate that the
Republican Party can be inclusive of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will show America that Hispanics and Anglos can co-exist
side by side in the 10th largest city in the United States and do a
good job,'' Bush said. ``I hope they (the GOP site selection
committee) are smart enough to select San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he has been embarrassed about the Clinton sex and lies
scandal, but he said the national backlash against congressional
Republicans resulted from the party's approach to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Republicans sometimes tend to do is say what we're
against. I like to say what I'm for. I like to lay out what's
positive about my agenda,'' Bush said. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's alive!
</P>
<P>
   Victor Frankenstein isn't the only creator, it turns out, who
can make a breathing organism out of dead body parts. That corpse
of a musical known as ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' which opened a
year ago at the Minskoff Theater, is suddenly showing startling
signs of animation.
</P>
<P>
   Restructured, rewritten, restaged and significantly recast under
the supervision of its new executive producer, Tim Hawkins, and its
new director and choreographer, Robert Longbottom (of
``Sideshow''), what was once a frozen lump of a production is on
its feet and moving. And not with the lumbering tread of
Frankenstein's monster but with a light and springy step. Heck, it
has even learned to dance a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' still isn't, by any stretch of the
imagination, a ``My Fair Lady'' or even a ``Phantom of the Opera.''
But on its own terms _ as a family-oriented musical that's part
boy's adventure story, part Harlequin romance _ it works. It now
has such essential assets as a focused story line, dramatic
momentum and cleanly defined characters, none of which were evident
in its first incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of metamorphosis is commonplace during out-of-town
tryouts for Broadway shows. But for it to occur well into a New
York run is astonishing and what makes this revitalized
``Pimpernel'' news. It also gives anyone who suffered through the
first version a fascinating opportunity to see how the same set of
ingredients can be used to such radically different effect.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' which has a score by
Frank Wildhorn (of ``Jekyll and Hyde'') and a book and lyrics by
Nan Knighton, had the distinction of being the most irritatingly
understaged musical on Broadway. (That was before the arrival of
``Footloose.'') Directed by Peter Hunt, with choreography by Adam
Pelty, this singing adaptation of Baroness Orczy's 1905 novel
suggested a waxworks run by a caretaker who had forgotten to turn
down his radio when the public arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Though the plot was as eventful as any Superman comic book, with
a disguised band of English aristocrats saving worthy souls from
the guillotine during the French Revolution, it was translated to
the stage as a series of awkward tableaux. Whatever
``swashbuckling'' means, this ``Pimpernel'' didn't have it.
</P>
<P>
   A Broadway newcomer named Douglas Sills showed a definite spark
in the title role. But his more seasoned co-stars, Christine
Andreas, as the Pimpernel's French wife, and Terrence Mann, as his
archenemy, seemed respectively annoyed and bored with the
proceedings. The romantic chemistry was nil, and by the spring, the
company was playing to half-empty houses.
</P>
<P>
   That was when David W. Checketts, the president and chief
executive officer of Madison Square Garden, stepped in with a plan
that seemed about as foolhardy as bearding Robespierre in the Reign
of Terror. Radio City Entertainment, which like Madison Square
Garden is a division of the Cablevision Systems Corp., acquired
``Pimpernel'' with the financier Ted Forstmann, one of its original
producers. While Sills remained, Mann and Ms. Andreas left the show
when their contracts expired, to be replaced by Rex Smith and
Rachel York.
</P>
<P>
   The succeeding wholesale revision of ``Pimpernel'' is all the
more remarkable when you realize the full company had only a week
of rehearsals while the Minskoff went dark. From the new
production's first minutes, it declares its differences from its
predecessor. The most significant of these is its confident sense
of identity: It obviously knows what it wants to do and how to
achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   The musical no longer begins with a gloomy ``Les
Miserables''-style assemblage of prisoners awaiting the guillotine
but on the stage of the Comedie Francaise. The opening image is a
confectionary fantasy. A woman in a towering pink wig (Ms. York)
emerges from the darkness to sing of storybook dreams and ask of
her audience, ``Come, let's believe.'' (The song, ``Storybook,'' is
a reworking of a number that was bizarrely featured in the second
act in the original and has been ingeniously retailored in the same
spot in a reprise.)
</P>
<P>
   The lights come up to reveal a team of ornately costumed
dancers, music hall variations on Fragonard. The effect is
picturesque but slightly silly, closer to Folies-Bergere than
Comedie Francaise, and that's the point. Don't take us too
seriously, the show seems to suggest: This is only a story; it's
meant to be fun.
</P>
<P>
   The number also neatly establishes the show's romantic triangle.
Watching the actress, Marguerite, are Chauvelin (Smith), her former
lover and a vengeful official of the new French regime, and Percy
(Sills), the English nobleman who is her fiance. The scene is a
score card of sorts. Now you know who the players are.
Relationships and conflicts are established in quick, broad
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is of a piece with that scene. The level of
enchantment aspired to here is not lofty. It's not far from that of
the formula Technicolor movies of the 1950s in which stars like
Stewart Granger and Rhonda Fleming smoldered on the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Accept that context and you can now have a perfectly good time
at ``Pimpernel.'' Longbottom's restaging and Ms. Knighton's
extensive rewriting consistently bring lightness and clarity to
what once seemed merely turgid.

   Seen as part of a ``let's pretend'' sensibility, Andrew
Jackness' sets and Jane Greenwood's costumes feel far less like
elements in a Rococo window at Bloomingdale's. Natasha Katz's
revamped lighting is invaluable in focusing attention as well as
creating atmosphere. Even Wildhorn's syrupy pop ballads, while
still evoking images of has-been movie stars in sequins on a Las
Vegas stage, have acquired a new ease.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, these songs are now efficiently used to define
character and advance plot. It helps, of course, that Sills, Smith
and Ms. York make an appealing set of lovers. Although she succumbs
to the Streisandesque vocalizing that always befalls women in
Wildhorn shows, Ms. York beguilingly mixes dewiness and feistiness
in ways Barbara Cartland might admire.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is terrific, offering the sinister authority and vulpine
mien that make archetypal villains fun to watch. There's even a
mild erotic charge to the duet of seduction and resistance sung by
him and Ms. York. Percy has been more fully reconceived as a virile
matinee-idol type whose assumed foppishness masks the valiant hero
beneath, and Sills winningly slides between personas that
alternately bring to mind Danny Kaye and Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is more a matter of kinetic posing than proper
dancing, but it's not without charm, especially in the number in
which Percy and his fellow aristocrats practice the art of
accessorizing. And there's a climactic sword fight (staged by Rick
Sordelet) that makes witty use of the show's three principals. It's
not genuinely exciting, but it's enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of ``Pimpernel,'' the scene is an affectionate nod to
the heroic conventions of another time. This is a show, after all,
that includes lines like, ``Citizens, the tumbrels are here,'' and
lets the hero say to the villain, about the kidnapped heroine,
``Old boy, she's coming home with me.'' Such moments, wisely
delivered with straight faces, sum up the appeal of ``Pimpernel,''
which isn't much more than a pleasant diversion. The show's stormy
history, however, reminds us that in the theater these days, even
pleasant diversion doesn't come easy.

COMPOSERS WIN A STAY IN COPLAND'S OLD HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In 1960, Aaron Copland, searching for a new place to live as he
approached his 60th birthday, found a six-room house on a hilly
three-acre site in Cortlandt, N.Y., about an hour's drive north of
New York. One room, separate from the main house, had two glass
walls that overlooked forests, gardens and, in the distance, the
Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a place where a composer could write music,''
he said at the time. He bought the house on the spot, and lived
there until he died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to an unusual agreement between the Aaron Copland
Fund for Music, which manages Copland's estate, and Cortlandt, a
town of 38,000 in upper Westchester County, other composers will be
able to live and work in that house, called Rock Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday officials from the Copland Heritage Association,
set up in 1990 to maintain the house, announced the names of seven
composers who have won residencies at the house. Allen Shearer of
Oakland, Calif., will be the first composer-in-residence, from Nov.
27 to Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The other composers are Mark Kilstofte, Stephen Coxe, Carlos
Carrillo, Donald Crockett, Akemi Naito and Robert Carl.
</P>
<P>
   When Copland died, the house was in bad shape, with a failing
roof, wood rot, a faulty heating system and other problems. The
Copland Fund decided to sell it. But the town of Cortlandt began a
grass-roots effort to save the house and turn it into a permanent
cultural institution. After six months of discussions an
arrangement was worked out whereby the Copland Fund leased the
house to the town for $1 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The town, in turn, leased the house to the newly formed Copland
Heritage Association, a nonprofit organization that raised the
$150,000 needed for repairs. The association will continue to
maintain the house, with help from the town for services like snow
removal and exterior painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were just ordinary, culturally minded townsfolk,'' said
Michael Boriskin, a clarinetist who serves as artistic director of
the association. ``We hear so often about government officials not
caring a whit about such things, but the leadership in Cortlandt
was visionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The association will also present concerts, organize exhibits
and develop educational programs. Given the modest size of the
house, only one composer at a time can be in residence. Each
recipient of the honor, known as the Aaron Copland Awards, will get
the run of the place with a spouse or partner, but no children or
pets are allowed. Residents will receive food allowances, and a car
has been made available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the town are so proud that Aaron Copland lived here for
30 years,'' said Linda Puglisi, the town supervisor. ``It's
wonderful that promising composers will now reside in his house,
and hopefully write music comparable to Copland's.''

REPUBLICANS AGONIZE IN WAKE OF ELECTION RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the magnitude of the Democrats' election success
sank in Wednesday, Republicans indulged in introspection over what
went wrong and why the GOP failed to live up to expectations of
winning bigger majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives on the Christian right _ a hard-core base
of GOP support _ said the Republicans failed to meet historical
expectations because they weren't conservative enough. Others said
the party's problem was that it focused too narrowly on President
Clinton's role in the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, which
distributed 36,000 of its voter guides in churches last Sunday in
order to get out the Christian conservative vote, complained that
there was ``no clear conservative agenda articulated by national
conservative leaders in Washington'' during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He defined that agenda as favoring lower taxes, less government
and bans on abortion. By contrast, he added, Democrats had a clear
agenda of improving education, saving Social Security and placing
controls on managed care health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tate groused that instead of a set agenda like the GOP
``Contract in America'' in 1994, the Republicans focused on
impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful, you can't be Johnny one-note on a particular
issue,'' Tate said. ``You need to address a broad number of issues
in the pro-family movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the campaign, Republicans pumped $10 million
into about 30 mostly Southern and rural districts for TV ads
critical of President Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The same complaint was voiced by Gary Bauer, chairman of the
conservative Campaign for Working Families, which raised over $2
million for over 200 mostly Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to put the focus on Clinton may have led voters to
believe ``the only thing we were focused on was this mess at the
White House,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But without a ``governing agenda'' to go with the anti-Clinton
message, the focus on scandal ``ends up hurting'' Republicans,
Bauer said. ``We should be able to do two things at once.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Christian broadcaster James Dobson called for
a shakeup of the Republican leadership team, callimg it cowardly
for not attacking Clinton sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, without naming names, responded that potential
challengers and hardline conservatives would ``take the party to a
narrower base with fewer members.'' But he appeared to grant the
point that the GOP paid insufficient attention to issues in the '98
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   `There was no national dialogue,'' he told reporters. ``We
probably should have maniacally focused on cutting taxes, reforming
government, working on saving Social Security (rather) than
drifting into a September and October where there were no national
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gained five seats in the House, narrowing the
Republican margin there to 223-211 with one independent. It is the
first time since the Roosevelt administration in the 1930s that the
party in the White House gained seats in a mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' 55-45 margin in the Senate remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Historical precedents suggested that the Republicans should have
scored gains in both chambers, perhaps even winning a 60-vote GOP
Senate majority sufficient to cut off Democratic filibusters. In
the House, Republican leaders had predicted a gain of no fewer than
eight seats.
</P>
<P>
   Republican victories on the gubernatorial front were among the
few bright spots for the GOP on Election Day as George W. Bush won
re-election in Texas and his younger brother Jeb Bush won in
Florida. Republicans picked up the governorships of Nebraska and
Nevada, but lost California, Alabama, Iowa and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious GOP governors, all of them moderate
conservatives, surfaced as possible role models for future party
electoral success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won huge because they talked about things that unite all
Republicans such as education, crime and the economy,'' said Mark
Miller, executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a
centrist Republican group. ``What people want to hear from
Republicans is how are we different from Democrats on issues that
affect their daily lives: Keeping more of what they earn, safe
streets and better schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Others blamed GOP misfortunes on the Christian conservatives'
own platform. ``Clear distinctions between the candidates existed
on issues such as mandatory prayer in school, campaign finance
reform and support for public education,'' said Rev. Welton Gaddy
of the Interfaith Alliance, a religious group opposing Christian
conservatism. ``Those candidates who touted the narrow agenda
espoused by Bauer and Tate paid a price at the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls taken Tuesday showed that conservative Christian
voting declined from 15 percent of the total electorate in 1994 to
13 percent in 1998. A survey conducted for the Christian Coalition
found that 28.6 percent of those on the religious right voted, down
from 33 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found more Christian Coalition followers voted
Democratic. Democratic congressional candidates in 1998 received 31
percent of the religious right vote _ 11 percentage points higher
than 1994. Republican candidates, on the other hand, got 54 percent
_ down 13 points from 1994, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich took a share of the blame on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility,'' Gingrich told reporters. ``I am
Speaker of the House ... We in the House should have been more
consistent, and more aggressive'' on cutting taxes and saving
Social Security through personal savings accounts. ``I think that
was our mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be any GOP blood-letting, it is likely to take
place at the Nov. 18 meeting of the House Republican caucus.
</P>
<P>
   If a challenge were mounted against Gingrich, it could come from
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee who in the past year asked his colleagues to support his
future candidacy in the speaker's race; Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif.; Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind.; Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.
or Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget
Committee.

<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political scientist at the Brookings
Institution, doubted House Republicans would remove Gingrich in
what Gingrich himself has declared are his final two years in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an icon,'' Hess said. ``He's made awful mistakes but he
also reminds Republicans of their reason for being there. That
being said, you've got an awful lot of unhappy campers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said the
GOP's poor showing Tuesday won't lead to a shake-up in the party's
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's job ``is not in jeopardy and nor should it be,''
Nicholson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues are going to examine my performance and they
will see that the RNC raised a record amount of resources, which is
its primary mission, and got those resources out into the races,''
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I think a lot of introspection is going to go
on and should.''

winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

   As a brilliant but troubled 17-year-old, a scholarship student
at the privileged St. Paul's preparatory school whose father had
died when she was 8, Rosemary Mahoney read the memoirs of Lillian
Hellman and was overwhelmed. ``She lived her life; I merely walked
along beside mine, keeping an eye on it, reining it in,'' Ms.
Mahoney writes in her own riveting memoir, ``A Likely Story: One
Summer With Lillian Hellman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hellman wrote about her smallest experiences,'' she
remarks, ``they had the feel of epic adventures with epiphanic
endings. ... She was brave and strong and full of noble ideals. ...
And when she wrote in `An Unfinished Woman' that she was
`overproud, oversensitive, overdaring' because she was shy and
frightened, I wanted to see her, have a look at her, and let her
have a look at me, for surely she would recognize similar traits in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Mahoney wrote to Hellman, asking whether she could work
for her at her summer home on Martha's Vineyard ``in some
capacity.'' When to her amazement Hellman wrote back offering her a
job as a part-time live-in housekeeper for the summer, Ms. Mahoney
imagined that they ``would become great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``I felt that this meeting with Lillian Hellman was a
natural step in my destiny, proof that I was, as I sometimes dared
to suspect in the darkness and safety of my bed, special.''
</P>
<P>
   But over that summer of 1978, her experiences were such that six
years later, when she was helping to renovate an apartment and she
literally stepped on the headline announcing Hellman's death, she
was prompted to write, ``Seeing those words was like discovering
that the cool, slippery object you've crushed beneath your bare
foot in the garden is a large pus-colored slug.'' She heard herself
mutter, ``Thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   She writes: ``Lillian Hellman was good and dead. I clapped my
dirty hands and made cracks about the pieties that were sure to be
scattered about her funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   What had gone so wrong between them? On the evidence of Ms.
Mahoney's endlessly fascinating book, practically everything. The
job she had pictured vaguely as a part-time companion and assistant
turned out to be a full-time combination of chauffeur, housekeeper,
valet, butler, messenger, kitchen girl, answering service and
laundress. In short, Hellman's servant.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for someone to replace her own adored mother, who had
been sliding deeper into alcoholism ever since her husband's death,
Ms. Mahoney found instead a frightened, partially blind 73-year-old
woman wholly preoccupied with her own decline.
</P>
<P>
   On top of being disappointed in the sight of Hellman up close,
Ms. Mahoney was too wrapped up in herself to understand other
people's interests. (For instance, she writes of the ritual Hellman
and her friends made of preparing food, ``Cooking did not strike me
as a useful activity, but these people were mad for it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Mahoney failed to understand an older generation
that simply did not believe in fraternizing with the help.
(Curiously, among all of Hellman's celebrity guests that summer,
among them William and Rose Styron, John and Barbara Hersey, Mike
Nichols, Carly Simon and James Taylor, only Joseph Alsop, the
aristocratic newspaper columnist, treated Ms. Mahoney as an equal,
even going so far as to serve her coffee at breakfast.)
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Ms. Mahoney learned an essential lesson. As she
herself puts it after reading pages her employer had discarded from
a defense she was writing against those who had said she was
dishonest in ``Scoundrel Time,'' her memoir of the McCarthy era:
``There was more than one version to the world. What people stood
for wasn't necessarily what they were.'' If Hellman was noble in
her books, Ms. Mahoney found her petty in person; if she seemed
brave, she was actually fearful; if generous, then grasping; if
large, small.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unluckily for her subject, Ms. Mahoney kept her anger at a boil,
her sharp eye peeled and her journal always at hand to be filled.
Her memoir is overwritten here and there, with too many similes
piled up; but when tasted one sentence at a time, her descriptions
of Hellman can be deadly. ``The lunch and heat had made her sleepy.
Her face looked immovable and slightly sinister, the big beaky face
of a sea turtle at rest on the ocean floor, dreaming and digesting,
with one dyspeptic eye half open in a sluggish scan for predators
and perhaps more food.''
</P>
<P>
   By turns hilarious and infuriating, Ms. Mahoney's sketches of
Hellman add up to a portrait of a small-minded tyrant who, when she
wasn't ignoring Ms. Mahoney, was subtly putting her down. Hellman's
typical tactic was to accuse Ms. Mahoney of something she hadn't
done, like failing to rinse a bowl or eating all the tomatoes in
the refrigerator. Then if Ms. Mahoney defended herself, she would
be accused of being argumentative.
</P>
<P>
   Each such incident was tiny in significance but their cumulative
weight grew to be unbearably oppressive. ``Hellman was like a dark
sky coming closer and closer to the ground, pressing me down,'' Ms.
Mahoney writes. ``The less she seemed to see me, the more she
pressed me. I walked with my head down. She always had the final
word.'' Worse, Ms. Mahoney could not stop being respectful, even
affectionate at times. The contrast with what she had hoped for in
the way of friendship made her burn with shame.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the summer ended. She escaped, finished her
schooling, went on to write two well-received books, ``The Early
Arrival of Dreams,'' about a year she spent teaching English in
China, and ``Whoredom in Kimmage,'' a portrait of rural Irish pub
life. But she has clearly worn her summer experience with Hellman
like, as she puts it, ``a scab that wanted picking.'' She has
written with a vehemence that stings on every page.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``A Likely Story'' may simply prove the old adage
that no man is a hero to his valet. But it was Hellman's
self-destructive misjudgment to hire a valet with a fierce sense of
morality, an exquisite eye for detail, a sharp eye for character, a
fanciful way with words and a long memory. And Ms. Mahoney's
willingness to share blame for the misalliance makes her portrait
all the more absorbing and damning.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Voters in Hawaii and Alaska went on record against
gay marriages while Colorado voters turned down late-term abortions
and Washington state opposed affirmative action in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the hot issues that Americans decided Tuesday
through initiatives, referendums and state constitutional
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of ballot measures _ 61 issues in 16 states _
reflected a reluctance by state legislatures and Congress to
address controversial issues, said James Thurber, director of the
Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at the American
University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiatives' movement grows out of a distrust of
politicians to either deal with these issues or to decide them in
the way the people want,'' Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, voters decided a record 102 ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state approved
the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Advocates say the
narcotic can ease the pain and nausea associated with cancer and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada passed its own constitutional amendment approving
marijuana as a medicine, provided voters return in 2000 and approve
the measure a second time. Washington state's endorsement came a
year after voters rejected a broader plan that critics said could
have led to the legalization of other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard to bring back a very tightly worded, specific
medical marijuana initiative. It's a model for the rest of the
country,'' said Robert Killian, a Seattle doctor who sponsored the
Washington state initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters reaffirmed their 1996 approval of a plan that
makes legal the prescribing of medical marijuana for seriously ill
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the District of Columbia also voted on a medical
marijuana initiative, but the results of that ballot may never be
known. Election officials are keeping the results secret because
Congress, which controls the capital's budget, opposes legalization
and cut funding for the initiative after it appeared on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state marijuana measures won at the ballot box, it
remains to be seen whether they can be implemented. A similar
measure passed in California in 1996 but has largely been blocked
by state and federal officials. And Congress has threatened to
enact a law that would allow the Drug Enforcement Administration to
go after doctors who write prescriptions for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the initiatives was a blow to the Clinton
administration, which urged voters to reject the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sending our kids the wrong message, which is that
marijuana is somehow good for you,'' said Jim McDonough, director
of strategy for the administration's Office of National Drug
Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In other initiatives, voters in Alaska and Hawaii dealt the
gay-rights movement a setback.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiians approved an initiative that would authorize state
lawmakers to write a law prohibiting same-sex marriages, while
Alaskans voted a gay-marriage ban into their constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights groups promised to fight the measures in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that fear and prejudice triumphed over protections
guaranteed by the state constitution should make every American
take pause,'' said David Smith, a spokesman for Protect Our
Constitution, a group that fought the Hawaiian measure.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative groups hailed the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are against same-sex marriages, and they let the
politicians know it,'' said Molly Klatworthy, a spokeswoman for the
Christian Coalition, a conservative religious organization.
</P>
<P>
   On another contentious social issue, voters in Washington state
chose to join California in banning the use of racial and gender
preferences in government hiring and contracting and in university
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are clearly saying, `We want to treat everybody
equally,''' said Ward Connerly, the California businessman whose
organization spearheaded passage of that state's anti-affirmative
action measure and help plan and finance the Washington effort.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, a University of California regent, said he hoped the
success of the Washington and California measures would encourage
similar moves in Congress and in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Washington state and Colorado took on perhaps the
country's most divisive issue, abortion. In both states, voters
rejected proposals to restrict the late-term procedure that
opponents call partial-birth abortions. Colorado voters also
approved a measure that requires parental notification for minors
seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents hailed the decisions, saying the voters sent
a message to politicians that abortion should be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion should not be allowed, and politicians should know
that the public will hold them accountable,'' said David O'Steen,
executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, a
Washington-based anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   Other important issues decided on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   _ California's Indian tribes won broad voter approval to
continue running their casinos unhampered by state control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Missouri approved riverboat gambling.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan voters rejected a plan that would have made the
state, home to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the second in the nation with
legalized physician-assisted suicide. Oregon is the only state
where doctors can prescribe lethal doses to end suffering.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Carolina ended a 103-year-old constitutional ban on
interracial marriages.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ First he made seven Top 10 albums, as the producer
and mastermind of the Wu-Tang Clan. He came up with one of the
rawest, spookiest, most widely imitated musical styles of the
1990s. Then Robert Diggs, better known as the RZA, decided it was
time to study music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the last two years going through books to learn how to
play music,'' he said during an interview in a suite at the
Royalton Hotel while other people bustled around. ``I just delved
into them.''
</P>
<P>
   The suite had been redecorated with shiny futuristic shapes
inspired by the RZA's latest project and alias, a movie titled
``Bobby Digital'' and an album called ``RZA as Bobby Digital in
Stereo'' (Gee Street/V2). Wearing an orange robe, a Lone
Ranger-like mask on top of his head and two handfuls of rings,
among them the Wu-Tang Clan's stylized ``W,'' the RZA (pronounced
RIZ-a) discussed his musical education while publicists, children,
friends and girlfriends wandered in and out.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer for a European magazine set up lights and a
tripod. A former Buddhist monk who had defected from China _ where
he had been a member of the Shaolin order, which is noted for its
feats of martial arts _ was hanging out. So was Ghostface Killah, a
rapper from the Wu-Tang Clan, which got its name from kung-fu
movies and referred to its home borough, Staten Island, as Shaolin.
In Wu-Tang geography, Manhattan is Mecca, Brooklyn is Medina, and
New Jersey is New Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We named everything like Adam named things in the Garden of
Eden,'' said the RZA. ``Oh, that's a good metaphor, right? I've got
to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs, 28, began writing rhymes when he was 8. His other passion
was kung-fu movies, and he would often skip school to head for the
old movie houses on 42nd Street in Manhattan, where he would sit
through triple bills to see a favorite movie twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he persuaded some friends from the Staten Island
housing projects to chip in on a four-track tape recorder, which he
promptly used to start putting together hip-hop tracks. He worked
as a disk jockey and got together with the rappers who would later
become the Wu-Tang Clan: Method Man, the Genius/GZA, Raekwon,
Ghostface Killah, U-God, Inspectah Deck, Cappadonna, Masta Killa
and Ol' Dirty Bastard. The Genius and Diggs (under another name,
Prince Rakeem) each released albums in the early '90s that were
generally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Diggs said, after he was tried and acquitted on a
charge of attempted murder, he walked out of the courtroom and
decided to get serious about making it in hip-hop: ``I went to
Method Man, and I said: `Are you with me? I'm ready to do this. I
want to get off these streets. If we don't get out of here, we're
going to be dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   He plotted out every moment of the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album,
``Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).'' After reading books about the
music business, he also oversaw contractual maneuvers that put the
Wu-Tang Clan on one label and each member on a separate one; with
more labels involved, the group benefited from additional promotion
and varied marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Enter the Wu-Tang'' (Loud/RCA), on solo albums by Clan
members and on the less focused 1997 album ``Wu-Tang Forever,'' the
RZA's productions created an ominous, bombed-out urban sound, with
rough-cut rhythms and elegiac, hovering strings. The music was
simultaneously raw, ferocious and mournful, full of tension and
bleak memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's universal,'' said Ghostface Killah. ``Those beats are
straight from the basement, and they're also from the heart, the
core, the soul. He's a doctor, and he's a scientist, he's
intelligent to the max. And now he's risen to higher heights. He's
orchestrating his own music. He doesn't have to sample, he can make
it from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clan's rappers, with the RZA among them, have discoursed on
poverty and violence, philosophy and comedy, social uplift and rude
sex, with rapid-fire delivery and enough personas to confuse
outsiders and turn fans into cultists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all talented, and everybody's got a different style,''
said Ghostface Killah. ``It's like a pack of Life Savers.''
</P>
<P>
   The raps are packed with internal rhymes and dense with
allusions: to video games, movies, junk food, Scripture, science
and members' lives. Someday a professor is bound to publish ``The
Annotated Wu-Tang,'' footnoting every reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find many MCs who can make a rhyme make sense like
that but be a conjunction of so many different thoughts,'' Diggs
said. ``And it's still just the surface of our talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clan has spun off a line of clothing, Wu-Wear, and
associated hip-hop groups, like the Sunz of Man; in the last few
years, the RZA has farmed out some of the production work to his
apprentices. A Wu-Tang video game is also a possibility. But with
hip-hop's breakneck evolution, the sound the RZA had created was so
widely imitated that its impact started to wear off. The Wu-Tang
trademark, which from 1994 to 1997 guaranteed that a hip-hop album
would zoom into the Top 10 the moment it was released, lost some of
its cachet through dilution.
</P>
<P>
   For the RZA, studying music was one way of leaving the
competition behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you've got rappers looking like us and acting like us over
weak music, over recycled music and mediocre lyrics,'' he said.
``After five years and more than 250 songs, my sound is a common
trait. I realized two years ago that people were going to jump in
my world and start imitating it. That's when I started studying the
music. Because they can't do that, they can't imitate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the notes, I can see them and read them. I don't
have the speed yet, but I can read OK. I learned how to play drums.
And I know the basic chords: E-A-B, that's the basic pop song. But
then I confused myself, because I tried to keep playing, and I was
losing some rawness. So I had to go through a year of weak beats,
of corny beats. Then, after I got those out of me, I started
getting some good ones again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to do anything on a track. Now, I'll do anything with a
different tool. The griminess is what made Wu-Tang stand apart. But
clear griminess, imagine that. Before, you turned my stuff up past
seven, and it would distort. Now you can probably make it to nine
before it distorts, so your car is more fuller with me now. But
that old RZA crookedness, that weirdness about me, still exists.''

 NEW YORK: still exists.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The RZA's latest burst of activity surfaces this month. ``Bobby
Digital'' arrives as an album on Nov. 24 and as a straight-to-video
film early in December. At the same time, Sony Music plans to
release a greatest-hits album of his Wu-Tang productions. If he has
time, he said, he'd like to make a Christmas single, a hip-hop
version of the Bing Crosby hit ``Do You Hear What I Hear?'' Diggs
learned it in the choir at Curtis High School on Staten Island,
before he was thrown out of the group.
</P>
<P>
   And next spring comes the RZA's solo album, tentatively called
``The Cure,'' which comes from a persona different from Diggs'
Bobby Digital character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby tends more to his lower nature, whereas RZA tends to his
higher nature,'' Diggs said. ``But I couldn't do the RZA album
until I got this Bobby Digital out of me. I couldn't let the RZA
speak without showing that I spoke from life. And while I was doing
the music, I figured I might as well do the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs met only indifference when he approached movie studios for
financing. ``I'd been thinking about doing it for two to three
years, but I always was told, `You don't want to spend your own
money,''' he said. ``They had me scared. I've been going to
Hollywood to see what the movie world had to offer, but everybody
was saying, `You need a script.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a phat idea, but I ain't got no time to write a
script. And I don't need no script. Just give me the money, and
I'll show you what I can do. I'm a good investment. Anybody who
invested into us in our time, they gained. How many people can say
that in business, period?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Diggs decided to follow the lead of the New Orleans
gangsta rapper and movie maker Master P, who has built an empire on
rap albums and homemade, direct-to-video movies. ``Master P gave me
the freedom. He proved that it could be done and it could be
profitable,'' Diggs said.
</P>
<P>
   With $800,000 of his own money, Diggs made ``Bobby Digital.'' He
was the star and the director. He used the advice he got from
directors like Warren Beatty (who used some of the RZA's music for
``Bulworth'') and the action-movie master John Woo; he also came up
with a wish list for new technology, like camera lenses that allow
the actor to see his own reflection, along the lines of mirrored
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a one-page plot outline and a lot of
improvisation. ``Whoever was there that wanted to get into a scene,
he was in the scene,'' Diggs said.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Bobby Digital is a Don Juan and a street fighter.
``A lot of kids in my age and generation, we grew up on comic
books, movies, video games, the arcades and hip-hop,'' Diggs said.
``That's who this guy Bobby Digital is. He's like a comic hero from
the early 1970s, and a mack like the guys that kept the women in
the blaxploitation films.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the kung-fu martial arts are in it, and the
present-day street mentality is part of it. And it has the surreal,
as well as the future, whether it's the prophesized idea of the
future or the imaginary idea of the future. It's all
incorporated.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind its action, Diggs said, the movie also sets out to
de-escalate street violence from gunplay to martial-arts
fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gunplay ain't the way,'' he said. ``The situation ain't that
damn serious that you got to kill someone. Most of the cases that
you've got in these courtrooms is something that could have been
handled with a smack in the face, maybe. But to actually go ahead
and take this guy off the planet for something that has no value,
that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The RZA always keeps a keyboard nearby. He has 17 of them
scattered around his house on Staten Island, and he had brought one
to the hotel for the night. He turned it on and put in a computer
disk, and out came one of the hundreds of musical tracks he has
stockpiled: instant Wu-Tang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make beats all day,'' he said. He stopped when he
found a track with a hopping, stuttering bass line, answered by the
plink of a piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're whispering to each other,'' he said. Then,
unexpectedly, the bass slid downward. ``When you're rhyming, that
part makes you go crazy,'' he said with a smile. ``I could write to
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggs started improvising lyrics above the bass line. ``You
can't rhyme without design,'' he declaimed. ``When I speak my
dialect, that's the craziest wreck, make your whole body get upset.
You catch the bass, we make tapes, there's no escape, a Wu-Tang
masterpiece tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He switched off the keyboard. ``I'm just freestyling, catching
thoughts,'' he said. ``I'm trying to catch something right now.''

   ELN-NATION-RDP (Undated) _ Stunned by the Democratic resurgence
in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans attack each
other over who was to blame for their failure to score the
traditional opposition party gains in the sixth year of a
presidency. By Alison Mitchell. With photo and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-ASSESS (Undated) _ News analysis: The presidential campaign
of 2000 begins, like it or not. The millennial election will be
fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines, if not
its exact boundaries, were drawn by the voters in Tuesday's
elections, which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy
hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently
ailing Democrats. By R.W. Apple Jr. (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   ELN-DEMOCRATS (Undated) _ Politicians and strategists in both
parties say the Democratic successes in the elections stem from a
fundamental misreading of the electorate by the Republicans: In the
face of polls for nine months showing that voters were not
particularly exercised by the White House sex scandal, Republicans
persisted in trying to make it an issue. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-MINN-VENTURA (Bloomington, Minn.) _ Jesse Ventura has given
up body-slamming Hulk Hogan. He's quit wearing a pink feather boa
and glitter shorts. He no longer pummels alien invaders with Arnold
Schwarzenegger or plays characters who snarl things like ``I ain't
got time to bleed.'' In an earth-rattling political upset, the
former ``bad boy'' on the pro wrestling circuit, action flick
actor, Navy SEAL and talk radio shock jock, became the next
governor of Minnesota. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   ELN-NY-SENATE _ There were a host of reasons why Charles Schumer
defeated Al D'Amato, but ultimately it was because Schumer brought
to his challenge to D'Amato a single-minded forcefulness and
discipline unlike anything D'Amato had encountered before. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   BOMB-INDICT (New York) _ Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi
exile who is wanted in connection with the bombing of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, is indicted, along with a top
aide, on charges of conspiracy to kill Americans abroad. By
Benjamin Weiser. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RDP (Moscow) _ Russia will be unable to pay its foreign
debt next year and will seek to restructure the loans, Russia's top
economic aide say. The warning by the aide, Yuri Maslyukov, is the
first time the Kremlin has stated it will be unable to meet its
debts. The admission comes as Russia is reeling from a collapsing
currency, a disastrous harvest and a yawning budget deficit. By
Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   MIDEAST-U.S. (Washington) _ After intensive efforts by U.S.
diplomats, the Wye River agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians is back on track and will be presented to the Israeli
Cabinet, probably on Thursday, American officials say. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   GONE-WITH-THE-WIND (Undated) _ For several years St. Martin's
Press and the trustees who control the rights ``to protect and
exploit'' the imperishable ``Gone With the Wind'' have been
hungering for a chance to do a second sequel to the novel. That's
been no secret, but the stunning coup they believed they were going
to pull off is to enlist the talented best-selling novelist Pat
Conroy, who very much wants to write the book. By Martin Arnold.

HOUSTON PARADE TO CELEBRATE RETURN OF GLENN, DISCOVERY CREW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Houston will celebrate the Discovery crew's return
with a downtown parade Wednesday, Nov. 11 that coincides with
Veterans Day, Mayor Lee Brown announced at a luncheon where
astronaut John Glenn spoke during a live transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also wished a happy 82nd birthday to veteran journalist
Walter Cronkite, who broadcast a CBS radio network show from the
Houston Forum event on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect birthday greetings from outer space,''
Cronkite said.
</P>
<P>
   He then launched into a series of questions on the mission and
NASA's 40th anniversary of the signing of legislation that led to
its creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped the space station would be here by now,'' Glenn
said in response to what he expects from the space program in the
next 40 year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of demands on our budget,'' said Glenn, a
retiring U.S. senator. ``But we didn't try to solve all the
problems before we moved off the East Coast or we'd still be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the International Space Station by United States,
Europe, Russia, Japan and Canada is to establish a permanent human
presence on a lab in space by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the need of promoting math and sciences to children,
Glenn said, ``They can build any kind of world they want to make,
but they need to get a good education.''
</P>
<P>
   His contribution to atrophy and immune system experiments will
help reverse the natural process of aging, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps astronauts on longer missions and could take away
some of the frailties of aging on Earth,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, chief NASA administrator from Washington, D.C.,
also attended the event and made his predictions on the future of
the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 40 years, we will send robots out into space. In 40 years,
we will answer the age-old question of life beyond Earth. We will
be mining asteroids and comets,'' Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 40 years, I see a thriving tourist industry into space. In
40 years, an American astronaut will crunch her boot on the dusty,
red surface of Mars and the first word will still be `Houston,' ''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In jest, Goldin said, ``In 40 years, John Glenn will be training
for his third space trip. He'll be 117 years old, but will be in
the shape of a 65-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Goldin presented Cronkite with NASA's
Distinguished Public Service Medal, highest honor that the agency
presents to a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Cronkite the country's ``eminent space reporter,''
Goldin said, ``As John Glenn is an American hero, Walter Cronkite
is also an American hero.'' &QL;

REPUBLICAN APPEARS TO HAVE WON KENTUCKY SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ After one of the closest and most bitterly
fought Senate races in the country, Rep. Scotty Baesler, the
Democrat, all but conceded defeat Wednesday to his Republican
rival, Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Baesler said that while he had not formally conceded
the race, he had withdrawn his earlier demand for a recount and had
called Bunning late Wednesday morning to congratulate the
Republican on his apparent victory. With 99 percent of the
precincts reporting, Bunning had received 567,951 votes, or 50
percent, while Baesler had 560,888 votes, or 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning, a staunch conservative who had a 17-year career in
major league baseball before his election to the House in 1986,
will take the seat being vacated by the state's Democratic senator,
Wendell Ford, who is retiring from the Senate after 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning's victory means that Kentucky will have two Republican
senators for the first time in a quarter century. ``This is better
any time than getting into the Hall of Fame,'' Bunning said in
claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Baesler, a centrist Democrat who first came to
prominence in the state as captain of the University of Kentucky
basketball team, said that a formal concession may not come until
after state election officials conduct a review of statewide ballot
procedures _ a so-called recanvassing, a far less onerous procedure
than a recount. The recanvassing is expected to take about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Baesler's press spokesman, Mark Riddle, said the congressman
was largely resigned to defeat. ``We don't expect the recanvassing
to pull this out for us, to produce some kind of miracle,'' Riddle
said. ``This was a tough, hard-fought Kentucky political race, and
we're proud of what we accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough is an understatement for this Senate race, which saw
Bunning run television advertisements that featured snippets of a
campaign speech by Baesler last summer in which he gestured
dramatically, to the accompaniment of Richard Wagner's ``Ride of
the Valkyries.'' Democrats, noting that Wagner was Adolf Hitler's
favorite composer, said the advertisements were a crude attempt to
portray Baesler as a fascist.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning sought to define himself as a moderate and a defender of
Social Security, repeatedly reminding voters that he is the
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Social Security. Baesler
accused him of lying about his record, noting that he had often
voted in the House against programs to help the elderly and
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning's triumph was also a victory for Sen. Mitch McConnell,
the state's other senator, chairman of the Senate Republican
campaign committee and a key opponent of campaign financing reform.
McConnell, a key strategist for Bunning, directed large
contributions to his campaign. He did not want a loss in his own
back yard and was especially eager to see the defeat of Baesler,
long a champion of campaign reform.

DAVIS' WIN POINTS TO INCREASING INFLUENCE OF HISPANICS
</HEADLINE>
   (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic Party's first
white male nominee for governor of California since 1978, won that
prize for his party for the first time in those 20 years on Tuesday
by piecing together a broad coalition that cut across virtually all
voter groups, including two-thirds of moderates and half of whites.
</P>
<P>
   But when the next history of California politics is written,
Davis' election may also be seen as an important milestone on the
steady path toward the moment when the demographics of California's
electorate _ long disproportionately white _ catch up with the
demographics of its increasingly diverse and Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters made up about 13 percent of the statewide
electorate on Tuesday, still well below their 20 percent share of
California's total adult citizen population, but a bit more than
their 10 percent share in the 1994 governor's race and more than
double their 5 percent share in 1990. Davis drew nearly eight in 10
Hispanic votes, compared with fewer than two in 10 for his
Republican opponent, state Attorney Gen. Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat, Assemblyman Cruz Bustamante of Fresno, won the
race to succeed Davis as lieutenant governor, becoming the first
Hispanic official to be elected statewide in more than 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   All that is in no small measure the legacy of the state's
retiring Republican incumbent, Gov. Pete Wilson, who first won
office eight years ago with nearly half the Hispanic vote. But in
1994, when Wilson defeated his Democratic challenger, state
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, with a vocal and polarizing campaign to
halt illegal immigration, his share of the Hispanic vote fell to
just under 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Wilson sponsored a ballot measure, Proposition
187, to curtail illegal immigration that featured television
commercials of immigrants streaming across the border as an
announcer intoned: ``They keep coming and coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has insisted he meant to target only illegal immigrants,
but even some leading Republicans have said the campaign was
ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well they have kept coming, and they're going to be a much
larger percentage of the vote,'' said Mervin Field, the dean of
California poll takers. ``They're a more integrated part of the
society now, and they're clearly voting with the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, California Republicans have struggled
in vain to rebuild their support among Hispanic voters, and among
moderate voters over all, and Lungren ran extensive advertisements
on Spanish-language radio and television. But the effort fell far
short of Republican hopes. With all precincts reporting in
unofficial returns, Davis defeated Lungren 58 percent to 38
percent, an even bigger margin than Wilson's lopsided victory over
Ms. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Wilson took just over half the votes of
moderates, a quarter of Democrats, half of women and all
socioeconomic groups except the very poor, according to surveys of
voters leaving the polls. This year, Lungren lost all those groups,
and held only the slightest edge over Davis among white men.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, Davis emphasized his Army service in
Vietnam, his support for the death penalty, his wariness about new
taxes, thereby neutralizing Lungren on such traditionally GOP
issues and putting the attorney general on the defensive on
abortion, gun control, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This great victory is more than just electing a candidate for
governor,'' Davis told his supporters on Tuesday night. ``It is a
clear affirmation that Californians want to take a moderate path to
the future. That is who I am, that is how I ran, and that is how I
will govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, by contrast, Ms. Brown, the sister of Jerry
Brown and daughter of Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, California's last two
Democratic governors, won the votes of just over four in 10
moderates, just under four in 10 men and just under seven in 10
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   The overall electorate here remains about three-quarters white,
so it was not surprising that it was a white male Democrat who at
last prevailed, though analysts acknowledged it was an interesting
twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director for the
Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research and
polling group in San Francisco. ``But I think the demographic
shifts are finally beginning to show themselves in elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a combination of the gender gap and the ethnic and
racial gap that were all working toward the benefit of the
Democrats. As we talk about half the population of California being
minority in the not too distant future, this really points to the
importance of having a strategy to reach out to those people,''
Baldassare said.

 &HT;    TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC COALITION A HURDLE FOR GOP IN 2000
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The key to the Democratic Party's surprising
election success was putting together a coalition of ethnic
minorities and women, spurred by an unprecedented get-out-the-vote
effort that included taped telephone messages from President
Clinton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a large turnout across the board among the
traditional Democratic coalition,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Wednesday as both parties reviewed general election
returns looking for clues to a White House strategy in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party ``owes a great deal'' to minorities,
especially African Americans, said Pat Harrison, the co-chair of
the Republican National Committee (RNC).
</P>
<P>
   While winning minorities and women has long been difficult for
the Republican Party, the performance of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the current front-runner for his party's presidential
nomination, suggests an opportunity for the GOP in 2000. Bush, in
his successful re-election bid, won 65 percent of women, 49 percent
of Hispanics and 27 percent of African Americans, unusually high
numbers for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Jeb, in winning the governorship of Florida,
succeeded to a lesser extent in cutting into the Democratic core
constituencies. Jeb Bush lost all but 14 percent of black voters,
but won half of women voters and took 61 percent of the Hispanic
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, national exit polls indicate how far the Republican Party
must go in order to compete for women and minorities. Nationwide on
Tuesday, Democrats won 51 percent of the women's vote, 88 percent
of the African American vote and 59 percent of the Latino vote.
</P>
<P>
   When the late Lee Atwater took over as RNC chairman in 1989, he
advocated a ``big tent'' strategy, recognizing that the GOP could
not become a majority party without women and minorities. But in
the ensuing years, the party has done more to alienate women and
ethnic minorities than to welcome them into the GOP tent.
</P>
<P>
   While the party won control of Congress in 1994 with a
relatively narrow base of white, religious conservatives, it lost a
handful of seats in the House on Tuesday and failed to expand its
55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Republican governors such as Bush coasted to easy
victories by shunning the ideological purity of their congressional
leaders while emphasizing compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   These candidates campaigned on an ``inclusive political
philosophy that unites voters around a positive conservative agenda
of individual freedom and liberty, strong families and economic
opportunities,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of the
Republican Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose when our dominating message is one of rigid
ideology,'' Miller added.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican losses in some key races Tuesday appeared to be
due as much to the Democratic Party's eleventh-hour
get-out-the-vote campaign among minorities, especially African
Americans, as it was to the rigid conservative ideology of the GOP
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party targeted minority and women voters in 30
states, reaching them with a massive $30 million telephone campaign
in the final days before the election. Telephone calls featured
recorded messages from the Clintons and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scripts, written for Hillary Clinton, read in part:
``The Republicans have spent the last two years talking about
everything but issues. ... They're counting on the fact that solid
Democratic voters, like African Americans, will stay home on
Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   States that received such messages responded with high turnouts
of women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for example, Democrat Charles Schumer collected 87
percent of blacks, 59 percent of women and 82 percent of Latinos to
defeat three-term GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   And in California, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer survived a
strong challenge from Republican State Treasurer Matt Fong, an
Asian American. Boxer got 57 percent of women, 85 percent of blacks
and 72 percent of Hispanics. Surprisingly, she also won the Asian
American vote, 54-44.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In other states, where Hispanic voters were not a factor, the
appeal to black voters proved effective:
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, Democrat John Edwards got 90 percent of
blacks and 59 percent of women in defeating Republican incumbent
Sen. Lauch Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   _ In South Carolina, Democrat Jim Hodge received 92 percent of
blacks and 55 percent of women in his winning campaign against Gov.
David Beasley, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also in South Carolina, veteran Democratic Sen. Fritz Hollings
survived a challenge from GOP Rep. Bob Inglis, winning 91 percent
of blacks and 55 percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Alabama, Democrat Don Siegelman ousted Republican incumbent
Gov. Fob James on the strength of 94 percent of blacks and 61
percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Georgia, where the open gubernatorial seat was targeted by
the GOP, Democrat Roy Barnes defeated Republican Guy Millner,
winning 90 percent of blacks and 55 percent of women.

   ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Gov. Fob James represents more than a loss for the
Republicans. It also represents a stunning setback for the
Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   James, a longtime champion of fundamentalists and a man who had
espoused such causes as school prayer, posting the Ten Commandments
in state courtrooms and teaching creationism, was soundly beaten by
Don Siegelman, the Democratic lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman campaigned hard on the need to improve schools and
proposed a state lottery to pay for it. He also picked up the
support of many business leaders who felt James' image was hurting
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, a Democrat turned Republican, easily won
re-election, defeating Clayton Suddith.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also easily passed a constitutional amendment ``to
prohibit the burdening of the free exercise of religion unless
government demonstrates it has a compelling interest in doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   In an important victory for Democrats, Blanche Lincoln won a
seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lincoln, a former congresswoman, defeated State Sen. Fay
Boozman, a conservative who sponsored legislation to ban an
abortion procedure called partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lincoln's seat was left vacant when Dale Bumpers, a
24-year-incumbent, decided to retire.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Mike Huckabee, the former lieutenant
governor who became governor in 1996 when Jim Guy Tucker was
convicted of fraud and resigned, defeated his Democratic
challenger, Bill Bristow, a Jonesboro lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In an acceptance speech, Huckabee, the first Republican elected
governor since 1980, gave special thanks to the large number of
Democrats who supported him.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent was well-known throughout the state because he is
representing Danny Ferguson, a co-defendant with President Clinton
in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Mark
Pryor, a former state representative, beat attorney Betty Dickey.
The race was being watched closely because the winner will sit on a
board responsible for redrawing legislative districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, the son of the former president and brother of the
Texas governor, won in his second attempt to become governor of
Florida, defeating Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay and leading the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost narrowly the last time around, Bush, a real estate
developer, fortified himself with plentiful money and a centrist
platform. MacKay trailed Bush the entire campaign, and the voters
soundly rejected his appeal to choose a Democrat to counterbalance
the Republican-dominated Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Florida may have been the most incumbent-friendly state, with
hardly any federal officeholder there in jeopardy. Sen. Bob Graham,
a Democrat, trounced his Republican challenger, Charlie Crist,
sometimes called ``Chain-gang Charlie'' after he sponsored a law to
put leg irons on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   All 23 House members won re-election, most in uncontested races,
and only one _ Corrine Brown, a Democrat _ had a tough race. She
defeated Bill Randall, a former president of the Jacksonville
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Roy Barnes, a conservative Democrat, won the
governor's office by a surprisingly solid margin in a race that had
been widely expected to be far more competitive. Barnes, whose Cobb
County district incorporates Atlanta's northwest suburbs,
emphasized such issues as health-care reform and reducing property
taxes in defeating the Republican Guy Millner, a wealthy
businessman, in the race to succeed Zell Miller as Governor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' victory means Democrats maintain their 130-year hold on
Georgia's top office, a situation that no longer looks so anomalous
in the Deep South, given the re-capture by Democrats in Alabama and
South Carolina of the governor's offices there.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, who spent more than $11 million of his own money,
suffered his third defeat in a run at statewide office in four
years. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1994 and senator in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for a Senate seat, Paul Coverdell, a first-term
Republican incumbent, defeated the Democrat Michael Coles, founder
of the Great American Cookie Co. Coverdell broke a pattern for that
seat, which had changed hands between parties every six years since
1980.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   With a razor thin margin, the Republican Jim Bunning claimed
victory in the one of the country's hardest fought Senate races.
The campaign was to fill the seat of the state's retiring
Democratic senator, Wendell Ford. The defeat of the Democratic
candidate, Rep. Scotty Baesler, was a victory, too, for Kentucky's
Republican senator, Mitch McConnell, who recruited Bunning, a
congressman and Hall of Fame pitcher, and was deeply involved in
the campaign. The campaign was a rough one, with intense television
advertising and each man accusing the other of lying.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans nationally made Bunning's campaign a priority,
viewing the seat as one of the most likely to shift from Democratic
to Republican hands.
</P>
<P>
   But because the campaign was the only one in the country that
pitted two representatives against each other in a battle for a
Senate seat, Kentucky was also the site of two important and hotly
contested House races. In the race for Bunning's seat, the Democrat
Ken Lucas defeated Gex Williams, while in the race for Baesler's
seat, the Republican Ernie Fletcher defeated the Democrat Ernesto
Scorsone.
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was sleepy even by the standards of off-year
elections. In the only statewide race, Sen. John Breaux, a
Democrat, crushed State Rep. James Donelon, a Republican. Four
other candidates each got one percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux outspent Donelon very heavily, and beyond television
advertisements, he barely campaigned.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven House races, five incumbents had no opponent and
one faced two political unknowns. In the seventh, Richard Baker, a
Republican seeking a sixth House term, won a close race against
Marjorie McKeithen, a lawyer in Baton Rouge. The daughter of the
secretary of state and granddaughter of a former governor, she has
one of the most famous names in the state.

 &HT;    BIG-MONEY INTERESTS WERE BIG WINNERS TUESDAY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the political parties totaled their gains and
losses Wednesday, special interest groups and their hefty political
donations emerged as the clear winner in the record-setting $1
billion-plus midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   More than perhaps any other factor, money was the predictor of
victory. In 94 percent of congressional races, the candidate who
spent the most money ended up winning, according to an analysis by
the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan research group.
And in nearly every case, the big spenders were the incumbents, who
enjoy a huge advantage in seeking donations.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that business, labor and other special interest
groups almost assured themselves of an attentive ear for their
causes in the new Congress. Some groups also poured money into
state races and won ballot initiatives, including measures to
extend casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public distaste over the role of money in politics,
voters provided no strong mandate for campaign finance reform.
Voters in Massachusetts and Arizona approved ``clean election''
initiatives that would offer public funds as an alternative to
private campaign donations. Meanwhile, a hero of the campaign
finance movement, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., survived a
squeaker against his challenger, Republican Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   But in Kentucky, the Democratic senatorial candidate, Rep.
Scotty Baesler, failed in an attempt to make reforming campaigns a
decisive issue and was defeated by Republican Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   And elsewhere, big bucks fund-raising failed to stir much
controversy, even as the two national parties raised more than $162
million in unregulated ``soft'' money for party operations, more
than double the amount raised in the last midterm election.
Republicans raised the most, $96 million, and President Clinton set
a new benchmark for presidential fund-raising as he criss-crossed
the country to attend more than 100 events to collect money from
major Democratic contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interest groups whose contributions played a role in
the campaigns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Banking, finance and real estate, as a group, were the top
contributors, giving more than $98 million to parties and
candidates, according to a study by the the Center for Responsive
Politics. In the key race, the re-election campaign of Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R-NY, this financial
sector gave generously to both sides. They donated about $1.2
million to D'Amato and about the same to his victorious challenger,
Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer.

<P>
   _ Organized labor contributed more than $38 million to
campaigns, chiefly to Democrats, and ran TV spots in selected
districts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gambling interests expanded their political involvement
dramatically, pouring more than $4.1 million into federal races.
The industry's political action committees increased their
donations by 90 percent compared to the 1996 congressional
elections. The gambling lobby successfully staved off an effort in
the last Congress to repeal the tax deduction for gambling losses.
</P>
<P>
   In states, the pro-gambling interests contributed to Democrat
Jim Hodges' defeat of Republican Gov. David Beasley, an outspoken
opponent of video poker. In Missouri, the gambling interests spent
$10 million to win backing for a ``boats in moats'' measure to
extend riverboat gambling to boats docked in off-river ponds. The
Kansas City Star reported that the opponents could muster only
$160,000 against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters approved a measure to permit Indian casino
gambling. It was said to be the most expensive ballot initiative
fight ever, estimated by the Los Angeles Times to cost $95 million,
with competing Nevada casino interests leading the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tobacco interests poured more than $1.4 million into this
year's federal elections, and Phillip Morris ranked as the largest
single giver to Republicans. Tobacco suffered at least one setback
when their favored candidate, Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., lost to
Democrat John Edwards. However, in the Kentucky Senate race,
smoking interests couldn't lose, since they donated to both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Congress, the tobacco lobby defeated a $368 billion
settlement ending state lawsuits that would have raised taxes on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care groups divided over the proposed ``patients' bill
of rights,'' which was killed by Republican opposition in the last
Congress. In one switch, the American Medical Association, which
favored the legislation, appeared to transfer some of its money
away from Republicans, who got 67 percent of AMA's $1.6 million in
donations in this year's campaign, compared to 77 percent two years
ago.

   MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Shows, a conservative Democrat, won the state's most
interesting House race, for the Fourth District seat being vacated
by Rep. Mike Parker, a Republican. Shows had name recognition as an
elected highway commissioner and former state senator. He defeated
Delbert Hosemann, a tax lawyer in Jackson, who tried to portray
Shows as a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's four other congressional districts, the
incumbents kept their seats. Two winners, Roger Wicker and Charles
W. Pickering Jr., are Republicans. And two, Bennie Thompson and
Gene Taylor, are Democrats. Mississippi voters have not defeated an
incumbent congressman since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Lauch Faircloth, a two-term Republican incumbent, lost his
Senate seat to a political newcomer, John Edwards, after portraying
Edwards as a ``Clinton liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a telegenic lawyer specializing in personal injury
cases, spent more than $5 million of his own money and argued that
he would not be beholden to special interests. He did not focus on
Faircloth, but called for more government regulation of health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth tried to persuade voters that Edwards had never done
anything productive.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mel Watt, a black Democrat, was re-elected, defeating Scott
Keadle, a Republican who is white. The district was redrawn last
spring after courts found it unconstitutional, and now has a white
majority.
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA
</P>
<P>
   The solid victory by Gov. Frank Keating, the popular Republican,
immediately provoked supporters to say he was a prospect for vice
president or even president. Gov. Keating, who worked in the Reagan
and the Bush administrations, did little to quiet such speculation.
The defeated Democratic candidate, Laura Boyd, a family therapist
from Norman, told supporters: ``We were drowned in a sea of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican senator, Don Nickles, the majority whip,
easily won re-election. Support for Nickles, the second-ranking
Republican in the Senate, had been so strong that he had been able
to campaign in other Senate races around the country and the
Democrats had trouble finding an opponent. The Democratic
candidate, Don Carroll, an air conditioner repairman, had won his
spot on the ballot in a runoff with a woman who had died by the
time of the primary vote. Carroll said he was satisfied that he had
given Oklahoma voters a choice.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Former State Rep. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, was elected governor
in a surprise victory over David Beasley, the Republican who has
held the office for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat, beat back a strong challenge
and won the right to another term in the Senate, where he has
served since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley was initially expected to win this year. But Hodges
scored a political upset with his call for ``education reform,''
financed by a state lottery. Hodges said South Carolinians should
have an opportunity to vote on a lottery, now banned in the state
constitution, to fix ``David Beasley's mess'' _the public schools.
Hodges hailed his victory as a ``mandate for better education.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists in South Carolina said the election became
a referendum on Beasley. Hodges was helped by a large turnout among
black voters. He won support from some moderate Republicans. And he
received financial support from the video poker industry, which
Beasley tried to ban this year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 32 years in the Senate, Hollings remains the junior
senator, behind Strom Thurmond. Hollings was put on the defensive
this year by his Republican challenger, Rep. Bob Inglis, a
three-term congressman. Inglis, a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, had called for the resignation of President Clinton and
had hoped to capitalize on voter outrage over the White House sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The five House members running for re-election, including
Lindsey Graham, a Republican, and John M. Spratt Jr., a Democrat,
won their races.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Don Sundquist, the Republican incumbent, easily won
another term as governor, a job he came to in 1994 after 12 years
in the House, where he served on the Ways and Means Committee.
Sundquist was so heavily favored that it was hard to find a
challenger, and even when John Jay Hooker, who had the Democratic
nomination in 1966 and 1970, stepped up for a third shot, it was
never an all-out campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker, a Nashville lawyer, was an unusual candidate who stayed
clear of Vice President Al Gore's Tennessee appearances because of
a decade-long feud with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hooker, whose Minnie Pearl fried-chicken franchise
failed in the 1970s, tried to focus the race on campaign finance,
he remained better known for suing state agencies and announcing
that he wanted to hold his fund-raiser in the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Sundquist emphasized his record on welfare reform and improved
programs for children.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents prevailed in all nine of the state's congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush, a Republican who campaigned hard among
Hispanic voters, was re-elected by a landslide, the first Texas
governor to win consecutive terms in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the governor _ speaking in Spanish about good schools
and safe neighborhoods _ filled Texas airwaves. Polls showed that
the strategy paid off big, with Bush winning more than 40 percent
of the Hispanic vote. That kind of showing will likely elevate
Bush's standing among potential Republican candidates for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic population, which will soon be the largest minority
group in America, is an important target for both parties in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were counting on Bush's popularity to sweep several
other Texas candidates into office. Rudy Izzard, a dentist and
former San Angelo Mayor, ran a strong but unsuccessful Republican
campaign against Rep. Charles Stenholm. The 10-term Democratic
incumbent was re-elected to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm's campaign, which raised twice as much money as his
challenger's, emphasized the congressman's conservative views and
his political independence. But in an increasingly Republican
district, he struggled until election day to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, another 10-term Democratic incumbent, also
faced a challenge. Frost, the chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, spent as much time fighting for
his own seat as he did fighting for Democrats across the country.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Shawn Terry, 31, a management
consultant, accused the congressman of distorting his record to
appear conservative. Frost attacked his challenger as too young and
inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   There was no close race in Virginia, and no voting for governor
or senator this year. Three House Democrats ran unopposed.
Independents tried unsuccessfully to unseat House incumbents. But
Republicans and Democrats squared off in only four of the state's
11 districts. Every House member was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   James Moran, one of the few House Democrats who had voted for a
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry, won with 67 percent of the vote.
Rick Boucher and Robert Scott, both Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee, were returned to office, as was the Republican
Robert Goodlatte, another member of the impeachment panel.

REJECTION OF GAY RIGHTS MEASURE IN OGUNQUIT TERMED DIVISIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians, who have lived in harmony with the straight
community in Ogunquit, Maine, for decades, said the town's
rejection of a gay-rights ordinance means more tension and less
tolerance in that seaside tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ogunquit has always had the reputation for being an
open-minded, tolerant community, but I don't think that's the case
anymore,'' Albert Dello Russo, a member of the town's Planning
Board, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town that calls itself `Beautiful Place by the Sea' now
needs an asterisk,'' he said. ``It's a beautiful place if you're
gay as long as you don't push it.''
</P>
<P>
   As voters in South Portland were handily approving a citywide
gay-rights ordinance, Ogunquit voters rejected a similar measure by
just nine votes, 383-374, prompting calls for a recount.
</P>
<P>
   And in a double-barrel defeat for gays and lesbians, Ogunquit
easily rejected a bid to recall a member of the town's board of
selectmen, who had said he could not ``accept homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Selectman John Miller was allowed to keep his post on a 473-304
vote in a local election that drew 65 percent of the town's
registered voters to the poll _ a turnout voting officials said was
the second highest in Ogunquit's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sick to my stomach,'' said David Mills, co-owner of a
bed-and-breakfast and a leader of the measure that would have
barred discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing,
credit, and public accommodations. ``It's more shock and disbelief
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Ogunquit's vote was more about politics and
personalities than a true measure of gay rights support.
</P>
<P>
   Ogunquit had overwhelmingly opposed a Feb. 10 referendum which
rescinded Maine's gay-rights law, leaving the state the only one in
New England without such a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a real gauge of how people are thinking,'' said David
Garrity, vice president of the Maine Lesbian and Gay Political
Alliance. ``A lot of people were offended at the idea of taking
this out personally on Mr. Miller. I wouldn't be surprised if a
measure comes up before town meeting and passes before the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many residents interviewed before the election said they
feared that because the bid to recall Miller and the gay-rights
ordinance shared the same ballot, voters would consider the choice
between a long-time town servant and the gay-rights ordinance
mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   And now, they said they fear the fallout of Tuesday's decision
will be unmistakable once tourism begins next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine gay people, or people who have gay relatives
or friends, coming to this town for any reason whatsoever,'' Dello
Russo said. ``Ogunquit is a nice place, but it isn't so
geographically wonderful that it overrides something that is this
serious socially.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Littlefield Seaman, a 68-year-old amateur historian
whose roots in Ogunquit date to 1643, said predictions of economic
calamity because of Tuesday's vote are ``baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing is for everybody to forget about the
damn thing,'' said Seaman, who said he opposed Miller's recall and
supported the gay-rights measure. ``We've had gay people here for a
hundred years and they haven't bothered anybody. It's just a few
people who are causing all the problems. I hope this publicity
stops and people forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Hagen, a 66-year-old retiree who chairs the local
Planning Board, said there is little chance of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be put on the town warrant in April for the town meeting
and if it's voted down then, it'll probably be put on the ballot
the following year,'' he said.

 &HT;    GRAMM SET TO TAKE OVER BANKING COMMITTEE
 &HT;    854&AMP;add.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thanks to New York voters, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is set to become chairman of the powerful Senate committee
that oversees banks, stocks and bonds, international trade, housing
and public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has massive economic powers,'' Gramm said of the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee he will lead in the
wake of Tuesday's defeat of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been chairman of the panel since January 1995, but
he lost to Democrat Rep. Chuck Schumer, leaving Gramm as the most
senior Republican on the 18-member committee and its de facto
chairman come January.
</P>
<P>
   How powerful is the committee? Gramm told New York Republicans
before the election that D'Amato had better win, or Gramm's first
act as chairman would be to move the New York Stock Exchange to
Dallas and Merrill Lynch to Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joke, but it was funny only because the Banking
Committee chairman, like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, really does have the power to
``move markets'' _ Wall Street parlance for causing stock prices to
rise or fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's ascension ``is the single most important change to come
out of this election,'' said Micah Green, executive vice president
of the Bond Market Association, the trade group that represents
cities, counties, companies and other entities that raise money by
selling bonds. ``When we are facing global economic insecurity and
uncertainty in our own economy, the chairman of the Senate banking
committee can be very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who has served on the securities subcommittee, most
recently as chairman, offered a quick rundown Wednesday of the full
committee's importance and his own goals as its leader:
</P>
<P>
   ``The banking committee has massive jurisdiction over many
things that affect the economic well-being of the people of Texas
and America,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``My goal as chairman
will be trying to ensure a strong and vibrant economy that will
create jobs and quality products for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In areas like housing, I want to make private ownership of
housing easier, less expensive. I want to make financial services
more available and cheaper to businesses and consumers. I want to
use the export-control and foreign-trade functions of the banking
committee to try to promote trade and job creation in Texas and
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In areas like HUD and mass transit,'' he said, ``I'm going to
work to see that those services are delivered more efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development, known as HUD,
is one of the agencies that may feel the early brunt of an
innovation Gramm plans to bring to the banking committee: the
addition of an investigations subcommittee. Gramm said the
subcommittee would examine such issues as fraud in public housing
and inefficiency in public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to not only write law but enforce the laws we
write,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Though Gramm has been in Congress for 20 years, writing and
passing laws may present his biggest challenge as a committee
chairman. He is good at blocking legislation that he opposes _ this
year's effort to reform Depression-era banking and securities laws
died because Gramm objected to a piece of it _ but even his
supporters are anxious to see how he negotiates the compromises and
trade-offs necessary to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His beliefs on issues are very deeply held,'' Green said. But
``the process of producing legislation doesn't always mesh well
with the desire for ideological consistency. And it happens to be
an ideology we agree with.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions of leaders of other banking and securities groups were
mixed Wednesday. Some of them were bitterly disappointed that Gramm
blocked the bill to overhaul financial services; others,
particularly among small banks and savings and loan associations,
were ecstatic with Gramm's stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many S&AMP;Ls had some serious concerns about the financial
modernization legislation, and I think everybody was very pleased
that not only did Senator Gramm stand up against it ... he almost
single-handedly stopped it,'' said James L. Pledger, commissioner
of the Texas Savings and Loan Department. Gramm's chairmanship of
the banking committee ``will be a great deal for Texas,'' Pledger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities Industry Association, whose members _ investment
banks, stock brokers, dealers and mutual fund companies _ wanted
the reform bill, issued a statement that first congratulated
Sen.-elect Schumer, then delicately reminded Gramm that ``he has
long been an advocate of examining outdated laws and regulations
which hinder competition in the marketplace. We look forward to
working with Senator Gramm. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Scurlock, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of Texas, said members of his group ``are
delighted'' with Gramm's impending chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very good thing for Texas,'' he said, ``and adds to
the already significant clout that Texas enjoys in the leadership
and raises the visibility of the Texas delegation significantly.''

   ``Odgen Nash was onto something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long,'' begins Glicksman in this humorous essay. She fondly recalls
the days when ``a laptop was where you sat a child'' and ``a
compatible interface was what you hoped for on blind dates.''
Echoing the frustration of many a PC user, she wonders, ``Why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian
novel?'' (slugged:

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>

 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

<P>
   ILLINOIS
</P>
<P>
   Carol Moseley-Braun, the nation's first black female senator,
was ousted by a wealthy conservative Republican who attacked her
for ``six years of scandal and controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton frequently visited Illinois in an effort
to help Ms. Moseley-Braun, but the Democratic senator could not
overcome criticism of her 1996 visit with the Nigerian dictator
Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican victor, Peter Fitzgerald, bombarded voters with
television commercials criticizing the trip to Nigeria and
highlighting allegations that Ms. Moseley-Braun and a former
campaign manager had spent $281,000 in 1992 campaign money on
vacations, cars and jewelry. Fitzgerald, a State senator, spent
large amounts of his own money on the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Those who voted for Fitzgerald often mentioned ethical standards
as the issue that mattered most to them; Ms. Moseley-Braun's
supporters often cited Social Security as the issue most important
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans held onto the governor's office. Voters chose George
Ryan, the Illinois secretary of state, over Rep. Glenn Poshard, a
Democrat from downstate Illinois, to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a
Republican who is retiring after eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   In the hottest House race, Rep. Lane Evans, a Democrat, held
onto his seat in the Rock Island-Moline area. With strong support
from labor and environmental groups, he defeated the Republican
candidate, Mark Baker, a former television newsman who also ran
against Evans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats retained Poshard's seat in the 19th Congressional
District, as David Phelps defeated Brent Winters, the Republican
candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA
</P>
<P>
   Talking the talk of a conservative, and even at times shunning
his own party, Evan Bayh, a Democrat, decisively won the seat in
the Senate that was once held by his father, Birch. Commercials for
Bayh, who resigned from the governor's office in 1996 with an 80
percent approval rating, repeatedly called him ``bipartisan'' and a
``fiscal conservative'' and never mentioned the word ``Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the commercials, which attempted to distance Bayh from
the sex scandal enveloping President Clinton, the candidate's wife
promised that Bayh would take ``Hoosier values'' to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bayh's victory was a tough loss for Republicans, who had held
both Indiana Senate seats since the late 1970s. He will replace
Sen. Dan Coats, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   The fight to replace Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat who retired
after 34 years in Congress, was close until the final votes were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   In her third run for Congress, the Republican candidate, Jean
Leising, 49, swept across the district accompanied by notables like
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and Jack F. Kemp. But in the end,
it was the Democrat, Baron Hill, 45, who emerged the winner by a
close margin.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's campaign painted him in the image of Hamilton, a
studious, mild-mannered Democratic stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning upset, Tom Vilsack, a state senator, became the
first Democrat in a generation to be elected governor of Iowa. It
was the second disappointment in a row for Jim Ross Lightfoot, who
two years ago had come close to unseating Tom Harkin, the state's
Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   At a victory celebration, Vilsack, who had been behind in the
polls by as much as 20 percent, gleefully held up a sweatshirt with
the slogan ``Underdog is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack had benefited from an infusion of money from Harkin's
political action committee. He had gained rapidly in the polls
during the final week or two of the campaign, despite a barrage of
negative advertising by Lightfoot.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of voters leaving polling stations, conducted for The
Des Moines Register, said that those who considered education the
most important issue voted heavily for the Democrat, while those
who thought tax cuts were most important tended to choose the
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, the Republican incumbent, Charles Grassley,
was an easy winner over State Rep. David Osterberg.
</P>
<P>
   All three House incumbents, two Democrats and a Republican,
easily held on to their seats. Republicans retained control of the
Iowa state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Except for a surprising upset in one of the state's four
congressional districts, incumbents did very well with Kansas'
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Graves, the popular moderate Republican governor, won a
second term against his Democratic challenger, Tom Sawyer, a state
representative who never caught up after waiting until the eve of
the filing deadline to declare his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, the heir to a family trucking fortune, greatly outspent
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Senate, the incumbent Republican, Sam
Brownback, defeated Paul Feleciano Jr., a Democrat. Brownback
joined the Senate two years ago when he won a hard-fought special
election to complete the term left vacant when Bob Dole ran for
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the geographically compact 3rd Congressional District, which
includes Kansas City and Lawrence, a former prosecutor and
Democratic challenger, Dennis Moore, upset Vince Snowbarger, a
conservative first-term Republican who had won a close race in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other three Republican incumbents in the
congressional delegation faced tough opponents.
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, the Republican, easily won a third term in a
campaign in which the Democrat, Geoffrey Fieger, seemed to be
running not so much against the incumbent as against his own very
feisty mouth. Fieger had called Engler a ``moron'' and referred to
Jesus as a ``goofball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, a lawyer who represents Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the advocate
of assisted suicide, spent more than $3.5 million of his own money
on the campaign, to little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats kept their distance from Fieger. Vice President
Al Gore flew to Michigan to help congressional candidates who had
feared going down with the top of the ticket. None did, although
David Bonior, the House minority leader, was re-elected with just
52 percent of the vote, a low showing for an incumbent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fieger lost every county except Wayne, which encompasses
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Sander Levin, seeking a ninth term in the House, beat back a
challenge from Leslie ouma, a former aide to Engler.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian himself was on the ballot in a way, in the form of a
ballot initiative that would have created a procedure for legal
doctor-assisted suicide for patients with less than six months to
live. Voters rejected it decisively.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office

   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.

 UNDATED: it decisively.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNESOTA
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, a onetime professional wrestler running as a
third-party candidate for governor, stunned the state's political
establishment by defeating the nominees of the two main parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shocked the world,'' said Ventura, a talk show host and
former mayor of the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park. ``Nobody
thought we had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   A colorful, straight-talking populist, Ventura ran strongly
among young voters, combining an anti-tax message with
moderate-to-liberal positions on social policy.
</P>
<P>
   He defeated the Democratic candidate, Hubert H. Humphrey 3rd,
the son of the former vice president, and the Republican, Norm
Coleman, mayor of St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura ran catchy, unconventional commercials, one of which
showed a Ventura action figure fighting off ``evil special interest
man.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no change in the state's House delegation, as
incumbents won in all eight districts.
</P>
<P>
   MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bond, Missouri's Republican senator, defeated his
Democratic challenger, Attorney General Jay Nixon. The Democratic
candidate, a proven statewide vote-getter, had assailed what he
called the senator's ``Washington life style.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a conservative who is a member of the powerful
Appropriations Committee and has been an outspoken critic of
President Clinton, had been considered vulnerable because he won
his previous two races with small margins of victory. Nixon is
popular in the state, having received more votes than any other
statewide candidate in the 1996 election. But Nixon's efforts to
reduce state spending on court-ordered school desegregation lost
him some support among black voters, a key to success for
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After spending more than $8 million, mostly on advertising, the
state's casino companies convinced voters to amend the state
constitution and give them the right to operate casinos built
inside man-made basin that are located within 1,000 feet of the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Many casinos have spent millions
building inside the basins, but a State Supreme Court ruling last
year determined that in order for those casinos to operate, they
had to be situated on the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   NEBRASKA
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-year absence, Republicans captured the governor's
mansion as Mike Johanns, the two-term mayor of Lincoln, easily beat
Bill Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob Kerrey. Johanns' victory
completed a remarkable political rise for him that began in May,
when he was the surprise winner in a primary against Representative
Jon Christensen and John Breslow, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Touting his record as mayor, Johanns was able to overcome having
changed positions on a major ballot initiative to restrict growth
in state and local government spending and taxes. The initiative
was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In the House races, two incumbent Republicans, Doug Bereuter and
Bill Barrett, won easily. For the seat vacated by Christensen, Lee
Terry, a Republican Omaha city councilman, defeated Michael Scott,
a former television news anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH DAKOTA
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent Democratic senator, Byron Dorgan, breezed to
re-election. Dorgan had virtually ignored his opponent, Donna
Nalewaja. and outspent her, raising more than $1.7 million to her
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter race for the House seat drew most of the
post-election attention. The Democratic incumbent, Earl Pomeroy,
defeated the Republican challenger, Kevin Cramer, with 56 percent
of the vote. It was the second time the two candidates had faced
each other and the second Pomeroy victory. Cramer said he was
leaving the door open to yet another face-off in two years.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO
</P>
<P>
   The Taft name is gold in Ohio, where Secretary of State Bob
Taft, the Republican candidate for governor, defeated former
Attorney General Lee Fisher. In 1990, Taft, the great-grandson of
President William Howard Taft, ceded the Republican nomination for
governor to George Voinovich, then mayor of Cleveland. But this
year, with Voinovich barred by law from re-election and pursuing
the Senate seat vacated by John Glenn, Taft had a clear shot at the
governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a Cleveland lawyer and great-grandson of a sheet-metal
worker who emigrated from Russia, campaigned as a people's
candidate who planned to slash property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Voinovich won a seat from the Democrats, sweeping
to victory against Mary Boyle, a former majority whip in the State
House of Representatives. School financing was a big issue in Ohio,
where voters last spring overwhelmingly rejected a Voinovich-backed
proposal to raise the state sales tax for education. Ms. Boyle
charged that Voinovich had let the schools decline.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH DAKOTA
</P>
<P>
   Bill Janklow, the populist Republican governor, swept to a
record forth term, despite lingering concerns about his health. He
was hospitalized for most of March after he developed a
life-threatening infection while recuperating from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent was Bernie Hunhoff, the State Senate
minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow, a maverick Republican, told supporters on election
night that he would work for affordable health care and housing,
and education appropriate to a global economy. ``No one gets left
behind on this trip into the future unless they want to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow has worked closely with Sen. Thomas Daschle to bring
federal farm aid to the state. Daschle, the Senate minority leader,
coasted to an easy victory in his race for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN
</P>
<P>
   Although he seemed at times about to be swamped by his
Republican opponent's heavy television advertising, Sen. Russell
Feingold, a Democrat nationally known as an exponent of campaign
finance reform, won a close victory over Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who drew strong support from in and around Madison and
Milwaukee, promised to continue pushing for campaign reform as a
second-term senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican known for his welfare reforms,
solidly won a fourth term by defeating his Democratic opponent, Ed
Garvey, a lawyer and former executive director of the National
Football League Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's congressional races, Neumann's seat remained in
Republican hands, won by Paul Ryan, a former congressional aide. In
the 2nd District, where Scott Klug, a moderate Republican, is
retiring, State Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, won election to
become the first female House member from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th District, historically a Republican preserve, returned
to the party's hands when State Rep. Mark Green defeated Rep. Jay
Johnson, a Democrat seeking a second term.

 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For several years St. Martin's Press and the trustees who
control the rights ``to protect and exploit'' the imperishable
``Gone With the Wind'' have been hungering for a chance to do a
second sequel to the novel. That's been no secret, since the
publisher is reported to have paid $4.5 million for the privilege.
But the stunning coup they believed they were going to pull off was
to enlist the talented best-selling novelist Pat Conroy, who very
much wants to write the book.
</P>
<P>
   The clandestine negotiations have involved Conroy, his agents,
two book publishers and the trustees and have gone on for nearly
two-and-a-half years. The good news for the trustees was that
Conroy wanted to write the book, and the bad news was that he
wanted to write the book. (His way.) This week the trustees gave
the novelist the OK to write, uncensored, whatever he wants, and
the deal, for the moment at least, is as close as trees on a
plantation road to being closed. But nothing has been signed, and
some of the trees could still be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   The bargaining has been as theatrical as life at Tara, largely
because of Conroy's outrageously bold contemplation that he might
kill off Scarlett O'Hara. When the trustees finally focused on
that, the idea held such terror it was as if they had run smack
into General Sherman on the sidewalk in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For Conroy the issue was a simple one of censorship. No one
could tell a novelist what to write. He wasn't a writer for hire,
but rather a serious artist, and the killing off of Scarlett, if
that's what he decided to do, was not only his right but would give
him the challenge and luxury of writing what would very likely be
the most memorable literary death scene since Anna Karenina threw
herself under a train. He was willing to walk away from a weighty,
seven-figure advance rather than surrender any control.
Negotiations broke down late last month, and the project seemed
over for Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   Which to many would have seemed unfortunate indeed, since
Conroy's entire concept for his novel was grandly impertinent. It
was to be written in the first person, and titled, ``The Rules of
Pride: The Autobiography of Capt. Rhett Butler, CSA.'' It was not
to be a sequel of the original, Conroy said, and certainly not a
sequel to the best-selling sequel, ``Scarlett'' (Warner Books,
1991) by Alexandra Ripley. Rather, with the audacity of an artist,
he prepared himself to write what he called ``a companion'' novel
to the original. Rhett's story, not Scarlett's. Equal to, although
not entirely separate from, ``Gone With the Wind.'' Ms. Ripley's
book was an actual sequel to the original, and thus she did not
have quite the leeway that Conroy will have.

   ``I thought I was going to do a work of art, that I could
contribute something to the genre of sequel by taking this with
utter seriousness as if my life depended on it,'' he said, in a
telephone interview from his home in South Carolina. Conroy is a
believer in signs, and three such mystical signals told him he had
to do this book, he said.
</P>
<P>
   First, he was watching the television show ``Jeopardy,'' and one
of the answers was the name Margaret Mitchell. He then learned from
his father that he and Mitchell, both Roman Catholics, were
baptized in the same church. Later, an aunt told him his mother,
whose name was not Margaret, was called Peggy all her life, in
honor of Mitchell. These made it a must for him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sequels, or anything like them, are fraught with danger and
usually meet with failure, and this project had a distressing
beginning. First, St. Martin's Press planned to have Emma Tennant,
their author of two Jane Austen sequels, write a sequel to Ms.
Ripley's sequel. But Conroy arrived on the scene. He said that the
trustees first demanded there be no homosexuality or miscegenation.
``I told them that if they insisted on that,'' he recalled, ``I'd
write the novel with this first sentence: `After they made love,
Rhett turned to Ashley Wilkes and said, ``Ashley, have I ever told
you that my grandmother was black?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to that demand ``would have been extraordinarily
demeaning to `Gone With the Wind,' and I wouldn't sign that,''
Conroy said. The trustees, two Atlanta lawyers, Paul Anderson Sr.
and Hal Clarke, backed off, and Conroy thought the censorship issue
was dead, until he met last week with them, their agent, Owen
Laster of the William Morris Agency, and the two publishers in the
New York office of his agents, International Management Group-Bach.
Then, for the first time, the trustees raised the issue of
Scarlett's possible mortality. In a lawyerly way, according to
several who were present, the trustees backed away from directly
banning a death scene but said they wanted final control over what
was published. The project expired with that demand, only to come
alive again on Monday when the trustees decided that they really
wanted Conroy and surrendered.

</P>
<P>
   The idea of Scarlett's dying had actually come to Conroy from
his dying mother, for whom ``Gone With the Wind'' was almost a
secular Bible. ``She thought that Scarlett would be one of the
great death scenes of literature; of course, she was talking about
her own death scene,'' Conroy said.
</P>
<P>
   In a handwritten letter more than two years ago to the
publisher, St. Martin's Press, setting out his concept, he casually
mentioned the possibility of Scarlett's death. Conroy said he never
heard a word about it until the Oct. 26 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have gone along with her not dying,'' he said, ``but
they were also talking about editorial control, of their having
final approval. That I couldn't go along with.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy came to the project in a singular way. When the 60th
anniversary edition of Margaret Mitchell's novel was published by
Scribner in 1996, Conroy wrote a preface for it in which he
movingly discussed what ``Gone With the Wind'' had meant to his
mother and to his own childhood, and his feeling about the South.
``For the most part, I was raised in a house without books, but the
ones displayed and laid out flat for the inspection of visitors
were the Bible and `Gone With the Wind,' in no particular order of
importance,'' he wrote in the preface. ``To Southerners like my
mother, `Gone With the Wind' was not just a book, it was an answer,
a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``If you could not defeat the Yankees on the
battlefield, then by God, one of your women could rise from the
ashes of humiliation to write more powerfully than the enemy and
all the historians and novelists who sang the praises of the
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The preface touched the people at St. Martin's Press and
Anderson and Clarke, who are the literary trustees for the estate
of Mitchell's son, Stephens Mitchell. They badly wanted Conroy, the
author of the best-selling novels ``Beach Music'' and ``The Prince
of Tides,'' (both Nan A. Talese/Doubleday). But Conroy was under
contract to Doubleday for another book, and the publishing house
didn't want him to go off and write what could be a very visible
best seller for a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   So the people at Random House, of which Doubleday is a division,
weren't terribly unhappy when it seemed the deal was off,
particularly since they knew Conroy wouldn't have finished with
Rhett until the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But under the arrangement finally worked out, Nan Talese will
edit the book for her rival publishing house, and Bantam Books,
another Random House division, will publish the paperback.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scarlett, well, in book publishing anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even bringing her back from the dead for another sequel. After
all, tomorrow is another day.

EVERY MICROCHIP SINGS: FLAT IS BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Swatch's super-thin Skin line of watches, each barely a
membrane with display wrapped around the wrist, to flat-front
computers and television sets, flatness is the hardware quality of
the moment. Laptop computers from Sharp and Sony, with cases of
semiprecious magnesium, brag of being ``no thicker than a
magazine,'' and business gurus celebrate ``flat'' organizations,
with fewer layers of management. Managerial efficiency is abetted
by flat devices like Rex, a credit-card-size Rolodex, a
quarter-inch thick, with a flat set of round buttons used to call
up 6,000 addresses, numbers or appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of high-definition television this month signals
another call for the flat screen hung on the wall, so long promised
and yet so slow in arriving. There are flat-panel displays, from a
42-inch, $12,000 video-conferencing unit at Sony's Madison Avenue
showcase to $1,500, 15-inch computer monitors from Compaq, Apple,
NEC and others. Sony's new Trinitron Wega televisions, while still
restricted to conventional broadcasts, are sold under the tag line
``Flat Out Flat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too thin,'' cries Calista Flockhart, the star of
``Ally McBeal'' in People magazine, but I've noticed that this
year, the desks of the sitcom's law firm are prominently decorated
with flat panels instead of old-fashioned monitors. Flat-panel
computer displays, taking up less room on the desk, are also
digital and therefore cutting edge. The chunky, conventional
cathode ray tube monitor, by contrast, is analogue and as out of
date as a record player or the horn-shape speaker of a Victrola.
IBM has plastered Manhattan with posters that present its flat
computer panels, photographed in stark profile like the rockers or
rappers in adjacent posters.
</P>
<P>
   Flat is a variant of thin, which is a variant of small. And
small in the late-20th century is the mark of technological
virtuosity, expense and chic. None of the physical paradoxes of
``Flatland,'' Edwin Abbott's Victorian science fiction classic
about a race that lives exclusively in two dimensions, can match
the psychographic paradoxes of flat products. In the age of the
image, flatness expresses a disdain for the hardware. The hardware
that displays the images seems an afterthought, almost an
embarrassment, a baggage from the physical world dragged into the
electronic one of appearances _ the sorry character behind the
screen showing the face of the mighty Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the boastful ads about flat technologies, I think of the
old country line about the man who's so thin that when he turns
sideways, he disappears. But flatness is also about attracting
attention. ``Want to get noticed?'' Sony asks in the ads for its
VAIO 505 Superslim notebook computers, which will make you
``totally streamlined _ fully empowered.'' Rivalries over smallness
are a familiar paradox of the high-tech age.
</P>
<P>
   John Plunkett, the former creative director of Wired magazine,
said that he laughs to see the ``power suits'' fighting over who
has the smallest phone or laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think thin equals small, and small equals new _ that is,
expensive _ and therefore a potent new power symbol,'' Plunkett
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The flat panels are expensive indeed. (Although the financial
crisis in Asia, where they are manufactured, has made them more
affordable.) But the technological state of the art _ and therefore
the frontier of technological fashion _ is as fleeting as the image
on a screen. I read that on the horizon are flat television or
computer screens of ``organic light emitting diodes,'' which can be
printed on plastic sheets and handed around like postcards or
unrolled and hung up like tapestries or theater sets.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with flat things may reflect our wider unease
about the relationship between the image and the object. Consider
that the artists of the moment are champions of flatness. Jackson
Pollock, subject of a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art,
and Jasper Johns, whose landmark ``White Flag'' was just bought by
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, recall the days when the critic
Clement Greenberg championed their fidelity to the two-dimensional
picture plane _ their flatness, in other words. Is flat the most
extreme form of shallow, or in a culture ruled by images, is flat
deeper than it looks?

WHITE HOUSE WASTES LITTLE TIME IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL
SECURITY AGENDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, confronting an adversarial
Congress for his remaining two years in office, deemed Tuesday's
elections a ``vindication'' of the Democrats' agenda and called
Wednesday for lawmakers set aside partisanship for policy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House wasted little time in promoting the
administration's agenda as the president convened his economic and
political team before the cameras to tout a conference next month
on Social Security reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the election is over, it is time to put politics
aside and once again focus clearly on the people's business,''
Clinton said, his calm demeanor understating the euphoria at the
White House over unexpected Democratic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Weathering Clinton's sex scandal, the party picked up five seats
in the House to cut the Republican edge to 223-211 with one
independent. In the Senate, Republicans retained their 55-45
advantage, but fell short of projections that they might gain up to
five seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a vindication of the policies and of the general
policy of putting partisanship behind progress and of putting
people before politics and of trying to find ways to bring people
together inside of to divide them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president again promoted the five issues that the
administration highlighted throughout the election season:
education, the environment, the economy, Social Security reform and
a patient's bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said his members will
reach out to moderate Republicans in an attempt to form a new
majority to enact much of the Democratic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we can construct a working majority with
moderate Republicans that can help make this next Congress vastly
more productive than the last,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Hollsworth, a political science professor at Virginia
Commonwealth University, foresees even more political skirmishes
between the Democratic White House and the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going see a lot of fighting between them, but
I'm not sure you're going to see an extensive agenda. I'm not sure
the public wants a large agenda,'' said Hollsworth. ``In reality,
the public expressed a lot of contentment with how things are going
right now and if the public has an agenda it is to keep the good
times rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a presidential expert at the Brookings
Institution, agreed that their was little chance of a ``new
brotherhood pact'' between the Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Clinton's) got two years to go now. I think it changes that.
I think there's no question he's going to limp across the finish
line. But he also is guaranteed for the last two years an
opposition Congress that has a very different agenda while at the
same time he becomes increasingly a lame duck president,'' Hess
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton showed this year that even while damaged by the
threat of impeachment he remains a formidable opponent who knows
how to use the veto and the bully pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the ``No. 1 lesson'' for
Republicans was the need for an agenda to save Social Security and
a large tax cut. ``Those two themes would carry the largest weight
in the broadest part of the Republican Party,'' Gingrich said. ``It
returns us to the kind of positive themes that made the `Contract
with America' (the 1994 GOP agenda) successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Sosnik, Clinton's senior policy adviser, said this election
marks a changing world where the public has rejected negative
attack ads from candidates who have little to say about the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a changing world we're in. There's an incentive in the
political marketplace to get things done,'' Sosnik said. ``Our
agenda is what the country wants.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans who survived an election scare will be
unlikely to make the same mistake of allowing themselves few
accomplishments to run on. ``I believe they are going to have
incentive to work with us on our agenda, which is very popular out
there, to get things done,'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some agenda will beat no agenda anytime,'' complained Randy
Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, about the
Republicans lack of message. &QL;

VOTE BOOSTS CLINTON ROLE IN PEACE EFFORT, MITCHELL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ George Mitchell, who helped negotiate the
historic Irish peace treaty, said Wednesday that this week's US
elections had bolstered President Clinton's ability to press for
implementation of both the Irish agreement and the recently
concluded pact between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats had fared poorly in Tuesday's balloting, said
Mitchell, it could have undermined Clinton's authority at home and
abroad because the outcome would have been perceived as a public
condemnation of the president's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. The
former senator from Maine said that, instead, voters made it clear
they want politicians to turn their attention away from the sex
scandal and onto ``more serious'' policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously intangible ... but very clearly his position
has been strengthened, and any doubts about him have been resolved
in his favor,'' Mitchell said in an interview before speaking at
Tufts University. ``That's bound to have an effect on both the
Irish and the Mideast questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell made no bones about his bias in assessing this week's
voting. He said he was ``delighted'' by the results and described
himself as a ``committed Democrat.'' His evaluation of Clinton's
post-election stature echoed that of many analysts in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell implied that Clinton's enhanced standing came at a
potentially important time, as glitches have arisen for the
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli and the Irish accords.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the latter, Mitchell expressed confidence that
too much progress has been made for the process to fall apart
easily, especially since residents of both the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland resoundingly voted for peace earlier this year.
``I believe it has a momentum that will enable it to endure,'' said
the onetime Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview and in his address, Mitchell sounded less
sanguine about the prospects in the Middle East, though he
predicted that peace eventually will be achieved there. Though he
did not explicitly say so, his view of Clinton's power seemed to
apply more to that region than to Ireland since US leverage,
particularly in Israel, has been an integral part of negotiations
between the Jewish state and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell came to Tufts Wednesday to be the fifth annual speaker
at a lecture series endowed by Issam Fares, a wealthy Lebanese
businessman whose youngest son attended the university here. Past
speakers have included former President George Bush and former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Given Mitchell's background _ his mother was Lebanese and his
paternal grandparents were Irish emigres _ he seemed pleased about
the subject of his address: The lessons Middle East peace advocates
can draw from his three-plus years of bargaining with
representatives from the north and south of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they are distant lands,'' he said near the start of
his remarks, ``in both, the highway of peace runs directly through
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell went on to outline the ways in which Middle East
negotiatiors can learn from their Irish counterparts. Among them
was ``a genuine willingness to understand the other point of
view,'' along with ``courage and perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell said all parties must commit themselves to
implementing a pact they reach and not just revel in the fact that
one has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be self-evident,'' said Mitchell. ``But often just
getting an agreement is so difficult that the natural tendency is
to celebrate, then go home and relax. But as we are now seeing in
Northern Ireland ... and in the Middle East ... getting it done is
often harder than agreeing to do it.''

PRAGMATISM, NOT IDEOLOGY, COUNTED IN GOVERNORS' RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the country in Tuesday's elections, governorships were
won by pragmatic politicians who spurn the hard-edged ideology that
dominates both parties in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That was true of most governors who were re-elected, like George
Pataki of New York, John Rowland of Connecticut, Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin and Bill Graves of Kansas, all Republicans, and Howard
Dean of Vermont, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and John Kitzhaber
of Oregon, who are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It was true of newly elected governors like Gray Davis of
California and Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Democrats who depicted their
Republican opponents as arch-conservatives, and Mike Johanns of
Nebraska and George Ryan of Illinois, Republicans who went to great
lengths to seize the middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was true of the most surprising winner on Tuesday, Jesse
Ventura, the former professional wrestler with the shaved head who
was elected governor of Minnesota as a third-party candidate. A
survey of voters as they left the polls showed that they placed
Ventura solidly in the center of the Minnesota political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   And it was especially the case with the Bush brothers, George W.
in Texas and Jeb in Florida, both Republicans who took moderate
positions on the issues and reached out to the black and Hispanic
voters who normally support Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, at a news conference in Austin, Texas, George
W. Bush described himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' and
declared: ``One of the things the Republicans sometimes tend to do
is say what we're against. I like to say what I'm for.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first official action after the election, Bush
reappointed Mike Moses as education commissioner. The governor and
Moses have had a stormy relationship with a group of extreme
right-wing Christian conservatives who have tried to take control
of the Texas Board of Education. The group failed to achieve a
majority in Tuesday's elections. The quick reappointment of the
commissioner was a way for the governor to stick a finger in the
group's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush lost his first race for governor four years ago in
large part because many voters were turned away by his stridently
conservative style. This year he took a quieter, more judicious
approach. ``Life is a journey,'' he told a reporter recently. ``I
hope I never stop learning.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Jeb Bush announced that his
transition team would consist of a black man, a Hispanic man and a
white woman, and he promised that diversity would be one of the
main elements he would consider in making government appointments.
</P>
<P>
   As for Davis, whose success in winning the governorship in
California was the Democrats' biggest plum, he said in his victory
statement that his triumph was ``a clear indication the voters want
to take a moderate path in California.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``That is who I am. That is how I ran. And that is
how I will govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 governorships contested on Tuesday, Republicans won 23
and Democrats won 11. In addition to Ventura in Minnesota, Angus
King, an independent who on most issues is carefully positioned in
the middle between Republicans and Democrats, was re-elected
governor of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   That means Democrats will have 17 governorships next year, the
same number they had going into the election. Republicans will have
31, one fewer than they have this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be successful, most governors, especially those from large
states, find it necessary to mute their ideology to appeal to a
broad range of constituents. One who did that successfully was Gov.
Paul Cellucci, a Republican from Massachusetts, one of the most
reliably Democratic states. Cellucci, who took office last year
when Gov. William F. Weld resigned, was elected on Tuesday to a
full four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   James Thompson, a moderate Republican who was governor of
Illinois for 14 years beginning in 1977, said he could not have
remained in office for so long had he not worked hard to win
support from urban liberals in Chicago and rural conservatives
downstate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Thompson, who now practices law in
Chicago, said, ``Governors are expected to get things done, to
reach across party lines, to pass legislation rather than consider
it year after year, to make things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kean, who was governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990, said
successful governors tended to emphasize issues like education,
taxes and the environment rather than ideologically hot topics like
abortion and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter so much what you say as what you do,'' said
Kean, a moderate Republican who is now president of Drew University
in Madison, N.J. ``In Congress, you are judged on what you say. As
governor, you are judged on what you do.''

N.H. GOP SHAKEN BY STRONG VOTE FOR INCUMBENT GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>

 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  CONCORD, N.H. _ For nearly two decades, New Hampshire was one
of the most Republican states in the nation. In many years, it sent
no Democrat to Congress and yielded no Democrats statewide
positions higher than minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The state's status as a Republican redoubt foundered in 1996
when Jeanne Shaheen became not only the state's first female
governor but the first Democrat to hold the office in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, GOP ground shook again when Shaheen dealt rival Jay
Lucas the worst defeat of any Republican gubernatorial nominee this
century; it shook even further when Democrats took control of the
state Senate, for the first time since 1912, by a 13-11 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this says a lot about the political skill of Governor
Jeanne Shaheen,'' said Tom Rath, a Republican strategist and former
state attorney general. ``I've never been shy in expressing my
admiration for that skill, but this was a really impressive
demonstration of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who defeated Lucas with 66 percent of the vote as
opposed to her opponent's 31 percent, campaigned aggressively for
Democratic candidates in the last weeks of the campaign. Her
efforts made the difference in several close Senate races,
including an acrimonious contest in central New Hampshire between
former House Democratic leader Rick Trombly and Republican
incumbent Amy Patenaude.
</P>
<P>
   With one week to go before the election, the Union Leader of
Manchester linked Trombly with a gay social group.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans held control of the 400-member House, the
change in the Senate raised hopes that the state will be able to
resolve its school-funding crisis. The state Supreme Court has set
an April 1 deadline to replace an unconstitutional system that
relies almost totally on local property taxes to fund education.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike, however, warn that a
Democratic-controlled Senate does not mean that the solution to the
crisis will be a statewide sales, income, or property tax. Shaheen
has repeatedly said she would veto any such effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of it is that this does not mean that we are about to
see a major change in the state's tax structure,'' said Edgar
Helms, former state Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Claremont school funding suit, filed by a coalition of poor
towns, is in its eighth year.

DEMOCRACY'S STRENGTH LIES IN SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Americans pondered the news that DNA tests
show Thomas Jefferson fathered a son born to his slave, Sally
Hemings, the nation's political leaders continued last week to
reject a far more important part of Jefferson's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   They ignored _ some might say violated _ his staunchly-held
principle that there should be a strict separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, less than 48 hours before voters began trekking to
the polls, President Clinton visited a large, predominantly black
Baptist church in Baltimore, where he was accorded a hero's welcome
and the right to speak to the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the purpose of his visit was to persuade
parishioners to exercise their right to vote. But his deeper
purpose was to assure a sizable black turnout on election day for
Maryland Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening's bid for a second
term.The effort paid off. Glendening defeated his Republican
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two places, only two, where we have fulfilled
both the admonition of the Scriptures and the promise of the
founders that all of us are created equal,'' the president told the
enthusiastic parishioners. ``One is when you come into your house
of worship on Sunday and the other is when you show up at the
ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's use of a church to achieve political objectives was
questionable, but he was not alone in resorting to such tactics.
</P>
<P>
   While he was speaking from the pulpit in Baltimore, the
Christian Coalition was distributing some 35 million voter guides
in parishes from coast to coast. The guides listed the stand of
office-seekers on important political and moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   Religious right leaders claimed the effort _ similar to others
conducted in recent national elections _ was designed only to
inform voters where candidates stood on such matters as abortion,
school prayer and a constitutional amendment to require a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it was designed to persuade conservative Christians
to vote for Republican candidates as they had done overwhelmingly
in 1994 when the GOP regained control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   From pulpits across the land, some clergymen made it quite clear
that, according to their religious precepts, the conservative way
is the Christian way. Black ministers and some of their white
brethren made it equally clear to their parishioners that they
believe liberalism is the Christian way.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were finally tallied in last week's amazing
midterm election, the drive to get black and Hispanic voters to
support Democrats had proved more successful than the one led by
the religious right on behalf of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The mixing of religion and politics is not new in our country.
Since the earliest days of the republic, office-seekers have sought
to win votes by invoking the name of the Almighty and the doctrine
of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, men like Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed and Jerry Falwell
have launched massive campaigns to create a large conservative
Christian base within the GOP. To a large degree, they have
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the leaders of the great civil rights movement of the
1960s were ministers dedicated to achieving equal opportunity and
justice or blacks. During that same period, some of the clergy
actively opposed the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have twice nominated a Catholic for president, and
each time the candidate faced opposition from Protestants, who
feared the pope would dictate policy to the president. But, at the
same time, the candidates drew strong support from their fellow
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats chose New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith in 1928,
they lost several states in the heavily Protestant South that had
voted Democratic since the Civil War. Outside the South, Smith
carried only Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which had large
numbers of Catholic voters.
</P>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960, a group of prominent
Protestants, led by the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, decided
privately to oppose him because of his religion. But word of their
action became public and probably helped Kennedy rather than hurt
him.
</P>
<P>
   While losing six heavily-Protestant southern and border states
that traditionally voted Democratic, he benefited from a large
turnout of Catholics in the North.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal law prohibiting politicians from exploiting
religion for their political gain. There is no firm rule that men
and women seeking votes cannot do so in a house of worship.
</P>
<P>
   But Jefferson feared the merging of church and state, which he
felt had had a debilitating effect of some foreign nations. Even in
death, he wanted his position known to future generations.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the inscription that appears on his gravestone at
Monticello, and it reads: ``Here was buried Thomas Jefferson,
author of the Declaration of Independence, of the Statute of
Virginia for Religious Freedom and the father of the University of
Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have every right to seek laws to implement their
deeply-held views. But the church is not the place to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Much of America's greatness stems from its observance of
separation of church and state. In our land, we have many
denominations and houses of worship. All should be protected and
honored, but they should not dictate the manner in which we
implement democracy's most cherished ritual, the vote.

PARROT MAY HAVE LIVED DURING DINOSAUR ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new report suggests that the dinosaurs may have had some
unexpected and colorful company during the final years before their
demise: Parrots, which are considered the most intelligent of
present-day birds.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny fragment of fossilized bone that has been lying in a
drawer at the University of California, Berkeley's museum of
paleontology since about 1960 may turn out to be the remains of the
only modern land-dwelling bird ever found to have lived during the
dinosaur age.
</P>
<P>
   The piece of a lower jaw from fossil beds in Wyoming appears to
come from a parrot, writes graduate student Thomas Stidham in a
report in the journal Nature, being published Thursday. If so, it
would be by far the earliest parrot, and the earliest land bird of
any kind, ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it could help to illuminate the long-debated link
between birds and dinosaurs. Some paleontologists consider birds to
be direct descendants of the dinosaurs, while others think that
both descended from some earlier common ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   This find suggests that many other types of modern birds may
also have existed in the last part of the Cretaceous period _ the
final chapter of the dinosaur age _ Stidham suggests. And, he adds,
it would imply that ``modern bird groups, including parrots, may
have been relatively unaffected by the mass extinction'' that
killed off the dinosaurs and about three-quarters of all species
alive at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But the find would be so surprising, some paleontologists said
Wednesday, that it would require something much more substantial
and definitive than a tiny jaw fragment to convince specialists in
the field of bird evolution that this really was a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so important that we probably shouldn't try to
make the claim off an ambiguous specimen,'' said Larry Martin, a
paleontologist at the University of Kansas who specializes in bird
fossils. Martin, who is known as one of the leading skeptics about
many claims of early bird fossils, said that judging by the
photographs, he's not even sure the fragment is really a lower jaw,
much less a parrot. But, he added, it's impossible to be sure since
he has not seen the actual specimen.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bakker, one of the paleontologists who has long promoted
the idea that today's birds are direct dinosaur descendants, said
Wednesday that if this really was a parrot, it would have been
``just about the most intelligent creature found in the Cretaceous.
A parrot has a brain about 20 times larger than the smartest mammal
of the late Cretaceous.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem with the claim, Bakker said: For birds as
advanced as parrots to have appeared at such an early age, he said,
either they would have to have evolved about a thousand times
faster than any other kind of bird has been known to, or else they
were around for many millions of years earlier without leaving any
other fossil remains that have yet been found. As someone who has
spent many years digging in the hills of Wyoming where this fossil
was found, he said he finds that unlikely, since vast numbers of
bones of similar size, for example from ancient frogs, do show up
in those formations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either alternative is challenging,'' Bakker said. It would be
about as surprising as finding a chimpanzee skull there, he said,
dating from a time when the most advanced mammal known was
something like a tiny-brained hedgehog.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other line of evidence that supports the idea that
parrots may have existed that early on, according to Stidham: Some
researchers say that genetic analysis of modern birds suggests that
virtually all the families of present-day birds did in fact
originate at least that far back _ about 65 to 70 million years
ago. The parrot finding, Stidham wrote, ``supports the hypothesis,
based on molecular divergence data, that most or all of the major
modern bird groups were present in the Cretaceous.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Currie, curator of the Royal Tyrell Museum in Drumheller,
Alberta, Canada, said Wednesday that ``one of the problems there
has been for a long time in dealing with the Cretaceous bird record
is that most of it is ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin doesn't even think this particular case is ambiguous:
``The one thing I can tell from the pictures is it's not a
parrot,'' he said. ``It's an awfully small piece, and it doesn't,
in my opinion, have the characteristics of a parrot.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Clemens, a paleontologist at the University of
California, Berkeley, and Stidham's adviser said that the
identification of this jaw fragment as being from a parrot had been
examined and supported by several specialists in the field of bird
evolution. ``Like any fragmentary fossil, there are always
questions as to its identification,'' he said, but Stidham ``made
the best possible identification, given the material.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Clemens said, the find is ``really quite important,
providing additional evidence that the radiation of modern birds
happened before'' the demise of the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who is skeptical of the idea that environmental changes
caused by an asteroid impact were solely responsible for that
extinction, said that if modern birds did indeed survive through
the extinction, it would raise serious questions about some claims
of just how severe those environmental effects were.
</P>
<P>
   He said that other things were going on at the same time that
also had severe environmental consequences, including massive
volcanic eruptions and changes in the configuration of marine
basins that may have drastically altered the climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Cretaceous,'' Clemens said, ``can be described
as hard times.''

DEMOCRATS INTERPRET ELECTION RESULTS AS SIGNAL VOTERS OPPOSE
CLINTON IMPEACHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Braced by their surprising election wins, Democrats
on Wednesday interpreted the results as a signal that voters oppose
efforts to impeach President Clinton. The assertion was immediately
rejected by House Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials privately gloated over the stronger hand
voters dealt the president on Tuesday, but Clinton and his aides
publicly steered clear of predicting how Republican congressional
losses would affect the impeachment investigation begun a month ago
by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message the American people sent was loud and
clear: We want progress over partisanship, and unity over
division,'' Clinton said, adding that how Republicans proceed with
the impeachment inquiry ``is a decision for them to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Henry Hyde of
Illinois, plans to push ahead with impeachment hearings later this
month, but Democrats said Hyde and Speaker Newt Gingrich would be
wise to wrap up the investigation quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful now that, despite the Speaker's predetermined
views on impeachment, that he will help orchestrate a swift
conclusion to this investigation,'' said House Democratic Leader
Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact is that the American people rejected
Republican obsession with impeachment,'' Gephardt said about the
election in which the Democrats gained five seats in the House and
held the Republicans to no gain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said that
once Republicans analyze the election results they will lose
enthusiasm for impeaching Clinton over his behavior in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. ``The can't feel very good about prolonging
this,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Hyde dismissed the assertion that the impeachment
investigation should be rushed, a position not uniformly held by
GOP House members.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will not ``take a major constitutional duty and
reduce it to the level of who can spin best,'' Gingrich said,
adding that it was the news media _ not GOP lawmakers _ who were
obsessed with Clinton's alleged effort to cover-up his affair with
the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who has said he wants to end the inquiry by Dec. 31, spent
Wednesday in Chicago talking by telephone to committee members. He
is expected to announce a schedule of hearings later this week.
Although a subcommittee is set to meet Monday to discuss
impeachment history, the first full committee hearing probably
would not be held for at least another week, committee aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to
complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner,'' Hyde said in
a written statement that took note of the election results. ``This
was just as true before the election as it is today. Our duty has
not changed because the Constitution has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a member of the Judiciary
Committee, told the Associated Press that the inquiry should move
quickly. Voters in Tuesday's elections ``reiterated they want this
matter behind us,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with voters leaving the polls Tuesday offered a mixed
message for Clinton. While 60 percent of the voters said Congress
should drop the whole Lewinsky matter without even holding
hearings, about one-third thought Clinton should be impeached and
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by Voter News Service, conducted for the AP and five
television networks, found a solid majority approved of the job he
was doing and half said Clinton's ability to lead the nation had
been hurt by the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Potential hearing witnesses mentioned by committee aides include
Clinton confidant Bruce Lindsey, friend and golfing partner Vernon
Jordan, and White House secretary Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   One aide said it was unlikely the committee would call Lewinsky,
but would instead rely on tapes and transcripts from her graphic
testimony before the grand jury used by independent Kenneth Starr
to investigate her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel have not decided whether they want to
summon Starr, who two months ago delivered a report to Congress
alleging 11 potentially impeachable offenses by Clinton stemming
from his affair with Lewinsky. &QL;

HEARING ON PINOCHET EXTRADITION OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's highest court began hearing arguments
Wednesday on whether Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean former dictator,
should be sent home or extradited to Spain to face charges that he
had killed and tortured opponents in his 17-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   As Chilean exiles and relatives of alleged victims looked on,
five judges from the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament,
heard two competing claims:
</P>
<P>
   _They should uphold the decision last week by the High Court
that Pinochet could not be extradited because as a former head of
state he was immune to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   _They should overrule the High Court on the grounds that because
Pinochet had engaged in widespread human rights violations, he is
not entitled to head-of-state immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments are expected to continue today. While a decision
had been expected Thursday, the judicial panel's head, Lord Justice
Gordon Slynn, hinted that the proceedings could drag into next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Before they began hearing arguments, the judges dealt a setback
to those clamoring for Pinochet's extradition, saying they would
limit their review to the legal question of whether the principle
of immunity applied.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want Pinochet put on trial, for crimes against
humanity, voiced hope that even if the judges upheld the High Court
ruling, Pinochet could be held while London adjudicated extradition
requests from other countries, including France and Switzerland,
that have expressed an interest in trying Pinochet. But the Lords
have made the decision stark: Either he goes to Spain or he goes
home.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jones, the lawyer arguing for the Spanish authorities, who
want Pinochet to face charges for killing Spanish citizens, said it
was ``repugnant'' to suggest that Pinochet was entitled to
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said a body of international law, developed throughout the
20th century, belied Pinochet's claim: Because Chileans had
accepted a deal in which he stepped down in exchange for not being
prosecuted, other countries had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to allegations that Pinochet is responsible for
killing more than 3,000 people, including children, and
``disappearing'' another 1,000 who have never been accounted for,
Jones said: ``It is not part of the function of the head of state,
under English or international law, to behave like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said that some of the crimes of which Pinochet is
accused had taken place during, and immediately after, the 1973
coup he led, before he could be considered a head of state.
Pinochet's lawyer, Clive Nicholls, scoffed at that assertion,
saying: ``There's no suggestion that anyone else was head of state
at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 150 people crowded into the Lords' chambers was Isabel
Allende, daughter of Salvador Allende, the leftist Chilean leader
who died after Pinochet overthrew him in a CIA-backed military
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jacob, a senior lecturer in law at the London School of
Economics, said there is no pattern to the Lords overturning High
Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every case is different,'' Jacob said. ``The chief justice,
Lord Bingham, is respected, but he made a very conservative
decision in this case, so it's hard to say which way it will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob left no doubt where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a bad decision,'' he said. ``Under that
reasoning, Hitler could have gotten away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's accusers hope the Lords agree with Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   The case has become a political football here. Conservatives say
Pinochet was a loyal ally in Britain's 1982 Falklands War with
Argentina, and should be allowed to go home. Liberals in the
governing Labor Party say it is a disgrace that Pinochet had come
here regularly to shop at Burberrys and relax with supporters,
including Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher, the former prime minister, treated him to cocktails at
her Belgravia home last month, a few days before he entered a
London hospital for back surgery. Two weeks later, officials in the
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair authorized his arrest as he
recuperated in a hospital bed.

   ALASKA
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat elected in 1994 by a margin of
just 536 votes out of more than 213,000 cast, cruised to an easy
victory this year, thanks in part to infighting among Republicans.
John Lindauer, a businessman, was the Republican nominee. But the
race became utterly confused in late October, when the Republicans
endorsed a write-in candidate, State Sen. Robin Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of write-in ballots exceeded the number cast
for Lindauer. Political observers said they assumed that many of
the write-in ballots were cast for Taylor, but state officials are
counting these ballots by hand and have not reported the results.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Republican chairman said before the election that
Lindauer had ``undermined the party's credibility'' by failing to
give complete information about the source of his campaign money,
including large sums provided by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, a Republican first elected in 1980, won
easily in his bid for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the state's only House seat, Don Young, a
Republican from Fort Yukon first elected in 1973, defeated the
Democratic challenger, Jim Duncan of Juneau, the minority leader of
the Alaska Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull, the Republican incumbent, cruised to her
first full term, despite the faction of state Republicans who felt
that she was not conservative enough. Ms. Hull, a former junior
high school teacher, state legislator and secretary of state,
became governor in September 1997, when Gov. Fife Symington was
convicted of financial fraud. Her Democratic opponent, Paul
Johnson, the former mayor of Phoenix, sparked little interest in
his tax-cut plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, John McCain, the Republican incumbent known
for his efforts on campaign finance reform, his leadership on
tobacco legislation and his potential as a presidential candidate,
crushed his Democratic opponent, Ed Ranger, a political novice.
Ranger, a lawyer who graduated from law schools both in the United
States and Mexico and in 1994 set up a law firm in Mexico to
counsel American companies doing business there, had an uphill
fight to build a political base in Arizona, which he returned to
only recently.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters approved a plan to give substantial public money
to political candidates who voluntarily limit their spending and
raise certain small contributions.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   Democrats swept powerfully through the nation's most populous
state, seizing the governorship and other statewide offices,
retaining a Senate seat that had been tenuously held, and gaining a
major advantage when California's huge House delegation, making up
about an eighth of the House of Representatives, goes through
redistricting after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 16 years since California had a Democratic governor.
The last one was Edmund G. Brown Jr. The next will be Brown's
former chief of staff in Sacramento, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis overcame a reputation for dullness with a sure-footed
campaign that highlighted his political moderation. He defeated the
staunchly conservative Republican candidate, Attorney General Dan
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the incumbent Democratic Sen., Barbara Boxer, managed
to defeat the Republican State Treasurer, Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of victories is of monumental importance to the
Democrats as they prepare for the presidential election two years
from now. President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President
Al Gore and other administration officials had campaigned hard in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5, an Indian gambling initiative, passed but might
face a court challenge. Proposition 9, which would have undone
provisions involving the deregulation of electricity, was defeated.
Both ballot measures sparked enormous advertising campaigns.

   In race that was so close that some are calling for a recount,
Republican Bill Owens was elected governor of Colorado. The victory
was a stunning upset for Democrats, who have held the governor's
office since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Gail Schoettler, the lieutenant governor,
had waged an intense, and creative campaign, riding across the
state on horseback to seek support. But the stunt never carried her
far ahead of Owens, who promised to repeal the state's personal
property tax.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's Senate race, Ben Nighthorse Campbell won a second
term and his first race as a Republican. The senator, first elected
as a Democrat, beat Dottie Lamm, a Democrat and wife of former Gov.
Richard Lamm.
</P>
<P>
   Two ballot initiatives on abortion were also decided election
night. Voters said yes to a measure that requires those under 18 to
get parental permission before having an abortion. And, by a narrow
margin, voters rejected a proposal to ban certain types of
late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   HAWAII
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a strong union showing, the incumbent Democrat, Ben
Cayetano, narrowly defeated his Republican challenger, Linda
Lingle, the mayor of Maui. Ms. Lingle was trying to become Hawaii's
first elected Republican governor since it became a state 39 years
ago. A struggling economy that was being dragged down by the crisis
in Asian nearly allowed her to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Neil Abercrombie and Patsy Mink, the state's Democratic
House members, won re-election, as did its Democratic senator,
Daniel Inouye.
</P>
<P>
   By a margin of 2 to 1, voters also approved an initiative
allowing the state legislature to ban same-sex marriages. The
effort was spurred by a 1993 State Supreme Court ruling that could
have opened the way for marriages of people of the same sex to be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   IDAHO
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth, one of the most conservative Republicans
in the House, initially trailed in opinion polls as she sought a
third term _ her last, she promised _ but beat Dan Williams, a
Democrat, with 55 percent of the vote. In the race for governor,
Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican who left the Senate after one term,
beat Robert Huntley, a Democrat and former State Supreme Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Kempthorne's Senate seat was won easily by Rep. Mike Crapo, a
Republican, who defeated Bill Mauk, chairman of the state
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And Crapo's seat in turn was won by Mike Simpson, the speaker of
the State House of Representatives, who ran against Richard
Stallings, a Democrat who had held the seat from 1975 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved a referendum authorizing the secretary of state
to accept term limitation pledges from congressional candidates,
and list them on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   MONTANA
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hill, a Republican, won a second term as Montana's only
member of the United States House of Representatives. He defeated
the Democratic challenger in a race marked by sharp disagreements
over education, economic policy, Social Security and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate, Robert Deschamps, served as the
Missoula County prosecutor from 1971 until September of this year.
The race tightened up in the final weeks of the campaign, but Hill,
a former chairman of the Montana Republican Party, said the results
showed that ``people are fairly contented.''
</P>
<P>
   Deschamps said that Hill, who owned an insurance agency in
Helena, was an aloof ``millionaire insurance salesman'' who did not
understand the plight of most residents of the state. Hill
countered by saying that Deschamps' record as a government lawyer
did not teach him how to create jobs or meet payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA
</P>
<P>
   It took most of the night, but Sen. Harry Reid, a Democrat,
emerged the victor in a close fight against Rep. John Ensign. With
most of the ballots counted, Reid's victory margin was less than
500 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who won a third term, outpolled his Republican
challenger in Las Vegas; Ensign did better in rural localities and
in the Reno area.
</P>
<P>
   Ensign was no stranger to nail-biters: he had been about to
concede his race for the House four years ago when late returns
pushed him ahead of the incumbent by about 1,500 votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Kenny Guinn, a former state school
superintendent and president of the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas, defeated Jan Jones, the mayor of Las Vegas. Guinn had
received early financial backing from the state's gambling
industry. However, after Guinn became locked in a surprisingly
tough primary battle, the casino industry also contributed to Ms.
Jones' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MEXICO
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, staved off a challenge from
Martin Chavez, a Democrat and former mayor of Albuquerque, to
become the state's first two-term governor.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico has an active Green Party, and its candidates won
more than 5 percent in many races around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's Third Congressional District, State Attorney
General Tom Udall, the son of former Interior Secretary Stewart
Udall, defeated the Republican incumbent, Bill Redmond. The Green
candidate, Carol Miller, took only a few percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a closer race, Heather Wilson, a Republican who had been in
the House only a few months, narrowly defeated the Democrat,
Phillip Maloof, and the Green candidate polled in the double
digits.
</P>
<P>
   OREGON
</P>
<P>
   Two incumbent Democrats, Gov. John Kitzhaber and Sen. Ron Wyden,
racked up big margins in their victories. But the contest for the
state's First Congressional District remained too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber, who emphasized his support for education and the
environment, soundly defeated the Republican, Bill Sizemore, who
heads an anti-tax organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate contest, Wyden easily overcame a challenge from
Republican State Sen. John Lim.
</P>
<P>
   In the First District, the Democrat David Wu, a business lawyer,
was leading the Republican, Mary Bordonaro, a public relations
consultant, in the race to succeed Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Furse,
who is retiring. The Oregonian, a Portland newspaper, said the
outcome will depend on absentee ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also approved a measure allowing medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Utah, long a conservative stronghold, re-elected most
Republican incumbents by overwhelming margins.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert F. Bennett, a Republican and wealthy businessman,
beat a surgeon, Scott Leckman, a Democrat of Salt Lake City whose
campaign theme was ``Big ideas and a big heart can beat a big
wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gave Utah Republicans one good run on election night.
A school teacher, Lily Eskelsen, a Democrat, narrowly lost to
Representative Merrill Cook, a freshman Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Congress turned nasty in the final days, with
Ms. Eskelsen portraying Cook, a multimillionaire, as an opportunist
who ``would do or say anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Patty Murray, a Democrat, the state's first female senator who
made a nationwide name for herself in 1992 campaigning as the ``mom
in tennis shoes,'' won a second term in a tough race against Rep.
Linda Smith, a Republican who had backing from the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   In the third woman-versus-woman Senate race in history, Ms.
Smith was known for down-to-earth sound bites, like when she spoke
of ``fighting against leches in the workplace who hit on young
women,'' a reference to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith paid a price for her longstanding support for campaign
finance reform: the Republican organization gave her little money,
and she was noticeably outspent early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Washington voters approved Initiative 200, an anti-affirmative
action measure, modeled on California's, that will ban racial or
gender preferences in government hiring, contracting or college
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   As in other states, Washington voters rejected a proposed ban on
a type of late-term abortion. And, one year after vetoing a broader
plan some thought might leave the door open to legalizing other
drugs, voters approved a ballot initiative allowing the medical use
of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WYOMING
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer, the Republican incumbent, won a second term
saying voters approved of his economic policies. His Democratic
opponent, State Sen. John Vinich, tried to make an issue out of the
fact that the Cowboy State missed the prosperity of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming is one of the nation's most Republican states, with a
2-to-1 registration edge over the Democrats. That made challenges
to Republican incumbents difficult, as Scott Farris, the Democratic
candidate for Wyoming's House seat, showed. The incumbent
Republican Rep., Barbara Cubin, won easily.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT DENIES IT HOLDS WINDOWS MONOPOLY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft assailed the crux of the government's
antitrust case on Wednesday by denying that it had locked up the
market for desktop operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, however, an Apple Computer executive
argued that Microsoft has a real monopoly in Windows and, what is
more, that it had sought to use that monopoly to ``sabotage''
Apple's multimedia software, which was written to run on all
computer platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The tenth day of the landmark antitrust trial featured some
multimedia shows of its own, although not of the wattage generated
by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates's videotaped offering earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining Avadis Tevanian's Jr., Apple's senior vice
president of software engineering and a key government witness,
Microsoft lawyer Theodore Edelman put up a series of computer
``screen shots'' in the crowded courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1997 deal, Apple is obliged to make Microsoft's Internet
Explorer browser the standard tool on its machines, while
Netscape's Navigator browser remains unused, buried under layers of
secondary files on Apple's distribution disk.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman walked through seven layers of McIntosh ``screens'' in a
bid to show, contrary to Tevanian's direct testimony, that
customers could readily choose between the rival browsers.
</P>
<P>
   But Tevanian insisted that even these ``complex procedures''
would fail unless the user had first known enough to install
Navigator on the Apple computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't tell me how to do it,'' said U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the
trial without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman also disputed Tevanian's contention, based on widely
used studies, that Windows accounts for 90 percent of the market
for personal computers. He showed the court a recent videotape of
Tevanian's top boss, Steve Jobs, lauding Apple's Macintosh
operating system as the company's ``crown jewel,'' one that
services 22 million customers with about 12,000 specific
applications.
</P>
<P>
   On the same tack, Edelman recounted a litany of Silicon Valley
firms now committed to supporting Linux, another operating system
that has recently won favorable notice in the trade press.
</P>
<P>
   And he sought to demolish Tevanian's charge that Microsoft had a
digital funeral in mind for Apple's QuickTime, which is distributed
free in its basic form and which is used to play both audio and
video content. Microsoft's own Windows Media Player is a
proprietary product that, unlike QuickTime, shuns open Internet
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Tevanian, don't you think the use of the word 'sabotage'
is something of an exaggeration?'' Edelman thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds fine to me,'' Tevanian replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a fact, Dr. Tevanian, that you have no personal
knowledge or basis to assert that a any of the incompatibilities
were created to do anything to harm QuickTime?'' Edelman pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree,'' the witness said. ``What other goal could
there have been'' for the (constant) error messages?''
</P>
<P>
   But under relentless questioning, Tevanian finally admitted that
he lacked any direct evidence that Microsoft had purposely embedded
bugs in the fastest version of its browser in order to keep it from
working smoothly with QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know the individual motivations. ... I don't know if
it was on purpose, or for some reason,'' Tevanian said,
acknowledging that ``it's unfortunate, but it's not unusual'' for
new software to fail to work with existing applications.

MARKET PLACE: CHINA'S RELIABILITY AS BORROWER MAY BE IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a Chinese company set to default on a foreign bond payment
for the first time since the communists took power 50 years ago,
some bankers worry that a looming credit crunch could weaken
China's immunity to the financial turmoil that has already hit most
of its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp.,
failed to make a scheduled interest payment of $8.75 million on a
$200 million bond last week. On Friday, barring unexpected action
by Chinese central government authorities, the company will exhaust
the 10-day grace period for making the payment and go into formal
default.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong International Trust is a provincial investment firm
that does not share China's high sovereign credit rating, but the
default seems certain to cast a shadow on the country's reputation
as a first-rate borrower, bankers say. That's because Guangdong and
some 240 similar provincial investment companies, which are charged
with raising foreign money to support China's economy, have long
carried the implicit backing of China's government.
</P>
<P>
   The credit problem appears to be spreading fast. At least one
other provincial investment firm, Guangzhou International Trust and
Investment Corp., has failed to make loan payments to a French
bank, bankers say. And investment companies in Fujian, Shanghai,
Hainan and other major cities and provinces face tests of their
solvency in coming weeks as loan and bond payments come due.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign bankers' willingness to extend or refinance the loans is
waning. ``We will not cut off loans to every Chinese company,
because we can make distinctions between the good ones and the bad
ones,'' said a senior loan officer at a large U.S. bank who asked
not to be identified. ``But is China facing a credit crunch? The
answer is yes. People don't forget about a default overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, China must grapple with a drought of new foreign
lending even as its economy slows to its lowest growth rate since
the early 1990s. New lending to even the best Chinese financial
companies, including publicly listed investment vehicles in Hong
Kong known as red chips and national-level investment firms like
China International Trust and Investment Corp. in Beijing, has
slowed to a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investor Services, a leading credit-rating agency, has
downgraded its ratings for all Chinese nonbank financial companies.
They are all now rated at less than investment grade, a sharp
reversal from just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is hardly fortuitous. Investment by foreign
companies, especially those run by overseas Chinese, is slowing,
cutting a once frothy supply of financing for everything from shoe
factories to skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, to keep its economy robust even as neighboring nations
plunge into deep recessions, the government has pledged to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars on roads, bridges, subways and
airports in the next several years. But that program depends in
part on raising new foreign loans and direct investment, and the
money now seems less likely to come China's way.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles do not, at least in the short term, make China a
candidate to follow Russia into financial mayhem. China's total
foreign debt of $137 billion is still considered affordable, even
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Through exports, the country is expected to earn five times more
foreign currency than the amount it needs to pay on its overseas
debt this year, a comfortable margin by any standard. Moreover,
China's national store of foreign currency, at $140 billion, is one
of the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Why China has so far failed to exercise that financial muscle to
prevent the default is a mystery to some analysts. Guangdong
International Trust was considered a prominent enough company to
issue a Yankee bond, a high-profile dollar-based offering marketed
and sold in the United States, often to pension and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   As with most Yankee-bond issuers, this Chinese company's bond
did not come due for 20 years, a long-term debt obligation usually
only available to the best-regarded governments and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the big U.S. investment bank, was the main
underwriter of the bond in 1996. Guangdong International Trust went
bust in early October, but its debt obligations were assumed by
Bank of China, the national foreign-currency bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has not explained why it has failed to make good on the
payment due last week. Few believe that the Bank of China itself
has a credit problem. But some analysts believe investors might
conclude that China has deeper debt problems than official figures
reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems during the Asian crisis has been that
sovereign risk became blurred with credit risk of corporations,''
said Tom Byrne, head China analyst for Moody's. ``The same thing
could happen in China. The Chinese are very sophisticated
borrowers, but this is perplexing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The default will likely accomplish one longstanding Chinese
government goal: persuading foreign lenders that the central
government will not necessarily protect state-owned companies that
borrow more than they can afford to repay.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For many years, foreign banks have treated prominent companies
and local governments as good credit risks in large part because of
an implicit assumption that Beijing would not allow its national
credit rating to be damaged by a local government or company
default. That confidence led foreign banks, especially Japanese
banks but also European and U.S. lenders, among others, to
sometimes back speculative projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sympathetic to the central government's situation,'' said
Chen Zhao, editor of Bank Credit Analyst in Montreal. ``They are
saying to the foreign banks, `You took the risk and we warned you
many times.' Letting these companies fail without a bailout is a
positive step compared to Japan, where they never resolve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, default is a blunt instrument for sending that message.
And the provincial investment companies may prove to be China's
Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial companies officially account for $38 billion in
foreign borrowing, much of it coming due in the next year or two.
The companies have also taken on debt obligations that do not
appear on their balance sheets and were not officially reported to
the central government, as required. The quantity of that debt is
unknown, but some analysts estimate that it totals $30 billion to
$40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have reacted to the crisis by acting to shutter
some troubled investment companies. In addition to Guangdong
International Trust, China Venturetech Investment and China
Agricultural Development Trust and Investment, both based in
Beijing, were closed recently.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, government officials now say, they intend to merge
or close most of the investment companies, leaving perhaps 30 big
ones. But how they handle the accumulated debt of those that are
closed is an unresolved question.
</P>
<P>
   Dai Xianglong, governor of China's central bank, told visitors
this week that China intends to make good on the debt obligations
of the investment companies, according to a Chinese government
newspaper published in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But he made a distinction between loans that were properly
registered with the central government and other kinds of lending,
suggesting that the properly registered loans would be paid first.
Still, he did not make clear why China had so far failed to make a
payment on the Yankee bonds of Guangdong International Trust, which
were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington.

   BOSTON _ The FBI has begun a ``preliminary inquiry'' into the
theft of public records linked to baseball Hall of Famers in
Boston, just as officials in Illinois have learned the will from
another Hall of Famer is missing from their files.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both states suspect the thefts may be related since
all of the men played in Boston in the late 19th Century during
professional baseball's early years.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Howard Springer of the McLean, Ill., sheriff's department,
said Wednesday that collectors often try to assemble signatures
from a single team or era in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The wills of George Wright, Thomas McCarthy and Hugh Duffy, all
Hall of Fame players from the late 19th century, are missing from
the vaults at the Suffolk Registrar of Probate's office in Boston.
In Illinois, the will of Charley ``Big Hoss'' Radbourn, a star
pitcher who played with the Boston Beaneaters in the 1880s, is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Peter Generis of the FBI's Boston office said agents
met Wednesday with Suffolk Registrar of Probate Richard Iannella,
who was alerted last week that a probate record signed by Wright
was set for auction in Manhattan. Iannella then searched his vaults
and discovered the records from the two other players were also
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into it'' as a violation of federal laws
against interstate transport of stolen property, Generis said. ``We
don't know what we have here yet, but we are looking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Detective Springer said a baseball memorabilia
collector contacted authorities last week. The collector had
examined Radbourn's will in 1988 for a story he wrote for a
collector's magazine. When officials looked at Raybourn's probate
file in the Bloomington, Ill., courthouse last week, Springer said,
``it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I check into it (the Radbourn theft), the more
information I get that it's out there in the New Jersey, New York,
Boston area,'' Springer said. ``I can't prove it, I haven't found
anybody who has seen it, but it's an indication'' the will may be
for sale in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, said the fact that all of the players had Boston
connections leads him to suspect the thefts are related.
</P>
<P>
   Iannella said Wednesday officials in both states have
independently come up with the name of one person who may be
selling the records.
</P>
<P>
   Ianella also said he expects the probate record of Wright to be
returned to his office from Leland's, a Manhattan auction house,
today. The auction house paid $2,000 for the Wright document, but
agreed to return it to Iannella after he said he would not seek to
prosecute them.

SUPREME COURT HEARS CASE OF DISABLED YOUTH WHOSE SCHOOL WON'T PAY
FOR MEDICAL NEEDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The mother of a quadriplegic teen-ager squared off
against an Iowa school district at the Supreme Court on Wednesday,
arguing that the education board has a legal duty to pay for the
extensive nursing attention her son needs in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cedar Rapids Community School District, appealing a
lower court decision in the boy's favor, countered that federal law
does not require the school to pay for the continuous medical needs
of the student, identified in court papers as Garret F.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, school
districts need not pay for the ``medical services'' of a severely
disabled child _ a statutory exclusion that Cedar Rapids and
Garret's mother view differently.
</P>
<P>
   The school's lawyer, Sue Seitz of Des Moines, urged the justices
to interpret medical services broadly to include the numerous,
constant duties Garret's nurse performs. However, attorney Douglas
Oelschlaeger, representing Garret's mother, said the exclusion is
narrow, requiring schools to pay for all student health care needs
except those performed by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices said Seitz's broad interpretation would provide
little guidance for when parents, rather than schools, must pay the
health care costs of their disabled children in class. Justices
also said Oelschlaeger's narrow view would require schools to pay
for a wide range of expensive medical procedures not provided by
doctors, such as nursing care and ambulance service.
</P>
<P>
   Garret depends on a ventilator and wheelchair as a result of an
accident in 1987 in which he was thrown from a motorcycle after the
blanket he was holding got snarled in the vehicle's drive
mechanism. The jolt jerked the then 4-year-old's head, severing his
spine.
</P>
<P>
   Garret, now in high school, has normal mental capacity, can
speak and uses a puff-and-sip straw to control his wheelchair. He
also requires constant attention for a variety of health needs,
including regular bladder catheterization; suctioning of his
breathing tube; changing his sitting position; and monitoring his
respiration and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In litigation over whether the school district should pay for
this care in the classroom, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed with Garret's mother that the nursing attention he needs
does not qualify as a ``medical service'' under the law. As a
result, the school must pay for Garret's care in the classroom _
about $20,000 per school year _ pending the high court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz, the district's lawyer, urged the Supreme Court to
overturn the 8th Circuit's decision, saying the ``continuous'' and
extensive care a nurse must provide to Garret clearly constitutes a
medical service.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia
appeared unwilling to accept Seitz's proposed division between
routine health care, which the law requires schools to subsidize,
and more extensive nursing, which falls under the medical-services
exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very hard line to draw,'' O'Connor said. ``I don't
think it's going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scalia: `` Can you give us any clearer line?''
</P>
<P>
   Seitz, noting that a nurse attends to Garret all the time at
school, argued that constant care was a fair distinguishing point.
</P>
<P>
   Oelschlaeger contended that Seitz exaggerated the boy's health
care requirements and that Garret needs to be treated only
intermittently. However, the lawyer from Cedar Rapids conceded that
the boy must be monitored constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on that point, O'Connor asked whether the continual
presence of a nurse to monitor Garret should constitute a medical
service.
</P>
<P>
   Oelschlaeger, reiterating the intermittent attention Garret
primarily needs, said the law's medical-services exclusion refers
only to a doctor's care, not a nurse's. Oelschlaeger said Congress
intended the law to allow disabled children such as Garret to learn
in a mainstream classroom while relieving schools of the burden of
having to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Cedar Rapids Community School District vs. Garret F., by July. &QL;

TRIAL OF UGANDAN ON BAD CHECK COUNTS OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To federal prosecutors, the case against Nasser Ntge
Sebaggala, the mayor of Uganda's capital city, ``is about fraud,''
about trying to deposit four bad checks in BankBoston totaling more
than $190,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about lying to US Customs about a bundle of traveler's
checks, some of them stolen, tucked into Sebaggala's suitcase when
he landed at Logan Airport last New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Sebaggala and his lawyer see it quite
differently. Far from being a calculating criminal intent on
cheating banks and defying customs regulations, they say Sebaggala
was the victim of an unscrupulous associate he put in charge of his
currency-exchange business while he worked in Ugandan politics.
</P>
<P>
   The differing views of Sebaggala, 51, who endured beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, were
presented to a jury Wednesday in federal court, where Sebaggala
went on trial on charges of bank fraud, transporting altered
checks, and making false statements to US Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement to jurors, Assistant US Attorney
Theodore Chuang said that Sebaggala, while visiting the United
States in September 1997, opened an account at a BankBoston branch
in Waltham and deposited four checks totaling $191,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the checks, originally written to other parties, had been
altered so that Sebaggala was the payee. ``You'll see the erasure
marks. You'll see the discolored paper. You'll see the crooked
typing on the checks,'' Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
   A large stamp mark was also placed on the front of the checks to
blot out bank notations which showed they had previously been
cashed, Chuang said. Although a BankBoston manager noticed the
alterations on two of the checks and refused to deposit them in
Sebaggala's account, two others were deposited and he was able to
withdraw $53,000.
</P>
<P>
   The charge dealing with lying to Customs stems from Sebaggala
allegedly telling a Customs officer at Logan that he had $40,000 in
traveler's checks in his suitcase when in fact he had more than
$100,000. Currency amounts over $10,000 must be reported on
declaration forms.
</P>
<P>
   But Sebaggala's attorney, Paul V. Kelly, said his client, who
had trouble deciphering the Customs form, believed he was only
required to report currency, not traveler's checks. During a
previous trip to Chicago, Sebaggala, with the assistance of a
Customs officer, had declared only $3,000 in cash he had with him,
not $30,000 in traveler's checks in his suitcase, Kelly told
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Sebaggala did not know how much in traveler's checks
he was carrying when he landed at Logan on Jan. 1 because the
manager of his currency-exchange business in Kampala had bundled
the checks. When Sebaggala asked a Customs officer if he could
retrieve an inventory from his suitcase, he was refused, Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Sebaggala was spending only an hour or so a day at
his currency-exchange business after becoming a full-time
politician and then mayor, and knew nothing about checks being
altered or traveler's checks stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply wasn't involved in it,'' Kelly said. ``He didn't
know about it ... He's as much a victim of this conduct as anyone
else.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, INVIGORATED BY ELECTION, MOVES TO SHORE UP SOCIAL
SECURITY
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON An invigorated President Clinton moved quickly
Wednesday to use his renewed political capital to press for a deal
with Capitol Hill Republicans over how to shore up the Social
Security system before it begins losing money early next century.
</P>
<P>
   Savoring his party's surprising gains even as he moved to put a
divisive midterm campaign season behind him, Clinton outlined a
slate of domestic priorities, including hiring new teachers,
reforming campaign financing and health care insurance and raising
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''But above all, we have to seize this opportunity to save
Social Security,'' Clinton said. ''I believe we can do it. I
believe we must do it. Yesterday's election makes it clear that the
American people expect us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the White House Cabinet Room, Clinton
showed restraint in the face of a surprisingly strong Democratic
showing in Tuesday's voting. He said he was ``proud'' of his fellow
Democrats but took care not to gloat. He pointedly referred to his
party colleagues as ``they,'' avoiding an overt claim of personal
credit for their victories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who faces House impeachment proceedings over the Monica
Lewinsky sex and deception scandal, said Tuesday's elections showed
that the public wants Washington to focus on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people want their business, their concerns, their
children, their families, their future addressed here,'' said
Clinton. ''That's what the message of the election was.''
</P>
<P>
   What's less clear, though, is a path forward on how to bolster
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that any federal budget surplus should be set
aside until Republicans and Democrats can agree on a plan. House
Republicans, however, have wanted to return some surplus to
citizens in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to lay the groundwork for bipartisan negotiations
beginning next month, Clinton spoke by telephone to Democratic and
Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, urging them to work
cooperatively toward hammering out a formula for strengthening the
financial outlook for the nation's largest retirement insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will only be able to do this if we reach across party
lines, reach across generational lines, indeed, reach across
philosophical lines, to forge a true national consensus,'' Clinton
said as he prepared to meet with his senior economic and domestic
advisors over the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's push for Social Security reforms came less than 24
hours after a surprisingly strong Democratic showing at the polls.
Defying predictions that Clinton's troubles over the Lewinsky
matter could lead to a rout for his party, it was Republicans that
lost five seats in the House, while both parties held even in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing for Democrats clearly benefitted Clinton, his
party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has gained a lot of political capital,'' as a
result of Tuesday's elections, said presidential scholar Shirley
Anne Warshaw, associate professor of political science at
Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. ''He has quite a bit of
goodwill right now and, depending on how he uses it, he could
increase it and he could also decrease it.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to converting his fresh momentum into substantive policy
gains, she said, is for Clinton to launch a focused, directed
campaign meant to advance a small number of top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''He better have a short, clear-cut list of priorities that he
can motivate broad-based political support for,'' Warshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   In pouncing on the Social Security program, Clinton has chosen a
politically volatile federal insurance fund that covers 148 million
American workers and provides checks to 44 million beneficiaries.
It faces financial troubles beginning in 2013, unless Congress
enacts changes that bring more money into the fund, reduces payouts
or both.
</P>
<P>
   Any formula for saving the fund would likely involve pain that
could pose political risks to its proponents.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Clinton has been talking quietly about the
issue for months with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and others on
Capitol Hill, hoping to avoid open political warfare over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton has hosted public meetings around the country
this year to hear the views of citizens and experts.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a politically acceptable solution begins in
earnest next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to host key players on Capitol Hill as well as a
range of experts from around the country for a two-day conference
on Social Security on Dec. 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   Battle lines are already being drawn.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address last January, Clinton called
on Congress to preserve any surplus from the federal budget until
both political parties can agree on a long-term fix for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, however, defiantly passed an $80 billion tax
cut _ which died from lack of support in the Senate. Gingrich has
also called for private savings accounts, in which workers would be
able to designate that some portion of their Social Security
payments be invested in stocks, bonds or some other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ruled out any plan for fully privatizing the Social
Security program.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, however, said all options
were under review, and the key would be how to fit together various
proposals in a workable package.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have now is almost a broad menu of particular ideas
about things that might work and might be part of a long-term fix
for the Social Security system,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some ideas that may have some merit, depending on
how they work in with other ideas,'' Lockhart said. ''And we'll be
moving more now to try to put together, whether it be principles or
some legislative package, (something) that we believe the Democrats
and Republicans can support.''

SAILING OUT TO `SEE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ Talking with crew at the main mast of
his 40-foot ketch, Fairwind, skipper Tim Bercovitz watched as the
boat merged with other vessels at the mouth of Newport Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   That was when a disturbing thought popped into his head,
something about a crew change he had forgotten about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' he mouthed, ``my helmsman's blind.''
</P>
<P>
   About to hop down into the cockpit and unceremoniously wrest
away the wheel of his beloved wooden ketch, Bercovitz checked
himself. Why should he?
</P>
<P>
   ``She was holding the course beautifully, steering by the wind
on her face,'' the Newport Beach skipper said of blind sailor Becky
Porter, also of Newport Beach. ``She told me she was able to hear
the boats around her, so I let her stay at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Bercovitz was taking part in the American Legion Yacht Club's
eighth annual Sail for the Blind in Newport Beach; he spoke of
Porter while fondly recounting his first experience entrusting his
boat to a blind person.
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 24 day sail, co-sponsored by the Women's Ocean Racing
Sailing Association of Orange County, combined about 200 blind
sailors and sighted volunteers of all experience levels with the
skippers of 26 vessels _ mostly big, impressive sailboats.
</P>
<P>
   Crew on each boat decided where they wanted to go. Some chose to
tack inside the harbor; others took to the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Clarke of Anaheim has spent much of his 34 years around
water. He's done a lot of boating at Lake Havasu and on the
Colorado River but not a whole lot of sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a powerboat, you just point and shoot,'' said Clarke, who
has lost most of his sight to diabetic retinopathy. ``Sailing is
just a whole different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day sail aboard the Fairwind, he tried to remember
which way the genoa sheet is wrapped around the winch drum, while
Bercovitz experienced a mix of exhilaration and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clarke, most of the blind crew are avowed dilettantes to
sailing. Some would sail more if they could; others are happy to do
it one day a year and satisfied having to relearn the points of
sail and sailing lingo each time they go out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who are REALLY happy not to sail more than
once a year. Their eyes might not work, but their inner ears do.
Yes, blind sailors get seasick just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the annual sail was born somewhere off the
U.S.-Mexican border during the 1990 Ensenada Race. A group from the
Women's Ocean Racing Sailing Association was strategizing aboard
the ocean racer Stella Maris when the talk turned to their
professional lives. One of them taught computer classes to blind
adults and mentioned that two of her students had once done some
sailing and were interested in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Gibson, skippering the Stella Maris, contacted the
students after the race. She and her crew took 12 blind passengers
for a day of sailing in Newport Harbor. The following year they got
the American Legion Yacht Club on board.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Fairwind, Janice Wright, 39, of La Habra, carefully
walked the length of the deckhouse, using the boom as her guide as
she undid the mainsail ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do more sailing,'' she said as her guide dog,
Naples, a yellow Labrador retriever, stood watch. Wright, who has a
condition known as retinitis pigmentosa, has been blind from the
beginning. She also grew up around boats, water skiing and canoeing
at San Luis Obispo County's Lake Nacimiento with her family.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clarke, his biggest lament is what blindness has done to
his sense of balance. He is completely blind in his right eye and
has tunnel vision in his left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine holding a toilet-paper tube to your eye,'' said
Clarke. ``That's what I see in my left eye.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also benefits for the sighted skippers and volunteers
who mark the day sail on their calendars each year and make their
boats and knowledge accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing with the blind gives you a different perspective on
sailing,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sighted sailors THINK they see the wind, but they really
don't,'' she said. ``They only see telltales and weather vanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand that when you sail with people who HAVE to feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ((Skippers, sighted volunteers and blind or visually impaired
sailors of all experience levels wishing to take part in next
year's day sail can contact the American Legion Yacht Club in
Newport Beach at (949) 673-5070.))

AXELSON, NURSING CONCUSSION, OUT AT LEAST THREE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins left wing P.J. Axelsson will likely miss the
next three games, starting against Toronto Thursday night, after
sustaining his second concussion in a week during a 4-2 loss at
Buffalo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson missed Wednesday's practice at the FleetCenter and will
be out for ``about a week,'' coach Pat Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins visit Pittsburgh Saturday and Carolina Sunday, and
Axelsson could return for the Nov. 13 visit to the New York
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick to his stomach and dizzy, and you don't take
chances with something like that,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres' Matthew Barnaby connected with his left elbow after
Axelsson had passed off in the neutral zone with the score tied,
1-1, early in the second period. Barnaby was not penalized, and the
Sabres scored soon after and took command of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wicked, wicked elbow,'' Burns said. ``They were
calling it different things on television, but I call it a savage
attack. In all fairness to (referee) Mick McGeough, he was looking
the other way, but it's up to the linesman to make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson sustained a concussion last Wednesday when he was
elbowed in the head by Montreal's Dave Manson, who received a
five-minute major penalty, a game misconduct, and a three-game
NHL-imposed suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are picking on him, it's just been the
circumstances of the last week,'' Burns said. ``I don't think he's
a target. He's not that type of player. But some players feed on
players like that. (Barnaby's) was a savage attack and cowardly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were to send a tape of the incident to NHL
headquarters. Burns expressed concern about the possibility of the
NHL Players Association negotiating leniency for Barnaby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Players Association has to decide whose side they are
on,'' the coach said. ``Both Barnaby and P.J. are the Players
Association's boss, and sooner or later, (the NHLPA) is going to
have to stop protesting. Incidents like this happen, and (the
players) are not together. If they say I'm faking it, I would get
upset. `I'm not faking it; I almost had my head torn off.' You do
something like that and you deserve to get fined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' Rob DiMaio had been suspended for a similar incident
this year. DiMaio confronted Barnaby after the incident Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a good view of it, but I know Barnaby and I saw
(Axelsson) knocked down,'' DiMaio said. ``Sometimes that can happen
with a clean hit and you hit the boards the wrong way and you get
your bell rung. But this wasn't a situation like that. This was a
cheap shot, a violent and vicious hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is cracking down on these things, and I agree with
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns expects a spirited game against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams have had problems with Buffalo, and there will
probably be two angry teams going at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said NHL realignment should encourage the rivalry between
the Bruins and Toronto, who are now both in the Northeast Division,
but the Maple Leafs must adjust to a different pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Western Conference is very different and it is tough,'' he
said. ``You have to understand the traveling. They used to take
four trips out West. I've done some of that, and by Christmastime,
your eyeballs are falling out of your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious and a very good rivalry to have these teams in
one division. It won't take long for the Leafs to be hated in the
Eastern Conference.''

FLUTIE NO. 1 IN BUFFALO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY   AND WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Flutie no longer has an annoying word before his job title.
He is not a temporary starter. He is not an interim starter. He is
not an acting starter. When his story is told now, it will have to
go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills is Doug Flutie.
That's it. Very simple. No prefaces. The Quarterback Formerly Known
As No. 22 is now the top man in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in New England knows about the popularity of the
5-foot-9-inch Flutie. Fans in New York fell for him long ago, too
(a cereal called Flutie Flakes has gone over the 100,000 mark in
boxes sold). The only catch was that Wade Phillips had given no
official word on what he would do. The Bills coach obviously likes
Natick, Mass. native and Boston College graduate Flutie, who has
helped the team win five games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips was somewhere between a player's injury knock and a
team's hard-earned place (tied for first in the AFC East). On one
hand, the job belonged to Rob Johnson, who lost it only because he
was injured. And the unwritten NFL code is that you shouldn't lose
a job to injury. When Johnson was healthy, he completed a slightly
higher percentage of passes than Flutie (63.2-62.8) and led the
Bills to an unexpected win over the 49ers. But could Phillips
justify removing a player who not only captured imaginations but
wins as well?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Phillips made his decision. He broke the code. He said
it was easy to do. He spoke at his press conference in Orchard
Park, N.Y., and easily anticipated the topic of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the question _ the answer is Doug Flutie,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Johnson _ owner of a $5 million annual salary _
became one of the most expensive part-timers in sports, not to
mention the North American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday the trainer (Bud Carpenter) and Rob Johnson came to
me,'' said Phillips. ``The trainer said, `Wade, Rob's ready to
play. Until that point in time, I didn't have to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, Doug has been fantastic. He's been great. Our team
has really played well with him. I knew I had to make a decision
but to me there was only one decision and that was Doug was going
to be our quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Rob and he understood. Rob could play Sunday, bit if he
did, he wouldn't be sharp and he would still be a litttle big hurt.
He could play, but he wouldn't be 100 percent. I told Rob, `It's
not your fault. You didn't get a good break, but it's a good break
for us as a team because Doug has done so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget, Rob hasn't got hit in five or six weeks. I don't
know how long it would take to get him back in playing shape and
playing real well again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug has been so consistent, he made it an easy decision.
Everything he's done for the last 4 1/2 weeks has been consistent.
We're lucky that we have two terrific quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   has showed a lot of maturity that I wasn't sure he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnson sees what most sports fans do. Some people call it
a phenomenon. The shortest and lowest-paid starter ($250,000) in
the NFL is the AFC's top-rated passer. He helped bring down then
unbeaten Jacksonville with a bootleg in the final seconds for a
touchdown. He missed on only four throws in a win over Carolina. He
passed his way past the master, Dan Marino, last Sunday to beat
Miami. A phone company wants him to be an endorser. A soft drink
company wants him to be an endorser. A car company ...
</P>
<P>
   Now the shortest starter will get a chance to beat one of the
biggest coaches Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J. The very big man
knows what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing extremely well,'' said Jets coach Bill Parcells.
``He certainly has a very good track record over the years and he's
very unique. He's creative, and I think he appears to have a very
good mind for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, CBS finds a matchup of the engaging Flutie's Bills
and the engaging Parcells's Jets irresistible. The network will
televise the 4:15 p.m. game to most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Since Flutie is the official No. 1 starter, a bigger question
looms for Nov. 15 in Buffalo: Whom do you root for? Flutie, who is
guiding the usually hated Bills? Or the team that will try to stop
him, the previously adored New England Patriots?

 &HT;    MICROSOFT DENIES IT HOLDS WINDOWS MONOPOLY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    Corrects spelling of Macintosh in graf 6.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft assailed the crux of the government's
antitrust case on Wednesday by denying that it had locked up the
market for desktop operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, however, an Apple Computer executive
argued that Microsoft has a real monopoly in Windows and, what is
more, that it had sought to use that monopoly to ``sabotage''
Apple's multimedia software, which was written to run on all
computer platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The tenth day of the landmark antitrust trial featured some
multimedia shows of its own, although not of the wattage generated
by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates's videotaped offering earlier in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   In cross-examining Avadis Tevanian's Jr., Apple's senior vice
president of software engineering and a key government witness,
Microsoft lawyer Theodore Edelman put up a series of computer
``screen shots'' in the crowded courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1997 deal, Apple is obliged to make Microsoft's Internet
Explorer browser the standard tool on its machines, while
Netscape's Navigator browser remains unused, buried under layers of
secondary files on Apple's distribution disk.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman walked through seven layers of Macintosh ``screens'' in
a bid to show, contrary to Tevanian's direct testimony, that
customers could readily choose between the rival browsers.
</P>
<P>
   But Tevanian insisted that even these ``complex procedures''
would fail unless the user had first known enough to install
Navigator on the Apple computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't tell me how to do it,'' said U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the
trial without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman also disputed Tevanian's contention, based on widely
used studies, that Windows accounts for 90 percent of the market
for personal computers. He showed the court a recent videotape of
Tevanian's top boss, Steve Jobs, lauding Apple's Macintosh
operating system as the company's ``crown jewel,'' one that
services 22 million customers with about 12,000 specific
applications.
</P>
<P>
   On the same tack, Edelman recounted a litany of Silicon Valley
firms now committed to supporting Linux, another operating system
that has recently won favorable notice in the trade press.
</P>
<P>
   And he sought to demolish Tevanian's charge that Microsoft had a
digital funeral in mind for Apple's QuickTime, which is distributed
free in its basic form and which is used to play both audio and
video content. Microsoft's own Windows Media Player is a
proprietary product that, unlike QuickTime, shuns open Internet
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Tevanian, don't you think the use of the word 'sabotage'
is something of an exaggeration?'' Edelman thundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds fine to me,'' Tevanian replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a fact, Dr. Tevanian, that you have no personal
knowledge or basis to assert that a any of the incompatibilities
were created to do anything to harm QuickTime?'' Edelman pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree,'' the witness said. ``What other goal could
there have been'' for the (constant) error messages?''
</P>
<P>
   But under relentless questioning, Tevanian finally admitted that
he lacked any direct evidence that Microsoft had purposely embedded
bugs in the fastest version of its browser in order to keep it from
working smoothly with QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know the individual motivations. ... I don't know if
it was on purpose, or for some reason,'' Tevanian said,
acknowledging that ``it's unfortunate, but it's not unusual'' for
new software to fail to work with existing applications.

IMPAIRMENT DOESN'T INHIBIT YACHTSMAN

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ The best sailors have been sailing blind
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches work blindfolds into the training regimens of America's
Cup and Olympic sailors. After all, what better way to weed out the
undeserving than by making team hopefuls execute a spinnaker peel
in the dark?
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Russ Le Narz knows the routine well. He is consumed by
sailboat racing. He has crewed on nearly everything afloat and can
work the pit, sail-trim stations, mast positions and the coffee
grinder. Le Narz not only incorporates blind training into his
routine, he IS blind.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't let his impairment get in the way of his racing.
In fact, there might even be a tactical upside to his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light air, when every little movement makes a difference,
you feel the wind better,'' Le Narz said. ``Sitting on the rail,
going to weather, there can be advantages to using the other
senses.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say sailing blind is without risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most obvious danger,'' he said, ``would be the boom
crashing into you. You're not able to see its motion.''
</P>
<P>
   He strives to be careful and emits a sense of invincibility.
During a recent sail, one got the feeling that, if anything, the
boom would end up hitting the sighted fellow next to Le Narz, the
guy who's not paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Balboa Yacht Club for five years, Le Narz has
been legally blind since birth. He became interested in sailing at
13 through a summer program run by the Braille Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, some friends at the club read about a racing program
for blind sailors and told Le Narz. The club ended up sponsoring
him the same year.
</P>
<P>
   The racing course, part of the SailBlind project operated by the
Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, Mass., offers advanced
blind sailors the chance to compete with their peers. During the
past four years, visually impaired sailors from the center have
competed in the Blind Sailing World Championship Regattas in New
Zealand, Australia and England.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard each boat, a blind helmsman, responsible for steering the
boat under the direction of a sighted guide, is paired with a blind
crew member who trims the sails while a second sighted guide acts
as race tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Le Narz was hooked, and now he moves freely between races for
the blind and sighted competitions.
</P>
<P>
   When he meets less-experienced blind sailors, he not only
regales them with stories of the blind-racing world but also speaks
of ``regular'' local races, like the Ensenada Race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world to them,'' Le Narz said of his fellow
blind sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ((Apart from its racing program, the Carroll Center for the
Blind also offers summer courses in sailing fundamentals and
publishes ``Facing the Wind,'' a manual for teaching sailing to the
blind. For more information, call the facility at (617) 969-6200 or
write to: Carroll Center for the Blind, 770 Centre St., Newton, MA
02158.))

   Beginning the week of Dec. 6, 1998, the Boston Globe will begin
moving two new columns, by staff writers Adrian Walker and Brian
McGrory. They will join Pulitzer-winning columnist Eileen McNamara
in The Globe's Metro section.
</P>
<P>
   Because these are Metro columnists, their subject matter on some
days may be too local to be of interest outside the immediate
Boston area. Budgets will indicate when their columns will not move
for this reason.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule:
</P>
<P>
   -- Eileen McNamara's Sunday column will move on Monday; her
Wednesday column will move Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Brian McGrory's Tuesday and Friday columns will move Tuesday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   -- Adrian Walker's Thursday column will move Thursday; his
Saturday column will move Friday Evening, for immediate release.

VOTE BOOSTS CLINTON ROLE IN PEACE EFFORT, MITCHELL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. _ George Mitchell, who helped negotiate the
historic Irish peace treaty, said Wednesday that this week's US
elections had bolstered President Clinton's ability to press for
implementation of both the Irish agreement and the recently
concluded pact between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats had fared poorly in Tuesday's balloting, said
Mitchell, it could have undermined Clinton's authority at home and
abroad because the outcome would have been perceived as a public
condemnation of the president's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. The
former senator from Maine said that, instead, voters made it clear
they want politicians to turn their attention away from the sex
scandal and onto ``more serious'' policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously intangible ... but very clearly his position
has been strengthened, and any doubts about him have been resolved
in his favor,'' Mitchell said in an interview before speaking at
Tufts University. ``That's bound to have an effect on both the
Irish and the Mideast questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell made no bones about his bias in assessing this week's
voting. He said he was ``delighted'' by the results and described
himself as a ``committed Democrat.'' His evaluation of Clinton's
post-election stature echoed that of many analysts in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell implied that Clinton's enhanced standing came at a
potentially important time, as glitches have arisen for the
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli and the Irish accords.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the latter, Mitchell expressed confidence that
too much progress has been made for the process to fall apart
easily, especially since residents of both the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland resoundingly voted for peace earlier this year.
``I believe it has a momentum that will enable it to endure,'' said
the onetime Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview and in his address, Mitchell sounded less
sanguine about the prospects in the Middle East, though he
predicted that peace eventually will be achieved there. Though he
did not explicitly say so, his view of Clinton's power seemed to
apply more to that region than to Ireland since US leverage,
particularly in Israel, has been an integral part of negotiations
between the Jewish state and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell came to Tufts Wednesday to be the fifth annual speaker
at a lecture series endowed by Issam Fares, a wealthy Lebanese
businessman whose youngest son attended the university here. Past
speakers have included former President George Bush and former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Given Mitchell's background _ his mother was Lebanese and his
paternal grandparents were Irish emigres _ he seemed pleased about
the subject of his address: The lessons Middle East peace advocates
can draw from his three-plus years of bargaining with
representatives from the north and south of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although they are distant lands,'' he said near the start of
his remarks, ``in both, the highway of peace runs directly through
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell went on to outline the ways in which Middle East
negotiatiors can learn from their Irish counterparts. Among them
was ``a genuine willingness to understand the other point of
view,'' along with ``courage and perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell said all parties must commit themselves to
implementing a pact they reach and not just revel in the fact that
one has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be self-evident,'' said Mitchell. ``But often just
getting an agreement is so difficult that the natural tendency is
to celebrate, then go home and relax. But as we are now seeing in
Northern Ireland ... and in the Middle East ... getting it done is
often harder than agreeing to do it.''

SHADE FROM AUSTIN TRIBUTE WON'T HIDE ROLE IN INTRODUCING SLAVERY TO
TEXAS TERRITORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, Texas _ The Waller County Courthouse grounds will be
shadier, as well as more politically correct, thanks to an unusual
tree-planting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The observance originally was planned as a low-key arboreal
tribute to Stephen F. Austin, the 19th-century colonial impresario
regarded in state history as ``The Father of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, besides recognizing Austin's role as the original Texas
land developer, the ceremony also came to include special attention
to his place in introducing slavery into the new territory.
</P>
<P>
   County Commissioner Frank Jackson, an African-American, was
responsible for the enhancement, which came about after the Sons of
the Republic of Texas last week pitched a plan to honor Austin by
planting a live oak tree on the courthouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal to Commissioners Court drew a stinging rebuttal
from Jackson in the form of an impromptu history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be remiss (if) I sat by and voted to honor Austin
without also honoring the victims of the holocaust of slavery,'' he
said, going on to decry how the slave trade had ``stripped a people
of its whole culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took our language, our god. Our minds were deliberately
mutated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson reminded officials of the Sam Houston Chapter of the
Sons of the Republic of Texas, along with his fellow commissioners,
that slavery came to Texas in its very earliest days as a colonial
territory of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He said head colonist Austin offered additional land to settlers
with slaves. Historical accounts of the era reflect that
slave-owners would list their slaves as indentured servants in
order to skirt the Mexican government's official sanctions against
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Liendo Plantation, northwest of Houston and now a Waller County
tourist attraction, grew to regional prominence before the Civil
War as a slave-tended cotton plantation. It began as a Spanish land
grant in Austin's colony.
</P>
<P>
   Other plantation owners in what is now Waller County kept slaves
to work cotton fields and tend herds, and several slave cemeteries
still exist today in out-of-the-way corners of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson closed his lecture with a motion that a companion oak
tree be planted to honor the slaves of early Texas, and Precinct 4
Commissioner Eddie Neuman seconded it.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people, including a number of Hempstead Elementary
School children, attended the ceremony. The two saplings that were
planted came from West Columbia, south of Houston, the Brazoria
County site of Austin's grave.
</P>
<P>
   The Sons of the Republic of Texas organization plans to plant
oak trees commemorating Austin on the grounds of every county
courthouse in the state, officials said. &QL;

TRIAL OF UGANDAN ON BAD CHECK COUNTS OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To federal prosecutors, the case against Nasser Ntge
Sebaggala, the mayor of Uganda's capital city, ``is about fraud,''
about trying to deposit four bad checks in BankBoston totaling more
than $190,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about lying to US Customs about a bundle of traveler's
checks, some of them stolen, tucked into Sebaggala's suitcase when
he landed at Logan Airport last New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Sebaggala and his lawyer see it quite
differently. Far from being a calculating criminal intent on
cheating banks and defying customs regulations, they say Sebaggala
was the victim of an unscrupulous associate he put in charge of his
currency-exchange business while he worked in Ugandan politics.
</P>
<P>
   The differing views of Sebaggala, 51, who endured beatings and
harassment at the hands of former Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, were
presented to a jury Wednesday in federal court, where Sebaggala
went on trial on charges of bank fraud, transporting altered
checks, and making false statements to US Customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement to jurors, Assistant US Attorney
Theodore Chuang said that Sebaggala, while visiting the United
States in September 1997, opened an account at a BankBoston branch
in Waltham and deposited four checks totaling $191,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the checks, originally written to other parties, had been
altered so that Sebaggala was the payee. ``You'll see the erasure
marks. You'll see the discolored paper. You'll see the crooked
typing on the checks,'' Chuang said.
</P>
<P>
   A large stamp mark was also placed on the front of the checks to
blot out bank notations which showed they had previously been
cashed, Chuang said. Although a BankBoston manager noticed the
alterations on two of the checks and refused to deposit them in
Sebaggala's account, two others were deposited and he was able to
withdraw $53,000.
</P>
<P>
   The charge dealing with lying to Customs stems from Sebaggala
allegedly telling a Customs officer at Logan that he had $40,000 in
traveler's checks in his suitcase when in fact he had more than
$100,000. Currency amounts over $10,000 must be reported on
declaration forms.
</P>
<P>
   But Sebaggala's attorney, Paul V. Kelly, said his client, who
had trouble deciphering the Customs form, believed he was only
required to report currency, not traveler's checks. During a
previous trip to Chicago, Sebaggala, with the assistance of a
Customs officer, had declared only $3,000 in cash he had with him,
not $30,000 in traveler's checks in his suitcase, Kelly told
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Sebaggala did not know how much in traveler's checks
he was carrying when he landed at Logan on Jan. 1 because the
manager of his currency-exchange business in Kampala had bundled
the checks. When Sebaggala asked a Customs officer if he could
retrieve an inventory from his suitcase, he was refused, Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Sebaggala was spending only an hour or so a day at
his currency-exchange business after becoming a full-time
politician and then mayor, and knew nothing about checks being
altered or traveler's checks stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply wasn't involved in it,'' Kelly said. ``He didn't
know about it ... He's as much a victim of this conduct as anyone
else.''

JESSE VENTURA: EX-WRESTLER BRINGS MUSCLE TO GOVERNOR'S MANSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.)

 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ He's given up body-slamming Hulk Hogan.
He's quit wearing a pink feather boa and glitter tights. He no
longer pummels alien invaders with Arnold Schwarzenegger or plays
characters who snarl things like, ``I ain't got time to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, Jesse Ventura _ former ``bad boy'' on the pro wrestling
circuit, action-flick actor, Navy SEAL, and talk radio shock jock _
says he's ready for a new nickname. He doesn't want to be called
``the Body'' any more. ``I'm Jesse the Mind now,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Ventura _ the strapping, chrome-domed,
gravel-throated sports-celluloid celebrity _ has a new job. In an
earth-rattling political upset Tuesday that left politicians and
prognosticators shellshocked, Ventura became the next governor of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to resist, David Letterman instantly offered up a Top Ten
list of slogans for the new chief of state, including ``Building a
steroid-enhanced bridge to the 21st century,'' and ``C'mon, don't
you want to see Newt Gingrich in a chokehold.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ventura, who ran as a third party maverick against two
respected and established major-party candidates, strutted a little
through his victory party as if he had just whacked Jimmy
``Superfly'' Snuka.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said a vote for me was a wasted vote,'' he said. ``Well
guess what? Those wasted votes wasted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's breathtaking victory _ with 37 percent of the vote _
marked the first time a Reform Party candidate has ever won
statewide office and makes him the highest ranking elected official
in Ross Perot's party. And it was a huge humiliation for his rivals
_ the Democrat, Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III,
son of the former vice president, who got 28 percent, and the
Republican, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who got 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gosh, it's stunning,'' said Chris Gilbert, chairman of
the department of political science at Gustavus Aldophus University
in St. Peter, Minn., one of a legion of experts who initially
thought Ventura was just a ``curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how we try to explain it, it's a really
stunning, striking outcome for Minnesota and the nation, to have a
Reform Party candidate break through and for the Democrats and
Republicans in the state to essentially see all their core
supporters taken away from them,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   A few observers were not as shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse's victory proves that people want a real man in power to
lead, not a play plastic puppet like other politicians,'' said Hulk
Hogan, who played good guy to Ventura's bad guy. (He added: ``I'd
love to get him in the ring one time before he becomes
president.'')
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Minnesota, the Jesse phenomenon might seem comical.
But inside the state, at least in 20-20 hindsight, it actually
seems to make sense. Behind it is a streak of protest vote, a trace
of the national backlash against politicians. But Ventura was able
to cobble together a number of other advantages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Ventura, 47, had tremendous name recognition,
primarily from his talk-radio show, and that made up for his lack
of campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   While Coleman and Humphrey were both competent and
well-regarded, they lacked luster and began to snipe at each other
in what, for Minnesota, was a negative campaign. Ventura, on the
other hand, is an appealingly colorful mixture of affable bravado
and plainspoken drive. In one of his television commercials
children play with a Jesse Ventura action figure who scuffles with
Evil Special Interest Man.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, voters with low expectations were pleasantly
surprised when Ventura, who served four years as the mayor of
Brooklyn Park, a suburb of Minneapolis, turned out to be a
substantive candidate too, able to clearly articulate opinions on
almost every issue, many of them refreshingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as a fiscal conservative with liberal and
moderate social views, Ventura supports abortion rights and gay
rights. He refuses money from special interest groups, and opposes
school vouchers, merit pay for teachers and taxpayer funding for a
new baseball stadium. He even mused publicly about legalizing
prostitution and drugs, although he says he's not suggesting he
approves of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a populist affection for political mavericks _
Ross Perot got 24 percent of the presidential vote here in 1992 _
all this went over like gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotasek, a 32-year-old baker from Bloomington, said he was
persuaded to vote for Ventura precisely because the other
candidates seemed to marginalize him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about him running, I thought it was going
to be a stunt,'' said Gary Isakson, a 30-year-old sales
representative for a Minneapolis concrete company. ``But I hear him
in these debates and he really won me over. I'm sick of
professional politicians voting for specific bills just because
they have to vote along party lines. I liked what he said about if
a bill comes across his desk, he'll sign if it's good for
Minnesota. He just talks straight from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Body'' was born James George Janos, still his legal name,
but he began to call himself Jesse Ventura at the start of his
professional wrestling career in 1975. ``Ventura'' sounded like it
fit the bleached-blond surfer-wrestler image he was cultivating
after coming out of a stint as a Navy S.E.A.L in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't really a very good wrestler, but he had charisma,''
said Dave Meltzer, publisher and editor of Wrestling Observer
newsletter. ``His best move was standing on the apron yelling at
the fans while his tag team partner did all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura believes that wrestling has laid a foundation for his
politics because it made him comfortable ad-libbing and performing.
Others see different advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of wrestling is that when you make move A and
someone blocks move A, you've got to make move B, C or D,'' said
Nick Bockwinkle, four-time heavyweight wrestling champion who lives
in Minnesota. ``You've always got to have alternatives and I think
that translates to the political structure as well.'' (Sounds like
he'd make a good cabinet member in a Ventura administration).
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ventura left wrestling and began to get small roles in
films like ``Batman and Robin'' and ``Predator'' with
Schwarzenegger. He went on to be Brooklyn Park mayor from 1991 to
1995. He and his wife Terry own a thoroughbred horse ranch outside
Minneapolis. He says he will continue to be the conditioning coach
a high school football team, where one of his mantras is ``What is
pain? Pain is good!''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's greatest challenge will be to work with the state
legislature _ a Democratic Senate and, as of Tuesday, for the first
time in years, a Republican House. But the man who as a candidate
once replied to a question about getting along with the legislature
by baring his grapefruit-sized bicep, seemed unfazed by that
conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've jumped out of an airplane 34 times,'' he said. ``I've
dove 212 feet under water. I've done a lot of things that defied
death, and this isn't defying death. It's just common sense and
hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ventura, who said he was ``awestruck'' and punchy
from exhaustion, met with Gov. Arne Carlson, whose staff had
briefing books ready. Then he did an hour of his radio show _ live
in a packed sports bar _ fielding calls from, among others, the
owner of the Vikings, who offered him his pick of seats, saying
``you can body slam me on the 50-yard line if you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he never even got so much as a press pass before.
``You know,'' he said, ``I'm beginning to kind of like this gig.''

FBI LOOKING INTO HALL OF FAMERS' RECORDS THEFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ill.; a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The FBI has begun a ``preliminary inquiry'' into the
theft of public records linked to baseball Hall of Famers in
Boston, just as officials in Illinois have learned the will from
another Hall of Famer is missing from their files.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both states suspect the thefts may be related since
all of the men played in Boston in the late 19th Century during
professional baseball's early years.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Howard Springer of the McLean, Ill., sheriff's department,
said Wednesday that collectors often try to assemble signatures
from a single team or era in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The wills of George Wright, Thomas McCarthy and Hugh Duffy, all
Hall of Fame players from the late 19th century, are missing from
the vaults at the Suffolk Registrar of Probate's office in Boston.
In Illinois, the will of Charley ``Big Hoss'' Radbourn, a star
pitcher who played with the Boston Beaneaters in the 1880s, is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Peter Generis of the FBI's Boston office said agents
met Wednesday with Suffolk Registrar of Probate Richard Iannella,
who was alerted last week that a probate record signed by Wright
was set for auction in Manhattan. Iannella then searched his vaults
and discovered the records from the two other players were also
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking into it'' as a violation of federal laws
against interstate transport of stolen property, Generis said. ``We
don't know what we have here yet, but we are looking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Detective Springer said a baseball memorabilia
collector contacted authorities last week. The collector had
examined Radbourn's will in 1988 for a story he wrote for a
collector's magazine. When officials looked at Raybourn's probate
file in the Bloomington, Ill., courthouse last week, Springer said,
``it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I check into it (the Radbourn theft), the more
information I get that it's out there in the New Jersey, New York,
Boston area,'' Springer said. ``I can't prove it, I haven't found
anybody who has seen it, but it's an indication'' the will may be
for sale in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, said the fact that all of the players had Boston
connections leads him to suspect the thefts are related.
</P>
<P>
   Iannella said Wednesday officials in both states have
independently come up with the name of one person who may be
selling the records.
</P>
<P>
   Ianella also said he expects the probate record of Wright to be
returned to his office from Leland's, a Manhattan auction house,
today. The auction house paid $2,000 for the Wright document, but
agreed to return it to Iannella after he said he would not seek to
prosecute them.

HIGH-TECH WHEELCHAIRS OFF BEATEN PATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LANGTON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The mountain bike revolutionized the cycling
industry and changed the face of the sport by introducing hordes of
new disciples, but its most worthwhile contribution may be to the
field of adaptive recreation.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, designer and inventor John Castellano of
Petaluma fabricated a wheelchair for a disabled friend that was
part mountain bike, part go-cart. The Cobra off-road wheelchair
featured a chassis with four-wheel disc brakes and a unique
steering mechanism that allowed the rider to steer the chair much
like an all-terrain vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early success, Castellano's dream of mass producing his
4WD wheelchair was met with formidable hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't enough people demanding this product to make
the economy of scale viable,'' Castellano said. ``The market is
very small, and those people who do want one don't always have a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   While technology exists to mass produce off-road chairs, demand
is low and even an inexpensive chair costs around $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that a full-suspension mountain bike costs $1,000
is that they're going to sell 25,000 of them. We'll sell maybe 25
or 30 wheelchairs this year, so it's all volume,'' explained
Michael Whiting of Denver-based Wildernet, one of only two company
producing off-road chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Wildernet's Phoenix 3 features fully independent suspension,
four-wheel disc brakes and sophisticated aluminum I-beam frame
technology. It sells for around $5,000. The Razor, at about half
the cost, features a steel frame and a suspended seat and shock
absorbing handlebar assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But expensive, high-tech, off-road wheelchair equipment is not
essential to enjoying the trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is irrelevant to the essence of the sport,''
Whiting said. ``It's part of the reason the sport is becoming more
popular... but it doesn't have to be `full-suspension hydraulic
downhill monster chairs' for people to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders are confident that, like mountain biking, the
demand for off-road chairs will increase as more people are exposed
to the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting's seven-event World Off-Road Wheelchair Series is
helping to do just that. This year nearly 400 people participated
in the series, which included a stop at Big Bear Lake. Next year's
series schedule has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The National Off-Road Bicycle Association (NORBA) has created a
class for off-road wheelchair downhill racers. Gerard Moreno of Los
Angeles has been racing for nearly five years and is the current
California state downhill champion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, 41, has always been active in sports. That nearly
changed 17 years ago when he become paralyzed after being shot
during a robbery. But as soon as he was able, Moreno sought
activities in which he could participate using a wheelchair. He
discovered an Enduro ATC off-road wheelchair at an abilities
exposition and began racing almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go out with my two Siberian Huskies up to Sycamore
Canyon (in the Santa Monica Mountains) and have the dogs pull me in
a regular wheelchair,'' Moreno said. ``It was fun, but I took a lot
of nose dives. The folks at Enduro were looking for someone to race
their chair. They sent me home with one, and I've been racing ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno, a member of the U.S. wheelchair fencing team that placed
12th in the saber competition at the World Championships in Germany
over the summer, has made several modifications to wheelchair
mountain bikes over the years. For example, he has added custom
shock absorbers and an air-activated seat-height system. With the
push of a button, Moreno can raise the seat for better leverage
while pushing the wheels or lower it for a better center of gravity
on the descents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off-road chairs can go almost anywhere a mountain bike can
go,'' Moreno said. Of course, he added, it helps to have a couple
of mountain bikers along to tow the wheelchair and rider up the
steeper hills _ or a hiker or runner to push them up.
</P>
<P>
   As a board member of the U.S. Adaptive Recreation Center at Bear
Mountain ski resort in Big Bear Lake, Moreno witnesses the
transformation of disabled people who get out on the trails with
the aid of an off-road chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's unsafe, but I know the people who come
up and try it, and they love it. The freedom is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Adaptive Recreation Center plans to purchase at least
two Phoenix chairs and make them available for test rides. Also,
the World Off-Road Wheelchair Series will add high-performance
riding skills clinics this year.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting speaks for many in the industry when he says his biggest
goal is to get as many people as possible to enjoy the experience.
``A disabled person getting in an off-road chair is like an
able-bodied person being able to fly.'' &QL;

DEVASTATED HONDURAS STRUGGLES TO AID RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Gasoline stations ran out of fuel and
grocery store shelves emptied Wednesday in the wake of the mayhem
of Hurrican Mitch. Meanwhile, the Honduran government was
overwhelmed by a nation in desperate need of basic services from
drinking water to medical care and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Government agencies said they were still trying to piece
together the most basic information: how many people died, how many
are missing, how many bridges are unsafe, how many miles of road
must be fixed, and how much all of this will cost.
</P>
<P>
   The other countries that were savaged by the hurricane's rain
and winds _ Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize and Mexico _
face the same dilemma. The total number killed by Mitch is believed
to be near 9,000, including 7,000 in Honduras alone.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, US Army helicopters plucked several dozen people
from rooftops and hills in flooded areas, while an Army team
searched for a group of international technicians that had been
deactivating land mines on the border of Nicaragua when they were
surrounded by rising rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the rescue effort will be ending in a day or two so
that we can move to the next desperate phase, which is providing
food and water,'' said US Ambassador James F. Creagan, whose own
home became a shelter for 40 girls from an orphanage that was
surrounded by water. Seven of the girls had chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   With hospitals and clinics overwhelmed and the threat of disease
looming, most embassies in Honduras told non-essential staff
members to leave the country. The Peace Corps started evacuating
its 200 volunteers from the country Wednesday afternoon. ``There's
no food, no gas, no way of getting treated if you get injured,''
said Ethan Macomber, 28, of Brunswick, Maine, who ran a
conservation project on the Caribbean coast with his wife, Lauri,
who is also a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Tegucigalpa, the capital, basked in a second day of sunshine
after nearly a week of punishing rain. At first glance, the city
resembles any Central American city in normal times, with hectic
traffic, street vendors and ramshackle houses sprawling off to the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different city than it was before Mitch. The
bridges linking Tegucigalpa to the coast and the rest of the
country were swept away. Most shops are closed. Stores have no milk
or fresh fruit, and entire slum neighborhoods on river banks are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Even the old Central Penitentiary, with its stone walls and iron
gates that harken back to Colonial times, is empty. Over the
weekend, a swollen river knocked down one of the walls and several
prisoners managed to flee. Hundreds of other prisoners have been
relocated to an unfinished prison where they are threatening to
riot because of the shortage of food and water.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Honduras is bustling, but not with students.
Its classrooms now house 4,000 people who have been left without
homes, and hundreds more are sleeping in public schools and the
National Stadium. School officials said they have no idea when
classes will resume.
</P>
<P>
   Affluent neighborhoods in the green hills above Tegucigalpa have
felt the effects of Mitch as well. The area where the US ambassador
lives does not have tap water because a large pipe in the mountains
broke during a landslide, so Ambassador Creagan has been swimming
instead of showering.
</P>
<P>
   The US goverment has promised $2 million in emergency aid, and
officials in Washington say Congress will soon be asked to approve
far more than that. Estimates of the cost of rebuilding the country
and restoring farms range from hundreds of millions to billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The US Army Corps of Engineers will soon arrive to build bridges
and roads, officials said. Macomber, the Peace Corps volunteer, was
irritated because he had met several Hondurans who seemed willing
to rely on others to repair the damage. ``A taxi driver told me,
`God is going to help us, and Bill Clinton is going to send
millions of dollars,' '' Macomber said.
</P>
<P>
   Private industries have taken a much more aggressive role than
they did after the devastation from Hurricane Fifi in 1974.
Companies that ship food and fuel have started repairing roads from
Honduras to San Pedro Sula, on the north coast.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the companies had coordinated their work with the
government, an official from an international bank just smiled.
Government offices are in chaos, and employees might not be paid
for several weeks. The Ministry of Education, which sits near a
river, is immersed in mud. Files at the Ministry of Public Works
are a jumble of wet papers with indecipherable writing. At the
Ministry of Finance, an IBM mainframe computer donated by the
United States stands in six inches of water in a basement.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry does not know the exact amount of Honduras'
foreign debt _ which hovers around $3.8 billion. It doesn't matter
much, anyway. Due to the hurricane, Honduras has suspended
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Every agency has been affected. On the Caribbean coast, this
summer the police stopped four Colombians in a speedboat filled
with cocaine. The seized boat, with twin 250-horsepower motors, was
to be the workhorse of the anti-drug force. During Mitch, it
capsized and sank in the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ministry of International Technical Cooperation, director
Moises Starkman worked with embassies and non-profit groups to
dispatch food to far-flung areas. A shipment of six tons of
medicine, rice, beans and canned food, for example, flew from the
capital to the north coast in a plane chartered by Trocaire, an
Irish group. From there, a US Army helicopter airlifted it
Wednesday to a remote coastal town in the province called Gracias a
Dios, or Thanks to God.
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, fuel trucks will start to arrive to the capital,
Starkman said. ``We're facing two or three very difficult days for
the people and then it will be difficult,'' Starkman said. ``It
will take a long time to return to a sense of normalcy.''

HOUSE GOP WRESTLES WITH CLINTON DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The next act of the 105th Congress _ a high-profile
hearing next week on the standards for impeaching a president _ may
be one of its last.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise results of Tuesday's election apparently
underscoring the public's disdain for the push to impeach President
Clinton, House Republicans Wednesday faced the delicate dilemma of
trying to quickly resolve the investigation of Clinton's sex
scandal without further harming the GOP cause.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to open
full-scale hearings as early as Nov. 16 into the circumstances
surrounding Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But as television networks geared up for the potential
spectacle, several analysts said House Republican leaders are
resigned to the apparent futility of the impeachment effort and are
privately exploring possible legal and political alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cut the fragile GOP majority in the House from 11
seats to six in the election. And Republicans failed to gain
strength in the Senate, where they hold 55 seats, 12 shy of the 67
they would need to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 106th Congress, which convenes in January, is
expected to be even less likely than the current assembly to
consider removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election, it's pretty clear there isn't going to be
an impeachment,'' said former Representative Bill Frenzel, a
Minnesota Republican who served in the House for 20 years before
becoming a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``The Republicans need to find a way to get rid of it
before the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That quandary is the most urgent of several problems confronting
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who also faces the possible wrath of
rank-and-file GOP lawmakers over the unexpected election gains by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gingrich may be saddled with trying to protect his
speakership while Clinton and the larger Democratic minority,
re-energized by the election results, step up the pressure for
their prized initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the speaker's strength has been diminished,'' said
Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget
Office. ``There is going to be a certain amount of looking over
one's shoulder going on among the House Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it remained unclear whether the GOP rank-and-file has
the power _ or inclination _ to oust Gingrich, who has pledged to
step down in 2000 after his third term as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty, the 106th Congress is expected to look _
and legislate _ much like the 105th. Analysts said Republican
leaders will be handcuffed by the possibility that as few as six
GOP moderates or conservatives can block their agenda by
threatening to vote with a unified Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out in the 105th Congress, as efforts
by GOP leaders to push several initiatives, including using the
budget surplus for tax cuts, were stymied by rebellious factions
within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen this year is what we'll see next year,''
Frenzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even most of the issues will be similar, from overhauling
managed care regulations and the campaign finance system to banning
late-term abortions and abolishing the so-called marriage tax
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   However, the White House has vowed to make the next session's
top priority designing a long-term plan to preserve the Social
Security system. And top Clinton supporters vowed to continue to
press issues that were blocked this year by the Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will renew the fight for things that will make a difference
in people's lives, starting with urgently needed reforms in HMOs,
aid for school construction repair, and an increase in the minimum
wage,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impeachment problem looms. And no one expects the
issue to be easily resolved, since the House is obligated to
complete the formal inquiry it authorized last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the first step, which was like taking the first step
off the mountain when you are skiing,'' Reischauer said. ``Once you
start down, you can't go back up. They are going to have a very,
very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also must consider the views of Judiciary Chairman
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, whose reputation could be harmed if GOP
leaders seek a political resolution that is seen as undermining the
integrity of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde issued a statement Wednesday indicating he hoped to stay
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to
complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner,'' Hyde said.
``This was just as true before the election as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had said he hoped to complete the inquiry by the end of the
year. But committee lawyers have yet to begin formally interviewing
potential hearing witnesses and the schedule for the proceedings
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Clinton include perjury, obstruction of
justice and witness tampering. But the panel's work could be
complicated if the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, who is
reportedly investigating whether Clinton made a sexual advance to
former White House aide Kathleen Willey, recommends additional
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also are expected to protest any attempts to
speed up the proceedings at the expense of the president's due
process rights.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee said Hyde planned to
issue a statement later this week that may discuss a timetable for
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several committee members in both parties said they
believed voters sent the House a message that they were sick of the
Lewinsky matter and the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to admonish the president and bring it to a
conclusion,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat. ``But I'm not sure the Republicans on the committee
recognize the results the people are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mary Bono of California, the only Republican
woman on the panel, said she heard the same message as
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and
committee member, who defeated Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bono quoted Schumer as saying, ``People are definitely tired
with the impeachment. They want to put it behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I can't agree with him more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Bono added, ``it is still our duty to look at
what we have before us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a vote expected to have national reverberations,
Washington state's residents dealt a stinging defeat to
state-sponsored affirmative action. Alaska and Hawaii voters said a
clear no to the idea of same-sex marriages, while voters in five
Western states gave a resounding yes to the medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Arizona voters said yes to public financing of
political campaigns, while Colorado and Washington said no to the
idea of criminalizing late-term abortions. And Oregon, becoming the
first state in the nation to do away with polling places
altogether, will conduct elections entirely by mail.
</P>
<P>
   These were some of the highlights of votes on more than 200
initiatives and proposed constitutional amendments that were on
state ballots on Tuesday. Supporters hail such initiatives as
popular democracy in action, but critics call them a potentially
dangerous subversion of representative government.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its merits or flaws, the initiative process was used
Tuesday in 16 states, perhaps most notably here in Washington,
where voters also made theirs the first state in the nation to
require annual minimum-wage increases linked to the inflation rate,
and in California, where voters contended with a dozen major
questions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, an initiative to raise cigarette taxes by 50
cents a pack and use the tax income for children's programs was too
close to call, in spite of a huge campaign blitz by tobacco
companies. And in a battle that became the most expensive fight
ever waged over a state initiative, the state's voters ignored an
advertising campaign by Nevada casinos and broadly backed the
expansion of casino gambling on Indian tribal lands in California.
</P>
<P>
   In all, voters passed 37 of the 61 initiatives and popular
referendums before them, a higher percentage of yes votes than in
any other election this decade. In general, the big winners Tuesday
were medical marijuana, campaign-finance reform and gambling, while
the big losers were doctor-assisted suicide, tax credits for
private-school tuition, a late-term abortion procedure that its
opponents call partial-birth abortion, and same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters addressed the tough issues that elected officials
have been unwilling to deal with as well as voted down those
reforms they weren't ready for,'' said M. Dane Waters, president
and founder of the Initiative &AMP; Referendum Institute, a nonpartisan
group that tracks the votes and generally supports the initiative
process.
</P>
<P>
   But others said that many of the measures that passed were
misleading to the voters, and on no issue was there more debate
about the meaning of the initiative than on Washington state's
Proposition 200, which passed 58 percent to 42 percent and will ban
many state-supported forms of affirmative action that were
originally enacted to remedy discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who went into the polling booths Tuesday were asked
whether government should be ``prohibited from discriminating or
granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color,
ethnicity or national origin'' in public employment, education and
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   They said yes by a wide margin, making Washington just the
second state, after California, to enact such language into law.
``It means that America is taking a great step forward to looking
beyond race and minimizing its importance, rather than dwelling on
it and magnifying its importance,'' said John Carlson, chairman of
the group sponsoring the initiative. ``It also, I think, will
hasten the transition of affirmative action from a program based on
race and ethnicity and occasionally gender to a program that is
based on people's circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   But the vote, far from clarifying the issue, is certain to spark
a round of lawsuits, as supporters of affirmative action argue that
programs intended to provide equal opportunity for racial
minorities or women do not constitute preferential treatment. They
also point to polls suggesting that while people endorse the
language in measures such as Proposition 200, which was taken from
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they will say ``no'' when asked
whether they wish to eliminate affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the vote in Washington is clearly a boost to
opponents of the practice, and is likely to spur efforts to get
similar measures on the ballots in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights measures went down to defeat in several states
Tuesday. Colorado residents rejected a proposal to grant gays and
lesbians civil-rights protection against discrimination. Hawaii
voters gave the Legislature authorization to overturn a court
ruling and ban same-sex marriages, while Alaskans voted 2-1 in
favor of a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a
union between one man and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen states have already banned gay marriages and
Congress has passed the Defense of Marriage Act, which prevents
federal recognition of marriages between homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in South Portland, Maine, passed a local ordinance to ban
discrimination based on sexual orientation, but in three other
cities _ Fayetteville, Ark.; Fort Collins, Colo.; and Ogunquit,
Maine _ such measures were defeated. The issue was especially
charged in Fort Collins, which is near Laramie, Wyo., the city
where Matthew Shepard, a gay man, was beaten and tied to a fence.
He was transferred to a hospital in Fort Collins, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the struggle for full equality is a
long-term one,'' said Kerry Lobel, executive director of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ``And win or lose in Hawaii
and Alaska, we will continue to fight for full equality, including
the freedom to marry, until we succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle over California's proposed cigarette tax remained
breathtakingly close Tuesday evening; with all precincts reporting,
the yes forces had 3,550,483 votes, while the no vote stood at
3,537,278. A recount was almost certain in what has been dubbed the
``Marlboro vs. Meathead'' battle, pitting tobacco companies against
a coalition led by Rob Reiner, the actor whose character got that
nickname in the ``All in the Family'' television series.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In other votes, Michigan residents soundly rejected a proposal
to legalize physician-assisted suicide, and South Carolinians,
asked to decide whether to remove a 103-year-old passage in their
constitution that forbids marriage between a white person and a
black person, decided to do so, though 38 percent of voters were
against striking that language. The U.S. Supreme Court has already
found it to be unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, voters agreed to add the phrase ``and women'' to the
constitutional guarantee that all men ``are, by nature, free and
equal, and have certain inalienable rights.'' Floridians voted
solidly to let counties impose waiting periods on firearms sold at
gun shows. And voters in Massachusetts and California rejected
efforts to block deregulation of the electric utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   In what is perhaps a reflection of Americans' positive
perceptions about the economy, voters approved a record total of
$20 billion in bond measures for schools and infrastructure
projects such as water and sewer line improvements. Sports stadiums
in Denver, San Diego and Cincinnati were also approved.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to outlaw what its opponents call ``partial-birth
abortion'' were turned back in two states. Abortion-rights
supporters condemned the measure, saying its terminology was overly
vague and might lead some judges to ban all abortions. The question
before voters in Washington was: ``Shall the termination of a
fetus' life during the process of birth be a felony crime except
when necessary to prevent the pregnant woman's death?''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more unusual local issues to make it to the ballot
box, voters in Newport, Maine, decided by 775-283 to reject an
ordinance that would have punished women for publicly displaying
their breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began when a woman in that town got into the habit
of mowing her lawn without a shirt, prompting complaints by her
neighbor to the local authorities that she was violating decency
laws. Maine law prohibits display of genitalia or commission of sex
acts in public, but town officials ruled that breasts were not
genitals and that lawn mowing was not a sexual act, so they said
they could not charge the woman with breaking any law. That
prompted the irate neighbor to get enough signatures to put the
measure on the ballot, but it failed.

DESPITE MIDDAY FIZZLE, DOW FINISHES UP 77  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Apparently buoyed by election results, stock prices
jumped early Wednesday but then faded after investors showed little
enthusiasm for an offering of government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 148 points at
one stage, barely managed to stay in positive territory during an
afternoon swoon before moving up again in the final hour to finish
with a gain of 76.99 points, or 0.9 percent. Indexes made up of
smaller companies, however, did better.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts seemed to agree that electoral inroads by
Democrats _ rare for a presidential party in midterm elections _
diminished the chances of a market-rattling impeachment process
that could result in President Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling that the risk of a nasty impeachment
proceeding has gone down a lot,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief market
strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``If Republicans had had a
successful election, I think Newt Gingrich et al. would have been
encouraged to press the impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar note was struck by Lisa Cullen, a strategist at
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's good news for stocks because it looks like the
Republicans won't be able to muster the firepower to impeach
Clinton,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the afternoon selloff, which also coincided with release
of a federal survey showing the economy lost momentum in September
and October, most stocks posted gains, with indexes dominated by
technology and smaller capitalization stocks faring best.
</P>
<P>
   Various positive forces have converged in recent weeks to
encourage stock investors, including signs of stabilization in
Brazil, a seemingly serious attack by Japan on its banking
problems, a big financial replenishment for the International
Monetary Fund and some reassuring inflation and other reports from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks climbed smartly in all major overseas markets Wednesday,
with main gauges up 4.12 percent in Japan and 1.96 percent in
Brazil. Mexican stocks were up 3.39 percent, Germany's 3.59
percent, France's 2.80 percent, Britain's 2.16 percent and Hong
Kong's 1.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, some analysts suggested, might have benefited early
in the session by demand from foreign investors who generally may
not have realized that impeachment fever had already diminished
here before the election.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan and American Express, both with significant exposure
to overseas turmoil, accounted by themselves for 59 percent of the
Dow's rise. Morgan soared 7|, to 101}, nearly 30 points higher than
four weeks ago, amid speculation that it might be acquired.
American Express climbed 3 9/16, to 94.
</P>
<P>
   Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, on Monday raised his recommended allocation to Japanese
stocks on grounds that the depressed economy there had stabilized
enough to appeal to investors looking for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Steel, which announced it was cutting operations at its
Fairless Works outside Philadelphia by 70 percent because of a
flood of imports, rose 1 5/16, to 26 11/16, lifting its gain over
the last week to 21 percent. Inland and AK Steel each rose more
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks slumped as Dura Pharmaceuticals, down 2|, to 9},
failed to win government approval for its asthma inhaler and was
downgraded by Merrill Lynch. Warner-Lambert and Pfizer lost 3} and
3\, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, a low-cost carrier, gained 7/16, to 21 9/16
on word that it plans to begin flights into the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, investors focused heavily on smaller companies, with
the Nasdaq composite index rising 35.14 points, or 1.96 percent, to
1,823.57, and the Russell 2000 index up 5.40 points, or 1.39
percent, to 392.96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have probably only started the next phase of the
outperformance of the small-cap market,'' said Robert Elliott,
senior executive vice president of Bessemer Trust Co. He noted that
earnings gains of small- and medium-sized companies had now
exceeded those of big companies for three straight quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.83 points, or 0.7
percent, to 1,118.67, but more than twice as many issues rose as
fell _ 333 to 154.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts expressed skepticism that stock prices were
headed much higher. ``We've got some fundamental profit problems,''
said Michael Fenollosa, an economist at John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 2,062 stocks rose Wednesday and
1,027 fell, with new highs swamping new lows 82 to 14. Volume rose
to 861.2 million shares from 704.3 million on Tuesday.

THE VOTERS OF '98: STIRRED, NOT SHAKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and p coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not an earthquake, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Nor a tidal wave.
</P>
<P>
   But as a wakeup call to right-wingers everywhere, Election '98
was on the loud side.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a Congress that off its slightly reduced
conservative strength, after a massive conservative investment,
appears to have lost the political if not the moral authority to
impeach President Clinton; it never had the numbers in the Senate
to kick him out of office based on the current case to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   But however narrowly divided the House of Representatives turns
out to be after what can only be interpreted as a left hook to Newt
Gingrich's glass jaw, this is also a Congress that may not appear
capable of doing anything else, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is a country that faces numerous, complex, and vexing
problems (Social Security and health care being only two) that may
be even tougher to solve with inventive compromises if Congress
becomes even more closely divided.
</P>
<P>
   For instructive example, the country really should turn at long
last to its governors, whose ranks are once again swollen by
precisely the kinds of people Congress lacks in sufficient numbers.
</P>
<P>
   From Republican Paul Cellucci in Massachusetts to surprise
Democratic winner Tom Vilsack in Iowa; from the GOP's Bush brothers
in Texas and Florida to New Democrats like Roy Barnes in Georgia,
Don Siegleman in Alabama, and Tom Hodges in South Carolina, the
lessons ought to be obvious: Go to work; get things done, even if
not ideally; give ground to gain ground; don't race-bait; don't
gay-bash; and leave the right to choose alone. Republicans have
shown they can be as inventive and persistent as President Clinton
in governance in the pragmatic '90s, and they are being rewarded
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Congress. For the defeat of Al D'Amato in New York
and Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina and they crowning of Gray
Davis in California, the Democrats get bragging rights, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton gets the medal for Campaigner of the Season.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no question that the Bush brothers and several
ideological cousins get the Republican stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is when the gridlock gurus in the Congress
are going to get the message. To say that Newt Gingrich and Senate
majority leader Trent Lott had one lousy campaign season this year
is an immense understatement, but to say that either or both will
learn from their colossal goofs is pure fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, however, overinterpret the results last night at
their peril, Clinton included. This was no wild and crazy
electorate that went to the polls. For example:
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bayh, the former governor of Indiana, tore through the
Indianapolis suburbs like a twister last night en route to his
landslide victory for the Senate seat last Democratically occupied
by his father 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But right through the same suburbs and towns that form the
state's 6th Congressional District came chronic Clinton pursuer Dan
Burton, running for reelection against a Democrat charged with
impersonating women over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, something like 25,000 solid Indiana citizens voted
for Democrat Bayh and Republican Burton, not knowing or caring of
the contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff happens whenever Americans vote, but this election
was an unusually good one for dichotomies as well as irony.
</P>
<P>
   Another illustration of the country's split personality to go
with its divided politics is provided by so-called exit polling of
voters at polling places by a large media consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to cite the most important things on their mind, 19
percent brought up education (a solid Democratic winner all year),
and 19 percent brought up moral values (just as solid a Republican
winner all year).
</P>
<P>
   An electorate that is dividing this cleanly and sharply is not
in much of a position to provide clear guidance to the senators and
congressmen who have to go back to ``work'' _ for the next two
months in the House on the impeachment inquiry the public hates and
for the next two years in both branches on perhaps a few matters of
actual significance, such as Social Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   This was an electorate that is no fan of Washington's favorite
sport. Most people in the exit polls _ fully two-thirds, in fact _
agreed that the eternal Lewinsky investigation has hurt President
Clinton's ability to govern the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting slightly more anti-Clinton sentiment than is
generally found in surveys of the public as a whole, two-thirds of
the respondents opposed impeachment of the president. Nearly half
favored censure of him; 40 percent said he should quit.
</P>
<P>
   The message, in short, continues to be that the country wants no
part of this, but it will, of course, go forward anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This was not, however, an angry electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 percent of the voters said their own financial situation
had worsened in the past year; nearly half said it was improved,
and almost as many said it was roughly the same.
</P>
<P>
   Even more notably, more than 80 percent of the respondents
described economic conditions as good or excellent; that figure is
about double what it was four years ago when the Gingrich
earthquake hit.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether either party can take enough out of
this result to form some kind of basis for governance that can
improve on the pathetic record of 1997.

CALIFORNIA REFERENDUM MAY THWART EARLY-PRIMARY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An obscure referendum vote in California may have
thrown a wrench into the state's plans to hold its presidential
primary in the year 2000 on the same day as the vote in five New
England states.
</P>
<P>
   The complication arose when Californians on Tuesday defeated a
proposal that would have required Democrats and Republicans to vote
only for a party member in a primary. By a 54-46 percent margin,
Californians said they wanted to retain the current open system
that allows them to cross party lines on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, California's primary system does not meet the
guidelines set by the Democratic and Republican parties. Both
parties refuse to allow convention delegates to be selected from a
primary if voters can cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Wednesday whether California officials could
find an alternative way to stick with a newly passed state law to
hold the presidential primary on March 7, 2000, the same day that
Massachusetts and other states plan to hold their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   California might propose a new system allowing voters to cross
party lines in a primary that would be viewed as a lower-profile,
non-binding ``beauty contest,'' with convention delegates selected
at separate caucuses. But such a system might render the California
primary nearly meaningless, which is not what political leaders
intended when they set up the early primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin, who has called the prospect of an early California
primary a ``national disaster.'' While Galvin said he assumes
California will go ahead with its March 7 primary, ``they have
reduced it to a beauty pageant. The California political
establishment thought this was a done deal, but it is no longer a
done deal. There will be no delegates selected that day.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, candidates would be less likely to skip the primaries
in Massachusetts and other states to spend most of their time
campaigning for the California primary, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Steve Grossman indicated
the defeat of the California referendum raised questions about the
state's primary effort. He said Democratic and Republican leaders
agree that delegates should not be chosen in a primary where voters
can cross party lines. He said he would testify about the matter on
Nov. 19 at a meeting of secretaries of state, who implement state
election laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is totally committed to the principle
that Democratic voters should choose Democratic delegates to a
Democratic National Convention to choose a presidential nominee,''
Grossman said. ``That principle, which is one of the things we and
our Republican counterparts agree upon, will be a principle we will
insist on as we move toward 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter does not affect the primary in New Hampshire, where
state law requires that its first-in-the-nation vote be held a week
before any other primary. But New Hampshire is feeling a lot of
pressure overall because so many states are considering early
primary dates. Aside from California, several other Western states
are considering holding their primaries on March 7, 2000, the same
day many Eastern states will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a strong effort under way to move a number of
primaries up in the calendar to that March 7 date,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones did not return a call
seeking comment on whether the state will try to go forward with
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Karger, a California political consultant, said the
referendum may have lost because voters knew little about it.
``There was a real lack of awareness,'' said Karger, of the Dolphin
Group. ``There was no campaign for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the referendum may hurt the presidential prospects
of outgoing California Governor Pete Wilson, who backed the early
primary and was expected to benefit from it.

 &HT;    A COURTROOM E-MAIL QUERY: WHERE'S BILL?
 &HT;    EDS: This is one in a series of occasional looks inside the
historic Microsoft antitrust trial.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates _ virtual or real _ wasn't anywhere to
be seen in U.S. District Court here Wednesday. Instead, a
semi-packed courtroom spent the day watching second string Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell lawyer, Theodore Edelman, hammer away at curly-haired
computer scientist Avadis Tevanian Jr., a senior vice president at
Apple Computer, who goes by ``Avie'' in his e-mails. The sparring
centered on Avie's assertion that Microsoft intentionally put bugs
in its operating system, making Apple's QuickTime software crash
with error messages when running on a new version of Microsoft's
popular Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways, between sessions punctuated with laughter at
Avie's in-your-face retorts to Edelman's condescending questions,
though, most observers were whispering about the Main Man, himself.
Bill Gates. Some reporters were peeved that Department of Justice
honcho David Boies had sprung the Gates videotape on them Monday
without warning. A few missed the main attraction entirely. Other
spectators groaned when they learned they wouldn't get another
glimpse of Gates' videotaped deposition until Monday, at the
earliest. ``That's really why I came today,'' confided one DOJ
employee, who just dropped by to check out the action.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Gates is about as far as you can get from
Washington these days. Unlike in many trials, District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson has limited the witnesses in this case to 12
people for each side. Microsoft decided not to call Gates to the
stand. And the Justice Department didn't want to use up its
precious few witnesses with someone hostile to their cause.
Instead, Boies made an end run around the judge's decree by
introducing part of Gates' 20-hour videotaped deposition into court
as evidence. Microsoft's legal team wasn't happy. Of what was
shown, about 40 percent of what was shown was chosen by the
Microsoft legal team.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem hard to believe that Microsoft had a hand in picking
any of the Gates footage. By most accounts, the billionaire
computer whiz came across on a 10-foot courtroom screen as evasive,
defiant, even a bit arrogant. At times, the virtual Bill rocked in
his leather chair, scratching his head, giving short, snappy
answers. Or he'd sit in silence. For seconds. Then he'd give an
obligatory answer.
</P>
<P>
   While it was hardly an Academy Award performance, many find it
inconceivable that Gates' lawyers failed to advise him that the
deposition could be shown in court. Remember Bill Clinton's command
performance in the Lewinsky affair? ``Everyone knows video
depositions can show up in court,'' says one Washington litigator.
``That's why they show up with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' defense, many lawyers say it's more difficult to
appear convincing and compassionate on video. ``It's still a very
harsh medium,'' says Peter Bleakley, a partner with Arnold &AMP; Porter
in Washington. ``All your mannerisms come across as very
exaggerated.'' In addition, you don't have the benefit of reacting
to the body language of a judge or jury member. For example, Gates
had no way of knowing that Jackson would watch his deposition,
shaking his head and smiling at times _ almost as if he was
incredulous at the CEO's assertion that he didn't remember key
events.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the Microsoft team still could decide to put Gates on
the stand. The judge has given each side a silver bullet of sorts
to call another witness, or introduce a key deposition, if
absolutely necessary. But that's not likely. The Microsoft team
probably remembers Gates' other Washington performance, when he
appeared before Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah's judiciary committee
earlier this year. That time, the real Bill came across as even
more combative and condescending with his
``If-only-you-understood-technology'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   While virtual Bill wasn't terribly helpful to Microsoft's case,
it could be that it's better than having the real Bill take the
stand.

 &HT;    A COURTROOM E-MAIL QUERY: WHERE'S BILL?
 &HT;    EDS: This is one in a series of occasional looks inside the
historic Microsoft antitrust trial.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates _ virtual or real _ wasn't anywhere to
be seen in U.S. District Court here Wednesday. Instead, a
semi-packed courtroom spent the day watching second string Sullivan
&AMP; Cromwell lawyer, Theodore Edelman, hammer away at curly-haired
computer scientist Avadis Tevanian Jr., a senior vice president at
Apple Computer, who goes by ``Avie'' in his e-mails. The sparring
centered on Avie's assertion that Microsoft intentionally put bugs
in its operating system, making Apple's QuickTime software crash
with error messages when running on a new version of Microsoft's
popular Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways, between sessions punctuated with laughter at
Avie's in-your-face retorts to Edelman's condescending questions,
though, most observers were whispering about the Main Man, himself.
Bill Gates. Some reporters were peeved that Department of Justice
honcho David Boies had sprung the Gates videotape on them Monday
without warning. A few missed the main attraction entirely. Other
spectators groaned when they learned they wouldn't get another
glimpse of Gates' videotaped deposition until Monday, at the
earliest. ``That's really why I came today,'' confided one DOJ
employee, who just dropped by to check out the action.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that Gates is about as far as you can get from
Washington these days. Unlike in many trials, District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson has limited the witnesses in this case to 12
people for each side. Microsoft decided not to call Gates to the
stand. And the Justice Department didn't want to use up its
precious few witnesses with someone hostile to their cause.
Instead, Boies made an end run around the judge's decree by
introducing part of Gates' 20-hour videotaped deposition into court
as evidence. Microsoft's legal team wasn't happy. Of what was
shown, about 40 percent of what was shown was chosen by the
Microsoft legal team.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem hard to believe that Microsoft had a hand in picking
any of the Gates footage. By most accounts, the billionaire
computer whiz came across on a 10-foot courtroom screen as evasive,
defiant, even a bit arrogant. At times, the virtual Bill rocked in
his leather chair, scratching his head, giving short, snappy
answers. Or he'd sit in silence. For seconds. Then he'd give an
obligatory answer.
</P>
<P>
   While it was hardly an Academy Award performance, many find it
inconceivable that Gates' lawyers failed to advise him that the
deposition could be shown in court. Remember Bill Clinton's command
performance in the Lewinsky affair? ``Everyone knows video
depositions can show up in court,'' says one Washington litigator.
``That's why they show up with a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' defense, many lawyers say it's more difficult to
appear convincing and compassionate on video. ``It's still a very
harsh medium,'' says Peter Bleakley, a partner with Arnold &AMP; Porter
in Washington. ``All your mannerisms come across as very
exaggerated.'' In addition, you don't have the benefit of reacting
to the body language of a judge or jury member. For example, Gates
had no way of knowing that Jackson would watch his deposition,
shaking his head and smiling at times _ almost as if he was
incredulous at the CEO's assertion that he didn't remember key
events.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the Microsoft team still could decide to put Gates on
the stand. The judge has given each side a silver bullet of sorts
to call another witness, or introduce a key deposition, if
absolutely necessary. But that's not likely. The Microsoft team
probably remembers Gates' other Washington performance, when he
appeared before Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah's judiciary committee
earlier this year. That time, the real Bill came across as even
more combative and condescending with his
``If-only-you-understood-technology'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   While virtual Bill wasn't terribly helpful to Microsoft's case,
it could be that it's better than having the real Bill take the
stand.

VENTURA WRESTLES WITH REALIZATION HE'S WON GOVERNORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. PAUL, inn. _ As his first official act, governor-elect Jesse
Ventura did not legalize eye poking, order the arrest of Hulk
Hogan, or mandate that his trademark feather boas be added to state
police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the former professional wrestler sat for a moment
Wednesday in a black leather chair in a temporary office in the
Minnesota Statehouse. And then, for the cameras, he made an
elaborate show of organizing a stack of paper and placing it near a
phone.
</P>
<P>
   He declared the menial task ``my first official act,'' then
flashed the menancing grin that made him a villain in the ring and
a champion in the election booth. It was a potent smile: Enough
Minnesotans liked Ventura and his brand of policy-light,
populism-heavy politics to elect him over two major-party
candidates with brand names and long records of achievement, though
neither has ever thrown a 300-pound man into a row of folding
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ventura swept through a throng of reporters and out to the
Statehouse steps. After a few more questions, a few more smiles, a
few more glints of sun off his shaved pate, it was ``gotta go''
from the huge man with the gravel voice, the dimpled chin and the
double-breasted suit he would gladly have exchanged for a leather
biker jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of a new era for Minnesota politics. On the
surface at least, it looked nothing like the earnest, civic-minded
regularity of the past, featuring gray-suited men longer on policy
than pizzazz, men like Eugene McCarthy, Walter Mondale and Hubert
H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts, supported by exit polls, said Ventura won a
plurality by attracting voters male and female, young and old, with
a magnetic personality and a plain-spoken message of tax cuts and
social tolerance, amplified by a backlash against professional
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those professionals were his victims: Attorney General
Hubert ``Skip'' Humphrey III, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate
and son of the former vice president, and Republican Norm Coleman,
mayor of St. Paul. Humphrey spent Wednesday raking leaves at home;
Coleman went to work at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected outcome _ pre-election polls placed Ventura a
distant third _ unleashed a metaphorical torrent, as headline
writers twisted the language into unnatural positions to describe
the jolt his victory gave to Minnesota politics. ``Body slam'' was
a favorite choice.
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface, however, there were signs that even when he
was quoting songwriters Jim Morrison and Jerry Garcia, the
47-year-old Ventura did not quite fit his detractors' caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Though he campaigned as an independent outsider under the banner
of the Reform Party created by H. Ross Perot, Ventura is not far
from the mainstream here: He is a moderate on social issues who
supports abortion rights and protections for gays and lesbians; and
he is an anti-tax fiscal conservative whose ``Retaliate in '98''
slogan was a shot at incumbent lawmakers' failure to return to
taxpayers a $4 billion state surplus.
</P>
<P>
   There was no escaping his wrestling days _ his ring persona of
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura was a scheming bad guy who hated heroic
Hulk Hogan and draped his trunk-like neck in a feather boa. But
Ventura, born James Janos, attracted voters with his real-life
story and a new nickname, ``The Mind.'' He is a veteran who was an
elite Navy SEAL; a married father of two; a successful businessman;
a plain-spoken everyman with street smarts if not a college degree.
He also spent five years as mayor of suburban Brooklyn Park, a job
he sought after he became angry over a zoning decision.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Ventura on display earlier Wednesday, during a
Statehouse appearance with outgoing Governor Arne Carlson, a
two-term Republican. Standing before a marble fireplace in the
Governor's Reception Room, the showpiece of Minnesota's opulent
Italian Renaissance-style Statehouse, Ventura tried to be the
picture of the solid, temperate governor-elect.
</P>
<P>
   He said his top priority was to begin work on the state's
two-year budget. He downplayed concerns about being a Reform Party
governor with a Republican-controlled House and a
Democrat-Farmer-Labor-controlled Senate. He said he has not decided
whether to live in the governor's mansion. Previously, he said he
would only serve one term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a rebel. I'm a veteran of this country. I support the
government,'' he said. ``I'm not coming on board to create some
sort of rebellion here. I'm here to make Minnesota the best state
it can be with my political philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   But now and then, the old Ventura slipped out from the tailored
suit and into the tight shorts of his wrestling and B-movie past.
Placing his hand on a six-inch stack of government manuals Carlson
had prepared for him, Ventura quoted a movie title, saying: ``I
feel a little bit like Rodney Dangerfield. It's time to go `Back to
School.''' And later, asked what message voters sent by electing
him, he shot back brusquely: ``Ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dashed into a sparkling white Lincoln Town Car and
rushed across town to host his sports-radio talk show. His first
caller was the owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves (``I got a rich
guy on the phone. And I don't owe him nothin'!''). All the
soon-to-be-governor wanted to know was: ``When the hell are we
going to see some basketball?'' His live audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Ventura won the election
with 37 percent of the vote, versus 34 percent for Coleman and 28
percent for Humphrey. Both outspent Ventura by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the campaign is still in shock and disbelief. Nobody's
polling showed Jesse Ventura as much of a threat,'' said Terry Lee,
communications director for Humphrey's campaign. Around her were
the detritus of a failed campaign: boxes of signs, banners,
pamphlets and pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said discontent was clearly in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura tapped into the sentiment that the managed quality of
politics and politics in general is a sales job and it's
condescending,'' said Harry Boyte, director of the Center for
Democracy and Citizenship at the Humphrey Institute of Public
Affairs at the University of Minnesota. ``This was an election to
send a message to the political class, both left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   A simpler explanation came from J.D. Ford, a 9-year-old boy
whose mother brought him to the Statehouse Wednesday. As Ventura
was leaving, he shot a smile in J.D.'s direction.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing he owned an action figure of Minnesota's next governor,
J.D. said, ``He's cool.''

ISRAELI DIPLOMAT URGES VATICAN TO DELAY BEATIFICATION OF PIUS XII  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Israeli ambassador to the Vatican has urged it to
wait 50 years before moving ahead with any plan to beatify Pope
Pius XII, who has been criticized by Jewish groups and others for
remaining silent about the Holocaust while it was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop Jean-Louis
Tauran, angered the Israeli authorities by calling Jewish
settlements in East Jerusalem ``an illegal occupation'' while
visiting the city. The Vatican is seeking international guarantees
to protect sites in Jerusalem viewed as holy by Christians, Muslims
and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The open wrangling over Pius XII and the status of Jerusalem
have brought the Vatican's relations with Israel to a new low, only
five years after Pope John Paul II took the historic step of
recognizing the Jewish state. And that ill feeling could hinder
John Paul's longstanding plans to visit Jerusalem for the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Gumpel, a Jesuit priest who is directing the
effort for beatification of Pius XII for the Congregation for the
Causes of Saints, called the remark by the Israeli ambassador,
Aharon Lopez, ``imprudent and provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel said the ambassador's statement, as well as repeated
criticism from many Jewish groups over other recent choices for
sainthood, was thwarting the Vatican's effort to improve relations
with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks and insults by some groups are
counterproductive,'' Father Gumpel said. ``I would not be surprised
if it led to a rise of anti-Semitic feeling. Many Catholics feel
outraged by these attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Lopez, who made his comment at a news conference,
spoke only of Pope Pius XII. But many Jewish groups have strongly
criticized Pope John Paul II's canonization of Edith Stein, a
Jewish philosopher who became a nun and was killed at Auschwitz, as
well as his beatification of Alojzije Cardinal Stepinac, who was
Archbishop of Zagreb when a Nazi puppet regime ruled Croatia during
World War II. Both took place last month.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials also express frustration over many Jewish
groups' rejection of the pope's ``act of repentance'' about the
Holocaust. In a document issued in March, the pope apologized for
the failure of many Catholics to protect Jews, but defended the
behavior of Pius XII. The church maintains that Pius XII personally
helped save thousands of Jewish lives and remained silent only out
of fear that more Jews would be killed if he publicly criticized
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations and Israeli legislators have vehemently
criticized the Vatican for its effort to beatify Pius XII, whose
cause was officially opened in 1965 by Pope Paul VI. But it was the
first time that an Israeli official raised the issue in public.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said in an interview that he realized that ``the
beatification of saints is the absolute prerogative of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But because Holocaust survivors are still with us and the
wounds of the Holocaust are still open,'' he added, ``it would seem
wiser to wait a number of years until sensitivities have been
defused and historians have access to all the records and can make
a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he would leave it to historians to evaluate the
substance of the case for and against Pius XII, but that he felt a
need to address the ``loaded and emotional'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time to speak out,'' Lopez said, ``while it is
still in process and not a fait accompli.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Wim Duisenberg will not acquire his full
powers for another eight weeks, but he is already enduring his
baptism by fire.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the new European Central Bank, Duisenberg is in
charge of setting into operation Europe's single currency, the
euro, on Jan. 4. But just when the historic project seemed set for
a remarkably smooth start, the ground underneath him has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the new bank is preoccupied with projecting its
hard-nosed credibility in world financial markets, Germany's new
left-of-center government is badgering it almost daily to open up
the monetary spigots and generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duisenberg suddenly finds himself playing with a rule
book developed by players who are not around anymore. After years
of belt-tightening, a new raft of center-left governments are
increasingly eager to lift spending and let their budget deficits
nose upward once again.
</P>
<P>
   In a major ideological shift, Germany's new government, under
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, now exhorts the bank almost daily to
reduce interest rates and help stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, passionately
argues that the country's high unemployment stems directly from the
austere monetary policies of the Bundesbank, which serves as the
model for the European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at America,'' Lafontaine said, referring to the
Federal Reserve Board chairman. ``Alan Greenspan has shown that you
can simultaneously achieve inflation-free growth and growth in
employment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Christa Mueller, an influential government adviser who is
married to Lafontaine, said: ``The policies of the European Central
Bank and the Bundesbank are not sacrosanct. They must be subjected
to a certain control.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the new bank's independence and its duties are
legally enshrined in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which laid the
ground rules for the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But the political landscape has changed enormously since
European leaders signed the treaty. Most countries now have
left-of-center governments, and Germany's change in power
eliminates the most formidable champion of hard-money policies.
</P>
<P>
   It was Germany, under then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that
enshrined the new bank's political independence. It was Germany,
often to the fury of France, that insisted the bank focus almost
entirely on keeping prices stable rather than on promoting economic
growth or jobs. And it was Germany that demanded harsh penalties
for countries that run high budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many European economists believe that the gospel of
fiscal austerity is losing force. Under the Stability and Growth
Pact signed last year by all 11 nations adopting the euro,
countries that run high deficits or have mountains of acquired debt
are subject to huge penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet countries like Italy, which has twice as much debt as the
rules allow, are expected to increase government spending next
year. Last month, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi was forced to
step down, because he could not muster enough support for his
proposed budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And Italy is not alone. ``You're clearly seeing a shift left in
European governments that is triggering a greater willingness to
increase spending,'' said Kermit Schoenholtz, global economist for
Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say that the rules of the game have been
changed already,'' said Friedrich Heinemann, senior economist for
the Institute for European Economic Research in Mannheim. ``Until
now, an important element of the credibility of the Stability and
Growth Pact was Germany's tough position. With Lafontaine now in
the government, the pact has already lost some of its
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Duisenberg brushed aside
demands for a policy change. ``It's normal for the political side
to give suggestions or opinions,'' he said, ``but it would be
abnormal if these suggestions were listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   A towering man with a shock of white hair and piercing blue
eyes, Duisenberg established his credentials as an anti-inflation
hawk as president of the Dutch central bank. There he locked his
own monetary policy to the Bundesbank's. He argues that the only
real way to promote job creation is by deregulating the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a growing number of experts believe that outspoken
pressure from Lafontaine and other European leaders will merely
force Duisenberg to adopt an even tougher line just to demonstrate
his independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lafontaine would do well to study the example of Bob Rubin,
which is to know when to shut up,'' said Rudiger Dornbush, an
economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. ``The European Central Bank
has to show its independence, and if it is pushed, it will have to
shove back extra hard.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be other pressures. Greenspan has already cut U.S.
interest rates in the hope of pre-empting a severe downturn. That
has put pressure on Europe and Duisenberg because it caused the
dollar to sink in value against European currencies.
</P>
<P>
   That makes European exports more expensive in many foreign
markets and is expected to severely dent European growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Senior German advisers to Lafontaine have seized on the U.S.
moves as a vindication of their own arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question we have raised is whether there is
maneuvering room for monetary policy to do something
expansionary,'' said Heiner Flassbeck, Lafontaine's senior adviser
on international economic issues. ``This is exactly the question
that Alan Greenspan has posed hundreds of times, and he has
answered the question by reducing interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Until January, the formal power of monetary policy will continue
to lie with the 11 national central banks. But in practice, the
countries are already following a common European policy _ and that
policy is closely modeled on the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the European Central Bank is governed by a board that
includes the presidents of each country's national bank. Most
decisions require a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lafontaine and Schroeder have exchanged most of
their barbs with officials at the Bundesbank. On Thursday,
Lafontaine and Flassbeck plan to take their case directly to the
Bundesbank's concrete fortress in Frankfurt, where members of the
executive board will hold their monthly meeting.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   But economists say the issues in Europe are more complicated
than those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even without pressure from Germany, many countries were already
reducing interest rates in preparation for the euro. Rates must be
almost equal in all member countries, because every country will
have the same risk of inflation and currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, countries with historically higher inflation have
been systematically cutting rates for several months to bring them
in line with those of Germany and France. Ireland, Spain, Italy and
Portugal have all slashed their rates several times, and more cuts
are expected before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundesbank's basic overnight interest rate, now at 3.3
percent, is already considerably lower than that of the United
States. Many economists worry that cutting rates could lead some
countries to overheat, igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But amid increasing signs that European growth may slow to less
than 2 percent next year, Schroeder has joined Lafontaine in
putting pressure on both the Bundesbank and the European Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't only have responsibility for monetary stability but
also for economic growth in a sensible way,'' Schroeder said on
Saturday, noting new government estimates that the German economy
will expand only about 2.3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's damn little, too little for a big offensive on the
labor market that is supported solely by economic growth,''
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine and other officials have also tweaked the central
bankers for their secretiveness and their refusal to reveal the
minutes of board meetings. Christian Noe, state secretary at the
Finance Ministry, recently accused the Bundesbank _ and by
extension, the European Central Bank _ of indulging in
``predemocratic'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the Vatican we're talking about,'' said one
government official, who insisted on anonymity. ``No one is
questioning the independence of the central bank. We're just
raising questions of public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Europe's central bankers have been far from amused.
Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the Bank of France, warned bluntly
that political leaders risked jeopardizing the euro's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestion that central banks were on the way to losing
their independence would affect savers' confidence both in Europe
and worldwide,'' Trichet said on Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Stark, the Bundesbank's deputy governor, said last
weekend that he was already worried about growing budget deficits
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excessive deficits are damaging,'' Stark said in a television
interview. ``The European Central Bank could be forced to react
with interest-rate increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics aside, a growing number of economists believe that
Duisenberg will eventually be driven by economic pressure to reduce
rates slightly _ to perhaps 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not satisfy people like Lafontaine, and Duisenberg
has made it clear he has no intention of deviating from his basic
concern about price stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders today are different from the ones that signed the
Maastricht Treaty, but the fact remains that we still have the
treaty,'' said Heinemann of the Institute for European Economic
Research. ``The fact that we have a new government in Germany
doesn't change one letter in the treaty.''

<P>
   A Fort Worth reader sent in a recipe for seasoned salt. She says
her family is so crazy for this that they even sprinkle it on dill
pickles. The two cake recipes were sent in by Pat Shepherd of

   REQUESTS: Jeanette Crowson, Burleson, Texas, writes with several
requests. One is for a cake her 86-year-old mother used to make.
Called a paradise cake, it was a layer cake with dates and had a
sugar-milk/water frosting with a praline texture.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also like the recipe for ``old-fashioned'' dumplings.
These aren't biscuit dough dropped by the spoonful, but instead are
made from dough rolled out and cut into strips. The strips were
either dropped into a hot mixture or used as a crust for a cobbler
with more dumplings inside.
</P>
<P>
   And one last request from her is for the tartar sauce served at
Dallas' Jay's Marine Grill in the '50s and '60s. It's not the same
as tartar sauce served today. She's not sure if it included either
mayonnaise or relish. It was served with hot popovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Bielicke, Granbury, Texas, would like a recipe for date
nut bars.
</P>
<P>
   May Dean Braddock, Burleson, Texas, would like a recipe for
ambrosia cake. Her mother made this cake at Christmas. The cake is
made with four thin layers of chocolate with fresh apples chopped
in the batter. The cooked icing was made with coconut, pecans and
chunks of fresh oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Burgess, Fort Worth, would like a recipe for biscotti
that uses a cake mix.

WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO HIDE GLEE AT GOP ELECTION LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of the exhaustion, relief and controlled
euphoria, a White House post-election strategy emerged of putting
on a visible show of attending to the nation's business while
letting Republicans engage in noisy political bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time to remain largely silent, senior officials
concluded after the extent of the Republican losses in Tuesday's
voting became clear. If others want to emphasize that voters showed
they are fed up with talk of sex, scandal and impeachment, top
administration officials are happy to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is no intention to gloat,'' said one senior
White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``Impeachment is still serious business. The worst thing the White
House could do is imitate the Republicans and overplay our hand.
We're just going to sit back for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a careful effort by senior White House officials not
to convey a sense of giddiness about Tuesday's election results,
which some Clinton loyalists were suggesting should be read as a
vote of acquittal on all charges against the president by his
ultimate jury, the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted in public and private that Tuesday's voting
would have no impact on how President Clinton approaches the
impeachment inquiry pending in the House of Representatives. Aides
said that it was up to Republicans to make the next move _ after
they sort out the implications of their poor showing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to work,'' was the unanimous refrain from White House
officials from the president on down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton convened a meeting of his senior economic advisers to
discuss plans for revamping Social Security, an issue that
Democrats played to their advantage throughout the fall campaign.
At the start of the meeting, Clinton said that the message of the
election was that the American people wanted their elected
officials to address pocketbook issues _ Social Security, health
care, education, the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people basically said to all of us _ all
of us _ we sent you there to work for us and we want you to find a
way to do it, to address the challenges we face and to bring this
country together and move this country forward,'' Clinton said. ``I
think that was the loud, clear, completely unambiguous message of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would not bite on an impeachment question dangled before
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in the hands of Congress and the American people,'' the
president said. ``I've said that before; I'll say it again. I have
nothing else to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath their sober demeanor, the president's top aides and
advisers were having difficulty concealing their pleasure at the
unexpected Republican rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a reaffirmation of what we knew before the
election,'' said James Carville, an outside political adviser who
helped to turn the election into a referendum on House Speaker Newt
Gingrich as much as on the president's private morality. ``The
public knew where the Republicans wanted to take them _ down the
road of scandal and impeachment _ and they clearly said they didn't
want to go with them. That's the real point.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides involved in scandal control would only say
that they hope Republicans will read the election results as a
public order to speedily conclude the impeachment inquiry scheduled
to begin before the House Judiciary Committee later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said the investigation would continue as
planned, but there was a recognition that voters interviewed at the
polls on Tuesday expressed a clear preference for ending the matter
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
suggested at a breakfast meeting with reporters that the inquiry
might be accelerated in the wake of Tuesday's voting. But he said
that no decision had been made on how to proceed with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the results were heartening for
the White House. ``I would expect the president is probably feeling
pretty chipper this morning,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one who has worked for Clinton for any period of time is
under the illusion that one election _ even one as surprising and
favorable as this one _ will end the president's problems at home
or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to impeachment, the president must still cope with
the threat from Iraq, the follow-through to the Israeli-Palestinian
talks, Kosovo and the continuing global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On domestic matters, even though the Republicans have been
weakened, there is still no bipartisan consensus on Social Security
revision, tax policy, education spending, tobacco legislation or
health care reform.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the good fortunes of Democratic candidates from
California to New York, Clinton still does not enjoy the trust of a
majority of the electorate. Exit polls indicated that while about
60 percent of the public approves of the job he is doing as
president, an equal number does not approve of his personal
morality or behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all the ups and downs of the past six years,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, who served as a senior White House political adviser for
six years until leaving last month, ``nobody is acting giddy or
ebullient today. The White House staff is a very sober, very
serious, very battle-tested group. They've seen good and they've
seen bad, and they know impeachment is a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although White House denizens were disciplined about not
interpreting the election results, the one race they could not help
talking about was the Minnesota governor's contest, won by a former
professional wrestler, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the scrawny White House chief of staff, said that
henceforth his nickname would no longer be Skippy, but rather John
``The Body'' Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   And the president, asked at the Social Security meeting about
Ventura's election, said, ``I think that you're going to have a lot
of politicians spending time in gyms now.''

   REQUESTS: Jeanette Crowson, Burleson, Texas, writes with several
requests. One is for a cake her 86-year-old mother used to make.
Called a paradise cake, it was a layer cake with dates and had a
sugar-milk/water frosting with a praline texture.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also like the recipe for ``old-fashioned'' dumplings.
These aren't biscuit dough dropped by the spoonful, but instead are
made from dough rolled out and cut into strips. The strips were
either dropped into a hot mixture or used as a crust for a cobbler
with more dumplings inside.
</P>
<P>
   And one last request from her is for the tartar sauce served at
Dallas' Jay's Marine Grill in the '50s and '60s. It's not the same
as tartar sauce served today. She's not sure if it included either
mayonnaise or relish. It was served with hot popovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Bielicke, Granbury, Texas, would like a recipe for date
nut bars.
</P>
<P>
   May Dean Braddock, Burleson, Texas, would like a recipe for
ambrosia cake. Her mother made this cake at Christmas. The cake is
made with four thin layers of chocolate with fresh apples chopped
in the batter. The cooked icing was made with coconut, pecans and
chunks of fresh oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell Burgess, Fort Worth, would like a recipe for biscotti
that uses a cake mix.

UT'S WILLIAMS PEERLESS IN END ZONE COOL CLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought there could be nothing more to like about
UT's Ricky Williams, add this one to the long list of praiseworthy
deeds:
</P>
<P>
   Ricky is End Zone Cool.
</P>
<P>
   He scores. He hands the ball to the nearest official. He says
his thank-yous to those teammates who helped make the touchdown
possible. He trots calmly off the field.
</P>
<P>
   In today's game, Ricky is a charter member of the End Zone Cool
Club. Actually, even if you include the NCAA with the NFL, Ricky
might be the only member. But that's OK. It makes him the coolest
of the cool.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a rival football organization to the EZCC. It
has a membership numbering hundreds. It is called the End Zone Fool
Club. You see their act every Sunday, and not just in the end zone.
A sack, a tackle, an interception _ they do the dance of fools.
Uncool fools.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lou Holtz who's credited for once uttering the immortal
words, ``act like you've been there.'' That quote should be
chiseled across the top of the entrance to every locker room and
clubhouse in America. Either that, or simply hang up a picture of
Ricky Williams. You, too, can be cool like Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky is an original. So was Elmo Wright many years ago. Wright
was an NFL receiver out of the University of Houston, who is
credited with creating the first end-zone celebration dance. That
was fun. Butch Johnson of the Cowboys was fun. The Washington
Redskins' Fun Bunch was fun. The spike was fun.
</P>
<P>
   But way too many Deions later, things got out of hand. The NCAA
had to crack down with its celebration-penalty rule. The NFL even
added a no-taunting rule. But worse, the End Zone Fool Club is
very, very boring, including those who attempt to turn personal
achievement on the field into an individualized ceremony of
religion. No matter what the cover, it's all about I-I-I-me-me-me.
</P>
<P>
   When Ricky Williams' team cracked the Top 25 this week, it was
an accomplishment many of us thought the Longhorns wouldn't be
seeing this season. Or maybe for a couple of seasons. Not with that
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But even when being pounded by UCLA and Kansas State early in
the season, new coach Mack Brown had his priorities in order. ``Win
with Class'' read the signs Brown hung all over the athletic
department. The problem was, the Longhorns had to win. Now they
are. And with Williams serving as the No. 1 example, the class part
is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched in the middle of their five-game winning streak was
the Oklahoma contest at the Cotton Bowl. The Longhorns' season took
off with that wipeout of the Sooners. But at the final gun, Brown
noticed something amiss as he trotted toward the middle of the
field _ some of his players were doing a victory dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got letters from a couple of alums after that game, unhappy
with what they had seen,'' said Brown. ``I wrote back, saying it
was four kids out of the 88 we suited up that day. Why didn't they
praise the other 84?''
</P>
<P>
   But long before the mail arrived, Brown had acted. In the
dressing room after the game, he told his players from now on, the
only place to celebrate would be behind the closed doors of the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are four good kids, too,'' Brown said yesterday. ``And
the reaction from them and the entire team has been very positive.
I'm a firm believer that this is not the NFL, and that
sportsmanship should be first and foremost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened to being humble along with happy
when you win. But that's the way we are going to have it here. This
is not a team that is going to be getting into someone's face.
There is no place for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown realizes he's bucking a trend. And it's not just from
those people who say players should be allowed to have their fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to have proper sportsmanship simply by the way
the college game is structured these days,'' he said. ``If you want
to play for a top bowl spot, or play for the national championship,
you have to beat a team as badly as you can to stay in the race.
The more you run up the points, the most votes you receive. I don't
like it. I wasn't raised that way. But that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown admits he sometimes second-guesses himself about being too
old-fashioned in today's football world. But actually, Brown is
part of a growing trend among college coaches. A coolness trend.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ricky Williams is alone. But he's still the
coolest of the cool.

COACH DENIES INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT WITH EX-PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Renowned basketball coach Jack McMahon, who has
shepherded thousands of New England teenage athletes to college
scholarships, has been suspended by the Amateur Athletic Union
following a complaint from a former player who says McMahon
initiated inappropriate sexual contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the coach Wednesday denied the allegation and
said McMahon will appeal the AAU decision before the Nov. 23
deadline set by the governing body, headquartered in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   AAU officials said McMahon did not respond to an AAU hearing to
defend himself last month, but his attorney, Wayne Murphy, said his
client never received the notice of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack McMahon has spent the better part of his adulthood in
service to the young people in New England,'' Murphy said. ``He
adamantly denies that any improper conduct took place between
himself and his accuser.''
</P>
<P>
   But word of the allegation, and the two-year suspension, has
traveled through locker rooms and living rooms across the region
because McMahon _ and the basketball program he oversees _ is so
well known. McMahon has been coaching boys basketball since he
graduated from high school, more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager who alleged the sexual advances has requested
anonymity. The boy and his parents say they have not decided
whether to proceed with a criminal complaint, and that their main
concern is that McMahon not supervise children any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about standing up,'' said attorney Jim Noucas,
who is representing the family. ``It's a matter of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk County investigators are aware of the allegation but are
not currently investi gating the matter, said spokeswoman Nina
Flaherty. The boy was above the age of consent, 16, at the time of
the alleged offense, but a state law mandates that no coach or
caregiver, such as a teacher, have sexual contact with a teen-ager
they are supervising.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged inappropriate contact was the culmination of a
relationship that even McMahon's supporters say was unique, with
the former player staying at McMahon's home on some weekends to
review game tapes. McMahon, who lives alone, told the boy's parents
that such a bond between coach and player was necessary for the
boy's athletic career, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources familiar with the Greater Boston program, and
the boy's parents, say that he arrived on the team with decent
playing ability, but thrived under McMahon's coaching, and headed
into his senior year with hopes of winning a college scholarship.
At one point, one of McMahon's assistant coaches, Skip Griffin,
said that he warned McMahon that his career could be troubled
because of the amount of time he spent alone with the player.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin, who is community relations director for promotion
at The Boston Globe and volunteers his time coaching, said
Wednesday that he never witnessed any sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents say their son has stopped playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used our son's love for basketball,'' said the boy's
father. ``He had dinner with us, at our home. He worked to gain our
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother said that at one point she noticed that her
son, typically even-keeled, became morose and suffered from
insomnia. After repeated inquiries, the teenager confided to his
mother that McMahon had made sexual advances toward him.
</P>
<P>
   The former player alleged that McMahon told him that he should
exercise naked at McMahon's home so that the coach could examine
his overall fitness, and later requested that he let McMahon fondle
him in order to build trust.
</P>
<P>
   The inappropriate contact allegedly occurred during the summer
of 1997, while McMahon's program made national news for showcasing
Daniel Gadzuric, one of the top five high school players in the
nation.

RUSSIA SAYS IT WILL NOT PAY FOREIGN DEBT NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian government said on Wednesday for the first
time that it will not pay its foreign debts next year, and will
seek to renegotiate the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is just the latest in a litany of
familiar setbacks here that includes a collapsing currency, a
yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating economy.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday the government also acknowledged another
startling indicator of its troubles: last month it had a meager
two-to-three weeks' supply of food. The government said it has
taken steps to restock its national cupboard, including an appeal
to the United States and Europe for food and financing.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's attempt to renegotiate its loans from foreign lenders
and countries is an important test of its ability to maintain some
credibility with the West. A Russian default on foreign loans would
make it that much harder for many years to come for a cash-starved
Russia to receive credits.
</P>
<P>
   Russia owes about $3 billion this year in foreign loans and
another $17 billion is due next year. The debt includes
government-backed credits to Russia, payments due to the
International Monetary Fund, loans coming due that were made to the
old Soviet Union, as well as more recent borrowings from private
banks and long-term bonds sold to Western investors.
</P>
<P>
   At first Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov held open the
possibility that the government would find a way to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Primakov team soon found itself overwhelmed by the
economic crisis. Seeded with Communists, social democrats and free
market supporters, the coalition government has produce a program
of only vague economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's failure to make tough decisions to close the budget
deficit and advance market reform has cost him, at least
temporarily, the support of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has criticized Primakov's most recent plan as a step
backward from economic reform, making it virtually impossible that
the Kremlin will receive the next $4.3 billion disbursement in
assistance before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And without Western aid, the government's cash crunch has become
that much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance of receiving money from the West,'' said
Sergei Kiriyenko, the former prime minister who was ousted by
President Boris Yeltsin last August. ``And as a result Russia will
not be able to pay all of its foreign debt next year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who was given
responsibility for economic policy under Primakov, acknowledged as
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pay $17.5 billion next year,'' Maslyukov said. ``This
year we have to pay only $3.5 billion. But both tasks are
extraordinary ones for our weakened economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov said Russia had two possible responses. It could take
draconian steps to pay off the debts at the expense of clamorous
Russian industries, interest groups and needy Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or we should come to terms with our creditors, reach an
agreement with them that they will restructure our debt,''
Maslyukov said. ``We will be tackling the second task.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, like much of the government's economic program, Maslyukov
was short on details Wednesday. At a news conference he did not say
which types of loans the government would try to renegotiate or
what terms they would seek. Generally, the restructuring of loans
involves deferring principal payments, lowering interest rates and
lengthening the term of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not say if Russia would simply default if it failed
to come to terms with its lenders. The choice is not an easy one,
for the Russian government must continue its payments to the IMF to
maintain its good standing with the fund.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kiriyenko suggested on Wednesday that the government should
begin talks on renegotiating former Soviet debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiriyenko clearly has a dim view of Primakov's ability to
direct economic policy. He said the government's most recent set of
economic measures was a profile in political cowardice that was
aimed primarily at papering over divisions within its own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, not surprisingly, put it differently. He said the
government was merely trying to cope with the mess that Kiriyenko
and Russia's market reformers left behind.
</P>
<P>
   But even Maslyukov acknowledged that the combination of state
intervention, subsidies and printing of money that the current
government had proposed did not constitute a strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a program,'' he said. ``We are speaking of
measures that must be taken today and tomorrow.''

CELLUCCI URGES RECONSIDERATION OF CLINTON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stung by what he feels is his national party's role in
creating the Democratic tide that swept the country and nearly
defeated him, Governor Paul Cellucci has called on Republican
leaders in Washington to change their course, including rethinking
their drive to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Wednesday Congressional party leaders must do some
``soul searching'' and take responsibility for Tuesday's debacle.
He said Republican governors now have to step forward and provide
the party its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in his State House office, Cellucci blamed
the GOP Congressional leaders not only for his unexpected close
call Tuesday but also for the defeat of William F. Weld's bid for
the US Senate and the state's only two Republican congressmen in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Weld could have won that senate race if there hadn't been
that big tidal wave for Bill Clinton,'' said Cellucci whose aides
privately say is furious with what he feels is the political
arrogance of the party's Congressional leaders and its failure to
understand how it has hurt local and state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, two years later, a non-presidential election year, there
seems to be a backlash against Republicans around the country that
I think hurt us here in Massachusetts'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci headed into Tuesday's elections with most polls showing
him with a strong lead over his Democratic opponent Scott
Harshbarger, but for several very anxious hours before the polls
closed, it appeared from exit-surveys of voters that the Democrat
would upset him.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst say the unexpected voting results were shaped by a
backlash from an energized Democratic base and other independent
voters who were reacting to Republican attempts to impeach
President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair while leaving the
impression they were ignoring other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with the final tally giving him a 51 percent to 47
percent lead -- a respectable four percentage margin -- Cellucci
was ready to do battle with his national party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to have do some soul searching down in
Washington, particularly the Congressional leadership,'' Cellucci
said. ``It is pretty clear that there was some backlash. Some
decisions were made that were not right for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after election, Cellucci and his aides were still
assessing the ruble created by the Democratic sweep. It has cut the
already small band of Massachusetts House Republicans from 28 to 26
in the 160-member body. The GOP was blocked from making possible
gains over their seven seats in the 40-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two relatively strong Republican congressional candidates were
also trounced by incumbent Democrats in the Sixth and Fourth
districts. The GOP candidates for the state constitutional officers
were beaten by large margins.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Cellucci's concern with national party leaders
is less over the impeachment proceedings than the their failure to
act on several fundamental issues that had impact on Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they say that for several weeks, Cellucci had
personally lobbied the GOP led congress, including Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, to pass a bill to extend the coverage seniors
currently get -- but were cut in a federal court ruling -- in their
health insurance for prescription drugs. When Trott refused to act,
Cellucci was furious, those aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just emblematic of just how tone deaf they are,'' said
one top Cellucci aide. ``They can't get out of their own way. It is
ludicrous how they could bungle a sex scandal in the oval office
into a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference, Cellucci said he planned to use a
national Republican governors meeting in New Orleans in two week as
a forum to build a coalition of his colleagues to deliver a strong
message to the party leadership about its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor said the national party should rely more on
its governors, who he said are dealing with issues that resonate
with voters -- education, crime, welfare reform and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci stopped short of calling on the Congressional GOP
leaders to halt the House impeachment inquiry. He said those
efforts should be re-evaluated in light of the damage it caused the
party in Tuesday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to have to determine whether they are
on the proper course here,'' the acting governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the Congressional leadership made a mistake by
airing a campaign ad that drew attention to Clinton's sex scandal
that the congressional

BAND OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS SETS SIGHTS ON REPLACING GINGRICH, ARMEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of GOP election losses, some House
Republicans set their sights Wednesday on presenting a cast of new
leaders to the country, beginning with the replacement of Newt
Gingrich as speaker and Dick Armey as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   There also was talk among a few Republicans of replacing House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, although there were no signs
of anyone emerging to challenge him for his post.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich, of Georgia, talked confidently of being able
to retain his leadership job, Republican members generally blamed
him for the loss of five GOP seats to the Democrats. They cited his
``stage-managing'' of the effort to impeach President Clinton and
his ``mishandling'' of the budget process this year as the reason
behind the party's failure to increase its majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., was mentioned by members as a
possible challenger to the speaker, and Rep. Steve Largent,
R-Okla., was said to be considering a challenge to Armey, who was
predicting late Tuesday night that Republicans would pick up seats
even after it was clear they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La.,
who already was planning to challenge Armey, was mentioned in
several interviews as a Gingrich replacement. One Republican member
said Livingston was being urged by supporters to make a decision by
this weekend about whether to challenge Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how Newt gets re-elected as speaker. The votes
just aren't going to be there,'' said one Republican consultant,
who said Gingrich and Armey were ``burning up the phone lines''
Wednesday to shore up support and gauge the mood of the GOP
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House members will hold a meeting in two weeks to
decide the makeup of the leadership team in the 106th Congress and
to consider what message to take from this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   The election eroded the GOP majority from 228 seats to 223. The
Democrats will hold 211 seats next year. One seat in the 435-member
chamber is held by Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, who
usually votes with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Although the resentment of Gingrich among Republicans appears to
be fairly deep, it was unclear whether he would be ousted from the
job he has held since the party followed his blueprint in 1994 to
take control of Congress for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some members were urging him on Wednesday to avoid a fight and
step down for the good of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it will take to defeat him is a handful of votes,'' said
one source familiar with the telephone discussions taking place on
Wednesday. ``Even if he survives the conference (meeting later this
month), there may be some members who won't support him when the
full House votes on the leadership in January.''
</P>
<P>
   The defection of only a half dozen or so Republicans, could
create a situation where House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., receives more votes for speaker than Gingrich if the
Democrats vote in a block. But even if that happens, there likely
would be a second ballot where both sides of the aisle end up
agreeing on a ``consensus candidate'' who would serve as ``sort of
a caretaker speaker,'' as one Republican aide put it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich signaled Wednesday that he does not intend to resign,
despite the grumbling from conservatives and moderates who have
tried to remove him as speaker before. He reminded his colleagues
that it was his plan, after all, that gave the GOP it's biggest
victory in recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point's real simple. There's only been one team, which has
won control, kept control and then won a third election in 70
years,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we may not be doing everything right and we may have a lot
of things to look at. But I would suggest that it's pretty hard to
argue that the only team to have been successful in 70 years
somehow ought to be replaced by somebody who has not ever won a
nationwide election.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hess, a political scholar at the Brookings Institute,
acknowledged that there was ``a great deal of dissatisfaction''
among Republican members with their leadership. But he said members
would likely move to replace Armey and GOP conference Chairman John
Boehner of Ohio rather than dump the mastermind behind the GOP
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt is still something of an icon. As much as they think he
has repeatedly screwed up, they also know he's how they got there
in the first place,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Still the calls for Gingrich's head could become a loud chorus
if conservative leaders and Republican officials continue to speak
out in favor of new blood at the top.
</P>
<P>
   For example, GOP political consultant Michael Murphy criticized
the Republican leadership for focusing too much attention on the
Monica Lewinsky scandal and not enough on an election year agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time we take a hard look at who our leadership
is. The unfortunate fact is that good leaders _ like Newt, like
Armey _ aren't always good (message) presenters,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut
who led the drive for campaign reform in the House, also said he
expects changes in the Republican leadership because of the
election losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a stunning victory for Democrats and a defeat for
Republicans in a year we could have reasonably expected to pick up
seats. You can't just spin it away,'' said Shays, who in the past
has supported Gingrich despite their differences on campaign
finance and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe their will be changes in our House leadership. I
don't think anyone knows yet what the changes will be.'' &QL;

U.S. CHARGES BIN LADEN IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a
238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in
August and with committing acts of terrorism against Americans
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials immediately announced that they were
offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged
Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief
military commander.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that
rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June,
that included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.
That indictment was returned before the embassy bombings and was
the result of a two-year investigation into his activities in
Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he had
connections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused
bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the
present, in which he was said to be working in concert with
governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist
groups, to build weapons and attack American military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged
involvement in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for
example, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden
gave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictment
was kept secret for months, but the secret charges were returned
about the time that American officials were plotting a possible
raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very
common to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend
those who are indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's
operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq
to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin
Laden's agreeing not to work against that country.
</P>
<P>
   No details were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraq
led to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group,
which is called Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used
private relief groups ``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al
Qaeda. The groups were not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internal
investigations of its members and their associates, trying to
detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those who
had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin
Laden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such
informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden,
transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for his
training camps and assisting in running his finances.
</P>
<P>
   While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the
government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the
months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an
indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the
embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and
carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks
and the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense,
all of the citizens of the world are also victims whenever and
wherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorism
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and
Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose
agents have fanned out around the world to look into the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigative strategy is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We
will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up
the line, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to
those who paid for them and ordered it done.''

DEMOCRATS CHEER, REPUBLICANS LICK WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day out from an election that defied much of
history, elated Democrats confidently pushed to abbreviate the
impeachment process, while congressional Republicans morbidly
looked inward for a plan that might right their many political
wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the capital and across the country, it was a day of
contradicting emotions swirling around a central belief:
Republicans in Washington overestimated the electoral reach of
President Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and
now face a backlash of significant proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Republicans lost five seats in the House of
Representatives, cutting their majority margin to just six _ in a
season of scandal in which they had once predicted a gain of more
than 20 seats. It marked the first time since 1934 that the party
in the White House gained seats in a midterm election. In the
Senate, the two parties fought to a draw, with Republicans still
maintaining a 55 to 45 seat advantage.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, Clinton could barely contain his glee as he spoke
of returning to an issues agenda that the American people had
wanted all along, a program of patients rights and Social Security
solvency, not of scandals and subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the lesson all people should draw is that the
people who were rewarded were rewarded because they wanted to do
something for the American people,'' said Clinton, in a White House
photo opportunity. ``They wanted to do something to pull this
country together and to move this country forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, House Speaker Newt Gingrich alternately blamed the
media and then himself for the failed Republican strategy of
focusing on Clinton's personal and legal travails. Privately,
several Republicans said they will now study Clinton's successful
strategy in overcoming his party's enormous losses in 1994, when
Republicans won control of Congress, and returning to relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm the speaker, so I'll take responsibility,'' Gingrich
said at a news conference in his home district in Georgia. ``We
should probably have aggressively pushed cutting taxes and saving
Social Security much harder than we did this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already began what many analysts believe will be
months of carping, infighting, and self-inflicted wounds, all of
which could threaten Gingrich's hold on his party and his position.
Deep within the Republican caucus, the names of Representative Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, and Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a former
professional football player and member of the class of 1994,
emerged as two possible contenders to oust the current GOP
leadership, according to party sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lord punished Republicans for not doing what they were put
on earth for, to cut taxes,'' said Marshall Wittmann, the director
of congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation, a
Republican-leaning think tank. ``The Republicans were singularly
focused on impeachment and scandal, and that didn't sell with the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were not in themselves stunning, the
Republican failure to seize on a golden political opportunity was.
As a result, the GOP is in danger of losing the House in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Said influential Democratic pollster Peter Hart: ``The
Republicans took an election with a pat hand and threw it away.
It's breathtaking. They took a perfect year and played it as badly
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing further embarrassment for Gingrich and other
congressional Republicans, GOP governors around the nation
generally fared well, with incumbents winning in major states such
as Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In state capitals, unlike Washington, GOP candidates were seen
as more mainstream and less likely to seek advantage from Clinton's
problems. The result: Greater success at the state level than in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``A governor is more moderately positioned than a US senator,''
said Neil Newhouse, a Republican consultant who worked on Jeb
Bush's successful gubernatorial campaign in Florida. ``A US senator
can be an archconservative, but you can't be an archconservative as
a governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, House members on both sides of the aisle and the
analysts who constantly watch them expressed a belief that the
election, while not about Clinton, will carry profound implications
for the president. With the Democratic victories comes the strong
expectation that the Republicans will shorten the impeachment
process, possibly holding true to their prior word that they will
complete the hearings by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois
Republican, issued a written statement saying that his panel would
continue to move forward with a hearing, but the very fact he felt
the need to reaffirm the position gave Democrats further reason to
embrace their new advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be accelerated,'' said Democratic Representative
William Delahunt of Massachusetts, a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``Clearly, the dynamic was going to change after the
election. Everyone sensed that there was collective exhaustion with
the scandal, with the issue. This just gives impetus to resolve it
expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lauded themselves for a high-powered effort to turn
out their voters on Election Day, including an unusually high
response from black voters, and for a significant appeal among
upper-income voters who tend to side with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans lost the ground war,'' said Wittmann. ``The
Democrats defeated the air war with a ground war. The Democrats
turned out their base, while the Republicans focused on an ad
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee chairman Steve Grossman, a
Massachusetts businessman, said Democratic committees relied on a
sophisticated computer model that encouraged turnout of key
constituencies such as blacks and women in select races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people wrote us off,'' Grossman said, reflecting upon a
year in which the party endured Clinton's sex scandal at the same
it was trying to overcome an $18 million debt largely as a result
of legal fees from the campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the party recovered for several reasons, including
a backlash against the GOP impeachment inquiry, voter concern that
the Republican-controlled Congress wasn't dealing with issues
affecting ordinary people, and the Democratic Party's recruitment
of candidates who reflected moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of impeachment, Grossman said it was up
to Republicans to end the inquiry. ``Our view has always been,
`Let's end the process in an appropriate way, let's not engage in a
potentially two-year open-ended process.''
</P>
<P>
   With an expedited impeachment process and the apparent plans of
Republicans to focus on key issues, many analysts believe the next
two years of political discourse will be devoted to such programs
as Social Security and health care reform. Democrats believe such a
change will enhance their prospects to capture the House and hold
the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we didn't change the landscape, but we redefined
the agenda,'' said Hart, the Democratic pollster. ``We're not going
to spend the next two years on impeachment. We'll move back to the
public's business.''

NETANYAHU, AFTER DELAY, WILL OFFER WYE PACT TO CABINET  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After intensive efforts by Washington to resolve a
dispute over when the Palestinians will arrest 30 people wanted by
Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will present the
withdrawal agreement he reached last month with Yasser Arafat to
the Israeli Cabinet on Thursday morning, American officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has been delaying a Cabinet meeting to approve the
deal, which was reached at talks with President Clinton at Wye
River, Md., and was supposed to have taken effect two days ago.
Israeli officials insisted that the Palestinians first had to put
in writing a list of the 30 people whom they agreed to arrest and a
timetable for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Those sought, including at least 12 Palestinian police officers,
are wanted on charges of involvement in the deaths of Israelis. At
Wye the Israelis agreed to forgo extradition if the Palestinians
arrested the suspects, with the Central Intelligence Agency
monitoring their detention.
</P>
<P>
   An oral agreement specified that the 30 be arrested in three
phases over 12 weeks, corresponding to the phases of the Israeli
withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank. The
withdrawal is conditional on specific Palestinian steps to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said Wednesday in Madrid that 12 of the 30 had been
arrested. ``We have detained 12 of them'' the Palestinian leader
said. ``They have committed terrorist acts. We will continue to
pursue the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials also said some of the suspects had been
detained. American officials said they had no reason to doubt
Arafat's statement but could not confirm it.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, to better defend the agreement before his Cabinet and
his angry right wing, has tried to have every ``gray area'' in the
agreement ``turned into black and white,'' an American official
said Wednesday, no matter how embarrassing that may be to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are moving in the right direction,'' the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Wednesday evening.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``has been working
intensively on this in recent days, and we're hopeful that
clarifications will yield a decision to bring this to the Cabinet
tomorrow, and the agreement will move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Other American officials said Netanyahu was forcing into the
public arena matters that both sides had agreed to keep private and
noted that the published agreement does not mention any timetable
for prisoner arrests, which the Americans are supposed to
guarantee, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensitivity of these security matters doesn't lend itself
to public discussion,'' an official said carefully. ``We recognize
the need to publicize and crystallize certain issues to win over
certain people who might be on the fence. But the United States has
an obligation to keep private what should be private and not
interfere with the arrest of people who should be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment was understood to be a reference to the publication
in an Israeli newspaper of the list of 30 suspects, a move that
will make their arrest considerably more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Another American official noted that Arafat is facing his own
domestic threats from radical Islamic groups that oppose any
accommodation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The American role, in drafting the Wye agreement and nursing it,
is extraordinary. Albright has made constant telephone calls on
this latest ``bump in the road,'' as Rubin called it Wednesday, and
all her senior officials who work on the Middle East have been
deeply involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's total dependency,'' said one exasperated American
official.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Hebron agreement in January 1997, when the
Americans did not pay as much attention to its effectiveness and
the deal was derailed by Israeli settlers, the Wye accord directly
involves American officials in carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official said Netanyahu had been hesitant to
present the Wye agreement to the Cabinet because he feared that the
Palestinians would evade their obligations to arrest the fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a real estate deal,'' the official said. ``He
wants the money in the bank before turning over any land, and not
any promissory notes. He can't accept it if it's another promise
that `the check is in the mail.' If he starts with that now, then
the whole system of Palestinian promises goes down the drain.''

REPUBLICANS CONCEDE THEY OFFERED VOTERS A MUDDLED MESSAGE, FAILED

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the aftermath of unexpected midterm election
losses, Republicans Wednesday conceded they had offered voters a
muddled message and failed to do as good a job as the Democrats in
turning out their core supporters.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders did not try to hide their disappointment with the
results of Tuesday's election, where they lost five House seats,
failed to pick up any Senate seats, and handed over the governor's
mansion in the nation's most populous state, California.
</P>
<P>
   While the party maintained control of both chambers of Congress
and held on to a majority of governorships, the Republican
performance was particularly poor for a midterm election, when the
party out of the White House almost always gains seats.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it became clear that the Clinton scandal which the
GOP once hoped to ride to greater victories, did not work in their
favor, with exit polls showing that most voters did not believe
president's behavior was relevant to their election selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped to be in a position for a wave, and there was one,
and they caught it,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga. who headed the
Republican House campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   Linder praised the Democrats for targeting their base
supporters, African-Americans and union workers, while
acknowledging that the GOP spent too much money on advertisements
and not enough on get-out-the vote ground operations.
</P>
<P>
   Linder acknowledged that Republicans failed to articulate
compelling issues in a year when Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky dominated media attention and the GOP got caught in a
frustrating last-minute budget battle with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we did not have a sharp edge to our issues,''
he said. ``I think we had candidates out there talking about a
variety of things, but no clear issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more controversial campaign tactics, the GOP spent
$10 million in the last week on series of ads, some of which linked
the Clinton scandal to the election. However, Republican candidates
lost in 18 of the 30 districts where the anti-Clinton spots ran.
</P>
<P>
   Linder denied that the ads had backfired but acknowledged that
they were ``inconsequential'' in moving voters.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim
Nicholson, said that the scandal was counterproductive because it
prevented the GOP from talking about a message of cutting taxes and
smaller government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton scandals became a filter through which we could
not penetrate with a clear message about what the Republican
majority has achieved in a remarkably short time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the fallout will be from the elections but
already a number of GOP faithful have been grumbling about House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has helped set the guideline for
impeachment and approved the anti-Clinton ads.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich angrily blamed the media for dwelling on the scandal
and vowed not to step down.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats were quick to pounce on the speaker's difficulties
in dealing with a fractious party.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo, said he would work
with moderate Republicans to try and pass legislation dealing with
Social Security, education, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats credited their victories to a sophisticated
get-out-the vote operation which included mass mailing and phone
banks which targeted key constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ground war; we trained generals, we trained colonels,
we trained sergeants, and we had an effective organization on the
ground when the day was done,'' said Steve Grossman, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were also aided by organized labor, which traded
the heavy advertising that characterized their efforts in 1996 for
a more low-profile grass-roots operation. Union officials said they
spent $19 million on the campaign and sent out 9.5 million pieces
of mail and made 5.5 million phone calls to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also more successful in getting
African-Americans, who are among the president's strongest backers,
to the polls this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, where the Democrat Roy Barnes won a close race for
governor, African-American turnout was 30 percent, up from 19
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, where incumbent Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening
survived a tough challenge, African-Americans comprised one out of
five voters. In 1994 one in eight Maryland voters was black.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans relied on conservative Christians to provide the
backbone of their support. But officials with the Christian
Coalition said said that according to their survey, about 31
percent of their voters supported Democrats on Election Day. They
blamed the defections on the Republicans' inability to articulate a
clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The election included a number of notable upsets, including the
defeat of two GOP Republican incumbent senators, New York's Alfonse
D'Amato and North Carolina's Lauch Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's defeat will mean that a Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm will
move up to chairman of the Senate banking committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only one incumbent Democratic senator, Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois, was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate Republicans will continue to hold a 55-45
majority.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the House Democrats have eroded the GOP majority by
five seats to a 223-211 advantage. The five House GOP incumbent
that lost included two elected in Republican class of 1994 _ Reps.
John Fox of Pennsylvania and Rick White of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats picked up governorships in California, South Carolina,
Alabama, and Iowa while Republicans nabbed Florida, Colorado,
Nebraska and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most talked about gubernatorial prize went to a
former professional wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura who pinned
both the Democrat and Republican candidates in his bid for
Minnesota's top office.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton's was in awe of Ventura's feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to have a lot of politicians spending
time in the gym,'' the president said. &QL;

VOTERS IN 5 STATES BACK MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Nev., Ore., Wash., Colo., Ga.)  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ In defiance of federal officials, and often state
legislators, voters approved initiatives on Tuesday to legalize the
medical use of marijuana in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   And in Colorado and the District of Columbia, where
conservatives managed to nullify medical marijuana initiatives at
the last moment, surveys of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday
indicated strong support for the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Drug policy analysts Wednesday said the votes, in which every
marijuana initiative on a state ballot was approved, demonstrated
the sea change in attitudes that started with the approval of
ballot measures in Arizona and California in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of these propositions would have passed five
years ago,'' said Mark Kleiman, a professor of policy studies at
the University of California, Los Angeles. ``It is no longer
possible to buffalo the American people by screaming drugs and
having them run away.''
</P>
<P>
   But the drives for the initiatives were bolstered by $5 million
in advertising over the last year, estimated Ethan Nadelmann,
director of the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy institute in New
York. The campaign was financed by George Soros, the billionaire
investor who financed the Lindesmith Center; Peter Lewis, a
Cleveland insurance executive, and John Sperling, a Phoenix
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The votes would give confidence to politicians who are afraid to
publicly support allowing doctors to recommend marijuana to
patients suffering from illnesses like glaucoma, cancer and
multiple sclerosis, Nadelmann predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon and Arizona, the votes were direct slaps at state
legislatures that had voted curbs on marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the Legislature last year restored criminal penalties
for marijuana possession. On Tuesday, Oregonians voted, 2-1, to
make possession merely a violation carrying a fine, as it had been
since 1973. They also voted, by a smaller margin, to approve the
medical use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the Legislature had approved bills last year that
essentially gutted the marijuana referendum votes of 1996. On
Tuesday, Arizona voters easily approved two initiatives that
restored the 1996 language.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two states, Arizona and Oregon, people overthrew the
politicians on drugs,'' Sam Vagenas, leader of Arizona's
medical-marijuana movement, said Wednesday. ``This is the biggest
grass-roots movement since term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the medical-marijuana movement has come from big
city police chiefs, Congress, and the White House's top drug policy
official, Gen. Barry McCaffrey. In Senate testimony last summer,
the general, who directs the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, warned, in a veiled reference to Soros: ``There is a
carefully camouflaged, exorbitantly funded, well-heeled elitist
group whose ultimate goal is to legalize drug use in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the general's office emphasized that the state
measures ``in no way alter the status of marijuana under federal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the mixed message that children pick up
on this,'' Jim McDonough, director of strategy for the White House
drug control office, said Wednesday of the advertising campaigns to
allow medical uses of marijuana. Noting that the number of
marijuana users in the nation had dropped in half since 1980, to
about 10 million today, he said that surveys indicated a recent
increase among students.
</P>
<P>
   In the District of Columbia, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a
conservative, inserted two weeks ago into the district's federal
appropriation bill an amendment to bar the district from counting
votes in Tuesday's medical-marijuana initiative. The American Civil
Liberties Union is suing to overturn the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, a medical-marijuana initiative was also on the
ballot, but Vikki Buckley, the secretary of state and a Republican,
said she would not count the votes because the initiative backers
did not supply enough valid signatures to place the issue on the
ballot. Backers are contesting her ruling in court.

NASA TO BEGIN ASSEMBLY OF SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA has agreed formally to begin assembly in orbit of the
international space station later this month, although financial
uncertainty looms over the key role Russia is to play, agency
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first component, the American-financed, Russian-built
control module, is slated for a Nov. 20 liftoff aboard an unmanned
rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. shuttle crew will follow with a structural link between
future American and Russian components, blasting off Dec. 3 from
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a shuttle rendezvous
with the control module, spacewalking astronauts will link the
first two components.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the third component is much more tentative. The
Russian service module, the first habitable component, is to fly
from Baikonur before the end of July. Chronic delays caused by
Russia's ailing economy have already made it 15 months late,
causing a year's postponement in the first launching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been an easy road for the international space
station,'' said Gretchen McClain, NASA's deputy associate
administrator for the project, who participated this week in a
series of technical reviews at the Johnson Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In front of us we still have a lot of challenges. It will not
be an easy road. None of us should expect this to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, McClain, NASA station program manager Randy Brinkley
and Frank Culbertson, the program's deputy manager for operations,
said planners have taken the steps necessary to begin the project.
</P>
<P>
   The construction will require an estimated 36 shuttle flights,
nine Russian rocket launches and dozens more launches of Russian
Progress cargo and Soyuz crew capsules through mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent measure to preserve Russia's role was a decision
by NASA to pay the country's space agency $60 million to install
the final components on the service module and to acquire the
components that will be needed to fabricate future Progress and
Soyuz capsules.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also plans to obtain its own propulsion module, a hedge if
Russia fails to provide the Progress craft it has promised.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency has alerted Congress that it may pay the
Russians as much as $150 million annually to ensure Progress and
Soyuz capsules are available during the first years of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concerns are financial,'' said Brinkley. ``Does the
Russian government have the resources to meet their commitments, to
be able to buy the critical components for the Progress and Soyuz
over the assembly sequence.'' &QL;

 &HT;    In Ala. battle of God vs. gambling, Siegelman and his lottery
win
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Outside the Embassy Suites hotel, campaign
headquarters for Republican Gov. Fob James on Tuesday night, a
moving van decorated with four American flags and inscribed with
the legend ``Fob. Governor. Yes'' waited in front of a parking
meter. But the reality of the election was reflected in the words
on the meter's red flag: ``Time Expired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted a change,'' said Mike Evans, who voted for Lt.
Gov. Don Siegelman, the first Democrat headed for the Alabama
governor's mansion since George C. Wallace was elected in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   As they decided to send James packing in favor of Siegelman,
voters had a clear choice Tuesday: the Christian activist platform
that won James national support from the Religious Right or a
lottery proposal Siegelman built his entire campaign around.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to God vs. gambling, lottery supporters had the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   James captured his Christian base but failed to land swing
voters, who turned out for Siegelman. According to Alabama exit
polling by the Voters News Service, James won 72 percent of the
votes among people who considered themselves conservative
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   However, they represented only about one of every three voters.
In contrast, more than half those who cast ballots said they
favored a lottery _ and almost nine out of every 10 of them voted
for Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   The wide margin voters gave Democrat Siegelman_ 58 percent to
James' 42 percent _ was an exception in an election in which many
other Republicans in Alabama survived challenges, leading some
analysts to argue that the governor's race was more a referendum on
James and the lottery than a fight over political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be interpreted as a Christian vote
against the conservative leanings that our Christian community and
others have,'' said Don Ireland of Birmingham, who lobbies
legislators on issues with moral implications. ``If you look at
Senate and House votes in the state, many who have stood on strong,
moral issues were re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most prominent Christian activists in Alabama,
Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy Moore of Gadsden, suggested people
of faith had turned away from their doctrine. In 1995, Moore hung
his hand-carved replica of the Ten Commandments on his courtroom
wall. Another judge ordered them taken down. Moore refused and
James spent much of his time defending Moore and vowed to call out
the National Guard to keep the wooden tablets up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that the people would seem to choose darkness
instead of what I consider light,'' Moore said. ``But I'm not so
disillusioned to think that God is not in control. God's still in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   But James is not, Moore said, because ``Christians evidently
didn't show up at the polls or else there would have been a
different outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian conservative leaders, however, argued that
rejection of James was hardly a rejection of the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We energized our conservative base,'' said Ralph Reed, former
director of the Christian Coalition hired as a James consultant.
``The fact is, there's not one scintilla of data that shows people
didn't back pro-family, pro-faith candidates. ... The Ten
Commandments, religious faith_that's still a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   James' political demise came, Reed said, because the campaign
was unable to move voters away from the lottery as their primary
issue. Tied to education, the Siegelman-proposed lottery _ modeled
after Georgia's 5-year-old program _ persuaded voters near the
middle of the political spectrum to abandon their tendency to vote
Republican, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Those on the fringes of James' support_conservative Democrats
and moderate Republicans_began turning away from the incumbent
during a tumultuous GOP primary. Republican challenger Winton
Blount beat down James' good-old-boy image, bringing up the time
the governor imitated the walk of a monkey to deride the theory of
evolution at a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
   James loyalists stayed loyal, for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at the broad picture of who Fob James is,'' said
Ebby Sechriest of Montgomery, who voted for the governor. ``He's
jovial. He makes jokes just to make himself more likable. He shows
that Darwinian theory is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, some analysts believe, the appeal of the lottery
simply was greater than the appeal of Fob James, who got only 38
percent of the vote in his hometown of Lanett, just across the
border from several Georgia lottery outlets.
</P>
<P>
   William Stewart, a political scientist at the University of
Alabama, agreed that the state's social conservatism remains
intact. Instead, he said, voters framed the election as a personal
referendum on James.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're saying they didn't support his agenda _
protecting the Ten Commandments or school prayer_ but they were
just focusing on a lottery, which Don Siegelman was able to
articulate so well,'' Stewart said. ``James was perpetually on the
defensive.

 &HT;    Martin continues to conquer, gets job done at Winston Cup
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Martin sort of blushed at the suggestion. ``I'm
not a very good writer,'' he said after being asked what words he'd
put into a headline describing his 1998 Winston Cup season. Then
the words came pouring forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas that come to mind are: Triumph. Success. Dream Come
True. The Best I've Ever Had.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Frustrating? Martin is the only active Winston Cup
driver who has finished sixth or better in the point standings each
year since 1989. This year, he chased Jeff Gordon all over the map
and still will come in second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to put 'Frustrating' there,'' Martin said. ``I
had thought that I may have seen the best years of my career
already prior to 1998, and now I'm pretty sure that I haven't seen
my best years yet. How is that frustrating? That's sort of a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's career year in '98 included seven wins, two poles, 20
top-fives, 24 top-10s and more than $3 million in winnings.
</P>
<P>
   He did it under what he described as ``suicidal pain'' from a
herniated disc in his back. ``This business doesn't allow you to be
sick or injured,'' Martin said. ``It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   He did it with an incomprehensible pain in his heart after his
father perished in a small-plane crash in August. Not even the
hectic Winston Cup schedule has helped his grieving process.
``Nothing seems to be replacing that or helping that,'' Martin
said. ``We were real close. There's been a lot on me since my dad's
accident, more than I thought I could handle. He had a business
that I'm in charge of now, as well as all the estate stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin acknowledged that he has a lot to be thankful for. But a
nervous energy consumes him. He shows lots of wrinkles and worry
lines when he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really designed to enjoy; I was designed to get the
job done,'' Martin said. ``That's the best way I can put it in
mechanical terms. I'm not about enjoying life; that's not what I'm
about. I'm about conquering the next challenge, so I would have to
say that this has been the most enjoyable year of my career. It's
been a surprise to me and a relief to me. I don't believe that I've
seen my best years yet, not after what I've seen this year.''
</P>
<P>
   When he looked at 1998, he saw the work that went into it rather
than the trophies it brought him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been paying, paying, paying, paying, and I kind of cashed
in this year, on my career. That probably sums it up. I've been
paying since 1974, and I feel like that I've cashed in this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, in stock-car racing Martin is called Mr.
Intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm working an average of 12 hours a day, seven
days a week. I consider this interview work; it's part of the job.
If I wasn't talking to you, I could be napping on the couch. There
is no time off for me. My days start at 5:30 in the morning, and
they usually finish 9 or 10 o'clock at night. I've had quite a few
16-hour days in the last month or two. I have a lot on me.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he do to de-stress? ``Nothing. There's no such thing.
When are you going to do that? If you do that, you're not doing
your job. If there's something to be done, you need to do it. Only
slackers walk away from their responsibilities and obligations. I
wasn't designed that way. My genetic makeup is not of that. I've
just been carrying the load.''
</P>
<P>
   The load got considerable heavier on Aug. 8, when his father,
Julian, died. Julian Martin had built a trucking company from the
days when he personally hauled eggs to St. Louis and Memphis from
his hometown, Batesville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark was 5, his dad stood him in his lap and began teaching
him how to steer a car. In 1971, when Mark was 12, his dad put him
in an 18-wheeler and told him to drive from a delivery in Ohio back
home. Three years later, Julian bought the kid a 1955 Chevy from a
junk yard, built a roll cage out of water pipe and painted it
orange with a No. 2 on the side. And Mark went racing.
</P>
<P>
   That first year, Martin entered 101 races at Benton (Ark.)
Speedbowl alone and won 22, including the state championship. By
1978, Martin graduated to the American Speed Association and won
the first of three titles racing against future Winston Cup
competitors Rusty Wallace and Dick Trickle.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first Winston Cup start in 1981 at 22. A year later,
he was fired from his first Winston Cup ride. His sponsor never
paid money Martin had been promised, and, despite finishing second
to Geoff Bodine in the rookie race and winning $124,215, Martin
went broke. In the garage area of Charlotte Motor Speedway, an
auctioneer sold off what was left of the Mark Martin Racing Team.
</P>
<P>
   Martin returned to short-track racing and began drinking
heavily. In 1983, Jack Roush gave Martin a second chance in Winston
Cup. In his biography, ``Driven To Race,'' Martin wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got hooked up with Jack Roush and finally got a shot at
having it all, after losing everything you could ever dream of, I
guess that was the hope I needed to straighten things out and make
a better life for myself and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who says of himself, ``I'm not the most
positive, upbeat person in the world, but I certainly have a
reasonable attitude about racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, show him the good equipment and he'll show you
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What your race team is made of and what your equipment is, I
believe, makes a bigger difference than I knew,'' Martin said.
``I've had better equipment than I've ever had this year, and the
results show. If Jack Roush can continue feeding me with the kind
of equipment that I've had, or better, then I have everything to
look forward to.''

 &HT;    New rules will slow down cars
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASCAR's decision this week to scrap the
``five-and-five'' rule and replace it with more rear spoiler and
longer front air dams should accomplish two things for the NAPA 500
at Atlanta Motor Speedway: slow down the cars and tighten the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations, said the rule
changes had nothing to do with the fast track at AMS. It was done
more for experimentation, Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR tried several combinations early in the season before
sticking with the five-and-five. Many drivers were critical because
they said the smaller spoilers caused cars to run too loose and
eliminated side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, NASCAR wants to get a jump on the 1999 season at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the opportunity to see what something like this
will do,'' said Triplett. ``It's difficult to make an assessment
off one race, but it's better than none.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers think NASCAR's decision to change the rules was
made easier when Jeff Gordon wrapped up the points title last week
at Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules apply to all makes. The front air dam on all cars
will have a 3.50-inch ground clearance; spoiler sizes differ.
</P>
<P>
   Like father
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton Jr. continued to follow in his father's footsteps
Wednesday, winning the pole for Friday's Winn Dixie 250 ARCA race
at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Hamilton, 21, took his first pole of the
year with a speed of 184.345 miles per hour. Veteran Frank Kimmel,
36, was second-fastest, 183.043. ``I have fun when I run good,''
said the young Hamilton, whose best finish was third at Charlotte
earlier this year. ``I wish he'd start doing more of that a little
more often so I could retire,'' said his Winston Cup dad, Bobby.
``I'm tired of hitting those walls. I wasn't surprised. He's got a
pretty good car under him.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven's decision
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Craven says sitting out 12 races with post-concussion
syndrome contributed to his release from Hendrick Motorsports.
``That was a tough decision (to sit out), but it was the right one,
and I'd make it again if I'm given that kind of advice,'' Craven
said. Since his release, Craven has been focusing on his future and
looking for another Winston Cup ride. ``I know this is where I want
to be, but in what form I'm not sure. I've considered a lot of
things.''

GRAMM LIKELY TO HEAD SENATE BANK PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (Also moving in `p' category) 
(lb) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The defeat of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York
means that Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who has a combative streak, is
expected to become the next chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, a prospect that is sending shivers through many on Wall
Street and in the financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Gramm last October single-handedly halted a
bill, sought by the financial services industry, to sweep away
Depression-era restrictions just as the measure was about to
receive Senate approval. For two decades the industry has sought
this measure, only to see it slip away at the 11th hour because of
Gramm's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gramm, who espouses a strong free-market philosophy
and anti-regulatory view, has criticized the Securities and
Exchange Commission's efforts to improve investor education.
</P>
<P>
   The banking committee oversees, in part, the nation's securities
industry, and Gramm has clashed with Arthur Levitt, chairman of the
SEC, on a variety of issues, including SEC funding. ``Gramm and
Levitt have tilted at each other before,'' said a lobbyist, who
asked not to be named. ``They are hardly peas from the same pod.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists said Wednesday that they had been fielding nervous
phone calls from Wall Street executives, concerned over Gramm's
views as well as his long history of clashes with bankers,
regulators and other senators.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial services lobbyists here who maintain residences
in New York said they were so concerned about the possibility that
Gramm would head the most important congressional banking oversight
committee that they flew to New York to vote for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``A D'Amato defeat does not bode well for the prompt enactment
of financial restructuring legislation,'' said Kenneth Guenther,
executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of
America, which supported the bill. ``D'Amato worked things out and
could reach across the aisle. That's not Phil Gramm's style. Gramm
will be more partisan, more interested in drawing lines in the sand
and in keeping the differences between Democrats and Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm halted passage of the financial overhaul measure after it
had already passed the House, had enough votes to gain Senate
approval and had gained unusual bipartisan and industrywide support
from special interests that had been warring for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Through clever parliamentary maneuvering, Gramm stopped the
bill, because he objected to parts of it that he felt would expand
the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires bankers to provide
loans to low- and moderate-income areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gramm issued a statement supporting the financial
modernization measure _ repeating what he had said all along. ``I
strongly favor rewriting the Depression-era laws which govern much
of the financial activity in America,'' Gramm said. ``I have long
recognized the need to update them.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who have dealt with Gramm over the years say his words
and actions often do not match. The overhaul bill would eliminate
restrictions that prevent banks, insurance companies and investment
banks from engaging in one another's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, attempts to pass this measure have
failed. This year the House passed the measure by a one-vote margin
and the Senate was poised to approve it, until Gramm held up a stop
sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this means changes for HR 10,'' said Bert Ely, banking
industry consultant in Alexandria, Va., referring to the overhaul
measure by its bill number. ``The conventional wisdom is that
Gramm's chairmanship will impede HR 10.''
</P>
<P>
   In his lone stand against the bill, Gramm represented no
industry group and said he was acting on principle. He has likened
the reinvestment act requirements to ``slavery'' and ``extortion''
in speaking before the Senate Banking Committee. It is Gramm's
penchant for strong ideological stances that is raising concern
among financial lobbyists here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows with Phil Gramm?'' said one lobbyist for a New York
investment bank, who asked not to be identified. ``He's a very
principled, ideological guy who has been very effective in stopping
things in the banking committee. Who knows if he can be effectively
affirmative? We are all beating our breasts. It's hard to imagine
him compromising. With D'Amato, compromise was his middle
initial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another area of concern is over potential legislation to
regulate hedge funds. While funding for the Commodities Future
Trading Commission, which oversees regulation of over-the-counter
derivatives, is handled by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the
banking committee also has some CFTC jurisdiction. Gramm's wife,
Wendy, is the former head of the CFTC and Gramm's basic orientation
is to oppose regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists generally feel that Gramm would be viewed positively
by hedge funds _ lightly regulated limited partnerships for rich
investors _ that want to fend off regulations. Some hedge funds
have suffered large losses recently, drawing new attention to this
kind of fund.
</P>
<P>
   With New York as the center of the nation's financial industry
and with Sen.-elect Charles Schumer having served on the House
Banking Committee, many expect that Schumer will get a seat on the
minority side of the Senate Banking Committee. For years, Schumer
has been a proponent of financial services modernization and, like
D'Amato, has long enjoyed the financial support of Wall Street and
New York banks in his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, too, has received hefty campaign contributions from the
financial securities industry. Federal Election Commission records
show he currently has $2.3 million in campaign donations from the
financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other lobbyists feel Gramm, as chairman, might want to put his
own stamp on financial services reform. They think that if Gramm's
concerns about the reinvestment act can be addressed, and if the
House passes the bill again by an overwhelming majority, Gramm
might want to make a mark as chairman and would support the bill.

 &HT;    Reed's `tough' election day probably a maturing experience
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ralph Reed grew a lot older between Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning than might be accounted for by that brief span of
time.
</P>
<P>
   As the youthful director of the Christian Coalition and then
head of his own high-profile, Atlanta-based Republican political
consulting firm, Century Strategies, Reed has come a long way in a
hurry since the days when he interned for then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller
and worked toward a doctorate in political science at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the kindest way to characterize Reed's first
general-election outing as a consultant is that it was a maturing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough day,'' Reed said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Counting a couple of clients he said he was contractually
obliged not to name, Reed claimed a win record of close to .500 for
the year, but his biggest races were disasters.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the Republicans lost their first governor's race in
16 years as Democrat Don Siegelman easily displaced incumbent Gov.
Fob James, who never recovered from a bloody primary battle and his
own image as a loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, client Mitch Skandalakis's campaign fell apart in
the closing weeks, and he is being widely blamed with sparking a
backlash of black voters which brought down most of the Republican
ticket. An Indiana client, Gary Hofmeister, was accused of playing
the race card in a failed effort to unseat incumbent Democrat Julia
Carson with an ad described by one columnist as ``Willie
Horton-esque.'' In that ad, a picture of Carson melds into images
of hypodermic needles and prison doors.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bad day for religious conservative candidates in
general, with the defeat of North Carolina Sen. Lauch Faircloth and
other allies of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what religious conservatives have got to do now is
resist the impluse for self-flagellation,'' and not to listen to
those writing their political obituary on the basis of one
election, Reed said. But he said Tuesday's setback does underscore
a couple of vital lessons for the movement with which he has been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we should recognize that this is a long-term, 30 to
40-year struggle,'' in which there will be gains and losses, Reed
said. ``That does not mean that we should retreat and it certainly
does not mean we are no longer viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, the religious right has to learn how to
deliver its message ``in the lexicon of people who've been left
behind, especially minorities and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   His own involvement in a couple of campaigns where just the
opposite appears to have happened was an especially sore point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bail out on clients but I hope that yesterday was an
important learning experience for a lot of people in the party in
terms of the issue of dealing with the black vote,'' Reed said.

 &HT;    Dietary supplement creatine popular, controversial
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bill Thorn is careful what he puts in his body. And he
tries to instill that philosophy in the high school athletes he
coaches at tiny Landmark Christian School in Fairburn.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he endorses the use of creatine monohydrate, the legal
but controversial muscle-building dietary supplement used by
athletes at all levels _ from Super Bowl winners to record-chasing
home-run hitters to local weightlifters _ looking to get ``pumped
up'' quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark's football and track performers also use a creatine
mixture that Thorn developed. It might be one reason why his War
Eagles have won the last three state track titles and are able to
stay competitive in football despite dressing only 25 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trained hard under coach Thorn. He wants to do everything
he can for his athletes,'' said Jeremiah Register, who went from a
skinny sophomore to a state-ranked pole vaulter and is now a
freshman at North Georgia College. ``There's no BS with him. He
lays it out there for you. He's been around forever and knows what
he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the more controversial androstenedione, another popular
muscle-building supplement endorsed by home-run king Mark McGwire,
creatine is not banned by any professional or amateur sports
league. It is available over the counter nearly everywhere. It is
sold by grocery stores and fitness centers, even at frozen
``smoothie'' drink stands at many malls. As a powder, it can cost
$30 to $50 per kilogram, which is about 200 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, a hormone that also is produced naturally by
the body and is the precursor to testosterone, is not as available
over the counter. Sports nutrition giant General Nutrition Centers,
which has 3,000 stores nationwide, has taken it off its shelves
because of its steroid-like side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of creatine among high school athletes
has been attributed in large part to its list of high-profile
users, including Shannon Sharpe of the Super Bowl-champion Denver
Broncos and slugger Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Many high school football coaches and administrators in Georgia
are apprehensive about endorsing the new rage in muscle candy; some
are against it entirely and question its safety.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, however, contends that creatine is a safe way to help
players get the most out of workouts and enhance performance and
endurance in competition.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old fitness enthusiast, who has run in all 29
Peachtree Road Races, says he wouldn't give his players something
he hasn't fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take it in a heartbeat if I felt like I could,'' said
Thorn, who doesn't use the supplement because he's battling
prostate cancer and is leery of its effect on the disease. ``I
believe it works as advertised. It's an enhancement, after you do
the groundwork. If you're not going to work hard, then this won't
work. That's what I tell my kids. This works as you work.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches, however, say that working hard isenough for a
teenager whose body is still developing. Clarkston coach Larry
Jester said he believes that no supplements are needed to win
football games, which his Angoras did regularly when they were
Class AAA semifinalists last season. ``I just believe in green
beans and weights,'' Jester said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the opinions, the supplements are prevalent in state
high school football programs and appear to be here to stay. In a
recent poll of 102 metro Atlanta coaches, 24 said they generally
favor using creatine, 60 said they are opposed, and 18 said they
are waiting to learn more. ``I know some coaches who sell it,''
Sequoyah coach Sid Maxwell said. ``They're into the salesman part
of it.'' Maxwell, a certified strength and conditioning specialist,
said that about ``50 or 60 percent'' of his players use creatine as
part of his program's nutritional plan. ``Right now, everybody is
using it, but I'm not sure they really can tell you what creatine
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Creatine monohydrate is an amino acid in the human body _ about
95 percent is stored in muscles _ and is used as fuel in such
quick-burst movements as snatching a barbell over your head or
bursting off the line at the snap in a football game. It is found
naturally in red meat and some fish. Proponents believe that users
can sustain those short, powerful movements if they supplement
their creatine level, through powder, tablet or gum. Supplements
raise the creatine level better than food does. For example, two
pounds of uncooked red meat contains only four grams of creatine,
and cooking the meat lowers the level. Most programs call for
beginners to take 20 grams or more daily for five to seven days,
then about five grams per day as a maintenance phase.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine consumption carries several side effects, most
considered benign by its faithful. Those side effects include
nausea, upset stomach, diarrhea and renal stress, but they
generally occur in those who take more than the daily five-gram
dosage, according to Ray Sahelian, a Los Angeles physician.
Sahelian has written what many users consider the definitive book
on the substance, ``Creatine: Nature's Muscle Builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents doubt that creatine supplements provide any
benefit, and they cite a possible link between creatine use and
dehydration and muscle cramping because of the supplement's
propensity to cause water retention. John Foster, an orthopedic
surgeon with the Atlanta Center for Athletes, which provides
trainers for several metro high schools, says he would discourage
creatine usage.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Tennessee football program decreased its
creatine use earlier this season afterseveral players got cramps in
the Vols' season-opener against Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sahelian, who takes creatine himself, says it can be
beneficial in building muscle mass and making workouts more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine encourages me to continue on a workout program
because the rewards are high,'' he said. ``It encourages with its
quick and noticeable results.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term effects of creatine monohydrate are not known
because the supplement has only been on the market since 1992. The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no official statement on
creatine, although it suggests a person see a doctor before
beginning use of any non-pharmaceutical nutritional supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend that creatine contributed to the deaths last
fall of three college wrestlers engaged in drastic weight
reduction. Two of the three wrestlers were known to have used
creatine, and the third was rumored to have used it. The FDA,
however, ruled that creatine did not cause the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Sahelian urges those who take creatine to be careful and to
spend significant time off of the supplement. He takes five grams
every other day but also eliminates usage one week each month and
one month three times a year. He strongly suggests that
high-schoolers be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel uncomfortable with teenagers using it,'' Sahelian said.
``However, knowing that creatine is widely available over the
counter and (that) opposing teams may be using it, `Just say no' is
not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahelian says a high school football player should take no more
than five grams a day during the season and then refrain from using
it during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers do not have the self-control, and they may take too
much of it,'' said Sahelian, who acknowledges that the long-term
effects of daily creatine use are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, the orthopedic surgeon, said he doesn't see any benefit
from creatine supplements, although he adds that he thinks they
generally are safe to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it might do is change the fluid status and make the
appearance of bigger muscles, but I don't think it improves
performance in the muscle,'' Foster said. ``I don't think it lives
up to its billing. But if you take an adolescent and make him
believe he's going to have an advantage, he's probably going to buy
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the publicity about both supplements, the National
Federation of State High School Associations issued a position
statement saying that coaches and school personnel should not
dispense such supplements except with extreme caution and with
parental consent. The association's Sports Medicine Advisory
Committee declared that ``even natural substances in unnatural
amounts may have short-term or long-term negative health effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia High School Association echoes that sentiment,
although executive director Tommy Guillebeau acknowledges that it
doesn't mean the association has a policy banning creatine. ``We
certainly don't approve of any of those enhancement drugs,''
Guillebeau said. ``We feel you should just eat your potatoes, meat
and bread. We think that's good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a popular sentiment among coaches. ``Our school doesn't
buy it for (players), and our philosophy is, eat well, sleep well,
lift hard,'' Cherokee coach Chuck Budde said.
</P>
<P>
   Some metro school systems, including Cobb and Fayette counties,
have written policies against coaches promoting the use of such
products as creatine.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, however, to discount the positive results seen
by high school coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   Sequoyah, on the verge of its second consecutive playoff berth
from tough Region 6-AAAA, has gone virtually injury-free in the
nine years _ five as head coach _ that Maxwell has been at the
Canton school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our second game of the season my first year we had five ACL
(anterior cruciate ligament) knee injuries. It was like a massacre.
I vowed not to let that happen again,'' said Maxwell, who says
creatine is given, with parental permission, after practices as
part of the nutrition and weight-training program he offers his
players. He said he believes that the supplement also helps his
players get less fatigued at the end of games. ``(Creatine) is just
one of the components that adds to the program. I think it's one of
the ways that we have seen our injuries drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Trey White, a senior tight end and linebacker at McNair High in
DeKalb County, believes that creatine has made him a college
prospect. In one year, White has gone from 175 pounds to 215,
carries only 2 percent body fat and bench-presses almost 400
pounds. White is the son of McNair coach Earl White, a former
defensive line coach and assistant strength and conditioning coach
at Oklahoma State and Virginia _ and a proponent of creatine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really blessed to have a father that knows all about this
stuff,'' Trey White said. ``It is nothing that will hurt you. It
only helps. One dosage a day makes you feel stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing about the supplement is a must, Thorn said. His research
led him to develop his own line of nutritional supplements, named
Coaches Choice, including creatine, which is produced by
Jonesboro-based Vitalabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information out there got me interested,'' Thornsaid.
``Then I researched it in depth. Then I had come to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said he stays informed by attending seminars and
symposiums and asking the right questions of those in the know. ``A
lot of people don't do their homework,'' Maxwell said. ``I've got
the background based in knowledge. Everybody has their opinions,
but I try to listen to the people who deal with it daily and
research it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more they know, those coaches say, the more they can pass
along to their players, and maybe that knowledge will keep them
away from more dangerous substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (steroids) are available; I hate to say it,'' Thorn
said. ``I tell my kids to stay away from the gyms. Don't listen to
those muscleheads.''

 &HT;    Mindset geared for success keeping Falcons on top
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Boigner was walking around the Falcons' locker
room Wednesday grinning and looking like he'd just hit the lottery.
When asked what 6-2 means to him, he summarized nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harmony, man,'' he said. ``Hey, there's more pressure; you're
getting more attention; the stakes are higher. But it's fun. It's
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how things are going for the Falcons these days -- even
the equipment manager is loving life. His is not an easy job, but
every job seems easier these days in Suwanee, where the Falcons
have the best first-half record in their 33 years, and they're
standing shoulder to shoulder with the 49ers atop the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround is difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineups are virtually the same as the ones that
started 1-7 last year. The only offensive changes are rookie right
tackle Ephraim Salaam instead of Matt Willig and wide receiver Tony
Martin for Bert Emanuel.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ball, former Seahawk and Packer free
safety Eugene Robinson, 35, was signed to be the defensive
``quarterback,'' and Shane Dronett, a reserve last year, has
replaced departed free-agent defensive tackle Dan Owens. Craig
Sauer, who had 21 tackles his first two seasons, has replaced
injured linebacker Henri Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, running back Jamal Anderson is having a great
season. He is third in the NFL with 862 rushing yards (4.6-yard
average), has scored four touchdowns and has caught 16 passes for
215 yards and a TD. He has a lot to do with the Falcons leading the
league in average time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   People love to point out that the Falcons have played a soft
schedule, with their six wins coming against teams that have gone
12-36. It hasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important ingredient in the Falcon success has been
their collective mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude from last year (at) this time to now is totally
different,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``Our expectations are greater,
the excitement is greater, the whole feeling is much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comfort zone is better between last year and this year,''
he said, ``of being familiar with each other, coaches with players
and players with coaches, in terms of understanding what your
strengths are and what your weakness are and preparing to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of players that don't get a lot of
recognition, but they do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The players feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis, in his fifth year as a Falcon, has
seen it two ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a lot of superstars, guys you see on magazine
covers and billboards,'' Mathis said. ''We have a lot of role
players. But (before the middle of last season), guys didn't know
their roles. Nobody knew if they were supposed to be a superstar or
what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now what we can do, and we believe we can win. We may
slip once in a while, but not often.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler (92-of-179, 51.4 percent, 12 TDs,
seven interceptions, 86.8 passer rating) is only slightly off the
pace of last season, when his 95.1 passer rating was second in the
NFL, but Reeves would prefer nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Chandler has probably been the biggest surprise,''
Reeves said. ``When we traded for him (before last season), I can
tell you I had no idea he was as good a quarterback as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, this team still has weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   With Chandler at the helm, the Falcons are averaging 29.9
points, but there is a tremendous dropoff to his backups, Steve
DeBerg, 44, and second-year pro Tony Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line has been strong in the running game, but it
has surrendered 31 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   There is little depth on either line of scrimmage. On offense,
rookie Bob Hallen is the backup guard and rookie Jose Portilla is
the backup tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have little depth behind Anderson, who has 93.3
percent of the rushing yards by running backs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six games, the secondary allowed 11 passing plays
of 33 or more yards, six plays of 56 or more yards. In the past two
games, however, the longest passing plays have been 26 and 22
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's defense is ranked just 23rd in the NFL, but it has
forced 18 turnovers, including 13 fumbles, and the Falcons'
turnover ratio of plus-five is tied for sixth in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Robinson looked dubious for a while. He was slow
to make plays the first five or six games, and he lacks some of the
speed he had a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But his value comes in the mental edge he can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, bringing in Eugene Robinson has helped,'' Reeves
said. ``Here's a guy who has been to the Super Bowl, and what he
brings to the table just in leadership -- when he says something,
people listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been winning by holding onto the ball, chewing up
the clock, playing well against the run (No. 4 in the NFL), and
scoring in the red zone (12 touchdowns and nine field goals in 23
possessions inside the 20).
</P>
<P>
   But the next two games, Sunday at New England (5-3) and Nov. 15
at home against San Francisco (6-2), might tell more about the
Falcons than the last 16 and all those stats combined.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Lester Archambeau like the team's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a big difference in talent level in the NFL (from
one team to the next),'' he said. ``But having consistency with
your coaches, and faith in your teammates is very important. We
understand what we're trying to do, and everybody knows their roles
and understands what's expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (of) that breeds confidence.''

 &HT;    Fate of loved ones worrisome in wake of Mitch
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ The messages pour without end into the
cramped, second-floor offices of Honduras This Week, an
English-language newspaper based in the capital of this devastated
country.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Gutierrez Sr., the editor, receives no fewer than 150
e-mails a day. The messages come from the United States, from
Europe, even New Zealand, and they are plaintive and desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whom it may concern,'' reads one. ``I need your help in
finding my brother('s) daughter to find out if she okay (cq) and if
she could please call home. Her name is Stephanie Cumba. She is 8
years old. ... Please, if anyone out there could go to her and tell
her that her daddy is very worried to please call us at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez can do nothing. Lifting a piece of paper from his desk
Wednesday, he read the handwritten numbers listing the best
information his newpaper has on the destruction wreaked last week
by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one really knows the precise numbers, Honduran
officials estimated their country's death toll at 7,000 on
Wednesday. Some 6,000 to 11,000 people were missing. As many as 1
million to 1.4 million are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   And across Central America, the toll is higher _ an estimated
9,000 dead in all.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of numbers like that, Gutierrez cannot wander out
into the devastation trying to locate a single person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you tell me where is Sarah?'' he asked, raising his hands
and letting them fall helplessly against his legs. ``I cannot
handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is this week a nation in shock.
</P>
<P>
   A revived Mitch was expected to hit South Florida today as a
fast-moving tropical storm, bringing 4 to 8 inches of rain before
heading toward the Bahamas. Mitch had sustained winds of 45 mph
Wednesday when it was 250 miles west of Cuba, producing rain and
winds to the island.
</P>
<P>
   But this is nothing like the powerful storm Mitch was when it
hit this region.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the damage in Honduras cannot be assessed
because travel is nearly impossible. At least 93 major bridges
collapsed. Much of the country is inaccessable by road.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Honduran cities are like islands,'' said Mario Gutierrez
Jr., the editor's son.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is clear: People will not be able to pick up,
rebuild and put this country back together in a month or even a
year. Gutierrez Jr. estimated that, with the infrastructure wiped
out, it will take Honduras at least 10 years to get back to where
it was last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the major problem is to get food and medicine
to people who are stranded _ something that often can be done only
by air. But the secondary problem is that, with roads out, even
areas that survived without major damage cannot be resupplied with
food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, the capital, some areas were devasted while
others made it through intact. But there was fear Wednesday, even
in unscathed areas, that food and fuel will run out within days.
Gasoline and food sit in Honduran ports. But there is no way to
truck them into the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Lines formed at grocery stores Wednesday. And, with gas stations
selling only about $4 of gas to each customer, a line of cars
waiting to drive into a downtown Esso station stretched for blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, there is fear that the storm dealt the
economy a near-fatal blow. Seventy percent of the country's crops
are estimated to have been destroyed. Commerce simply cannot be
conducted. Still, the most immediate concern for many is the fate
of the people they love. And the messages keep pouring into the
newspaper offices. Every time Gutierrez checks, he finds more:
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, I am worried about my friends in the village of
Armenia Bonita,'' e-mailed a woman from San Francisco. ''Any news
about the welfare of the village ... would be greatly
appreciated.'' Officials say the full number of people who died in
the storm will never be known. But this, said Gutierrez Jr., is
``the worst tragedy that has ever hit in Honduras.

COURT HEARS SELECTIVE DEPORTATION ARGUMENT BY `L.A. EIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the government's effort to deport a group of
supporters of the Palestinian cause now approaching its 12th year,
the Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on whether the seven
Palestinians and one Kenyan are entitled to go before a federal
court with their claim that they were unconstitutionally selected
for deportation because of their political views and lawful
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 law, Congress cut back sharply on judicial review of
actions by immigration officials. Where deportation is concerned,
the new law made explicit a limitation that the government had
viewed as inherent in the old law: that judicial review was
confined to appeal of a final order of deportation, and that during
the years that often precede the final order, aliens were
restricted to bringing much more truncated administrative appeals
that could not address constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable confusion in the courtroom on Wednesday
over the extent to which the new law applied to this long-running
dispute and over what difference a ruling would make for future
cases, to which the new provisions would clearly apply. Several
justices appeared to be looking for some safety valve, a way to
interpret the law to make sure aliens would not be effectively
forced to forfeit their constitutional arguments. The lower federal
courts have begun examining the new law and have been restricting
or striking down various provisions intended to cut off judicial
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no review is available of these constitutional claims, it
might influence our interpretation of the statute,'' Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor told Malcolm Stewart, an assistant solicitor general.
Stewart was defending the government's position that the lower
federal courts should not have blocked the deportation proceedings,
as they have repeatedly done in this case, to enable the
Palestinians to collect more evidence to bolster their argument of
selective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But other justices expressed impatience with allowing
constitutional arguments to stand in the way of moving swiftly
toward deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that these amendments were intended to prevent
exactly what's happening here,'' Justice Antonin Scalia said,
referring to the new law and addressing David Cole, the
Palestinians' lawyer. ``Everybody knows this is the name of the
game: String it out, and the longer it's strung out, the less
likely deportation will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, a Georgetown University law professor handling this case
on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York
City-based legal organization, replied that it was the government,
and not his clients, that was prolonging the case through repeated
appeals of the Palestinians' incremental legal victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is,'' Cole said, ``we're the ones seeking
expeditious resolution at every stage.'' He said that the longer
the case dragged on, the longer his clients remained ``chilled'' in
exercising their First Amendment rights to free speech and
political association.
</P>
<P>
   The group, often referred to as the ``L.A. Eight,'' supports the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the government
regards as a terrorist organization. But no member of the group has
been charged with any act of violence. Several were students when
the case began, and were charged with offenses like not taking
enough college credits to maintain their student visas or for
holding jobs not authorized by their immigration status. In their
selective enforcement claim, they are arguing that other aliens
with similar visa problems but lacking similar political
associations have not been faced with deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sits in San
Francisco, agreed with Cole in a ruling last year that the claim of
selective enforcement should not have to wait until the end of the
deportation process to be heard by a federal court, because the
facts necessary to support the claim could not be adequately
developed through the limited administrative appeals available in
the immigration system.
</P>
<P>
   During the argument on Wednesday, Justice Anthony Kennedy asked
Stewart, the government's lawyer, whether he agreed that the
Palestinians ``can't make in the administrative proceeding the
records necessary to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we concede that,'' Stewart replied. While some useful
evidence might emerge during such a proceeding, ``we can't count on
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Reno vs. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, No. 97-1252.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a second case on Wednesday, the court heard arguments on
whether a public school district in Iowa was obliged under federal
law to provide continuous care in the classroom to a quadriplegic
student who relied on a ventilator to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, schools
must provide special education and ``related services'' to enable
students with disabilities to benefit from an education. But
schools are not required to provide ``medical services.'' The broad
question in this case, Cedar Rapids Community School District vs.
Garrett F., No. 96-1793, is how to define the ``medical services''
exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in St. Louis, ruled in
this case that because the services the boy needed did not have to
be performed by a doctor, they were not medical and so remained the
obligation of the Cedar Rapids school district. In its appeal, the
district is arguing that the continuous, one-on-one nature of the
services, requiring the equivalent of private-duty nursing, met the
medical test even if performed by a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that by any definition, private duty nursing is a
medical service,'' Susan Seitz, the school district's lawyer, told
the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Both the student, represented by Douglas Oelschlaeger, and the
government, represented by Beth Brinkmann, an assistant solicitor
general, urged the court to hold that only those services performed
by a doctor qualify as medical.
</P>
<P>
   The case has attracted considerable attention from other school
districts, faced with rapidly rising costs of special education.
The National School Boards Association filed a brief urging the
court to adopt a broader definition of the medical services for
which a school district would not be responsible.

 &HT;    Rivalry or not, Clemson set to play Georgia Tech
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON vs. Georgia Tech, Nov. 12
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech and Clemson meet next week in a nationally
televised Thursday night game on ESPN. It will be the 63rd meeting
between the two in a series that Tech leads 40-20-2. . . . After
George O'Leary said that he thought that Clemson was Tech's main
rival next to Georgia, Tommy West disagreed. ``I never sensed that
from our players,'' he said. Our in-state rival (South Carolina is
first), and then Georgia has become our second-greatest rival,''
West said. . . . The Tigers can use the extra time off: Defensive
back Antwan Edwards is nursing a hamstring pull, outside linebacker
Adrian Dingle is bothered by a knee and an ankle injury, and
linebacker Terry Bryant is slow coming back from a severe ankle
sprain.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. Maryland, Nov. 14
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Duke coach Fred Goldsmith about the overtime
playoff adopted by college football if the game is tied at the end
of regulation. ``Hey, I'm not a good one to ask,'' he said. Duke
lost an overtime game last season to Clemson and another Saturday
to Vanderbilt. ``It was such a disappointing loss. We came back
from a 30-13 deficit late in the third quarter to tie it up and go
into two overtimes, but the bottom line is we lost the football
game.'' . . .Duke receiver Richmond Flowers was credited with a
catch in the Vanderbilt game, but he wasn't even in uniform. The
sophomore was on the sidelines recovering from an appendectomy. . .
. Another Duke receiver, Scottie Montgomery, suffered a separated
shoulder against Vanderbilt, but Goldsmith says he'll be ready for
Duke's next game Nov. 14 against Maryland.

   FLORIDA STATE vs. Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Although Virginia has only one loss and is ranked No. 12,
Florida State is still a 17-point favorite. FSU coach Bobby Bowden
doesn't want to hear it. ``Virginia is playing too good to suit me
right now,'' he said. ``They come out and jump on everybody they
play. They're the most physical team we've seen. I wonder how in
the world are we going to score against them.'' Bowden also says
the Cavaliers runs tough. . ``Virginia has got as good a running
attack as anybody in the country. Virginia lines up, says 'Hey,
here we come,' and runs at you. We're not anywhere near as physical
as they are. We're quick, but we're not as physical. They could
beat us.'' . . . Bowden did acknowledge that receiver Peter Warrick
has come into his own. ``The last two or three weeks, he's suddenly
catching the ball much better.''

   MARYLAND at North Carolina, Saturday, noon

   When you're bad, it's difficult to find positive things to talk
about, but Maryland head coach Ron Vanderlinden pointed out that
things are improving. ``Our defense has improved 49 positions (in
the NCAA standings) from last year,'' he said. ``We have moved up
51 slots in rushing. Our system is developing our running game, but
we just need to make some yards through the air. Our inability to
make the big plays with our passing game is killing us. We're
playing a freshman quarterback (in Randall Jones), and he's not the
type of player who's going to drop back and throw it 25 or 30 times
a game.'' . . . Vanderlinden said about playing Carolina: ``We know
the things that are causing them problems, but I'm not sure we're
in a position to exploit them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA vs. Maryland, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels entertain Maryland, and coach Carl Torbush says
he's still considering whether to start senior Oscar Davenport or
freshman Ronald Curry at quarterback. ``To tell you the truth, we
haven't discussed it a great deal. Both quarterbacks are taking the
same number of snaps in practice. We will probably make the
decision by Thursday.'' . . . Carolina found a running game over
the past few weeks, with freshman Rufus Brown. ``Rufus is our
starting tailback,'' Torbush said. The Tar Heels will be helped by
the return of leading kickoff returner Tyrell Godwin, who's been
out with a leg injury and can help at tailback. . . . . . . . One
twist in the Carolina-Maryland game: Terps starting tailback LaMont
Jordan wanted to go to North Carolina, but UNC had three tailbacks
already committed.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE vs. Wake Forest, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack closes its home season Saturday against Wake
Forest. ``We're looking forward to playing our last home game of
the season and having a chance for 20 seniors to go out on a
positive note,'' coach Mike O'Cain said. ``These seniors came in in
1994, saw us beat Mississippi State in the Peach Bowl, and then
went through some tough times (in consecutive 3-8 seasons). . . .
O'Cain also said, ``This Wake Forest team is a much better team
than their record indicates. Obviously, this is an important game,
a huge game, for us since we're going for our sixth win and, if we
get it, would be eligible to play in a bowl game.'' . . . The
Wolfpack has only one turnover in the last three games and is
second in the ACC, 13th nationally in turnover margin. . . . Torry
Holt is third all-time in ACC receiving-yardage (2,934).
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA at Florida State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   George Welsh says his team needs to get to FSU quarterback Chris
Weinke in Saturday's game. ``We need to make a little better effort
on our pass rush,'' Welsh said. ``Everybody is throwing all these
passes against us. Most of the year, we've had enough depth. I
don't know what the problem is.'' . . . Otherwise, Welsh says
playing in Tallahassee poses no additional problem. ``Most of these
players have been down there before. This is an experienced
football team..'' . . . Does Virginia have a plan for slowing down
the combination of Weinke to Peter Warrick? ``We've had some things
we're looking at, but I'm not going to discuss it. We had some
different things we did against (N.C. State's) Torry Holt, but we
can't do the same thing against Warrick; they'll be ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST at N.C. State, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons, 2-3 in the ACC and 3-5 overall, bear little
resemblance to the team picked by most people to finish toward the
top of the conference. ``We're just trying to find a way to get a
win, to get over the hump,'' coach Jim Caldwell said. ``Last year
(against N.C. State) was just a tough defensive battle. We're both
different teams this year. Obviously, Torry Holt has played well
against every team. He's just eaten them alive. No one has
double-teamed him consistently (for) the entire ball game. We know
he's going to catch some passes on us. We have to put pressure on
Jamie Barnette, try to get close to him.'' . . . ACC all-time
pass-catching leader Desmond Clark suffered a slight MCL sprain to
his left knee last week against Virginia and is doubtful for N.C.
State.

 &HT;    FAMU QB out front for new award
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida A&AMP;M quarterback Pat Bonner is the front-runner
to win the first Eddie Robinson player of the year award sponsored
by Street &AMP; Smith's.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound senior, has started six games for
the Rattlers (7-1), who lead Division I-AA in scoring. The Temple
University transfer has completed 185 of 287 passes for 2,505
yards, a school-record 28 touchdowns and only six interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The award will be presented by Robinson in a ceremony at the
Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta on Dec. 26, the same day of the
McDonald's Heritage Bowl at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Big turnaround
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State, after an 0-3 start, has won five of its last six.
In those games, the Tigers have averaged 46.6 points, while junior
tailback Destry Wright has become the leading rusher in the SWAC
with 1,184 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State (5-4) is almost certain to provide coach James
Carson with his seventh non-losing record; Prairie View is next on
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Big turnaround II
</P>
<P>
   In the annual Magic City Classic, witnessed by 56,437 at
Birmingham's Legion Field this past weekend, Alabama State trailed
rival Alabama A&AMP;M 28-0 in the third period before qarterback
Darnell Kennedy and wide receiver Damon Hodge led Alabama State to
a 34-28 overtime victory. Kennedy, the SWAC's leading passer, hit
on 28 of 43 attempts for 333 yards and two touchdowns. Hodges, the
conference's leading receiver, pulled down 17 of Kennedy's passes
for 224 yards and a TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of game is a stepping-stone for our program,'' said
Alabama State coach Ron Dickerson, whose Hornets (3-5) head to
Grambling on Saturday seeking their third victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Officials disciplined
</P>
<P>
   Four MEAC officials were fired after the supervisor of officials
ruled they missed a critical call that led to the winning score in
last weekend's William &AMP; Mary-Hampton game. Umpire Leon Jones,
field judge Wayne Randall, side judge Wayne Owens and back judge
Keith Washington were fired, MEAC spokesman Bradford Evans said,
and referee Ralph Wilson, linesman George Moran and line judge Tod
Reese were reassigned. The MEAC supervisor of officials, Johnny
Grier, reviewed a tape of the game and concluded the officials
erred in allowing the final touchdown in the 41-34 game.
</P>
<P>
   With about three minutes remaining and the score tied 34-34,
William &AMP; Mary receiver Chris Rosier caught a pass near midfield
and was immediately tackled. The side judge, believing Rosier was
not down, did not blow his whistle. Rosier jumped up and ran for a
touchdown, and the Tribe won.
</P>
<P>
   CIAA notes
</P>
<P>
   Virginia State (2-6), recent loser to rival Virginia Union (7-2)
in the annual Gold Bowl, has two receivers who have combined for
137 catches and 1781 yards _ sophomore Damon Thompson (69) and
senior Desmond Thornton (68). ... Junior defensive back Roderick
Williams of surprising Bowie State (6-2) has picked off seven
passes and returned one of them for a TD.

 &HT;    Alabama, LSU match up Saturday
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALABAMA at LSU, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zow's 361-yard passing performance against Southern
Mississippi was the sixth-best in school history. Zow, who
completed 26 of 35 passes, gave notice that he intends to hold off
highly touted freshman Tyler Watts when the two battle for the job
next spring. ... Linebacker Travis Carroll is still questionable
for Saturday's game with LSU. Carroll has a bruised right shoulder.
... With Zow playing so well, coach Mike DuBose is trying to find a
way to get backup John David Phillips on the field. Phillips has
played wide receiver during his career. The problem? If Zow and
Phillips both get hurt, the Tide might be forced to play Watts, who
is scheduled to be redshirted. ... Alabama has not lost at LSU
since 1969. ... Receiver Shamari Buchanan is out for the year after
fracturing his collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS vs. Mississippi, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas coaches say fourth down will be crucial when the
Razorbacks host Ole Miss. The Rebels have converted 10 of 19
fourth-down opportunities, which ranks No. 3 in the SEC. Arkansas
has stopped all but one of seven fourth-down plays against its
defense. ... Arkansas has moved into 11th place in the Bowl
Championship Series Standings. ... Right guard Brandon Burlsworth
is starting to pop up on some All-America lists. ... Tailback Rod
Stinson will be pressed into duty as a defensive back because of
injuries. Starting rover Zac Painter (shoulder) and bandit Jeromy
Flowers (knee) did not practice early in the week. ... QB Clint
Stoerner needs two touchdown passes to equal Quinn Grovey's school
record of 18.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN vs. Central Florida, Saturday, 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn reported five possible NCAA violations during the
coaching tenure of Terry Bowden, but none was a factor in Bowden's
resignation Oct. 23, according to a report in the Montgomery
Advertiser. ... Athletics director David Housel will be in charge
of a search committee that will hire the school's next football
coach. ``A word to the wise _ lobbying efforts will be
counterproductive,'' Housel said. ``The cream rises to the top on
its own, not with lobbying efforts.'' ... Interim coach Bill Oliver
defended his decision to fire offensive coordinator Rodney Allison.
``I recommended it, and, as is everything I've ever done, I've done
it for the welfare of the team,'' Oliver said. ``Let me tell you
something. Do you think it's been easy to take this thing over? You
have to do what you feel is right, that's the only way it will
work.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA at Vanderbilt, Saturday, 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Florida fullback Rod Frazier, who sprained a knee in Saturday's
game with Georgia, is out for the season. ... Because of
Vanderbilt's artificial surface, running back Terry Jackson will be
given another week to rest his injured ankle. Jackson dressed for
the Georgia game but did not play. ... Freshman Rob Roberts moves
into the starting fullback slot. ... Senior cornerback Tony George
was named SEC defensive player of the week for his performance in
the 38-7 win over Georgia. ... The game at Vanderbilt will be
Florida's first on artificial turf since the 1996 national
championship game against Florida State in the Sugar Bowl. ...
Quarterback Jesse Palmer is recovering nicely from his injured
clavicle. He is expected to be available for the Gators' bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY vs. Mississippi State, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Jeremy Streck was held out of practice last week
and is expected to be ready for Saturday's game with Mississippi
State. ... The Wildcats also are hoping that strong safety David
Johnson will return after a toe injury. ... Offensive tackle Jonas
Liening had surgery on his broken left leg and will be lost for the
season. He will be replaced by redshirt freshman Matt Brown. ...
Reserve linebacker Gus Jacobs is out for the season with torn knee
ligaments. ... Kentucky (5-3) needs to win one of its final three
games against Mississippi State, Vanderbilt, and Tennessee to
become eligible for bowls. Kentucky easily could have won two of
the games it lost, Arkansas (27-20) and Georgia (28-26). ``They
have really risen to every occasion,'' coach Hal Mumme said about
his players.
</P>
<P>
   LSU vs. Alabama, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With LSU at 4-4, coach Gerry DiNardo is taking full blame for
Saturday's 37-31 overtime loss to Mississippi. The Tigers fell
behind 28-10 at the half. ``I really believe I didn't have them
ready to play. I don't know why, yet.'' ... The three teams left on
LSU's schedule _ Alabama, Notre Dame, Arkansas _ have a combined
record of 18-4. The Tigers must win two of the three games to
qualify for a bowl. ... LSU's defense is last in the SEC against
the pass (267 yards per game) and 11th overall (393 ypg). ... A
year ago, LSU's defense was No. 1 in the SEC in points allowed per
game (16.2) under defensive coordinator Carl Reese. Reese, however,
went to Texas, and now the Tigers, under Lou Tepper, are No. 8 at
22.1 points per game. In its four losses to Georgia, Florida,
Kentucky and Ole Miss, the defense gave up 1,954 yards.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI at Arkansas, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, Rebel coach Tommy Tuberville likes the
NCAA's overtime format. Ole Miss has won two of its three overtime
games this season. The Rebels trailed SMU 41-19 with 12 minutes
left and rallied to win in overtime. ``You don't hold anything
back; you take chances in overtime,''Tuberville said. Tuberville
has won three of his four career OT games. ... The Rebels (6-2) are
enjoying their best start since 1990, when they were 7-1. It has
been a surprise to Tuberville. ``I had us fighting at the end of
the year to be .500, to be honest with you,'' he said. ... Running
backs Deuce McAllister and Joe Gunn have combined for 1,263 yards
rushing on 250 carries and 12 touchdowns. It is the first time
since 1990 that Ole Miss has had two backs with more than 500 yards
each.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE at Kentucky, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (5-2, 3-1 SEC) had a week off after losing to LSU
on Oct. 24. Despite that loss, Mississippi State still could win
the SEC West. If the Bulldogs win their final four games, they
would play in the SEC championship game. It would be their first
football championship of any kind since 1941. ``For us to win out,
we can't play another game like we did against LSU,'' coach Jackie
Sherrill said. ... There is no mystery about Mississippi State's
strategy for Kentucky quarterback Tim couch. The Bulldogs were one
of only two teams to sack Couch five times last season. MSU won the
game 35-27. Even so, Couch passed for 349 yards and four TDs. ``If
you don't pressure him, he'll pick you apart the whole game,''
linebacker Barrin Simpson said. Kentucky has given up 17 sacks in
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA at Florida, Nov. 14
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks (1-8) have a week off but did get some good news
in a verbal commitment from one of the top place kickers from
Florida. Bryce Harrington from Merritt Island High School chose
South Carolina because of his family ties with former Gamecock
great Dan Reeves, now the Falcons' coach. South Carolina now has
five verbal commitments. ... Teams continue to exploit South
Carolina's limitations in the secondary because of injuries to
safety Arturo Freeman and cornerback Andre Goodman. The Gamecocks
loaded up against Tennessee to stop the run only to have Volunteer
quarterback Tee Martin play a career game, completing 23 passes in
a row. ... South Carolina's eight-game losing streak is its longest
since it fell nine times in a row at the end of 1991 and the
beginning of '92. Boo Williams
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEEPhillip Fulmerthe Vols need to win impressively
Saturday in order to maintain their No. 2 spot in the BCS
standings. UAB has a 2-6 record. ``With the circumstances given to

``We're much more conscious of it than we've ever been.'' ...

 &HT;    Cink aims to rebound from missing East Lake
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ It is not adequate solace for the Tour
Championship spot just eluded. It makes Stewart Cink no less
irritated that the PGA Tour's richest event was conducted last week
at his home course and he squandered an opportunity to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But at least there's the Subaru Sarazen World Open, which
commences with today's first round at Chateau Elan, to provide some
refocus. After wasting a last-minute chance to join the top 30 by a
final-round 76 at Walt Disney on the final day of the PGA Tour's
money-list scrambling, Cink remained too peeved to even set foot on
the East Lake properly last week. He watched only ``an hour or so''
of the telecast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sulking Monday and Tuesday and got it out of my
system,'' Cink said flatly. ``But by Wednesday I got back out
practicing (at the TPC at Sugarloaf). ... I felt like all those
other members feel when we play ... and close their golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink's mindset at the end of this year _ his only other event
will be the J.C. Penney Classic Nov. 30-Dec. 6 _ is to use
finishing 31st on the money list as his incentive for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a real big motivator because I felt the pain there
for a few days of not being able to play and now I'm just ready to
go out next year and get 'em early and qualify for it early and not
have to worry about it,'' Cink said. ``I think it's going to be
good for me in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink's qualification for the Sarazen was a 1997 victory in the
Mexican Open. He tied for 11th last year at 2-under-par 286, with a
closing 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing this tournament and I love this golf course,''
he said Wednesday. ``The greens are always extremely good. It's a
tight course, but there's a lot of thoughtful slopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Tom Cousins, there's probably nobody more delighted than
Cink that the Tour Championship will return to East Lake in two
years. Beyond the minimum $64,000 Cink lost by missing the
tournament, he also dropped a $10 bet to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet that the winning score would be better than 6-under,''
Cink said. ``After Vijay (Singh's) 63 Thursday, I thought I was
looking pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   President Cup additions
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four additions to the two President's Cup teams are
in the Sarazen field _ John Huston of the United States and New
Zealand's Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner. Fred Couples was also added
to the U.S. team by captain Jack Nicklaus. ... Tom Kite, competing
in the Sarazen for the first time as the recipient of a Squire's
Selection, was impressed with the Legends Course's greens and
overall condition. ``I'm kind of amazed by some of the scores I've
seen that have been shot here,'' Kite said. ``There are a lot of
holes here where it's very difficult to get it close to the pin.''
... The weather, which has been cool on more occasions than not
during the five years of the Sarazen, will greatly contrast last
week's unseasonably warm temperatures for the Tour Championship.
Temperatures in the mid to high 50s are expected for the first two
rounds.

 &HT;    Panoz says World Open isn't dead yet
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ Don Panoz is not one to give up easily. While
the Subaru Sarazen World Open officially commences its final
installment with today's first round at Chateau Elan, the event
might not be as dead as it appears.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz met last week with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and
will meet today with European Tour head Ken Schofield to explore
the possibility of continuing the Sarazen in Europe in some form
for the next two years, despite having lost his date to the $5
million World Golf Championship event that begins next November in
Valderrama, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   If details can be worked out, Panoz ideally would run a modified
Sarazen World Open against the WGC event, which is for only the top
50 players from the Official World Rankings. Although Panoz
obviously could not draw those top players who are part of the
current Sarazen field, he still could provide the opportunity for
players outside the top 50 and other national open winners that
have been recognized for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can find a way out of this,'' Panoz said Wednesday.
``I kind of still don't understand their resistance to it. There's
going to be a lot of golfers in the world that are professionals
that aren't going to be in the world stroke play event that would
love to have a chance to play a tournament where there's still a
lot of money involved. That's what we need to investigate. If I
could find a home for it where we could maintain the format and
integrity of the tournament, I would be happy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sarazen, 96, who helped begin the world golf movement as
host of the ``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf'' shows in the 1960s,
said this week, ``I think the World Open belongs in Europe after
this. I think this tournament has done more for world golf than any
tournament that's played during the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Craig Stadler, who has played in all five
Sarazen Opens, figure there's a market for both a WGC event and
Panoz's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully something will be worked out where it continues in
some venue,'' Stadler said. ``I don't know whether it will be a
full-field event or a special event or something like that, but it
is a great place to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The WGC tournament will be played at Chateau Elan in 2001 after
two years in Spain with the ``Sarazen Cup'' as the hardware, but
will not be connected with the current Subaru Sarazen World Open.
Prior to last year's announcement, it was speculated that the
Sarazen basically would evolve into the WGC event _ not be knocked
off the schedule by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have embodied the principles of the Sarazen into
the world stroke play event and had everything going for it,''
Panoz said. ``I hate to see it kind of end up that way. I'm still
not giving up.

VENTURA WRESTLES WITH REALIZATION HE'S WON GOVERNORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. PAUL, inn. _ As his first official act, governor-elect Jesse
Ventura did not legalize eye poking, order the arrest of Hulk
Hogan, or mandate that his trademark feather boas be added to state
police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the former professional wrestler sat for a moment
Wednesday in a black leather chair in a temporary office in the
Minnesota Statehouse. And then, for the cameras, he made an
elaborate show of organizing a stack of paper and placing it near a
phone.
</P>
<P>
   He declared the menial task ``my first official act,'' then
flashed the menancing grin that made him a villain in the ring and
a champion in the election booth. It was a potent smile: Enough
Minnesotans liked Ventura and his brand of policy-light,
populism-heavy politics to elect him over two major-party
candidates with brand names and long records of achievement, though
neither has ever thrown a 300-pound man into a row of folding
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ventura swept through a throng of reporters and out to the
Statehouse steps. After a few more questions, a few more smiles, a
few more glints of sun off his shaved pate, it was ``gotta go''
from the huge man with the gravel voice, the dimpled chin and the
double-breasted suit he would gladly have exchanged for a leather
biker jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of a new era for Minnesota politics. On the
surface at least, it looked nothing like the earnest, civic-minded
regularity of the past, featuring gray-suited men longer on policy
than pizzazz, men like Eugene McCarthy, Walter Mondale and Hubert
H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts, supported by exit polls, said Ventura won a
plurality by attracting voters male and female, young and old, with
a magnetic personality and a plain-spoken message of tax cuts and
social tolerance, amplified by a backlash against professional
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those professionals were his victims: Attorney General
Hubert ``Skip'' Humphrey III, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate
and son of the former vice president, and Republican Norm Coleman,
mayor of St. Paul. Humphrey spent Wednesday raking leaves at home;
Coleman went to work at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected outcome _ pre-election polls placed Ventura a
distant third _ unleashed a metaphorical torrent, as headline
writers twisted the language into unnatural positions to describe
the jolt his victory gave to Minnesota politics. ``Body slam'' was
a favorite choice.
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface, however, there were signs that even when he
was quoting songwriters Jim Morrison and Jerry Garcia, the
47-year-old Ventura did not quite fit his detractors' caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Though he campaigned as an independent outsider under the banner
of the Reform Party created by H. Ross Perot, Ventura is not far
from the mainstream here: He is a moderate on social issues who
supports abortion rights and protections for gays and lesbians; and
he is an anti-tax fiscal conservative whose ``Retaliate in '98''
slogan was a shot at incumbent lawmakers' failure to return to
taxpayers a $4 billion state surplus.
</P>
<P>
   There was no escaping his wrestling days _ his ring persona of
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura was a scheming bad guy who hated heroic
Hulk Hogan and draped his trunk-like neck in a feather boa. But
Ventura, born James Janos, attracted voters with his real-life
story and a new nickname, ``The Mind.'' He is a veteran who was an
elite Navy SEAL; a married father of two; a successful businessman;
a plain-spoken everyman with street smarts if not a college degree.
He also spent five years as mayor of suburban Brooklyn Park, a job
he sought after he became angry over a zoning decision.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Ventura on display earlier Wednesday, during a
Statehouse appearance with outgoing Governor Arne Carlson, a
two-term Republican. Standing before a marble fireplace in the
Governor's Reception Room, the showpiece of Minnesota's opulent
Italian Renaissance-style Statehouse, Ventura tried to be the
picture of the solid, temperate governor-elect.
</P>
<P>
   He said his top priority was to begin work on the state's
two-year budget. He downplayed concerns about being a Reform Party
governor with a Republican-controlled House and a
Democrat-Farmer-Labor-controlled Senate. He said he has not decided
whether to live in the governor's mansion. Previously, he said he
would only serve one term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a rebel. I'm a veteran of this country. I support the
government,'' he said. ``I'm not coming on board to create some
sort of rebellion here. I'm here to make Minnesota the best state
it can be with my political philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   But now and then, the old Ventura slipped out from the tailored
suit and into the tight shorts of his wrestling and B-movie past.
Placing his hand on a six-inch stack of government manuals Carlson
had prepared for him, Ventura quoted a movie title, saying: ``I
feel a little bit like Rodney Dangerfield. It's time to go `Back to
School.''' And later, asked what message voters sent by electing
him, he shot back brusquely: ``Ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dashed into a sparkling white Lincoln Town Car and
rushed across town to host his sports-radio talk show. His first
caller was the owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves (``I got a rich
guy on the phone. And I don't owe him nothin'!''). All the
soon-to-be-governor wanted to know was: ``When the hell are we
going to see some basketball?'' His live audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Ventura won the election
with 37 percent of the vote, versus 34 percent for Coleman and 28
percent for Humphrey. Both outspent Ventura by wide margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the campaign is still in shock and disbelief. Nobody's
polling showed Jesse Ventura as much of a threat,'' said Terry Lee,
communications director for Humphrey's campaign. Around her were
the detritus of a failed campaign: boxes of signs, banners,
pamphlets and pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said discontent was clearly in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura tapped into the sentiment that the managed quality of
politics and politics in general is a sales job and it's
condescending,'' said Harry Boyte, director of the Center for
Democracy and Citizenship at the Humphrey Institute of Public
Affairs at the University of Minnesota. ``This was an election to
send a message to the political class, both left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   A simpler explanation came from J.D. Ford, a 9-year-old boy
whose mother brought him to the Statehouse Wednesday. As Ventura
was leaving, he shot a smile in J.D.'s direction.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing he owned an action figure of Minnesota's next governor,
J.D. said, ``He's cool.''

CELLUCCI URGES RECONSIDERATION OF CLINTON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stung by what he feels is his national party's role in
creating the Democratic tide that swept the country and nearly
defeated him, Governor Paul Cellucci has called on Republican
leaders in Washington to change their course, including rethinking
their drive to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Wednesday Congressional party leaders must do some
``soul searching'' and take responsibility for Tuesday's debacle.
He said Republican governors now have to step forward and provide
the party its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in his State House office, Cellucci blamed
the GOP Congressional leaders not only for his unexpected close
call Tuesday but also for the defeat of William F. Weld's bid for
the US Senate and the state's only two Republican congressmen in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Weld could have won that senate race if there hadn't been
that big tidal wave for Bill Clinton,'' said Cellucci whose aides
privately say is furious with what he feels is the political
arrogance of the party's Congressional leaders and its failure to
understand how it has hurt local and state elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, two years later, a non-presidential election year, there
seems to be a backlash against Republicans around the country that
I think hurt us here in Massachusetts'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci headed into Tuesday's elections with most polls showing
him with a strong lead over his Democratic opponent Scott
Harshbarger, but for several very anxious hours before the polls
closed, it appeared from exit-surveys of voters that the Democrat
would upset him.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst say the unexpected voting results were shaped by a
backlash from an energized Democratic base and other independent
voters who were reacting to Republican attempts to impeach
President Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair while leaving the
impression they were ignoring other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with the final tally giving him a 51 percent to 47
percent lead -- a respectable four percentage margin -- Cellucci
was ready to do battle with his national party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to have do some soul searching down in
Washington, particularly the Congressional leadership,'' Cellucci
said. ``It is pretty clear that there was some backlash. Some
decisions were made that were not right for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after election, Cellucci and his aides were still
assessing the ruble created by the Democratic sweep. It has cut the
already small band of Massachusetts House Republicans from 28 to 26
in the 160-member body. The GOP was blocked from making possible
gains over their seven seats in the 40-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two relatively strong Republican congressional candidates were
also trounced by incumbent Democrats in the Sixth and Fourth
districts. The GOP candidates for the state constitutional officers
were beaten by large margins.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Cellucci's concern with national party leaders
is less over the impeachment proceedings than the their failure to
act on several fundamental issues that had impact on Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they say that for several weeks, Cellucci had
personally lobbied the GOP led congress, including Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, to pass a bill to extend the coverage seniors
currently get -- but were cut in a federal court ruling -- in their
health insurance for prescription drugs. When Trott refused to act,
Cellucci was furious, those aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just emblematic of just how tone deaf they are,'' said
one top Cellucci aide. ``They can't get out of their own way. It is
ludicrous how they could bungle a sex scandal in the oval office
into a negative.''
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference, Cellucci said he planned to use a
national Republican governors meeting in New Orleans in two week as
a forum to build a coalition of his colleagues to deliver a strong
message to the party leadership about its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor said the national party should rely more on
its governors, who he said are dealing with issues that resonate
with voters -- education, crime, welfare reform and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci stopped short of calling on the Congressional GOP
leaders to halt the House impeachment inquiry. He said those
efforts should be re-evaluated in light of the damage it caused the
party in Tuesday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to have to determine whether they are
on the proper course here,'' the acting governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the Congressional leadership made a mistake by
airing a campaign ad that drew attention to Clinton's sex scandal
that the congressional

ABORTION ISSUE WORKS IN FAVOR OF WOMEN'S-RIGHTS CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of all the political ads in the
multimillion-dollar barrage on New York television, the one
featuring Emily Lyons may be remembered the longest and credited
with doing the most damage to Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be the same again,'' said Lyons, a registered
nurse who was maimed last January when a bomb exploded in the
Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic where she worked. The ad, paid
for by an abortion-rights group, targeted D'Amato's 1994 vote
against legislation to give federal protection to abortion
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato got trounced Tuesday in his bid for a fourth term by
Democratic Representative Charles Schumer, and D'Amato's opposition
to abortion rights, cast against the Oct. 23 murder of New York
abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian, appeared to be one factor in
his defeat, analysts said. Schumer supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It walked voters right to Schumer,'' said Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which paid for the Lyons ad. ``After all his years of
aggressive assaults on a woman's right to choose, D'Amato has
finally paid the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights activists found a lot to cheer about Wednesday
as the abortion issue appeared to help, and in some races be
decisive, for candidates who support a women's right to an
abortion. They also hailed the defeats of ballot initiatives in
Colorado and Washington state that would have banned certain
late-term abortion procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Their adversaries in the anti-abortion movement were just as
adamant that despite the electoral setbacks, Republicans in
Congress would not retreat from efforts to end or limit abortions.
And they maintained that candidates who oppose abortion rights can
still depend on support from an army of single-issue voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Wednesday's election results were not as good as we had
hoped, pro-lifers are happy that we continue to hold a pro-life
Congress,'' said Carol Long, director of the National Right to Life
Committee's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, antiabortion forces lost as many as 10 seats
Tuesday, according to the Long. In the Senate, the balance of votes
for and against abortion rights didn't shift much, a disappointment
to those who hoped for the three more votes needed to override
President Clinton's veto of the bill banning late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Governor-elect Gray Davis and Senator
Barbara Boxer prevailed over their Republican foes, partly by
relentlessly labeling them as extremists for opposing abortion
rights. Boxer made a big issue of a $50,000 contribution that her
challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong, made to the Traditional
Values Coalition, an antiabortion group.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Democratic Senator Patty Murray appealed to
women to reject her opponent, GOP Representative Linda Smith,
because of her opposition to abortion rights. Murray won, carrying
61 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Democrat Blanche Lincoln won the open Senate seat
with backing from abortion-rights activists, who targeted state
Senator Fay Boozman, her GOP opponent. Boozman, an eye surgeon,
created a controversy when he suggested rape victims don't need
abortion rights because certain hormonal reactions protect them
from pregnancy during violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Governor Parris Glendening warned voters not to
believe Republican Ellen Sauerbrey when she promised her own
antiabortion views would not influence her policy making. With the
help of a huge gender gap, Glendening beat Sauerbrey more soundly
than he did in 1994, when Sauerbrey was harsher on the abortion
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates who support abortion rights defeated
incumbent Senator Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina and
Representative Mark Neumann in his Wisconsin Senate challenge _
both Republicans and abortion foes. But two Republicans who made
issues of their opposition to abortion rights _ Peter Fitzgerald in
Illinois and Representative Jim Bunning in Kentucky _ won Senate
seats Tuesday. Fitzgerald beat Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, a
favorite of abortion-rights and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion was not an issue that necessarily harmed Republicans
in 1998,'' said Linda DiVall, a GOP pollster. ``A number of
pro-life candidates ran and won, and Mark Neumann, while he lost,
made real strides on the abortion issue. In California, it does
look like abortion moved voters against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, president of the Republican Coalition for Choice,
said the most significant result of Tuesday's elections was that no
incumbent GOP senator, House member, or governor who supports
abortion rights was defeated. Wednesday, in a letter to Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, she
implored GOP leaders to moderate the party's platform plank
opposing abortion rights before the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abortion issue and now family-planning issues are
hampering Republicans' ability to reach out to a broader audience
and, I fear, will impede our success at capturing the White House
in 2000,'' Cullman wrote. ``Women continue to turn their backs on
the Republican Party because they believe (it) wants to take away
their ability to control their own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiabortion groups Wednesday pledged to redouble their efforts
in the 106th Congress to pass two measures that stalled in the
105th: legislation to ban so-called partial-birth abortions, and a
bill to make it a federal crime to take a minor across state lines
for an abortion to avoid parental consent or notification
requirments.
</P>
<P>
   For the GOP Congress to back off on either one, said Douglas
Johnson, lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, ``would
be the very wrong response, and not what I expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the first time in three elections, abortion-rights
advocates said they were encouraged that candidates weren't afraid
to run on the issue or label their opponents as out of the
mainstream for opposing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a real victory for pro-choice America,'' said Michelman,
whose group put $2 million into this fall's races. ``While the
House and Senate remain in control of anti-choice majorities, it's
Republicans who have the problem. Their position causes schisms in
the party and puts them fundamentally out &UR;  &LR; of step with most
voters.''

WITH VISION BLURRED, GINGRICH FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Texas, N.Y., Okla, Ind., La., Wash., Ohio, Fla.,
Utah) (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do
well. The planning. The strategy. The big picture. The vision.
</P>
<P>
   His vision brought the GOP to the majority in Congress in 1994
and made him the first Republican House Speaker in 40 years. But by
his own admission, Gingrich's vision seems to have blurred this
time around, costing Republicans a net of five seats in Tuesday's
election and leaving the party's narrow governing majority even
narrower.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing election results also left Gingrich open to a
fractious challenge for his post as speaker. Members and aides said
Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and
that some members were trying to organize a slate of candidates to
replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans
convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., put it, ``When a company's stock
price goes down, it's usually the CEO who gets fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Top Republican aides, speaking anonymously, were even blunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very angry last night,'' one aide said. ``Today
it's a mixture of seething and dismay. It's just ugly. And Newt
knows it. His career is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aide said, ``Most people are really angry with Newt, and
no one knows what to do with it. But some are dipping their toe in
the water and seeing what the temperature is.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible slate could contain the names of Reps. Robert L.
Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich, Steve Largent of
Oklahoma to replace Dick Armey of Texas as majority leader, and
Jennifer Dunn of Washington to replace John A. Boehner of Ohio as
conference chairman. Rep. David M. McIntosh of Indiana is also said
to be considering a run for speaker, but it was not clear whether
he would be part of any slate. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
majority whip, was said to be secure.
</P>
<P>
   Armey bluntly acknowledged the scramble going on in the wings to
oust the leadership. Told on ``Nightline'' that there were
Republicans after his head, Armey replied: ``They're welcome to it
if they're big enough to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Gingrich has expressed confidence about keeping his
job as speaker. But he has been grim-faced over the last 24 hours
and closeted himself Wednesday with his top strategists making
calls to shore up his support among members.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like the victim of an accident,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who supports Gingrich. ``He's very somber in tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, as it always is with Gingrich, is how many members
are prepared to rebel against his leadership. In the past, no more
than a couple of dozen members have openly expressed their
dissatisfaction with him, and a coup attempt last year fizzled for
lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping more people will understand the need for a serious
reassessment this year,'' said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who
said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996
elections, when the Republicans also lost seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is this: Our majority keeps shrinking,'' Canady
said. ``If it shrinks any more, it will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich has built support among moderates, and some
perceived the election as a repudiation of the conservatives. Rep.
Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-Utah, said the results showed that this was
the right direction for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To maintain our majority, we've got to moderate some of our
views,'' Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings
Institution, said that moderates supported Gingrich in part because
no appealing alternative had emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know he sees the broader world and is prepared to
moderate if it makes sense,'' Mann said. ``Newt's gone out of his
way to support the moderates. He's nurtured a relationship with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mann and others said that anger has been building at
Gingrich for several reasons, including his signing on to a budget
deal last month that seemed to capitulate to President Clinton, not
offering a clear legislative agenda for Republicans and not
communicating a clear political message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are most defined by who we hate'' said Rep. Mark Souder,
R-Ind. ``But voters are more sophisticated than that, and
Republicans better have something to say about where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger grew in the last few days when the speaker approved a
$10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign that allowed
Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, who
has never been nearly as popular with the public as Clinton has
been.
</P>
<P>
   As if only slowly absorbing the implications of the loss, the
speaker seemed unable at a news conference here Wednesday morning
to pinpoint why the party suffered a net drop of five seats in the
House. As late as Tuesday afternoon, he was predicting a net pickup
of between 10 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we look at it better, I frankly don't understand all the
things that happened yesterday,'' he said, ``and I'm not sure
anybody else in the country does either.''

<P>
   But he said Republicans should have ``maniacally focused'' on a
basic message of cutting taxes, saving Social Security and
preventing drug abuse, and campaigned aggressively on those themes.
He contrasted the lack of focus this year with the Contract With
America that proved so successful in 1994. ``People thought we
stood for something pretty big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his
leadership, repeatedly casting the election results as a victory
for his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the
majority for three elections in a row for the first time in 70
years. He also suggested that those who would challenge him have
little support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who normally are quoted on this are people who
would in fact take the party to a narrower base,'' Gingrich said,
referring to the periodic eruptions of concern among conservatives
about his leadership. ``I'd like to see who it was that had a plan
that they were confident over the last 60 days would have been more
successful and why they didn't share it.''

CALIFORNIA REFERENDUM MAY THWART EARLY-PRIMARY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An obscure referendum vote in California may have
thrown a wrench into the state's plans to hold its presidential
primary in the year 2000 on the same day as the vote in five New
England states.
</P>
<P>
   The complication arose when Californians on Tuesday defeated a
proposal that would have required Democrats and Republicans to vote
only for a party member in a primary. By a 54-46 percent margin,
Californians said they wanted to retain the current open system
that allows them to cross party lines on primary day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, California's primary system does not meet the
guidelines set by the Democratic and Republican parties. Both
parties refuse to allow convention delegates to be selected from a
primary if voters can cross party lines.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Wednesday whether California officials could
find an alternative way to stick with a newly passed state law to
hold the presidential primary on March 7, 2000, the same day that
Massachusetts and other states plan to hold their primaries.
</P>
<P>
   California might propose a new system allowing voters to cross
party lines in a primary that would be viewed as a lower-profile,
non-binding ``beauty contest,'' with convention delegates selected
at separate caucuses. But such a system might render the California
primary nearly meaningless, which is not what political leaders
intended when they set up the early primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin, who has called the prospect of an early California
primary a ``national disaster.'' While Galvin said he assumes
California will go ahead with its March 7 primary, ``they have
reduced it to a beauty pageant. The California political
establishment thought this was a done deal, but it is no longer a
done deal. There will be no delegates selected that day.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, candidates would be less likely to skip the primaries
in Massachusetts and other states to spend most of their time
campaigning for the California primary, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Steve Grossman indicated
the defeat of the California referendum raised questions about the
state's primary effort. He said Democratic and Republican leaders
agree that delegates should not be chosen in a primary where voters
can cross party lines. He said he would testify about the matter on
Nov. 19 at a meeting of secretaries of state, who implement state
election laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is totally committed to the principle
that Democratic voters should choose Democratic delegates to a
Democratic National Convention to choose a presidential nominee,''
Grossman said. ``That principle, which is one of the things we and
our Republican counterparts agree upon, will be a principle we will
insist on as we move toward 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter does not affect the primary in New Hampshire, where
state law requires that its first-in-the-nation vote be held a week
before any other primary. But New Hampshire is feeling a lot of
pressure overall because so many states are considering early
primary dates. Aside from California, several other Western states
are considering holding their primaries on March 7, 2000, the same
day many Eastern states will vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a strong effort under way to move a number of
primaries up in the calendar to that March 7 date,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones did not return a call
seeking comment on whether the state will try to go forward with
the March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Karger, a California political consultant, said the
referendum may have lost because voters knew little about it.
``There was a real lack of awareness,'' said Karger, of the Dolphin
Group. ``There was no campaign for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the referendum may hurt the presidential prospects
of outgoing California Governor Pete Wilson, who backed the early
primary and was expected to benefit from it.

REJECTION OF GAY RIGHTS MEASURE IN OGUNQUIT TERMED DIVISIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians, who have lived in harmony with the straight
community in Ogunquit, Maine, for decades, said the town's
rejection of a gay-rights ordinance means more tension and less
tolerance in that seaside tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ogunquit has always had the reputation for being an
open-minded, tolerant community, but I don't think that's the case
anymore,'' Albert Dello Russo, a member of the town's Planning
Board, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town that calls itself `Beautiful Place by the Sea' now
needs an asterisk,'' he said. ``It's a beautiful place if you're
gay as long as you don't push it.''
</P>
<P>
   As voters in South Portland were handily approving a citywide
gay-rights ordinance, Ogunquit voters rejected a similar measure by
just nine votes, 383-374, prompting calls for a recount.
</P>
<P>
   And in a double-barrel defeat for gays and lesbians, Ogunquit
easily rejected a bid to recall a member of the town's board of
selectmen, who had said he could not ``accept homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Selectman John Miller was allowed to keep his post on a 473-304
vote in a local election that drew 65 percent of the town's
registered voters to the poll _ a turnout voting officials said was
the second highest in Ogunquit's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sick to my stomach,'' said David Mills, co-owner of a
bed-and-breakfast and a leader of the measure that would have
barred discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing,
credit, and public accommodations. ``It's more shock and disbelief
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said Ogunquit's vote was more about politics and
personalities than a true measure of gay rights support.
</P>
<P>
   Ogunquit had overwhelmingly opposed a Feb. 10 referendum which
rescinded Maine's gay-rights law, leaving the state the only one in
New England without such a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a real gauge of how people are thinking,'' said David
Garrity, vice president of the Maine Lesbian and Gay Political
Alliance. ``A lot of people were offended at the idea of taking
this out personally on Mr. Miller. I wouldn't be surprised if a
measure comes up before town meeting and passes before the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many residents interviewed before the election said they
feared that because the bid to recall Miller and the gay-rights
ordinance shared the same ballot, voters would consider the choice
between a long-time town servant and the gay-rights ordinance
mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   And now, they said they fear the fallout of Tuesday's decision
will be unmistakable once tourism begins next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine gay people, or people who have gay relatives
or friends, coming to this town for any reason whatsoever,'' Dello
Russo said. ``Ogunquit is a nice place, but it isn't so
geographically wonderful that it overrides something that is this
serious socially.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Littlefield Seaman, a 68-year-old amateur historian
whose roots in Ogunquit date to 1643, said predictions of economic
calamity because of Tuesday's vote are ``baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing is for everybody to forget about the
damn thing,'' said Seaman, who said he opposed Miller's recall and
supported the gay-rights measure. ``We've had gay people here for a
hundred years and they haven't bothered anybody. It's just a few
people who are causing all the problems. I hope this publicity
stops and people forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Hagen, a 66-year-old retiree who chairs the local
Planning Board, said there is little chance of that happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be put on the town warrant in April for the town meeting
and if it's voted down then, it'll probably be put on the ballot
the following year,'' he said.

COACH DENIES INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT WITH EX-PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Renowned basketball coach Jack McMahon, who has
shepherded thousands of New England teenage athletes to college
scholarships, has been suspended by the Amateur Athletic Union
following a complaint from a former player who says McMahon
initiated inappropriate sexual contact with him.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the coach Wednesday denied the allegation and
said McMahon will appeal the AAU decision before the Nov. 23
deadline set by the governing body, headquartered in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   AAU officials said McMahon did not respond to an AAU hearing to
defend himself last month, but his attorney, Wayne Murphy, said his
client never received the notice of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack McMahon has spent the better part of his adulthood in
service to the young people in New England,'' Murphy said. ``He
adamantly denies that any improper conduct took place between
himself and his accuser.''
</P>
<P>
   But word of the allegation, and the two-year suspension, has
traveled through locker rooms and living rooms across the region
because McMahon _ and the basketball program he oversees _ is so
well known. McMahon has been coaching boys basketball since he
graduated from high school, more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager who alleged the sexual advances has requested
anonymity. The boy and his parents say they have not decided
whether to proceed with a criminal complaint, and that their main
concern is that McMahon not supervise children any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about standing up,'' said attorney Jim Noucas,
who is representing the family. ``It's a matter of
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk County investigators are aware of the allegation but are
not currently investi gating the matter, said spokeswoman Nina
Flaherty. The boy was above the age of consent, 16, at the time of
the alleged offense, but a state law mandates that no coach or
caregiver, such as a teacher, have sexual contact with a teen-ager
they are supervising.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged inappropriate contact was the culmination of a
relationship that even McMahon's supporters say was unique, with
the former player staying at McMahon's home on some weekends to
review game tapes. McMahon, who lives alone, told the boy's parents
that such a bond between coach and player was necessary for the
boy's athletic career, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources familiar with the Greater Boston program, and
the boy's parents, say that he arrived on the team with decent
playing ability, but thrived under McMahon's coaching, and headed
into his senior year with hopes of winning a college scholarship.
At one point, one of McMahon's assistant coaches, Skip Griffin,
said that he warned McMahon that his career could be troubled
because of the amount of time he spent alone with the player.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffin, who is community relations director for promotion
at The Boston Globe and volunteers his time coaching, said
Wednesday that he never witnessed any sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's parents say their son has stopped playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used our son's love for basketball,'' said the boy's
father. ``He had dinner with us, at our home. He worked to gain our
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother said that at one point she noticed that her
son, typically even-keeled, became morose and suffered from
insomnia. After repeated inquiries, the teenager confided to his
mother that McMahon had made sexual advances toward him.
</P>
<P>
   The former player alleged that McMahon told him that he should
exercise naked at McMahon's home so that the coach could examine
his overall fitness, and later requested that he let McMahon fondle
him in order to build trust.
</P>
<P>
   The inappropriate contact allegedly occurred during the summer
of 1997, while McMahon's program made national news for showcasing
Daniel Gadzuric, one of the top five high school players in the
nation.

N.H. GOP SHAKEN BY STRONG VOTE FOR INCUMBENT GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  CONCORD, N.H. _ For nearly two decades, New Hampshire was one
of the most Republican states in the nation. In many years, it sent
no Democrat to Congress and yielded no Democrats statewide
positions higher than minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The state's status as a Republican redoubt foundered in 1996
when Jeanne Shaheen became not only the state's first female
governor but the first Democrat to hold the office in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, GOP ground shook again when Shaheen dealt rival Jay
Lucas the worst defeat of any Republican gubernatorial nominee this
century; it shook even further when Democrats took control of the
state Senate, for the first time since 1912, by a 13-11 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this says a lot about the political skill of Governor
Jeanne Shaheen,'' said Tom Rath, a Republican strategist and former
state attorney general. ``I've never been shy in expressing my
admiration for that skill, but this was a really impressive
demonstration of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who defeated Lucas with 66 percent of the vote as
opposed to her opponent's 31 percent, campaigned aggressively for
Democratic candidates in the last weeks of the campaign. Her
efforts made the difference in several close Senate races,
including an acrimonious contest in central New Hampshire between
former House Democratic leader Rick Trombly and Republican
incumbent Amy Patenaude.
</P>
<P>
   With one week to go before the election, the Union Leader of
Manchester linked Trombly with a gay social group.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans held control of the 400-member House, the
change in the Senate raised hopes that the state will be able to
resolve its school-funding crisis. The state Supreme Court has set
an April 1 deadline to replace an unconstitutional system that
relies almost totally on local property taxes to fund education.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike, however, warn that a
Democratic-controlled Senate does not mean that the solution to the
crisis will be a statewide sales, income, or property tax. Shaheen
has repeatedly said she would veto any such effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of it is that this does not mean that we are about to
see a major change in the state's tax structure,'' said Edgar
Helms, former state Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Claremont school funding suit, filed by a coalition of poor
towns, is in its eighth year.

KINGS HOPE TO FILL IN BLANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In January 1969, the Los Angeles Kings were
shut out three consecutive times, a mark in franchise lore that
they have somehow never managed to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years after those games, Olli Jokinen was born in
Finland. And tonight, the Kings are hoping Jokinen, now 19, will
help them avoid matching the franchise record for consecutive times
shut out when the Kings play host to the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (4-5-2) have been shut out twice in a row and in three
of their last four games. They have not scored in the last 126
minutes, 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jokinen, promoted from Springfield in the AHL on
Monday, should not be viewed as a savior, the Kings are hoping the
6-3, 208-pound center can fill the void created by the season-long
injury woes of Jozef Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that we want to see from (Jokinen) that we maybe
didn't see before was that second-effort for the puck,'' Coach
Larry Robinson said following Wednesday's practice at the Forum.
``We want to see a little more bite from him. That's really all.
There's no sense putting a lot of pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen skated Wednesday on a line with Glen Murray and Luc
Robitaille. A year ago, scant months after the Kings selected him
with the third pick in the NHL draft, Jokinen appeared in eight NHL
games, went scoreless, then was sent home to play in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   He is anything but overconfident about his return to the NHL one
year later. Asked what he expected of himself, he said, ``It's hard
to say because I haven't played yet. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen was playing 30 to 35 minutes a night on a Springfield
team dressing just nine forwards (NHL teams dress 12), and had nine
points in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted the change from playing on spacious European ice
surfaces to comparatively compact North American rinks has been an
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different playing on a smaller rink,'' Jokinen said.
``Everything is quicker and you must be careful in your own zone.
If you lose your own man, maybe he scores right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Jokinen's play without the puck are what kept him
from making the Kings' roster after training camp. Now, with the
offense at a standstill, the Kings have decided to see if they can
live with that deficiency in Jokinen's game.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jokinen's ice time quickly diminishes, look for this
stint in the NHL to be a short one. More than anything, the Kings
want their top prospect playing lots of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too young to come in and play just once in awhile,''
Robinson said. ``That's the most important thing for a young kid:
to get playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   __ It had to happen: It took only seconds for center Ray Ferraro
to react when he saw winger Craig Johnson, a Minnesota native, in
the locker room Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with a hick voice and said, `Guess who our new
governor is? Jesse `The Body' Ventura,' '' Johnson said, shaking
his head over Tuesday's surprising election of the former
professional wrestler to Minnesota's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little embarrassing,'' Johnson said. ``He actually has
some pretty good ideas. I guess people will start calling Minnesota
a hick town with a pro wrestler for a governor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Add winger Sandy Moger to the injury list.
Moger has a strained back and won't skate for at least a week. As
for the other injuries, center Ian Laperriere (partially torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee) has been cleared to
play and probably will be in the lineup tonight on a line with Eric
Lacroix and Steve McKenna; goalie Stephane Fiset (groin strain)
skated before Wednesday's practice and his response to the workout
was to be assessed today); goalie Jamie Storr (groin strain) is
listed as day to day); and center Jozef Stumpel (hip-flexor strain)
is week to week.

HOUSE GOP WRESTLES WITH CLINTON DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The next act of the 105th Congress _ a high-profile
hearing next week on the standards for impeaching a president _ may
be one of its last.
</P>
<P>
   With the surprise results of Tuesday's election apparently
underscoring the public's disdain for the push to impeach President
Clinton, House Republicans Wednesday faced the delicate dilemma of
trying to quickly resolve the investigation of Clinton's sex
scandal without further harming the GOP cause.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to open
full-scale hearings as early as Nov. 16 into the circumstances
surrounding Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But as television networks geared up for the potential
spectacle, several analysts said House Republican leaders are
resigned to the apparent futility of the impeachment effort and are
privately exploring possible legal and political alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cut the fragile GOP majority in the House from 11
seats to six in the election. And Republicans failed to gain
strength in the Senate, where they hold 55 seats, 12 shy of the 67
they would need to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 106th Congress, which convenes in January, is
expected to be even less likely than the current assembly to
consider removing Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the election, it's pretty clear there isn't going to be
an impeachment,'' said former Representative Bill Frenzel, a
Minnesota Republican who served in the House for 20 years before
becoming a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``The Republicans need to find a way to get rid of it
before the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   That quandary is the most urgent of several problems confronting
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who also faces the possible wrath of
rank-and-file GOP lawmakers over the unexpected election gains by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gingrich may be saddled with trying to protect his
speakership while Clinton and the larger Democratic minority,
re-energized by the election results, step up the pressure for
their prized initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the speaker's strength has been diminished,'' said
Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget
Office. ``There is going to be a certain amount of looking over
one's shoulder going on among the House Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it remained unclear whether the GOP rank-and-file has
the power _ or inclination _ to oust Gingrich, who has pledged to
step down in 2000 after his third term as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty, the 106th Congress is expected to look _
and legislate _ much like the 105th. Analysts said Republican
leaders will be handcuffed by the possibility that as few as six
GOP moderates or conservatives can block their agenda by
threatening to vote with a unified Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenarios played out in the 105th Congress, as efforts
by GOP leaders to push several initiatives, including using the
budget surplus for tax cuts, were stymied by rebellious factions
within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen this year is what we'll see next year,''
Frenzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even most of the issues will be similar, from overhauling
managed care regulations and the campaign finance system to banning
late-term abortions and abolishing the so-called marriage tax
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   However, the White House has vowed to make the next session's
top priority designing a long-term plan to preserve the Social
Security system. And top Clinton supporters vowed to continue to
press issues that were blocked this year by the Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will renew the fight for things that will make a difference
in people's lives, starting with urgently needed reforms in HMOs,
aid for school construction repair, and an increase in the minimum
wage,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impeachment problem looms. And no one expects the
issue to be easily resolved, since the House is obligated to
complete the formal inquiry it authorized last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the first step, which was like taking the first step
off the mountain when you are skiing,'' Reischauer said. ``Once you
start down, you can't go back up. They are going to have a very,
very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also must consider the views of Judiciary Chairman
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, whose reputation could be harmed if GOP
leaders seek a political resolution that is seen as undermining the
integrity of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde issued a statement Wednesday indicating he hoped to stay
the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to
complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner,'' Hyde said.
``This was just as true before the election as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde had said he hoped to complete the inquiry by the end of the
year. But committee lawyers have yet to begin formally interviewing
potential hearing witnesses and the schedule for the proceedings
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against Clinton include perjury, obstruction of
justice and witness tampering. But the panel's work could be
complicated if the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, who is
reportedly investigating whether Clinton made a sexual advance to
former White House aide Kathleen Willey, recommends additional
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers also are expected to protest any attempts to
speed up the proceedings at the expense of the president's due
process rights.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee said Hyde planned to
issue a statement later this week that may discuss a timetable for
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several committee members in both parties said they
believed voters sent the House a message that they were sick of the
Lewinsky matter and the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to admonish the president and bring it to a
conclusion,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell
Democrat. ``But I'm not sure the Republicans on the committee
recognize the results the people are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mary Bono of California, the only Republican
woman on the panel, said she heard the same message as
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and
committee member, who defeated Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bono quoted Schumer as saying, ``People are definitely tired
with the impeachment. They want to put it behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I can't agree with him more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' Bono added, ``it is still our duty to look at
what we have before us.''

OCTOBER SALES OF VEHICLES HIGHER THAN EXPECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   The strength of car and truck sales in October continued to
surprise Wall Street analysts and auto-industry executives as more
figures were released Wednesday. October turned out to be one of
the strongest sales months in history and puts the industry on
track for its best year in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for strong numbers, and these are stronger than
I expected,'' said David Healy, an auto analyst for Burnham
Securities in New York. Healy noted in an interview that the
stronger sales came about even as incentives began tapering off
from the high levels of last spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   With almost every vehicle manufacturer tallying higher sales
this October compared with the month a year earlier, total vehicle
sales in the United States for the month totaled 1,368,567 cars and
light trucks, a 9.8 percent increase compared with sales in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Car sales rose 7.1 percent, to 712,407 units; truck sales
increased 12.9 percent, to 656,160 vehicles. That put the
seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for light vehicles at 16.6
million cars and light trucks for October, just shy of June of this
year, when the rate was the highest since August 1987, according to
Ward's Automotive Reports.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. surprised analysts in making a quicker
comeback than expected from last summer's 54-day strike. Instead of
increasing sales by 2 percent, as analysts had predicted, GM
reported Wednesday that its sales increased 6 percent in October
compared with those in the month a year earlier, to 408,655 cars
and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   GM light truck sales totaled 180,212 vehicles, up 6.4 percent,
even without the full production of the 1999 models of its large
pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, which are in
their introduction phase after being redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   GM's full-size sport utility vehicles, including the Chevrolet
Tahoe and GMC Yukon, and front-wheel-drive minivans, sold as the
Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Montana, had
their best October sales in history. Small trucks also had large
sales increases. GM car sales rose 6.3 percent, to 228,443 on the
strength of its midsized line and large cars from Buick and
Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like GM's recovery from the strike is moving better
than they hoped,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, GM sales are off about 4 percent. Truck sales are
5 percent higher; car sales are 10 percent lower. Because other
automakers, particularly Chrysler Corp., which reported earlier in
the week that its October sales increased 20 percent, and foreign
brands are turning in stronger-than-expected sales numbers, GM came
in just shy of its goal for 30 percent market share in October.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GM recognizes that it is losing sales because its
inventory of vehicles in dealer showrooms remains off about 20
percent from levels in the month a year earlier, said Donald
DeVeaux, GM's director of North American market analysis. The
inventory shortages are most noticeable at GM's largest divisions,
Chevrolet and Pontiac, and in their highest-selling models, like
the Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Grand Am.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, GM plants are running at full capacity and the
automaker plans to build 1.5 million cars and trucks in the fourth
quarter, more than any fourth quarter in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   At Ford Motor Co., sales of Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar
vehicles rose 2.1 percent, to 333,522 cars and trucks, on target
with analysts' projections but higher than Ford expected at the
start of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Light truck sales increased 10.1 percent, to 202,741 vehicles on
the strength of the Ford F-Series pickup, Explorer, Expedition and
Lincoln Navigator sport utilities. Car sales declined 8.2 percent,
to 130,781 vehicles, because of lower fleet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, Ford, based on October's strong sales performance, will
build 1.1 million cars and trucks _ 25,000 more than originally
planned _ in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry blew past what we thought it would be,'' said
Michael DiGiovanni, GM's chief forecaster, in an interview. ``We
dodged the bullet of the Asian financial crisis. Now the rest of
the economic fundamentals look strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   DiGiovanni noted that lower interest rates and new products,
combined with favorable demographics _ like aging baby boomers
buying luxury vehicles and Generation X-ers forming households and
buying vehicles to meet their needs _ bode well for the industry's
near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we're looking at 1999 and wondering if it will be
a better year than we thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Healy agreed, noting that recent interest-rate cuts and future
ones would soon show up in car-loan rates, ``a plus factor for next
year's vehicle sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These sales might subside a bit but, barring 20-percent
interest rates or $2-a-gallon gasoline, we're not looking for a
collapse in sales or a recession,'' he said.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day out from an election that defied much of
history, elated Democrats confidently pushed to abbreviate the
impeachment process, while congressional Republicans morbidly
looked inward for a plan that might right their many political
wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Around the capital and across the country, it was a day of
contradicting emotions swirling around a central belief:
Republicans in Washington overestimated the electoral reach of
President Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and
now face a backlash of significant proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Republicans lost five seats in the House of
Representatives, cutting their majority margin to just six _ in a
season of scandal in which they had once predicted a gain of more
than 20 seats. It marked the first time since 1934 that the party
in the White House gained seats in a midterm election. In the
Senate, the two parties fought to a draw, with Republicans still
maintaining a 55 to 45 seat advantage.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, Clinton could barely contain his glee as he spoke
of returning to an issues agenda that the American people had
wanted all along, a program of patients rights and Social Security
solvency, not of scandals and subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the lesson all people should draw is that the
people who were rewarded were rewarded because they wanted to do
something for the American people,'' said Clinton, in a White House
photo opportunity. ``They wanted to do something to pull this
country together and to move this country forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, House Speaker Newt Gingrich alternately blamed the
media and then himself for the failed Republican strategy of
focusing on Clinton's personal and legal travails. Privately,
several Republicans said they will now study Clinton's successful
strategy in overcoming his party's enormous losses in 1994, when
Republicans won control of Congress, and returning to relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm the speaker, so I'll take responsibility,'' Gingrich
said at a news conference in his home district in Georgia. ``We
should probably have aggressively pushed cutting taxes and saving
Social Security much harder than we did this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans already began what many analysts believe will be
months of carping, infighting, and self-inflicted wounds, all of
which could threaten Gingrich's hold on his party and his position.
Deep within the Republican caucus, the names of Representative Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, and Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a former
professional football player and member of the class of 1994,
emerged as two possible contenders to oust the current GOP
leadership, according to party sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lord punished Republicans for not doing what they were put
on earth for, to cut taxes,'' said Marshall Wittmann, the director
of congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation, a
Republican-leaning think tank. ``The Republicans were singularly
focused on impeachment and scandal, and that didn't sell with the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were not in themselves stunning, the
Republican failure to seize on a golden political opportunity was.
As a result, the GOP is in danger of losing the House in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Said influential Democratic pollster Peter Hart: ``The
Republicans took an election with a pat hand and threw it away.
It's breathtaking. They took a perfect year and played it as badly
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing further embarrassment for Gingrich and other
congressional Republicans, GOP governors around the nation
generally fared well, with incumbents winning in major states such
as Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In state capitals, unlike Washington, GOP candidates were seen
as more mainstream and less likely to seek advantage from Clinton's
problems. The result: Greater success at the state level than in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``A governor is more moderately positioned than a US senator,''
said Neil Newhouse, a Republican consultant who worked on Jeb
Bush's successful gubernatorial campaign in Florida. ``A US senator
can be an archconservative, but you can't be an archconservative as
a governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, House members on both sides of the aisle and the
analysts who constantly watch them expressed a belief that the
election, while not about Clinton, will carry profound implications
for the president. With the Democratic victories comes the strong
expectation that the Republicans will shorten the impeachment
process, possibly holding true to their prior word that they will
complete the hearings by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois
Republican, issued a written statement saying that his panel would
continue to move forward with a hearing, but the very fact he felt
the need to reaffirm the position gave Democrats further reason to
embrace their new advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be accelerated,'' said Democratic Representative
William Delahunt of Massachusetts, a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``Clearly, the dynamic was going to change after the
election. Everyone sensed that there was collective exhaustion with
the scandal, with the issue. This just gives impetus to resolve it
expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lauded themselves for a high-powered effort to turn
out their voters on Election Day, including an unusually high
response from black voters, and for a significant appeal among
upper-income voters who tend to side with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans lost the ground war,'' said Wittmann. ``The
Democrats defeated the air war with a ground war. The Democrats
turned out their base, while the Republicans focused on an ad
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee chairman Steve Grossman, a
Massachusetts businessman, said Democratic committees relied on a
sophisticated computer model that encouraged turnout of key
constituencies such as blacks and women in select races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people wrote us off,'' Grossman said, reflecting upon a
year in which the party endured Clinton's sex scandal at the same
it was trying to overcome an $18 million debt largely as a result
of legal fees from the campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the party recovered for several reasons, including
a backlash against the GOP impeachment inquiry, voter concern that
the Republican-controlled Congress wasn't dealing with issues
affecting ordinary people, and the Democratic Party's recruitment
of candidates who reflected moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility of impeachment, Grossman said it was up
to Republicans to end the inquiry. ``Our view has always been,
`Let's end the process in an appropriate way, let's not engage in a
potentially two-year open-ended process.''
</P>
<P>
   With an expedited impeachment process and the apparent plans of
Republicans to focus on key issues, many analysts believe the next
two years of political discourse will be devoted to such programs
as Social Security and health care reform. Democrats believe such a
change will enhance their prospects to capture the House and hold
the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we didn't change the landscape, but we redefined
the agenda,'' said Hart, the Democratic pollster. ``We're not going
to spend the next two years on impeachment. We'll move back to the
public's business.''

HONDURAS' CAPITAL: CITY OF THE DEAD AND THE DAZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Selvin Joynarid Perez was standing under
the awning of his small house on a bluff overlooking the Choluteca
River early Saturday morning, keeping an uneasy watch on the
torrential rain and the rising waters below.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the earth trembled, he said. He turned to run into the
house to wake his wife and 3-year-old daughter. He never made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tried to go into the room where my wife and child were
sleeping, the earth opened up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, more than 45 houses in the Nueva Esperanza
neighborhood slid down the bluff in an avalanche of earth and wood
and tin roofing and human beings, toward the roiling black waters
below, Perez, 25, said. His wife, Maria, and daughter, Kensi, were
crushed to death in their beds.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday they were still buried in tons of debris above the
river, along with at least 11 other people from the neighborhood.
Some family members and survivors were picking over the jumbled
boulders and pieces of houses, clawing at the earth in the hope of
finding their loved one's remains. Perez, a mechanic, was laboring
to repair a road leading to the disaster site so the government
could bring in earthmovers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this Central American capital, victims of the floods
and landslides spawned over the weekend by Hurricane Mitch were
trying to reconstruct their lives, though most had little left
besides the clothes they wore and a thin thread of hope.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen neighborhoods in this city of 800,000 were
erased by floodwaters or buried under landslides. All over the
city, stunned men and women picked through the shattered remains of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, like the devastated Colonia Soto, hundreds of
vultures swirled overhead, apparently attracted by the faint but
fetid scent of corpses buried in the rubble created by an avalanche
on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials said on Tuesday that they had preliminary
reports that at least 6,420 people were killed by the storm
throughout the country and 5,807 were missing. Some 600,000 are
crowded into thousands of temporary shelters because their homes
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst,'' said Delmer Urbizo, the minister of
government and justice, who is overseeing the aid operation. ``This
has no precedent in the history of the country, or even in the
history of Central America.''
</P>
<P>
   But many officials here say they fear the worst is yet to come.
Outbreaks of disease and food shortages are likely unless the roads
and other installations can be repaired. Ninety-three bridges are
out along major highways, including 45 that are completely
destroyed. All the major cities in Honduras are like islands, cut
off from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Food and gasoline supplies are dwindling, with only a few days
worth of both in the capital, officials say. The roads leading from
the capital to the Pacific and Atlantic ports are still impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Vast tracts of the country are still inaccessible except by
helicopter, officials said. Thousands of people are cut off by
floodwaters in the northern coastal regions, especially in La
Mosquitia in the northeast. Some are surviving in trees and on top
of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, officials say, is that many villages and
settlements along rivers appear from the air to have been literally
wiped off the map.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have also done untold damage to grain, banana, bean
and tobacco crops in the San Pedro de Sula valley and other
important agricultural areas. By some estimates, more than 70
percent of the country's crops have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   There was sunshine in the capital on Wednesday. The river had
retreated into its bed, and in many neighborhoods life appeared to
be returning to something like its normal rhythm. In Comayaguela,
the business district, people were shoveling the mud out of
storefronts, removing debris from damaged factories and digging
cars and trucks out of banks of earth.
</P>
<P>
   But in dozens of communities swept away by floods or buried in
mudslides, working-class people were struggling to come to terms
with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In La Colonia Soto, residents climbed in disbelief over the
wreckage of their former neighborhood, which was nestled between
two hills alongside the river. At least 150 houses were destroyed
by a series of landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents had heeded warnings on the radio and had taken
shelter on higher ground, but dozens had stayed behind to guard
their properties. Most perished, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of destruction in Soto provokes awe. An entire soccer
field slid down a hill more than 200 yards from its original site
and crumpled like a giant sheet of paper, plowing under the houses
below. Many houses ended up 150 yards downhill from where they had
been built. Others were buried entirely, some with people inside.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Albarado, a 52-year-old fishmonger, was stacking up boards
salvaged from his wrecked home. He said his family managed to leave
for higher ground on Friday afternoon, just hours before an
avalanche carried his house down the hill and broke it in pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Looters had stolen what was left of his belongings, he said. He
has no way to make a living anymore, because the market with his
stall was also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing,'' he said, his eyes filling with tears.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of miles upstream, some residents of Nueva Esperanza
were still trying to find the bodies of the dead, but their hopes
were fading. Several acknowledged that the houses that had rumbled
down the bluff had been illegally built in a zone where
construction is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the thing is that it is not the government's
fault,'' said Florentino Sanchez, who had spent the day digging
with his bare hands for the bodies of four children of his cousin.
The mother's body was found on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never believed the river would do this,'' he said.

NASCAR HAS NOTHING TO LOSE WITH RULES MAKEOVER
</HEADLINE>
 REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not totally correct to classify Sunday's NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway as an all-out research and development
exercise for 43 NASCAR Winston Cup teams.
</P>
<P>
   But AMS, in effect, will serve as a 190 mph laboratory this
weekend, complete with 3,400-pound white and multi-colored
``mice.''
</P>
<P>
   By electing to modify its rear spoiler height and front air dam
clearance rules for the season-ender, NASCAR officials are openly
scrutinizing the ``Five-and-Five Rule'' governing aerodynamics.
Depending upon what unfolds around the super-fast 1.5-mile
quadoval, the ``Five-and-Five'' might be headed to the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like an idea. Because at this point, what has NASCAR got
to lose? The driver's championship has been bagged by Jeff Gordon,
and NASCAR officials traditionally dislike implementing major rules
modifications during the season. Given the complaints leveled
against the ``Five-and-Five'' and its effect on the quality of
racing by drivers, team owners and even promoters this season, the
timing is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that the rule was introduced in late January after a test
session conducted by Gordon, then only a two-time Winston Cup
champion, and his team at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. The
rule's intent was to make the cars less stable through the corners,
theoretically forcing drivers to lift off the accelerator and slow.
The rule also was designed to make the driver _ and not
aerodynamics _ a bigger part of the equation, and promote
side-by-side racing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you know how that played-out. Gordon wrapped up his second
consecutive championship, and third in four years, with a victory
at North Carolina Speedway on Sunday. The victory was Gordon's 12th
of the season, a personal-best and one short of Richard Petty's
record for NASCAR's ``modern era'' dating from 1972. Gordon also
has scored a series-leading seven poles in the ever-present No. 24
DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   With 5,143 points after 32 events, Gordon has racked up the
largest total since the current scoring system was put into place
in 1975. En route, Gordon also has reduced points runner-up Mark
Martin's career season _ seven victories, three poles and 21
top-five finishes _ to pretty much of an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gordon, Martin and Dale Jarrett _ the series' other
dominant driver _ have combined to win 22 of 32 races this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the same three ``usual suspects'' combined to win
21 of 32 events, but still produced the closest three-way
points-race in NASCAR history. Gordon finished 14 points ahead of
Jarrett and 29 in front of Martin. Heading into AMS, Gordon has a
344-point lead over Martin. Jarrett is third, but 699 points in
back of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   That is strong evidence that Gordon and crew chief Ray Evernham
certainly are worthy champions on a roll reminiscent of the heydays
of Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip and Cale Yarborough. And
it is strong evidence that the ``Five-and-Five'' has not made Cup
racing better than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racing's not great because Jeff Gordon won almost
everything on the racetrack that we didn't. So what can we say
about that?'' said Martin, driver of the No. 6 Valvoline Ford
Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   If you are speedway developer Bruton Smith, you can say that Cup
racing has become predictable and boring. You can say it is devoid
of side-by-side racing. Smith, whose Speedway Motorsports Inc.
holdings include TMS, said all that in late September and has not
backed down. Smith certainly struck a nerve, as he knew he would,
and here we are with a season finale devoid of its usual drama and
a set of revised aero specifications.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, NASCAR's decision to experiment with taller rear
spoilers on all Chevrolets (6.50 inches), Fords (6.25) and Pontiacs
(6.875) and a uniform front air-dam clearance (3.50 inches) should
tighten the field. The changes should give the cars more stability
and the drivers a bigger comfort zone. They should make
aerodynamics less a factor, put driver experience and ability back
into the equation and theoretically produce the passing and
side-by-side racing that is NASCAR's calling card.
</P>
<P>
   So, call it all-out R&AMP;D or a noble experiment. At this point,
NASCAR has nothing to lose.
THE BUZZ NASCAR

<P>
   Rivals Jack Sprague and Ron Hornaday Jr. will decide the
Craftsman Truck Series championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
Sunday. Each is bidding to become the series' first two-time
champion. Hornaday, the 1996 champion and a six-time winner this
season, holds a 13-point advantage after 26 events. ``I think Jack
respects my style and I respect his,'' said Hornaday, driver of the
No. 16 NAPA Brakes Chevy owned by Teresa Earnhardt. ``We're going
to try to win this championship. You've got to get yourself into
position for the last 25 laps, and keep an eye on what the Hendrick
team \Rof Sprague\S does. With 25 laps to go, that's when you can
worry about the championship.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, a four-time winner this season in the No. 24 GMAC
Financial Services Chevy, is not shy about trading paint with
Hornaday. ``We've had our deals and lost one truck apiece. So we're
even,'' Sprague said. ``But it's not a keeping-score type of deal.
I've never raced to wreck. I've always raced to win. The first 26
races don't mean anything anymore. I have a lot of respect for Ron
and if he wins this thing, I'll congratulate him and his team.
We've got to race together, so there's no sense in hating each
other.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup team owner Tim Beverley of Tyler and three-time
series champion Darrell Waltrip will terminate their working
relationship in the No. 35 Tabasco Pontiac Grand Prix after
Sunday's NAPA 500. Beverley, whose lawsuit-marred sponsorship deal
with Tabasco also ends with the race, is looking for a primary
backer for 1999 and beyond. Native Texan Kent Johnson, the team's
director of media relations, said Tabasco officials are considering
a return to the team next year, perhaps in a secondary role. ...
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Beverley _ who plans to continue running Pontiacs next
year _ is expected to name his new driver for 1999 on or about Nov.
16. Rich Bickle, who has been substituting for the injured Greg
Sacks in the No. 98 Thorn Apple Valley Meats Ford Taurus, is a
leading candidate to replace Waltrip. ``The only thing for sure now
is that I'm not tied to this team,'' said Waltrip, referring to
Tyler Jet Motorsports. ``I can look for something else to do. Maybe
there is nothing else to do. I've just got to believe if Darrell
Waltrip has to go around the garage area with resumes and telling
people he's looking for a job, then maybe he needs to find another
occupation.'' Beverley, who bought the No. 17 team from Waltrip in
March, will be entertaining two prospective sponsors this weekend
at Atlanta Motor Speedway, including one that spent 1998 in the Pep
Boys Indy Racing League but was disappointed by the lack of
coverage. ...
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR again will allow Cup teams seven test dates next season,
but four will be determined by the manufacturers. Teams will be
permitted to test at Daytona, Talladega, Charlotte, Indianapolis
and at three tracks of their choosing. All tests will be limited to
two days of fun. ``This will make testing even more important,''
said Jeremy Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford and
teammate to 1989 champion Rusty Wallace. ``Everything you can
learn, you need to learn. Everybody is going to have to test
smarter.''

   Californian Gary Scelzi is closing in on his second consecutive
National Hot Rod Association Top Fuel championship in style. Scelzi
will take a 115-point lead over Cory McClenathan into the
season-ending Winston Finals at Pomona (Calif.) Raceway on Nov.
12-15, when all he will have to do is qualify for the 16-car field.
Scelzi's numbers at the Matco Tools SuperNationals at Houston
Raceway Park in Baytown last weekend (and Monday) were
super-consistent. He qualified at 4.549 seconds at 322.23 mph (a
track record). During eliminations, Scelzi drove the Team Winston
Dragster to consecutive laps of 4.544 seconds/324.32 mph,
4.530/326.44 (the national speed record), 4.564/320.28 and
4.556/320.85. That qualifies as superb down-the-stretch racing. ``I
felt that it couldn't get any tougher \Rthan 1997\S,'' said Scelzi,
who got some sobering advice from seven-time Funny Car champion
John Force and two-time Pro Stock champion Jim Yates during last
year's NHRA awards dinner. ``They told me that if you think the
first one was tough, wait until the second one. Even when we were
in eighth place, I knew we were going to make a run at this thing.
I didn't know if we'd pull it off. It's a tough road. If you slip
up a thousandth of a second, they're going to take you out. And
they're not going to look back and say, `Gee, Gary, sorry.' Every
one of 'em, they all want to win as bad as we do. They just don't
have \Rcrew chief)\S Alan Johnson.''

   FAST LAPS Ray, Menard aim at Indy
</P>
<P>
   Plano's Greg Ray has a five-year contract to deliver team owner
John Menard the one jewel missing from his Indy-car collection.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a victory in the Indianapolis 500, a dream Ray and
Menard will pursue beginning with the 1999 Pep Boys Indy Racing
League season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indy 500 is everything to John Menard,'' said Ray, who has
replaced 1997 IRL champion Tony Stewart as lead driver at Team
Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Ray qualified No. 2 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway last May
for former car owner Thomas Knapp, who now is general manager at
Team Menard. Menard drivers have scored nine poles and four
victories since the IRL's inception in 1996. But none of the
victories has been at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit on pole is one thing,'' said Ray, 32. ``I can guarantee
you, if I can have a good year and win the Indy 500, I'll probably
have a lifetime contract with John. He wants to win Indy. That's
why this is so exciting for me. There's not a hidden agenda here.
It's all about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he and Menard began negotiations in June, after his run
at Indy and his second-place finish to Billy Boat during the True
Value 500K night race at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg seemed to work out from the `fit' standpoint,'' Menard
said. ``He's really aggressive, has a desire to win and is a good
tester.''
Nuts and bolts
</P>
<P>
   Blake Mallory of Joshua is scheduled to compete in the INEX
Legends Young Lions National Championship at Atlanta Motor Speedway
tomorrow. Mallory was second in the event in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty is the only full-time driver on the Winston Cup
circuit not to lead a lap this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nienhouse Motorsports, which finished second in the IRL points
race with Davey Hamilton this year, has lost Reebok as its primary
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   With the 21 points he scored en route to victory in CART's
season-ending Marlboro 500 at the California Speedway on Sunday,
race winner Jimmy Vasser finished 1998 with 169 points. That is 15
more than his CART championship season of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Team Penske concluded a winless, 19-race CART FedEx Series
season at California Speedway on Sunday. Team owner Roger Penske is
stuck on 99 open-wheel victories.

REPUBLICANS' MISCALCULATIONS ARE DEMOCRATS' GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(htv) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politicians in both parties said the unexpected Democratic
successes on Tuesday stemmed from a fundamental misreading of the
electorate by Republicans: In the face of nine months of polls
showing that voters were not particularly exercised by the White
House scandal, Republicans were utterly convinced that it would
ultimately play to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That was not their only blunder. Many Republican party officials
said they assumed they would have an edge given the tide of history
showing that the president's party almost always loses seats in a
midterm election. These Republicans figured, therefore, that they
did not need to use their congressional majorities to push
legislation that would shape the debate in this political year.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the miscalculation, Speaker Newt Gingrich said:
``We probably should have almost maniacally focused on cutting
taxes, reforming government, working on saving Social Security''
and ``accepted the fact that that was a better fight for us than
drifting into September and October where there really were _ as
people kept saying _ there were no national themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said:
``One of the lessons for Republicans out of this is that we need to
listen more carefully to the people _ and we need to have a clear
understanding and concise message that we do apply across the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who were swifter than in past elections in seizing an
opening, took the offensive on a host of issues including
education, Social Security and health care. Surveys of voters
leaving the polls on Tuesday showed that those matters played to
the Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on those concerns gave the party's core voters,
particularly minorities and union members, an incentive to turn out
in larger numbers than expected on Tuesday. Democrats, meanwhile,
took advantage of the party's issue edge by developing an intense
turnout drive that resembled the old-fashioned voter efforts
practiced by Democrats years ago. And with a low turnout overall,
those targeted efforts had special impact.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, while Republicans had for months expected the
scandal to embolden the voters that form their base of support, in
the closing weeks the Monica Lewinsky matter had so dissipated that
it was not an important motivator for Republicans to vote. Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, said Democrats clearly had an edge in turnout. ``I
don't think Republicans gave people a reason to vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties said that rather than generate
defections from the Republicans _ or drive independents to the
Democratic column _ the decision by Republicans to put their hopes
in the impeachment controversy simply gave the Democrats room to
ignite their supporters by focusing on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they sensed trouble late last week, after
the press got wind of the sudden, multi-million-dollar plan by the
National Republican Congressional Committee to broadcast television
commercials that reminded voters of the scandal. Party officials
had not intended word of the plan to leak out so soon, and they
were not prepared for the sustained national publicity about the
advertisements, which were shown in 30 Congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads added fuel to the ability of the Democrats to create a
fire about impeachment,'' said Tony Marsh, a Republican consultant
who created one of the three scandal commercials. ``They ended up
reinforcing everything that we were trying not to reinforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements serve in some ways as a metaphor for the
Republicans' failed strategy in the election: They showed that
after dozens, even after hundreds of polls showing that the scandal
had not registered with voters, Republicans in the crucial final
days clung to the idea that it was their ticket to victory in races
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Marsh said Republicans felt they had no choice but to turn
to the scandal near the end of the campaign because voters had not
identified their party with other issues. ``We couldn't connect on
the other issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While strategists argued over whether the advertisements hurt
Republicans, they certainly did not seem to help.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said they ran the commercials in 10
districts where they did not think Republicans had a chance of
winning _ and Republicans lost all 10 seats. They also ran them in
four races that were considered toss-ups, and that the Republicans
lost those races. The remaining districts where the ads appeared
were 16 that party officials had expected to win anyway, and where
the spots were intended to spur turnout. The party's candidates won
12 of those 16 seats.
</P>
<P>
   There was other anecdotal evidence that a backlash against
impeachment may have benefited Democrats. In Washington state, for
example, former Rep. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, was the first
candidate in a competitive race to run commercials linking his
opponent to the impeachment inquiry. The Republican incumbent, Rep.
Rick White, lost the election.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said strategists in their party simply could
never fathom that, despite a job approval rating that never ebbed
all year, Clinton would not be a drag on Democrats. ``The continued
success of Clinton is something that totally confounds
Republicans,'' said Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant,
``just as the Democratic intelligentsia never understood Ronald
Reagan. They just saw him as this actor guy, kind of a dummy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists on both sides said the Democrats triumphed not as
much from a backlash against the impeachment inquiry _ although
that certainly was a factor _ but because Democrats had an issue
agenda upon which to draw support and Republicans did not.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading Republicans said the party should have used its
majority in Congress to pick fights with Clinton on the budget and
other matters. Even in the face of presidential vetoes, they said,
they would have had substantial issues to take to the voters. But
even though they thought the scandal would be a millstone for
Clinton, many Republicans said they were nervous to challenge him
over issues given that the party was still smarting over the
president's success in turning the government shutdown against
Republicans in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They were willing to get out of town at any cost,'' said Craig
Smith, the White House political director. ``They left all the
budget decisions to the very end. And they had no leverage left.''
</P>
<P>
   An explanation for that is there was no consensus in the party
about precisely how to frame the budget battle. Party officials
said it was simpler to try to coalesce around the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Republican officials said, there was an ongoing, and
roiling debate inside the party over the Clinton affair, with some
officials warning that it could ultimately dampen their prospects.
But in the end, the consensus was that addressing the scandal was
unavoidable _ and that it was the most obvious issue around which
the Republicans could rally.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said in an
interview that even he had miscalculated the depth of the voters'
desire to hear no more about the scandal. ``I thought when all
their money came out in the last two weeks that we were gone,'' he
said. ``I just thought the money was going to kill us.'' He said he
had also been apprehensive about the last-minute scandal
commercials, even though others in the party had gleefully seized
on them as working to the Democrats' advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed they had spent a zillion dollars on research and
focus groups so the knew they ads would work before they put them
up,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans also said that while they enjoyed a huge
financial advantage, they were too lax in blanketing their money on
races where they had no chance in the unrealistic hope of setting
off a national wave of support for Republicans. But Democrats,
forced to preserve their resources, targeted their money more
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   For months many Democratic candidates complained that they could
not break through to voters because the press was so focused on the
scandal _ to the benefit of Republicans. But in the face of defeat,
losing Republican candidates offered the same complaint Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Robertson, a spokesman for Joe McCormick, a Republican
who was defeated in Albany, Ga. _ and who party officials had tried
to help by running one of the Clinton scandal spots _ said their
campaign was drowned out by the scandal. ``It took us out of the
race,'' he said. ``You couldn't talk issues. It motivated the
Democratic Party leadership at the state and national level to get
those people to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Smith attributed the Democratic wins less to
the Democrats' strategy itself and more to ``our ability to
capitalize on their miscalculations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said they were also jolted by the Democrats'
success in prodding people to the polls, and particularly by the
drive by the White House to focus on black turnout. For example,
party officials said they had calculated the exact number of votes
they needed to oust Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., and to counter
support from black voters in the district. The Republicans said
they met their goal but, because of an unanticipated outpouring of
support among blacks, the Republican, John S. Keadle, still lost by
20,168 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said his organization's
multi-million-dollar advertising drive ``saved a lot of seats that
we otherwise would have lost.'' Yet, he added, ``if I were to do it
over again, I probably would have moved some money off TV and moved
it into more turnout efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder added: ``The president and first lady and their entire
team, Jesse Jackson leading the team, turned out a huge
African-American vote, a block vote that turned out in large
numbers. Some of that was just fear tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, turnout on Tuesday was estimated at 38 percent of the
voting age population.
</P>
<P>
   While religious conservatives and other groups mounted
aggressive voter drives, Democrats appeared to benefit
significantly from a decision by labor unions to channel their
resources into get-out-the-vote drives rather than advertising
campaigns, as they did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went under the radar again,'' Lott said. ``They probably
spent more money _ and I think it was more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO distributed statistics from surveys of voters
leaving the polls which the federation said showed that voters in
union households comprised 22 percent of all voters on Tuesday, and
14 percent in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union members said they wanted to elect people who would focus
on solving the country's problems, instead of wasting time trying
to impeach Bill Clinton,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster
and consultant to the AFL-CIO. ``Seventy-five percent said that
that was a very important goal of theirs when they went to the
polls and decided how to vote.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the small turnout overall, many races were decided by
only a tiny pool of voters. If 9,537 people had voted differently
in six Congressional districts, Democrats would have won back the
House on Tuesday, according to Mark Gersh, chairman of the National
Committee for an Effective Congress, which provides demographic
data for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the gloating among Democrats, a similar shift in the
other direction may have preserved the Republicans' fragile margin
in the House.

NBA CHIEF CRITICIZES AGENTS IN LOCKOUT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern opened a new/old front in the labor
war Wednesday, fingering longtime agents David Falk and Arn Tellem
as the men behind the latest snag in efforts to end the lockout.
These two gents were also on Stern's hit list three years ago when
they led an unsuccessful attempt to decertify the union.
</P>
<P>
   This time it's the same old same old. Falk and Tellem are
arguably the two most powerful agents in terms of clientele and
stand to lose the most (we're using the word ``lose'' in relative
terms here) if there's a limit placed on the salaries of the
league's elite. Stern went so far Wednesday as to say he thought
the real union negotiators wanted to make a deal but that there was
pressure from the outside to prevent that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, with good reason, that the agents of players who
would be most affected by the high-end limitation have begun a
campaign to defeat any fair deal,'' Stern said. ``And their view is
that no matter how good the deal may be for 400 players, it won't
be allowed to fly if the top 30 can't have the ability to receive
unlimited amounts. And we're concerned that this entire arrangement
and deal is going to be held hostage by this attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The sides met Wednesday for less than two hours. They may or may
not meet Friday. League consigliore Jeff Mishkin said, ``We appear
to be even further apart than we've been. Nothing is happening to
bring us closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a not so subtle jab at the agents, Mishkin added,
``It's obvious that something external to our negotiations is
having an impact and preventing us from making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk did not return a call from the Globe. But he told the
Associated Press that Stern and his minions are simply resorting to
the familiar strategy of dividing the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered they think I'm running the union, but clearly,
what David Stern is trying to do is tactically divide us _ the
agents from the players, the high-salaried players from the middle
class,'' Falk said. ``This should be a wake-up call to the union to
stay unified and not let them divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem also did not return a call but told AP that Stern's
comments were ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's latest proposal would limit what a team could pay
to re-sign its own free agents. In the case of the younger free
agents, their first-year salary could be no more than 25 percent of
the overall cap (about $8 million), with 10 percent increases over
the ensuing five years. If a player had 7-9 years of service, he
could sign for 30 percent ($9.6 million), with 10 percent bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Among the league's up-and-comers, Falk represents future gold
mines Antoine Walker, Stephon Marbury, Allen Iverson, Keith Van
Horn, and Vin Baker, while Tellem has Kobe Bryant, among others.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be a small reservoir of goodwill building last
week. Each side agreed that there was what union attorney Jeff
Kessler called ``conceptual progress.'' There were luxury taxes and
escrow accounts and all sorts of creative financing vehicles on the
table. The only problem was that the sides were very far apart on
how the $2 billion pie should be divided. They still are. But until
Wednesday, no one was throwing any tomatoes. In fact, Stern said
one person on each team who understands the proposal could now talk
to players who have questions. That was a no-no before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also used the occasion to point out that the NBA's salary
limit mechanism would affect a small minority of players _ the true
superstars who re-sign with their own teams. Most of the others
would feel the pinch if there was no limit, he said. It was a
transparent attempt to get the so-called average players to rally
around the deal at the expense of the big-timers.
</P>
<P>
   He also said union chief Billy Hunter did not buy the league's
latest charge that Falk and Tellem were working to kill the deal.
The union did not issue a statement, although Hunter was quoted
after Wednesday's session as saying that ``we're just not going to
capitulate.''

U.S. WORKS TO WIN ALLIES' SUPPORT FOR USING FORCE AGAINST IRAQ  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, steadily and quietly,
built support Wednesday for the use of military force against Iraq
if President Saddam Hussein continues his defiance of U.N. weapons
inspections, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second day of meetings with Arab allies in the Persian
Gulf, Secretary of Defense William Cohen asked for and received
support for launching punitive strikes against Iraq if Saddam does
not back down, the officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, traveling with Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering
and the commander of American forces in the region, Gen. Anthony
Zinni, went to Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar. The Pentagon has refused
to disclose details of Cohen's meetings, including the topics he
has discussed with each country, but the officials said he has
asked some gulf allies to provide at least indirect support to
strikes, like granting permission for the passage of aircraft and
missiles through their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have the support we need for whatever option we
chose to take,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council met Wednesday to debate a resolution
expressing outrage at Iraq's decision, announced last Saturday, to
end all cooperation with inspectors searching out Iraq's chemical
and biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, introduced by Britain and expected to pass as
early as Friday, would not explicitly authorize the use of force
but simply demand compliance. However, the Security Council has
already authorized the use of force in previous resolutions
stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The new resolution would nonetheless underline the Council's
unanimous statement last Saturday condemning Iraq, while allowing
countries like France and Russia, which have been reluctant to
resort to force against Saddam, to avoid having to explicitly
threaten force.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton discussed the wording of the resolution during
a 25-minute conversation with President Jacques Chirac of France
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's spokesman, James Rubin, said Washington
would support any strong statement warning Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, we do not believe that an additional
authorization for the use of force is needed,'' he said. ``In our
view, previous resolutions provide an adequate basis for such a
step, if necessary. However, we would be supportive and expect a
clear, straightforward resolution which sends an unambiguous
message to Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's response to this confrontation has
contrasted sharply with previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   In last winter's showdown, the administration sent additional
forces to the Gulf region and sought to make a public case for the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials have said all options remained
open, it has kept its efforts low-key. ``We're not doing the
saber-rattling this time around,'' one official explained.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has 170 aircraft and 13 warships in the area,
led by the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower. Those forces are
far smaller than the 400 aircraft and 34 warships the
administration assembled during the last crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, however, has put more emphasis on the sea-based
weapons, doubling the number of cruise missiles in the Persian
Gulf. That means that Washington has not had to expend as much
effort seeking permission from gulf allies to launch strikes as it
did earlier this year.

FBI SEEKS VERMONT PROLIFE ACTIVIST IN DOCTOR CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST ALBANS, Vt. _ James Charles Kopp, a Vermont man with a long
record of anti-abortion arrests and apparent ties to radical
activists nationwide, is the subject of an FBI search in connection
with the killing of a New York abortion doctor last month.
</P>
<P>
   Even as FBI agents searched a Vermont home where Kopp once
lived, officials insisted he is only a material witness in the
shooting death of Dr. Bernard Slepian, the fifth in a string of
North American abortion providers shot in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators confirmed that a car owned by Kopp was spotted in
Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks prior to the murder, the first
definitive link between Kopp and the town where Slepian lived.
</P>
<P>
   Officials refused to release details of Kopp's past, emphasizing
in a statement that he is ``not a subject of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But to anti-abortion watchdog groups, Kopp, 44, is a familiar
character, a fringe activist with a twisted nickname _ ``Atomic
Dog'' _ and a record of arrests for anti-abortion violence dating
back more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   He first appeared on the radar screen outside the Ladies Clinic
in Pensacola, Florida, where he commandeered a truck and blocked
visitors from entering the driveway in 1986, Pensacola &UR;  &LR; Lt. Robert
Cotita said. He was arrested on two misdemeanor charges, disorderly
conduct and resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, during the surge of protests in Atlanta mounted
by the pro-life group Operation Rescue, Kopp was arrested again,
according to Mark Potok, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law
Center in Montgomery, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, he became known as part of a radical fringe,
Potok said. As protestors languished in jail, many of them for
refusing to give their real names, they formed a ``hardcore group''
of anti-abortion activists who later devoted their lives to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta was a turning point,'' Potok said. ``Kopp was in jail
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, he had moved north to St. Albans, according to
neighbors and police.
</P>
<P>
   And from 1990 to 1992, he apparently maintained his ties to the
anti-abortion movement, living in a farmhouse and participating in
occasional protests, according to Eric Kenny, a resident of the
home.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Wednesday that Kopp has been living recently in the
St. Albans area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Kenny said that his own parents may have joined Kopp in
protests held outside a Burligton health clinic that performed
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what was going on at the time, and there were a lot of
protests,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert White, a Vermont state police detective lieutenant, said
Wednesday that the black Chevrolet Cavalier seen near the Slepian
home had been traced to the Kenny home. A statement released by the
FBI said the car was owned by Kopp, and also said he owned a green
1977 Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   As the warrant for Kopp was announced, FBI agents descended on
the Kenny home, searching it for about 45 minutes Wednesday. They
did not appear to have removed any items by the time they left.
</P>
<P>
   Police are unsure how long Kopp lived in the home, White said.
Kenny said the bearded 44-year-old lived there until 1992,
returning only once, in 1994 or 95, to visit his parents. Kopp
still wrote occasional letters to his parents, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he moved to Vermont, Potok said, Kopp was ``well
known in the extremist fringe'' of the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   His nickname appears on the third page of the Army of God
Manual, an underground how-to book that includes instructions for
building bombs and harming abortion providers, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp's moniker _ ``Atomic Dog (you nuclear canine)'' _ is the
first dedication on the page, Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real player in the hardline fringe of the
anti-abortion movement,'' he said. ``He really made a name for
himself, and the Army of God Manual reflects that.''
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman said there is no evidence Kopp is linked to
Eric Rudolph, the fugitive suspected in the January bombing of an
abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. Rudolph, who remains the
subject of a massive search in North Carolina, also appears to have
ties to the Army of God.
</P>
<P>
   Potok could not confirm whether Kopp was at one time connected
to the Lambs of Christ, a well-known group of anti-abortion
protesters active in Vermont and upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   And some pro-life activists in northern Vermont said that if
Kopp was active in New England, he was not widely known.
</P>
<P>
   John Bolduc, a St. Albans prolife activist, said the FBI search
``is just as much a mystery to us as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never knew him,'' Bolduc said. ``We're very pro-life, but
that's about it. There are no high profile activites around here.''

<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ What does it take to get a job this winter at the
Daily Grind, a coffee shop on Bridge Street, this resort town's
internationally renowned shopping street?
</P>
<P>
   For an answer, Kaye Ferry, the owner, inhaled, then exhaled.
``Are you breathing?'' she asked the other day. ``Yes? You've got a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades of following laissez-faire housing policies are catching
up with Vail and as many as 2,500 jobs may go begging this winter.
The cause for a labor shortage in Colorado's most popular ski town
is as clear as the advertising lineage in a recent issue of The
Vail Daily. The newspaper printed 586 inches of classified
advertising offering jobs, but only 30 inches of housing
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Vail could ignore rising housing prices, content to
allow the members of its work force who live locally to dwindle to
30 percent. With the median price of a condominium here approaching
$300,000, a recent survey calculated that a worker would have to
hold down five full-time jobs at $10 an hour to live here. Bordered
on the east by a 10,666-foot-high Rocky Mountain pass, this town
historically draws its commuters from the west, from Eagle River
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the valley, warning signals about the housing crunch
have been obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Bureau of Land Management shortened maximum
stays in local campgrounds to one week, hoping to cut down on the
number of local workers who seemed to be on four-month camping
trips. Elsewhere in the valley, the town of Gypsum passed an
ordinance forbidding residents from renting their driveways out to
workers who lived there in campers.
</P>
<P>
   With Eagle County housing prices leaping by two-thirds in the
1990s, the class divide has become as stark as the Cordillera
development, $1 million houses sitting high on a bluff over a
trailer park inhabited largely by Mexican workers. The trailer
parks are vanishing, too. Since 1990 six trailer parks in the
county have been leveled to make way for more vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   But if Vail's wealthy residents were not overly worried about
the social hollowing of their town, the wake up call came when
business owners realized that business growth down valley was
diverting their commuting workers. In response, the Vail Town
Council approved last summer an an ambitious plan known as Common
Ground, to build 1,600 living units to rent or sell at subsidized
prices to local workers. But four neighborhood groups immediately
filed lawsuits challenging the plan, saying that it would build
housing on land originally earmarked for parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a bunch of elitist nimbies who don't want working
people,'' said Sally Jackle, leader of one of the neighborhood
groups. Acknowledging that a housing project ``would harm our
property values,'' she said the groups' guiding principle was,
``They should not build on parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that Vail Resorts, the area's largest employer, wants
local taxpayers to pay for housing its workers. Diana Donovan, who
served on the Vail Housing Task Force, said, ``Vail Resorts would
love to make the town of Vail build all their housing.''
</P>
<P>
   For business owners, however, the issue is urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Ogilby, a motel owner and member of the task force, said:
``Everybody's panicked because they don't have enough employees.
For the first time in my 30 years living here, housing is now at
the top of the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, Vail Resorts provides subsidized housing for about
30 percent of its peak-season work force of 4,400. That portion is
to rise to 45 percent by the year 2001, according to company
construction plans outlined by Andy Daly, the company president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ski industry, we are the leader in employee housing,''
said Daly. Indeed, Vail currently provides 77 percent of all
employee housing offered by ski areas in Colorado, according to a
recent survey by Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   The housing problem is only going to sharpen here and in other
mountain resort towns, predicted Myles Rademan, a resort consultant
in Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issues are the same in Canada, California or Colorado,''
Rademan said from Park City, a ski town which imports half of its
workers every day. ``It always gets down to a certain number of
people who say, `If you can't afford to live here, tough luck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the average age of a purchaser of a second home is
51, he said. With the aging of the baby boomers, about 78 million
people are to turn 51 over the next 18 years. Here, in Eagle
County, demographers forecast that the present population of 32,000
will increase by two-thirds over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the service business, you want people who are warm, fuzzy,
hands on,'' continued Rademan. ``If you ask people to commute 100
miles, it is not going to work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   With land in Vail selling for $1 million an acre, planners have
come up with novel sites for building worker housing. A proposal to
build apartments over Interstate 70 was discounted as too
expensive. Obtaining a few acres from the U.S. Forest Service was
discounted for fear of angering people who built homes believing
they would live next to a National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only affordable housing project that has not drawn
complaints is a mixed trailer park and apartment complex that is to
be built on an old gravel quarry site, 45 miles from Vail. Called
Two Rivers, the 391-unit complex is to be built on a historic flood
plain. The contractor promises to build Dutch-style dikes to
protect the development from the Colorado and Eagle Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In Vail, city authorities are scaling down Common Ground, hoping
to defuse the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado's tightest housing market _ 1.2 percent rental
vacancies in Eagle County _ continues to take its toll. Over the
last year, the Housing Task Force had to find replacements for two
members. They moved away because they could no longer afford to
live here.

DEMOCRATS MAKE SMALL COMEBACK IN STATE LEGISLATURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ELN-NATION-RDP; see also ELECTION-BUDGET-1STLD-NYT and
GRAPHICS-BUDGET-NYT.) 
(sw) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of mainly losing to Republicans in state
legislative races, Democrats managed a small comeback in Tuesday's
voting. In doing so, they strengthened their party's hand a bit
looking toward the crucial congressional redistricting process that
will begin after the 2000 federal census.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the same tide that helped Democratic candidates in
contests for Congress and governorships, the party's state
legislative candidates came out of the election in control of both
legislative chambers in 21 states, compared with 17 for the
Republicans. Control was divided in 11 other states. The remaining
state, Nebraska, has a one-house legislature that is nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats controlled 20 state legislatures going into the
election, just one more than the Republicans, who had steadily
strengthened their state capitol grasp during the previous 10 years
by snatching 11 legislatures from Democratic control. Going into
the election, 10 states had split legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In all, control of eight chambers switched on Tuesday to give
Democrats their 21-to-17 edge. Democrats took over the Senate in
New Hampshire, Washington and Wisconsin and the House in Indiana,
North Carolina and Washington. Republicans took control of the
House in Michigan and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really positions the party well for redistricting in
2000,'' Kevin Mack, the executive director of the Democratic
Legislative Campaign Committee, said of Tuesday's gains.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting is by no means the only important issue when it
comes to control of state legislatures, given the increased
governing responsibility Washington has been handing down to
states. But because redistricting occurs only once every decade, a
party that controls both legislative chambers in a state has an
advantage in the process, especially when the redrawing involves
high-stakes congressional district lines.
</P>
<P>
   And if the governor comes from the same party that controls the
legislature _ as does Florida's Republican governor-elect, Jeb
Bush, son of former President George Bush _ so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   A rough rule of thumb among political experts is that the party
that controls redistricting can tilt as many as one of every five
districts in its favor. In a state like California, which has 52
congressional districts, that would add up to at least 10 seats, a
hugely significant number given the narrow divide between Democrats
and Republicans in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans went into Tuesday's election with high hopes that
they would emerge in control, at last, of more state legislatures
than the Democrats. They have not enjoyed that edge since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, party officials were upbeat, insisting that the
long-term trend was toward Republican dominance and that Tuesday
was hardly a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to add to our numbers,'' said Tim Fitzpatrick of
the Republican National Committee. ``That, coupled with our
majority of governors, is going to put us in a position of strength
for 2000 and the first decade of the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the tide that seemed to be running for Democrats on
Tuesday, in that they did better than was anticipated, other
important factors helped decide many state legislative contests.
</P>
<P>
   In states like Arkansas, Michigan and Oregon, roughly half of
the seats at stake were open because of new term limits laws. Both
national parties, their sights set mainly on redistricting, thought
they saw special opportunity there since open seats are generally
easier to go after than occupied seats. So in the closing days of
the election, they poured in money, perhaps as much as $1 million
in all.
</P>
<P>
   Money is increasingly important in state legislative races, and
not just when redistricting looms. Until a few years ago, these
races were generally inexpensive, almost folksy affairs in many
places. But as states have gained more and more governing
responsibilities, state legislative jobs have become more and more
important and the campaigns have become more and more competitive,
more and more sophisticated and more and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republicans spent a record $3 million on
legislative races. In California, where expensive television
advertising sometimes seems to be the only way to campaign, state
legislative candidates were on the screen in many places along with
candidates for Congress and governor. In Texas, Republicans mailed
a million campaign flyers in an effort to capture 20 key
legislative seats held by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the legislators and governors elected on Tuesday will
still be in office when redistricting begins after the 2000 census
_ probably in 2002. But some will be up for re-election in 2000 and
some will be unable to run because of term limits, so Tuesday's
vote did not by any means end the fight for control of the nation's
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the long view, what happened Tuesday was neither a
great victory for Democrats nor a great loss for Republicans,''
said Constance Campanella, head of Stateside Associates, a
Washington-based consulting firm that specializes in state
government. ``Most incumbents managed to hang on, as they usually
do. I don't see any great change and certainly no great trend, not
yet. Let's see what happens the next time.''

JAPAN IS TRYING TO GET MOVING AGAIN, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Japan, whose eight-year slump has imperiled one of
Washington state's largest export markets, is trying harder to get
moving again, said Kazuo Kodama, the Japanese Embassy's counselor
for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   If he is right, it will be good news for Washington. Japan is
our largest trading partner. But according to state economist Chang
Mook Sohn, its share of our exports has slid for three years, from
25.3 percent in 1995 to 15.6 percent in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kodama spoke to journalists Wednesday in Seattle. He said it may
appear to foreign observers that the four-month-old government of
Keizo Obuchi has not done enough to clean up Japan's banking mess
and stimulate its economy. But he said it had actually done a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators sweated for two months to produce a new banking law,
which was put to the test Oct. 23 with the crisis of the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan. The bank was temporary nationalized, but
without a run of depositors. That is proof, Kodama said, ``that we
don't need to worry about any systemic crisis caused by a credit
crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodama predicted mergers among Japan's 18 large banks, shaking
up an industry that he said was Japan's most protected and
inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring consumer spending will be more difficult. The Japanese
are champion savers, and despite interest rates of nearly zero,
they have responded to tax cuts by saving them. To force them to
spend, the opposition party Komeito has proposed that the
government rebate coupons instead of money. Every adult would have
$100 to $300 in coupons that would become worthless unless spent.
</P>
<P>
   Kodama said the proposal was being taken seriously, though
people might just spend coupons and save the equivalent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is running up budget deficits not seen in U.S. peacetime
since the New Deal _ 35 percent of spending, a level reached here
in 1937. ``We have stopped trying to cut the budget,'' Kodama said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, at 4.3 percent, is low by U.S. standards but is a
record high to the Japanese. New-car sales have fallen for 19
straight months, and stock and real estate prices are both down
about 60 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat declined comment on why the yen jumped from 144 to
the dollar in June to 117 Wednesday. But he said that at 117,
Japan's currency ``does not give any more excuse'' for China to
devalue the yuan, an event that would be destabilizing in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Kodama said the United States ``has been very broad-minded''
about the trade deficit with Japan, and noted that the deficit with
China is now greater.
</P>
<P>
   Kodama was asked about the comment made here at the World
Affairs Council Sept. 30 by Chris Patten, former governor of Hong
Kong, that if the United States pulled back the Navy from the
Pacific, Japan would have its first nuclear test within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kodama shook his head. ``Farfetched,'' he said.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT BLAMING GOP FOR MAKING CLINTON THE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Christian conservative leaders, Tuesday's election was a
pivotal test of their political power. They poured millions of
dollars into key races, blitzed churchgoers with voter guides and
helped persuade Republican leaders to make the election a national
referendum on President Clinton's moral fitness for office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Democrats' strong showing, those same Christian
conservatives are blaming Republican leaders for making Clinton the
only issue. Republicans, they say, failed to hit hard enough on
abortion, vouchers for religious schools, homosexuality and school
prayer, issues that usually motivate their core constituency to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no clear conservative agenda coming out of the
conservative leaders in Washington, D.C.,'' said Randy Tate,
executive director of the Christian Coalition. ``The Republicans
tried to run a campaign solely on anti-Clinton sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, said:
``Dozens of candidates ran for the tall grass on values issues. And
the result was they demoralized their own base.''
</P>
<P>
   In several hard-fought races around the country, the candidates
backed by conservative Christian groups went down to surprising
defeats. They include Rep. Rick White of Washington state, who lost
to Jay Inslee, the Democratic challenger; Gov. Fob James Jr. of
Alabama, a Republican who lost to Lt. Gov. Donald Siegelman, a
Democrat; and Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina, a Republican
who lost to former state Rep. Jim Hodges, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to put a smiley face on it,'' said James C.
Dobson, the religious broadcaster and founder of Focus on the
Family, a conservative ministry based in Colorado. ``It was a
pretty resounding defeat in my view, especially when you have a
president mired in scandal who is facing possible impeachment
hearings. And the Republicans still could not make that case to
voters. That is pretty sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobson has been warning since February that religious
conservative voters would abandon the Republican Party if it does
not prioritize ``family values'' issues. Wednesday, Dobson called
for Republicans in Congress to remove Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi from
their leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team is losing you look at the coach _ and in this
case, we need to get rid of both coaches,'' Dobson said. ``They
lost their nerve at the end of the session. They caved in on
everything of importance to the pro-family and pro-life
community.''
</P>
<P>
   It was religious moderates and liberals, active in groups like
the Interfaith Alliance and People for the American Way, who
perceived that voters were disillusioned with the impeach-Clinton
approach.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way's new political action committee,
the Voters Alliance, spent about $2 million on an advertising
campaign with the message, ``Let's Move On.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the `Let's Move On' message did work,'' said
Michael Lux, senior vice president for political affairs of People
for the American Way. ``People who are tired of the focus on the
scandal, tired of the Republican obsession with impeachment, got
motivated to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Shields, president of People for the American Way, said
the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council had sent
out fund-raising letters and other mailings urging their members to
cast their votes to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disingenuous for them to now say they weren't pushing
this issue,'' Ms. Shields said. ``In many respects, they were the
ones driving it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, polls of voters leaving election places show that
some religious conservative voters, who usually vote Republican,
crossed over to vote for Democratic candidates. In 1994, about
two-thirds of religious conservatives voted Republican, and about
one-fourth voted Democratic, according to a poll commissioned by
the Christian Coalition. This year, only 54 percent of religious
conservatives voted Republican, while 31 percent voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this, some religious conservative
strategists say, is that the Democratic Party recruited
conservative anti-abortion candidates to run in districts where it
was clear a liberal could not win.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results were not all bleak for religious conservatives. They
regard the resounding passage of statewide initiatives banning gay
marriages in Hawaii and Alaska as significant, if expected,
victories. In Washington state's 2nd Congressional District, they
defeated Grethe Cammermeyer, a lesbian who was dismissed from the
Air Force National Guard because of her sexual orientation. And
they helped hold off challenges to stalwart Republican incumbents
who have backed the religious conservative agenda, among them Reps.
Helen Chenoweth of Idaho and John Hostettler of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these successes, said Ralph Reed, former executive
director of the Christian Coalition, ``There wasn't a lot of
ambiguity in the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought mistakenly _ and I'm not including myself in this _
that the Clinton scandals were a sufficient rationale for a
Republican majority,'' Reed said. ``And that was clearly a mistake.
People are looking for what you're going to do to address the
issues that affect their lives in a meaningful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, now a political consultant, said that in February, soon
after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, he wrote a memorandum
warning Republicans not to make the Clinton scandal the central
issue. Although most of his clients followed this advice, Reed
said, only about half of them won in Tuesday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically enough, Republicans made the same mistake during
the era of Clinton that Democrats made during the era of Reagan,''
Reed said. ``They were so blinded by their hatred of Reagan, and
Republicans have been so similarly blinded by their disdain for
Clinton, that they have spent all their time trying to bring down
his presidency rather than building around it. Democrats did the
same thing trying to bring down Reagan and Bush on the Iran-contra
scandal, and it didn't work.''

ABORTION ISSUE WORKS IN FAVOR OF WOMEN'S-RIGHTS CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out of all the political ads in the
multimillion-dollar barrage on New York television, the one
featuring Emily Lyons may be remembered the longest and credited
with doing the most damage to Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be the same again,'' said Lyons, a registered
nurse who was maimed last January when a bomb exploded in the
Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic where she worked. The ad, paid
for by an abortion-rights group, targeted D'Amato's 1994 vote
against legislation to give federal protection to abortion
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato got trounced Tuesday in his bid for a fourth term by
Democratic Representative Charles Schumer, and D'Amato's opposition
to abortion rights, cast against the Oct. 23 murder of New York
abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian, appeared to be one factor in
his defeat, analysts said. Schumer supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It walked voters right to Schumer,'' said Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which paid for the Lyons ad. ``After all his years of
aggressive assaults on a woman's right to choose, D'Amato has
finally paid the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights activists found a lot to cheer about Wednesday
as the abortion issue appeared to help, and in some races be
decisive, for candidates who support a women's right to an
abortion. They also hailed the defeats of ballot initiatives in
Colorado and Washington state that would have banned certain
late-term abortion procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Their adversaries in the anti-abortion movement were just as
adamant that despite the electoral setbacks, Republicans in
Congress would not retreat from efforts to end or limit abortions.
And they maintained that candidates who oppose abortion rights can
still depend on support from an army of single-issue voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Wednesday's election results were not as good as we had
hoped, pro-lifers are happy that we continue to hold a pro-life
Congress,'' said Carol Long, director of the National Right to Life
Committee's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, antiabortion forces lost as many as 10 seats
Tuesday, according to the Long. In the Senate, the balance of votes
for and against abortion rights didn't shift much, a disappointment
to those who hoped for the three more votes needed to override
President Clinton's veto of the bill banning late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Governor-elect Gray Davis and Senator
Barbara Boxer prevailed over their Republican foes, partly by
relentlessly labeling them as extremists for opposing abortion
rights. Boxer made a big issue of a $50,000 contribution that her
challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong, made to the Traditional
Values Coalition, an antiabortion group.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Democratic Senator Patty Murray appealed to
women to reject her opponent, GOP Representative Linda Smith,
because of her opposition to abortion rights. Murray won, carrying
61 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Democrat Blanche Lincoln won the open Senate seat
with backing from abortion-rights activists, who targeted state
Senator Fay Boozman, her GOP opponent. Boozman, an eye surgeon,
created a controversy when he suggested rape victims don't need
abortion rights because certain hormonal reactions protect them
from pregnancy during violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Governor Parris Glendening warned voters not to
believe Republican Ellen Sauerbrey when she promised her own
antiabortion views would not influence her policy making. With the
help of a huge gender gap, Glendening beat Sauerbrey more soundly
than he did in 1994, when Sauerbrey was harsher on the abortion
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates who support abortion rights defeated
incumbent Senator Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina and
Representative Mark Neumann in his Wisconsin Senate challenge _
both Republicans and abortion foes. But two Republicans who made
issues of their opposition to abortion rights _ Peter Fitzgerald in
Illinois and Representative Jim Bunning in Kentucky _ won Senate
seats Tuesday. Fitzgerald beat Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, a
favorite of abortion-rights and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion was not an issue that necessarily harmed Republicans
in 1998,'' said Linda DiVall, a GOP pollster. ``A number of
pro-life candidates ran and won, and Mark Neumann, while he lost,
made real strides on the abortion issue. In California, it does
look like abortion moved voters against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cullman, president of the Republican Coalition for Choice,
said the most significant result of Tuesday's elections was that no
incumbent GOP senator, House member, or governor who supports
abortion rights was defeated. Wednesday, in a letter to Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, she
implored GOP leaders to moderate the party's platform plank
opposing abortion rights before the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abortion issue and now family-planning issues are
hampering Republicans' ability to reach out to a broader audience
and, I fear, will impede our success at capturing the White House
in 2000,'' Cullman wrote. ``Women continue to turn their backs on
the Republican Party because they believe (it) wants to take away
their ability to control their own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiabortion groups Wednesday pledged to redouble their efforts
in the 106th Congress to pass two measures that stalled in the
105th: legislation to ban so-called partial-birth abortions, and a
bill to make it a federal crime to take a minor across state lines
for an abortion to avoid parental consent or notification
requirments.
</P>
<P>
   For the GOP Congress to back off on either one, said Douglas
Johnson, lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, ``would
be the very wrong response, and not what I expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the first time in three elections, abortion-rights
advocates said they were encouraged that candidates weren't afraid
to run on the issue or label their opponents as out of the
mainstream for opposing abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a real victory for pro-choice America,'' said Michelman,
whose group put $2 million into this fall's races. ``While the
House and Senate remain in control of anti-choice majorities, it's
Republicans who have the problem. Their position causes schisms in
the party and puts them fundamentally out &UR;  &LR; of step with most
voters.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Deflation is scary. The last time prices nose-dived throughout
the economy was during the Great Depression. Then government stood
by helplessly as wages and prices plummeted and over a quarter of
the labor force stood desperately in unemployment lines.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that investors cringe at the word
``deflation.'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, recently warned that ``deflation from the Far East is
heading our way.'' Many analysts now echo the deflation theme.
Charles McMillion, chief economist of MBG Information Services,
wrote last week in The New Republic that deflation ``could happen
again soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But predictions of deflation amount to little more than blather.
The experts who dwell on deflation can point to no data that show
prices are generally falling. Nor can they point to evidence that
across-the-board price cutting is likely to break out in the
future. Most important, deflation has not reached the all-important
sinews of labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions of deflation miss the key difference between today
and the 1930s: a Federal Reserve no longer asleep at the monetary
switch.
</P>
<P>
   First, the data. This year, as in most other years, prices in
some individual industries are falling. Energy prices have dropped
almost 10 percent in the last year. Commodity prices have dropped
by about 20 percent in the last year. The prices of raw materials,
clothes and other imported goods have also declined, partly in
response to the economic collapse of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But other prices are more than making up for the slack. Producer
prices, excluding energy and food, are rising about 1 percent a
year. Consumer prices are rising by about 2 percent a year. These
rates are small. But they are nowhere near negative.
</P>
<P>
   Look to the labor market, which drives the formation of prices.
Over the last year, wages and salaries have been rising about 4
percent a year. Nothing in economic logic or history suggests that
wages will suddenly reverse course. Indeed, even if recession
strikes, wages will almost certainly continue to rise, as they have
in every recent downturn.
</P>
<P>
   And if wages do not fall, prices will almost certainly not fall
either. Labor costs typically account for two-thirds of the cost of
producing goods and services. In general, wages and prices move up
and down together.
</P>
<P>
   They can move in opposite directions, however, in times of rapid
gains in productivity. If, say, workers are given the tools to
churn out 5 percent more each hour, then the extra output would
yield enough new revenue to allow the company to pay workers 5
percent more even without raising prices. The company could even
cut prices a few percent and still have enough extra revenue to
pass along to workers as higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   But productivity is now rising by less than 2 percent a year.
That provides no room for prices to fall if wages continue to rise
anywhere near their current 4 percent clip. As Martin Feldstein of
Harvard points out, ``Only in the extreme case of the economy
falling into a deep depression like that of the 1930s would the
level of prices actually begin a sustained decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are prices falling in any other industrialized economy
except Japan. Throughout Europe, prices are rising very slowly. In
developing countries, inflation rules nearly everywhere outside
China. Even in the decimated economies of Indonesia, South Korea
and Thailand, prices are rising rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   So why the frenzy over deflation? Robert Solow, Nobel laureate
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attributes some of
the chatter about deflation to analytical confusion.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every industrialized country, the official task of
the central bank is to achieve price stability, or roughly zero
inflation. At least since the reign of Paul Volcker in the 1980s,
Fed chairmen have been measured by their ability to get inflation
down. With prices rising by only 2 percent a year, Greenspan has
come close to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Solow observes, ``if average prices are not changing, then,
to a rough approximation, half the prices must be falling, while
the other half must be rising'' in order to keep the price index
relatively level. To invoke the specter of specific price cuts for
oil, apparel and computers as harbingers of deflation is, by this
argument, to confuse economics with algebra.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not experienced deflation since the 1930s.
But though economic historians continue to debate the underlying
cause of the Great Depression, they do not dispute the simple
proposition that deflation was then, and will almost certainly be
in the future, a monetary event. Translation: Prices can only
continue to fall if people are given fewer and fewer dollars to
spend on good and services.
</P>
<P>
   This is the flip side of the commonplace proposition that
inflation can rage only if people are given more and more dollars
to spend by the Fed. In the 1930s, the Fed committed the fatal
mistake of sitting back while banks closed and the supply of money
shriveled.
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that the Fed would make the same mistake
today. If, as Greenspan fears, deflation forces drift ashore from
Asia, the Fed has an ironclad remedy. It needs only to step on the
monetary pedal, as it has already begun to do cautiously by
lowering interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of economic forces to fear. Recession.
Inequality. Productivity slowdown. In each case, living standards
are at risk and government cannot perfectly anticipate what to do
and when to act. But deflation isn't worth fretting about unless
you believe that the United States will suffer a once-in-a-century
catastrophe and the Fed will play dumb.

BLACK VOTE HELPS DEMOCRATS IN QUEST TO WIN BACK HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the frost began to lift last spring, several
members of the Congressional Black Caucus sat down and charted the
House districts Democrats had won or lost, and calculated the
percentage of the African-American vote in each.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, polls and focus groups were done to analyze issues
voters care about. The goal: To try to win back the House by
increasing black voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, those Democrats came close.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in essence, a stealth campaign that in the final hours
included cashing in on President Clinton's popularity among
African-Americans by using his voice on a recorded message left on
answering machines in many black households.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose approval among blacks has no rival even among the
national black leadership, concluded his message by telling voters,
``The power is in your hands _ encourage your friends and families
to got to the polls and cast your vote for the Democrats and for
our future! Thank you for your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely on the strength of higher-than-normal black voter
turnout, especially across the South, and with help from Hispanics
and organized labor, the Democratic Party picked up five of the 11
seats it needed to recapture the House from the Republican majority
and denied the GOP an expected gain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats turned out their base and energized their
base,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.``They did a better job
than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Linder of Georgia, who heads the House
Republican Campaign Committee, said Clinton, First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Jesse Jackson ``turned out a huge
African-American vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election that witnessed its lowest turnout since 1942 _
36.1 percent of the electorate, according to Curtis Gans, the
director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
While overall black turnout remained lower than the national
average, it increased enough to become the fatal weapon against
Republicans hoping for larger gains in many statewide and
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, African-American turnout went up, or at least
turned out,'' explained Gans, who specializes in tracking
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In states the Democrats targeted for Clinton's phone message,
including Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, New York,
Nevada, California, and Maryland, the black vote proved decisive in
many races, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, black turnout climbed about 50 percent
from the 1994 election _ 30 percent compared with 19 percent. The
turnout was crucial in electing a Democratic governor, returning
two black Democratic members of Congress in majority-white
districts, and electing the South's first black state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black vote killed the Republicans in a number of House
districts and in the Deep South _ Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina,
North Carolina,'' said David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at
the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington.
``Who would have ever thought it would have been a bad year for
Republicans in those four states.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, where Democratic Governor Parris Glendening won
what was expeced to be a close race, the black vote jumped to one
in five of all voters this year, compared with one in eight in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the lopsided black vote for Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois _ 97 percent according to an MSNBC exit poll _ was not
enough to help her overcome defections from surburban white women
to retain her seat, Bositis said. She was the only black member of
Congress who lost in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 89 percent of African-American voters supported
Democratic candidates Tuesday night, an increase of 8 percentage
points over the 1994 midterm election, said the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said the increase was a result of six
months of unprecedented outreach to black voters. The outreach
included having members of the Congressional Black Caucus work with
white Democratic candidates to shape their message to black voters,
and loaning their staff members to assist in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We packaged this problem to try to get a historic vote,'' said
a Democratic strategist involved in the paty's efforts to take back
the House. ``It was not a presidential year, we knew black turnout
would be down. The other worry we had was the fact that
African-Americans are enjoying some small degree of prosperity, so
we had to turn up the volume, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the volume included a comprehensive media strategy
featuring Mrs. Clinton, conference calls with the president and
African-American clergy and political leaders, an unparalleled
effort targeting voters through black radio stations, and enlisting
the help of a range of celebrities, including radio talk show host
Tom Joyner, whose nationally syndicated program reaches some 6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson launched a one-man private jet tour that
made three or four stops a day for get-out-the-vote rallies in
various cities. Bob Johnson, owner of Black Entertainment
Television, dedicated an entire week of programming to urge blacks
to vote, and even took out a full-page ad in USA Today at a cost of
a quarter-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Walters, a political scientist at the University of
Maryland, said early exit polls show that blacks made up 11 percent
of all voters on Tuesday, up from 9 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Democratic efforts to target the vote,
Walters said another reason blacks turned out was to show their
support for the president. Even though ``Clinton was not on the
ballot, he was sure running, and most people understood that and
how the shape of this Congress would determine how they would treat
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Walters said, ``The Clinton scandal played to
good effect.'' Even recent reports that Thomas Jefferson had
fathered a child by his slave, Sally Hemings, may have aided
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president is some kind of lucky,'' Walters said.

   STOCKS GET EARLY BOOST FROM ELECTION BUT FADE
</P>
<P>
   Apparently buoyed by election results, stock prices jumped early
but then faded after investors showed little enthusiasm for an
offering of government bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average, up
as much as 148 points, barely managed to stay in positive territory
during an afternoon swoon before finishing with a gain of 76.99
points, or nine-tenths of a percent, at 8,783.14. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.83 points, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 1,118.67. The Nasdaq did better, rising 69.25 points,
or nearly 2 percent, to 1,823.57.
</P>
<P>
   BOND MARKET SUFFERS BIG DECLINE
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. bond market suffered the biggest decline in almost a
month as signs of stability in world financial markets sapped
demand at the Treasury's $12 billion note sale. The yield on the
30-year bond rose to 5.32 percent from 5.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT DENIES BULLYING APPLE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued at its antitrust trial that it had every right
to tell Apple Computer last year that it would stop producing word
processors and other software for Macintosh computers unless Apple
adopted Microsoft's browser as the default choice on its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Linkexchange, a closely held Internet advertising firm, will be
acquired by Microsoft in a $250 million stock deal, people close to
the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING OF THE GUARD AT LOEWS
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire brothers Laurence and Preston Robert Tisch said
they would turn over daily management of Loews, the diversified

BLACK VOTE HELPS DEMOCRATS IN QUEST TO WIN BACK HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the frost began to lift last spring, several
members of the Congressional Black Caucus sat down and charted the
House districts Democrats had won or lost, and calculated the
percentage of the African-American vote in each.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, polls and focus groups were done to analyze issues
voters care about. The goal: To try to win back the House by
increasing black voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, those Democrats came close.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in essence, a stealth campaign that in the final hours
included cashing in on President Clinton's popularity among
African-Americans by using his voice on a recorded message left on
answering machines in many black households.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose approval among blacks has no rival even among the
national black leadership, concluded his message by telling voters,
``The power is in your hands _ encourage your friends and families
to got to the polls and cast your vote for the Democrats and for
our future! Thank you for your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely on the strength of higher-than-normal black voter
turnout, especially across the South, and with help from Hispanics
and organized labor, the Democratic Party picked up five of the 11
seats it needed to recapture the House from the Republican majority
and denied the GOP an expected gain in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats turned out their base and energized their
base,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.``They did a better job
than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Linder of Georgia, who heads the House
Republican Campaign Committee, said Clinton, First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Jesse Jackson ``turned out a huge
African-American vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election that witnessed its lowest turnout since 1942 _
36.1 percent of the electorate, according to Curtis Gans, the
director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
While overall black turnout remained lower than the national
average, it increased enough to become the fatal weapon against
Republicans hoping for larger gains in many statewide and
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, African-American turnout went up, or at least
turned out,'' explained Gans, who specializes in tracking
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In states the Democrats targeted for Clinton's phone message,
including Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, New York,
Nevada, California, and Maryland, the black vote proved decisive in
many races, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, black turnout climbed about 50 percent
from the 1994 election _ 30 percent compared with 19 percent. The
turnout was crucial in electing a Democratic governor, returning
two black Democratic members of Congress in majority-white
districts, and electing the South's first black state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black vote killed the Republicans in a number of House
districts and in the Deep South _ Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina,
North Carolina,'' said David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at
the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington.
``Who would have ever thought it would have been a bad year for
Republicans in those four states.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, where Democratic Governor Parris Glendening won
what was expeced to be a close race, the black vote jumped to one
in five of all voters this year, compared with one in eight in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the lopsided black vote for Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois _ 97 percent according to an MSNBC exit poll _ was not
enough to help her overcome defections from surburban white women
to retain her seat, Bositis said. She was the only black member of
Congress who lost in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 89 percent of African-American voters supported
Democratic candidates Tuesday night, an increase of 8 percentage
points over the 1994 midterm election, said the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials said the increase was a result of six
months of unprecedented outreach to black voters. The outreach
included having members of the Congressional Black Caucus work with
white Democratic candidates to shape their message to black voters,
and loaning their staff members to assist in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We packaged this problem to try to get a historic vote,'' said
a Democratic strategist involved in the paty's efforts to take back
the House. ``It was not a presidential year, we knew black turnout
would be down. The other worry we had was the fact that
African-Americans are enjoying some small degree of prosperity, so
we had to turn up the volume, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the volume included a comprehensive media strategy
featuring Mrs. Clinton, conference calls with the president and
African-American clergy and political leaders, an unparalleled
effort targeting voters through black radio stations, and enlisting
the help of a range of celebrities, including radio talk show host
Tom Joyner, whose nationally syndicated program reaches some 6
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson launched a one-man private jet tour that
made three or four stops a day for get-out-the-vote rallies in
various cities. Bob Johnson, owner of Black Entertainment
Television, dedicated an entire week of programming to urge blacks
to vote, and even took out a full-page ad in USA Today at a cost of
a quarter-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Walters, a political scientist at the University of
Maryland, said early exit polls show that blacks made up 11 percent
of all voters on Tuesday, up from 9 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Democratic efforts to target the vote,
Walters said another reason blacks turned out was to show their
support for the president. Even though ``Clinton was not on the
ballot, he was sure running, and most people understood that and
how the shape of this Congress would determine how they would treat
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Walters said, ``The Clinton scandal played to
good effect.'' Even recent reports that Thomas Jefferson had
fathered a child by his slave, Sally Hemings, may have aided
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president is some kind of lucky,'' Walters said.

<P>
   The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye: Five Fairy Stories
</P>
<P>
   By A. S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12. These fairy tales
may be full of magic and quests, but they're also spun from
contemporary cloth as they explore the lives of characters who feel
imprisoned by their prescribed fate. ''Byatt is a storyteller who
could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for a thousand and
one nights,'' Nancy Willard wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Raban. Vintage Departures, $13. This English author
displays a quirky eye and restless energy in his account of a
two-year odyssey to American locales as varied as Alabama, Seattle
and New York, where he indulges in a full-scale cultural
deconstruction of Macy's department store. ''In an era of jet
tourism, he remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of . . .
Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Justin Kaplan wrote in these pages in
1991. ''He has a gift for vivid observation, description, anecdote
and personal encounter.'' Soft City (Harvill, $12), an earlier book
by Raban that has just been restored to print, is both a sharp
portrait of London and its comfortable middle-class young in the
1970's and a spirited defense of urban life. '' 'Soft City' shows
how, in the midst of physical decay, a city can flourish by
fulfilling an elemental human need, the need to play out fantasies
of self,'' Richard Sennett said here in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Iliad
</P>
<P>
   By Homer. Translated by Robert Fagles. Penguin, $15.95. This
translation of Homer's tale of the Trojan War is marked by free,
cadenced lines and simple, direct language that resembles real
speech. ''His narrative has real pace, it presses onward, leading
the reader forward with an irresistible flow,'' Oliver Taplin wrote
here of Fagles in 1990. ''His version is imbued with humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment: A Handbook
</P>
<P>
   By Charles L. Black Jr. Yale University, $6.95. In a guide
written during the Watergate era but reissued in the lengthening
shadow of the Clinton impeachment hearings, a constitutional
scholar stresses the need for caution and common sense as he
outlines the process for removing a President from office. In 1974
our reviewer, Mary Ellen Gale, called this an ''elegantly written,
lucid, intelligent and comprehensive handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   The Springs of Affection: Stories of Dublin
</P>
<P>
   By Maeve Brennan. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13. These 21 tales
by a former writer for The New Yorker who died in 1993 dwell on the
small joys, hurts and unrealized dreams tucked away in the
red-brick houses of a single Dublin neighborhood. ''Brennan's book
is full of small miracles presented in elegant but simple prose,''
Jay Parini wrote in the Book Review last year. The narrator of An
Irish Eye, by John Hawkes (Penguin, $11.95), is a 13-year-old
orphan whose bizarre adventures include a romance with an aging
World War I veteran and enslavement by the mistress of a manor
house. In 1997 our reviewer, Liam Callanan, called this novel ''an
engaging blend of genres and literary traditions . . . that
ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque.''
</P>
<P>
   My Brother
</P>
<P>
   By Jamaica Kincaid. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $10. In
reconstructing her brother's life and his death from AIDS in their
native Antigua, Kincaid refuses to romanticize her story, choosing
instead to follow the circular flow of her memory to portray death
as it really is, not as we might prefer it to be. The result is ''a
sustained meditation on the grinding wheel of family, with mother
always at the hub; on the countries of our past, both real and
emotional, which we have fled and in which we have felt like
strangers,'' Anna Quindlen wrote here in 1997. In Daughter of the
Queen of Sheba, by Jacki Lyden (Penguin, $12.95), a National Public
Radio correspondent recalls growing up in the Midwest as the
daughter of a manic-depressive woman whose delusional behavior was
dazzlingly bold and exotic. Last year in these pages, Caroline
Knapp said Lyden succeeds in ''vividly capturing both the horror of
her mother's illness and the seductive, transporting power of her
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of My Russian Summers
</P>
<P>
   By Andre Makine. Translated by Geoffrey Strachan. Scribner,
$7.99. This French novel by a Russian migr tells of how a
remarkable woman with a dual allegiance to her French past and her
Russian destiny endows her grandson with a sensibility that enables
him to endure life in the Soviet Union. ''Makine employs a highly
poetic voice to blend memory and imagination,'' Victor Brombert
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Croswell. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14. The history of
extrasolar planetary astronomy is one of frustration and false
promises, but advances in the 1990's have turned the field into an
exciting growth industry. '' 'Planet Quest' is of no practical use
whatever . . . but it is fascinating and worthwhile nonetheless,''
John Durant wrote in these pages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Leave It to Me
</P>
<P>
   By Bharati Mukherjee. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95. The heroine of
this raucous road novel is a misfit adoptee who sets off from
Schenectady, N.Y., to California on a vengeful (and ultimately
lethal) quest for her true parents. She is ''a brilliant creation -
hilarious, horribly knowing and even more horribly oblivious,''
Lorna Sage wrote here last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections,
congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who
was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition
party gains in an off-year election.
</P>
<P>
   The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility of
congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results
showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45
hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the
president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it
whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes.
The Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political
year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat
leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, amounted
to the smallest congressional majority since the
Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans
controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and
its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans on
the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness
Republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers he hoped to have
the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by
Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands and
put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment
Wednesday until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt
Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held
onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time
since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans
burned up the phone lines to each other, discussing whether to
mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males
running the Washington Republican Party,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans
this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We
need an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire
calendar year without an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut called the
election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are going to
be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party want
to see change.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton called the election results a
vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all the
results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American
people want their business, their concerns, their children, their
families, their future addressed here. That's what the messag e of
the election was.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first difficult questions now facing Congress is how
to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public
resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican
majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes
required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement
released Wednesday, Hyde said ``The Committee continues to have a
clear constituional duty to complete its work in a fair and
expeditious manner. Our duty has not changed becasue the
constitution has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results
guaranteed that impeachment will fail. ``I think any serious effort
to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he
said. ``It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on
an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island
Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously,
fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control of the
House with a 228-207 majority and to find consensus among their
party's competing factions. With their numbers reduced, the
Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing
act to unite a hard-core conservative faction that wants a more
aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their
party to return to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage.
The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and
moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking
control away from Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Already seeing some of the possibilities, Rep. Peter King of
Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be
strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership
and makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said. ``It's going to
weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the
anti-northeast conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging
from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically
uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the
results.

<P>
   ``Things were happening out there that none of us fully
understand--neither party in my judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his share of the blame for his party's losses, the
Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would
recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the modern media
world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes.
``I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people would
just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and
then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of
disgusting by sheer repetition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a result I think we probably underestimated the need to
really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting
taxes and saving Social Security, winning the war on drugs,
reforming education and national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted
mistakes, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message
in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that
Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt
his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of this lessons for Republicans out of this is that we
need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a
clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the
nation,'' he said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis
next year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file
lawmakers were making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount
challenges against the Republican leaders who have steered the
Congress since the Republican's assumed control four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican staffer said the House had become a
``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, ``The long distance
charges in Washington offices probably are going through the roof
today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that
something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington
Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well in New
York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas.'' And while Gingrich has
not gone out of his way to identify himself with the Republican
campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his
caucus knows he is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup
attempt against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his
own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him
remains a long-shot. But with House leadership elections now set
for mid-November, Republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in
their caucus had crossed ideological lines to moderates like Shays
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got shellacked,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a
conserative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves because we had no
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were discussing possible challenges to Gingrich, his
second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members of the senior
leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run an entire new
ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee
chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, an
Oklahoma conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the
speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly concerned.''
Republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early
December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges
against mid-level leadership figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators expressed particular pique toward the
re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who
poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying to defeat
the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he
had talked to more than eight senators, and was considering whether
to challenge McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election
outcome. ``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a
very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Most incumbents coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will
not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince
Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of
Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of
Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid _ Rep. Jay
Johnson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22
Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, a
Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final
victory announcement was not expected until Friday after absentee
ballots are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the self-proclaimed ``revolutionaries'' of the Republican
class of 1994, many of the newly elected members are career
politicians who rose through the ranks of local and state
government. Three of the Democrats are the sons of former
lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who
represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other
Udall brother, Stewart, a former Congressman and Secretary of the
Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who o won the Texas seat of his
father, Henry.

 &HT;    Turnout by blacks helped lift Democrats
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A ripple of anxiety swept through the ranks of
Democratic strategists on Election Day afternoon as they got wind
of the first round of exit polls in Georgia, indicating a black
turnout of 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was far more than they had hoped for. In the closing days of
this year's campaign the Democratic Party made an unprecedented $30
million investment in efforts to drive up turnout among
African-American and other minority voters in this and other
states.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, according to Democratic state Chairman David Worley,
every identified African-American household received a minimum of
two pieces of targeted mail and three phone calls paid for by the
party: automated messages from U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney and
President Clinton, followed by a personal call from a party worker.
</P>
<P>
   But the 28 percent result _ it later rose to 30 percent in the
final poll numbers _ was so far above previous black turnout
levels, the strategists were concerned that the entire exit poll,
which showed Roy Barnes leading in the governor's race, might be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They need not have worried.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, the turnout effort was a major factor in the
Democrats' success. In Georgia, the Republican strategy of making
an issue of affirmative action and the way the city of Atlanta is
run played right into Democratic hands and made the effect of the
heavy black voting even more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that the African-American
community was more energized, more angered, more insulted than I've
seen in the 20 years I've been in Atlanta,'' Mayor Bill Campbell
said Wednesday. ``We are not monolithic, except when we are
monolithically insulted as we were in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts think the actual turnout of black voters in Georgia was
probably closer to 25 percent to 27 percent, but that is a giant
leap over the levels of 19 percent in 1994 and 22 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the exit polls, Democrats got 90 percent of that
vote, lifting to victory two of the three black statewide
candidates _ Attorney General Thurbert Baker and Michael Thurmond,
the labor commissioner nominee _ and giving other Democratic
candidates a much more comfortable margin than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the state's four largest counties demonstrates in
dramatic fashion how turnout affected the governor's race. In Cobb
and Gwinnett, Guy Millner got about 42,000 votes more than Roy
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In Fulton and DeKalb counties, which have the state's largest
African-American populations, Barnes drew 110,000 votes more than
Millner. It has been decades since a Democrat has had such a wide
lead in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia may have shown the biggest turnout of black Democratic
voters in the South, but results elsewhere also were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina where, according to CNN, the national party
spent more A Republican moderate, by contrast, said the party's
obsession with mollifying conservatives hurt its showing on
Tuesday. ``We need a new direction, one where we can ... become
more centrist and not deal with issues that we know will be
defeated in the Senate in order to placate a certain group,''
Maryland Rep. Constance Morella said.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Dobson and Morella pointed up the delicate task
that confronts whoever leads the Republicans in the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich aides tried to stress the speaker's importance to the
party by noting that the speaker campaigned in 207 congressional
districts in the past two years and raised $75 million to $80
million for GOP causes.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans and analysts suggested Gingrich might
escape a direct challenge, but that other members of the leadership
team may not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder of Georgia, Gingrich's handpicked chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, the panel that
raised money for congressional campaigns, acknowledged that some
colleagues may try to make him the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he intends to fight for his job, Linder replied,
``You got it.'' He said he expects to serve another term as the
campaign committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for someone to blame, ``Linder could be the one to
take the hit,'' speculated Alan Abramowitz, professor of political
science at Emory University. ``It's just like the Atlanta Braves
losing. There's been a shake-up on the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House members indicated Gingrich's longtime political
adviser, Joe Gaylord, also could come in for criticism. Gaylord,
who receives a $3,000-a-month retainer from the House campaign
committee, is as close to Gingrich as anyone in Washington. He
frequently travels with the speaker and is in daily contact with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt and Joe go back a long ways,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston of
Georgia, anticipating what could be a messy intraparty political
fight. ``Of course, Newt and John go back a long ways too,'' he
added, referring to Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said he has heard that House Majority Leader Richard
Armey of Texas and Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican
conference chairman, may have competition for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're welcome to it, if they're big enough to take it,'' a
defiant Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gingrich and Linder struggled to explain how things turned
out so poorly for Republicans. Linder had for months talked about
an ``October wave'' that Republicans could catch and ride to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an October wave, but it went the other way,'' Linder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said there were myriad factors involved in the election
outcome, but he conceded that Republicans misjudged the public's
reaction to President Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said most of the blame rests not with the Republican
party, but with the media and its saturation coverage of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't understand that people would get frankly fed up with
the existence of the topic,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The party launched a $10 million ad blitz in the final days of
the campaign that featured commercials that played on Clinton's
relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Gingrich said, Republicans should have focused
more on touting large tax cuts and long-term reform of Social
Security, issues he pledged to press in January.
</P>
<P>
   Linder also said the ads had little effect on the election. One
analysis found that of the 30 districts in which the anti-Clinton
ads ran, Democrats captured 18 races.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging he is defensive about the campaign committee's
work, Linder said he raised more money for Republican House
candidates than any previous chairman. And he asserted that without
the $30 million or so in issue advertising that ran in selected
districts across the nation, ``We would have lost our majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston, Linder's and Gingrich's fellow Georgian, said far too
many things went wrong for Republicans coast-to-coast to blame any
one person. He said he would stand with Linder in the event he's
challenged.

 &HT;    GOP eager to finish hearings
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House Republicans recovered from their Election
Day hangovers, the big question Wednesday on Capitol Hill was what
would happen to the impeachment inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Losing five House seats Tuesday left many Republicans feeling
uncertain about their party's decision last month to open an
impeachment inquiry into whether Clinton lied, obstructed justice
and tampered with potential witnesses in an effort to conceal his
adulterous affair with Monica Lewinksy. The prevailing belief among
lawmakers was that the hearings should be completed as quickly as
possible to prevent further political damage as the party begins to
eye the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public has spoken and they are saying enough is
enough,'' said Rep. Constance Morella (R-Md.), who is known for her
moderate views. For example, the last-minute Republican ads playing
up the president's dishonesty in his affair with Lewinsky merely
``ignited the fires of passion among Democrats,'' Morella said. ``I
think the Republican Party will have to go through a re-examination
and rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political scientists say Democrats were successful Tuesday
because they were able to portray the Republican Party as ``the
party of wasteful investigations'' and themselves as the party of
``issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that the White House and House Democrats intended
to continue to deliver that message in an effort to expedite the
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is this: Do Republicans come back into town
chastened and ready to acknowledge the obvious and overwhelming
sentiment on this matter?'' asked Jim Jordan, spokesman for the
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. ``Or do they come back
even more obsessed, even more vindictive, even more petulant?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that he felt a certain amount of
vindication from the election results. ``The lesson all people
should draw is, the people who were rewarded were rewarded because
they want to do something for the American people,'' Clinton said.
``I think it is a vindication of the politics and of the general
policy of putting partisanship behind progress and of putting
people before politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the election impact on the impeachment process,
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the committee, issued a
three-sentence statement, saying the panel would ``continue to have
a clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and
expeditious manner. This was true before the elections as it is
today. Our duty has not changed because the Constitution has not
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is expected to announce a game plan for the committee as
early as today in Chicago. The first hearing, conducted by the
subcommittee on the Constitution, is scheduled for Monday and will
include testimony from Griffin Bell, the Carter administration
attorney general who is now a lawyer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings focused on the findings of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report could begin as early as Nov. 16 and be completed by
the end of the year, said Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.), who has
been working to forge a bipartisan alliance on the ideologically
divided committee.
</P>
<P>
   The list of witnesses is changing on a daily basis, but members
say they have asked Hyde to hear from Lewinksy, the former White
House intern; Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary;
Bruce Lindsey, confidant and aide to the president; and Sydney
Blumenthal, another White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public is clear, they want us to conclude it,''
Hutchinson said. ``I believe they expect us to keep our commitment
to conclude this by the end of the year and I am reinvigorated to
keep that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Few lawmakers feels the impact of losing seats to the Democrats
the way Georgia's Republican Rep. Bob Barr does. After all, Barr
was the first to call for the president's impeachment last fall,
well before the Lewinsky scandal first broke in January.
</P>
<P>
   A somber Barr said he was disappointed by the loss of seats
because it increases the openings for lawmakers to find a reason to
abandon the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the last year has shown, it's been difficult even under
good circumstances to really get members to focus on the
substantive needs for moving forward with an impeachment process,''
Barr said. ``As we have now lost votes and reduced our majority, it
will be even more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr said he has faith in Hyde to keep the process moving.
Looking at the results, Barr blames his own party leaders for
failing to articulate and deliver a clear message to voters about
the need for an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never consistently and clearly identified for the American
people why this is essential,'' Barr said. ``We had an obligation
to define it clearly, not just throw it on the table and walk away
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative analyst Arianna Huffington sees the vote as an
indictment of both Clinton and the Republican-led Congress. Exit
polls showed disenchantment with the president's personal behavior
as well as with the way Congress is handling the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pox on both houses,'' said Huffington. The question now
is whether Congress should even continue, she said. ``The
Republicans have forfeited their moral authority and I think the
votes show a backlash from the Republican base.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bibby, a professor of politics at the University of
Wisconsin, said the election was about local issues, not
impeachment. Democrats should be careful not to see this as a
vindication of Clinton's behavior., he said, citing polls that show
55 percent of the public supporting the way the president handles
his post, yet 61 percent viewing him personally in an unfavorable
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public prefers this to just go away,'' Bibby said. ``What
that means for Congres is that there will be greater pressure on
Hyde to cut this short and get it over quickly.''

 &HT;    Millner's third bid at office adds to trend of diminishing
returns
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Guy Millner's third bid at statewide office was a case
of diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' choice to lead their charge against the
Democrats' 130-year dominance of the governor's mansion carried 40
counties, about half as many as he did in his first bid for
governor in 1994 and about two-thirds his total in an unsuccessful
bid for U.S. Senate in 1996. In total votes, Millner's margin of
defeat Tuesday was more than four times as much as either of his
two previous races.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to have happened here is he hit his ceiling,'' said
Emory University political scientist Merle Black. ``Millner ran a
lot weaker than he'd done in his two previous tries. It was a
pretty dreadful attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Rusty Paul said party strategists are
still scratching their heads to figure out where polling that
showed Millner locked in an extremely tight contest, or even
slightly ahead of Gov.-elect Roy Barnes, went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   High voter turnout, and an energized black electorate, certainly
contributed. Overall turnout apparently eclipsed the projected 45
percent, and exit polls suggest black voters accounted for almost
three in 10 ballots cast. But Paul says voters across the state and
country voted against Republicans to send a message against
negative and non-issue-oriented campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of Georgia county-by-county returns may not give
a final diagnosis of the cause, but it does give a clear view of
the symptoms behind Millner's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Usually dependable Republican doughnut counties around metro
Atlanta weren't as reliable as Millner needed them to be to counter
the black turnout and heavy voting from Democrats in south Georgia.
Millner carried the GOP's traditional key to victory, Cobb County,
by 51 percent, prevailing over native Cobb County son Roy Barnes by
a mere 11,000 votes. By comparison, U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, who
also ran against Cobb resident Michael Coles, won his re-election
bid and carried Cobb by about a 36,000-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
   Millner declined to answer questions about the defeat Wednesday,
saying only that ``some things we would have done a little bit
differently, some things we would have done more of, some things
less. I'd rather set high goals and fall short than to live on the
edge of mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-time rule of thumb for Republicans is that carrying
Cobb by 60 percent is mandatory for a statewide victory. And even
though strategists said that yardstick wasn't particularly accurate
because of the Barnes' residency factor, Millner still failed to do
what was needed elsewhere: score big in newly-emerging Republican
counties to make up the difference in Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   In Gwinnett County, the next GOP linchpin behind Cobb, Millner's
margin of victory was a third off his 1996 pace. A similar pattern
emerged in some coastal suburbs. Millner's margin also sagged in
conservative north Georgia mountain communities expected to bolster
his returns. Millner carried Stephens County, for example, by 1,000
votes two years ago, only to lose it by about 200 votes this year,
unofficial returns show.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Republican Mitch Skandalakis
also suffered from poor vote totals, even among the counties he
carried. In Pickens County, Skandalakis won by the narrowest of
margins _ two votes. He carried only 19 of Georgia's 159 counties
against Democrat Mark Taylor. Taylor even carried Fulton County by
more than 45,000 votes, despite Skandalakis' position as Fulton
County commission chairman.

 &HT;    Glenn orbit No. 3 a no-no, says wife, NASA chief
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ John Glenn got the word Wednesday
from space agency chief Dan Goldin himself: Forget about making any
more space flights.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who is making his second space flight since becoming the
first American to orbit the earth in 1962, has repeatedly dodged
questions about his desire for a third trip, deferring the decision
to his wife, Annie.
</P>
<P>
   NASA administrator Goldin delivered her answer to Glenn during a
CBS-TV interview with Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I ask you a few questions, I have a few messages. First
from Annie: `You ain't goin' up again,' '' Goldin told Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, floating in the middeck with mission commander Curtis
Brown and pilot Steve Lindsey, laughed at the remark. But he came
back to the subject later, when Goldin joked that some of the
effects of space flight on Glenn might be to cause hair to grow on
his head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be something. Maybe you'll just have to put me up on
another mission whether Annie wants it or not, so I can grow more
hair,'' the 77-year-old former Ohio senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Glenn doesn't appear likely to get any extra time in
space on this mission. Flight director Phil Engelauf said the crew
has worked so efficiently the orbiter has saved about 20 hours'
worth of its fuel-cell supplies for generating electrical energy,
but that's not quite enough to give the crew a full extra day in
orbit, plus a two-day safety reserve.
</P>
<P>
   And the remnants of Hurricane Mitch, expected to bring
thunderstorms to Florida today, should be out of the way in time
for Discovery to land at Kennedy Space Center on Saturday as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather actually looks fairly promising for Saturday,''
Engelauf said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Spartan satellite back in the payload bay and
experiments going smoothly, Discovery's astronauts held a number of
video conferences with earth on Wednesday, including one with NBC's
Tonight Show host Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Taping his show that will air Wednesday night, Leno asked Brown,
``Does Senator Glenn keep telling you how tough it was in the old
days?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when he's awake,'' Brown quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever threatened to turn the space shuttle around and
go home, Senator Glenn, if these kids don't behave themselves?''
Leno asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a working stiff up here on this particular flight,''
Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown proved that astronauts have a sense of humor by
stealing the show from Leno. After Lindsey turned upside down to
demonstrate weightlessness, Leno remarked, ``That's what our band
is like most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Curt promptly replied, ``Yeah, we've heard 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the lantern-jawed Leno asked about the view from space,
Brown said, ``Actually Jay, every time we fly by California, we see
your chin.''

PAULA JONES LAWYERS SAID TO BE QUITTING THE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Va.)  (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual
misconduct lawsuit against President Clinton have grown annoyed
with her settlement demands and have told her they will soon
withdraw from the case, a friend of Ms. Jones and lawyers involved
in the discussions said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The impending departure of her lawyers, who are based in Dallas
and Charlottesville, Va., may weaken her position as she seeks a
settlement to drop the lawsuit, which led to Clinton's
confrontation with Congress over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, although Abe Hirschfeld, a New York real
estate magnate who announced on Saturday that he would put $1
million in an escrow account to help settle the lawsuit, he has
failed to do so. Hirschfeld, the Jones lawyers said, failed to wire
the money as he had explicitly promised to do in a written
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones did not respond to efforts to reach her but friends
said she and her husband, Steve, were surprised, even shocked, when
the lawyers told her on Tuesday night that they would be
withdrawing. It would be the second time that a team of lawyers has
left Ms. Jones after losing patience with her.
</P>
<P>
   Her current lawyers, like the previous lawyers, have laid out
enormous sums of money _ the previous lawyers claimed $800,000 was
owed them and the Dallas firm has said its fees totaled more than
$1.5 million. It is in the interests of the lawyers to have a
prompt settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in Tuesday night's discussions said Ms. Jones'
lawyers were troubled that she was, in their view, increasingly
unrealistic if not unreasonable about the amount of money she
should expect to receive in any settlement. Ms. Jones has said she
would withdraw the lawsuit for $2 million _ $1 million from the
president in addition to $1 million from Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have offered $700,000 to her and have made it
clear they are extremely reluctant to get involved in any
settlement that would include a contribution from Hirschfeld, who
is under indictment for tax fraud in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The event that seemed to have exhausted the patience of Ms.
Jones' lawyers was the meeting on Saturday in which Hirschfeld
handed her what appeared to be a check for $1 million in a
Washington hotel before television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The event was not attended by lawyers from the Dallas firm,
Rader, Fisher, Campbell &AMP; Pyke, and John Whitehead, president of
the Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville, who have been
representing her in court. Nonetheless, they signed an agreement
with Hirschfeld providing that he would wire the money to an escrow
account and they would assent to his condition that the money could
not be withdrawn until a settlement was reached with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, who has said he wants to speed a settlement to help
the country, has been notably inconsistent in explaining what he
would do. He has withdrawn his offer twice only to reinstate it,
gaining a fresh burst of publicity each time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawyers complained Wednesday that despite the ``media
fanfare'' on Saturday, Hirschfeld did not live up to his agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Hollenberg, Hirschfeld's lawyer, said in an interview
Wednesday that Hirschfeld had not wired the money as planned
because he became fearful that the Dallas lawyers for Ms. Jones
would seek to withdraw the money.
</P>
<P>
   Hollenberg said that instead of sending the money to an escrow
account, Hirschfeld had opened a line of credit for $1 million to
be used if there was a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawyers do not expect to withdraw from the case
immediately. If there were any breakthrough in negotiations with
Clinton in the next few weeks, the lawyers said, they could still
represent her.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has dismissed Ms. Jones' lawsuit but the matter
is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones has contended that in 1991 when Clinton was governor
of Arkansas and she was a state clerical worker she was summoned to
a hotel suite in Little Rock where he dropped his trousers and made
a crude sexual proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, Ms. Jones would have to find a new set of
lawyers to conduct the trial if an appeals court reinstates her
case. If it ruled against her, she would also need new lawyers
should she appeal that ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The impatience of Ms. Jones' lawyers parallels a similar dispute
in September 1997 when Ms. Jones balked at a possible settlement
with Clinton. Her lawyers then, Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert K.
Davis, asked the court to allow them to withdraw from the case
because Ms. Jones was unreceptive to an offer of $700,000 from the
White House. Ms. Jones said then that she did not care about the
money but that Clinton would not be offering an apology.
</P>
<P>
   She has since dropped the demand for an apology, her lawyers
said, because Clinton's acknowledgment of a sexual affair with
Monica Lewinsky have made that unnecessary. Public opinion polls
show that since Clinton's admission, a majority of people now
largely believe Ms. Jones' account.
</P>
<P>
   Each time that Ms. Jones has seemingly ignored the advice of her
lawyers she accepted the counsel of Susan Carpenter McMillan, a
California woman who befriended Ms. Jones and became her
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter McMillan was the first to embrace Hirschfeld as a
possible savior of the situation, even as Ms. Jones' lawyers in
Dallas and the White House were skeptical that he could play a
role. She declined to comment on the most recent developments.

 BofA Loses Arbitration Challenge  &HT;       
 By Harriet Chiang 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   In a big victory for consumers, a state appeals court has ruled
that Bank of America cannot force its credit card customers to
resolve disputes through arbitration, thereby giving up any right
to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision by the state Court of Appeal in San Francisco
affects 12.4 million customers who received notice in 1992 that the
bank was changing the terms of its account agreement, said James
Sturdevant, the San Francisco lawyer for the customers who sued the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said that  &LR; the bank had no right to impose
an arbitration clause without the consent of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original credit card account agreement provided
that ``all terms are subject to change,'' the court said that it
did not cover something as fundamental as a customer's right to
sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find no ambiguous and unequivocal waiver of the right to a
jury trial'' in the original agreement, wrote Justice Michael
Phelan for the three-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were notified of the change by a ``bill stuffer'' that
was included in their monthly account statements. This discreet
notice was intentionally meant to be overlooked by the customers,
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed to downplay the true significance'' of the
change, the court said, ``and to reduce the likelihood that
customers would notice and object to the new provision.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbitration clauses are becoming increasingly popular with
employers, banks, health maintenance organization and insurance
companies as a fast and efficient way to resolve disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say that the process _ which is largely
unregulated _ gives the company an unfair advantage. ``Almost all
of the important witnesses and evidence is under the control of the
corporations,'' said San Francisco attorney Cliff Palefsky, who has
challenged arbitration clauses in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that corporations are often repeat users of the system,
becoming ``more like clients of the arbitrators.''
</P>
<P>
   The damages awarded in arbitration also tend to be far less than
those awarded in the court system.
</P>
<P>
   But Sturdevant said his quarrel in this case was not with the
arbitration process but in the way Bank of America tried to impose
the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something terribly wrong with it when you try to force
it down somebody's throat who doesn't know about it and doesn't
consent to it,'' he said. ``That's illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the decision ``an unfettered victory for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America spokesman Peter Magnani said the company was
reviewing the opinion to decide whether to file an appeal with the
California Supreme Court. ``It's inconsistent with the trial
court's decision after a 17-day trial on the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by four bank customers as well as two
consumers groups soon after Bank of American began sending the
``bill stuffers'' to its customers in June 1992.
</P>
<P>
   After a 17-day trial, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Thomas
Mellon ruled in favor of the bank, saying that the change was
allowed under the original account agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon also said that public policy favored the bank and its
customers settling its disputes through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court had harsh words for this reasoning, saying
the judge ``glossed over the threshold issue of consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan said that the bank did not have a ``carte blanche to make
any kind of change whatsoever, as long as a specified procedure is
followed.''

BROWSER MEMOS POSE CHALLENGE TO MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also MICROSOFT-TRIAL)

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As late as last year, Microsoft Corp. was so
worried about Netscape Communications Corp.'s lead in Internet
software that its senior executives wanted to delay an upgrade of
Microsoft's Windows operating system to gain an edge in the browser
battle, according to internal Microsoft documents released this
week by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of Microsoft's defense in its antitrust trial is
that its Internet Explorer, or IE, browser is a seamless feature of
Windows _ not, as the government contends, a separate product
bundled with Windows in an effort to give it an unfair advantage
against Netscape. The origins of its product strategy, Microsoft
asserts, date back more than four years to a meeting of its
executives in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But internal Microsoft electronic-mail messages released this
week by the Justice Department seem to cast doubt on these defense
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, argues that the e-mail mostly supports its
legal case. ``It shows that they regarded browsing functionality as
part of Windows and were willing to delay an upgrade schedule to
deliver a superior product,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an e-mail exchange between two senior Microsoft
executives in January 1997 _ more than a year after the company
introduced its software for browsing the World Wide Web _ talks of
competing with Netscape as ``pitting browser against browser'' and
refers to ``browser market share as job 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange suggests that at that late date, within Microsoft,
the browser and the operating system were not viewed as a single,
seamless product.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail on Jan. 2, 1997, James Allchin, a Microsoft senior
vice president, writes to Paul Maritz, a group vice president and
the most senior Microsoft executive scheduled to appear as a
witness in the trial, ``I do not feel that we are going to win on
our current path.'' Later, he adds, ``I am convinced we have to use
Windows _ this is the one thing they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Allchin urges Maritz, ``If you agree that Windows
is a huge asset, then it follows quickly that we are not investing
sufficiently in finding ways to tie IE and Windows together.''
</P>
<P>
   The more tightly Internet Explorer can be entwined in the next
upgrade of Windows, Allchin writes, ``the more Netscape will be cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeating Netscape, the e-mail suggests, was such a priority at
Microsoft that it was seen to outweigh the impact a delay of
Windows would have on the computer industry. Sales of new personal
computers, hardware add-ons and software all typically surge in the
wake of an upgrade of Windows, part of the central nervous system
that controls more than 90 percent of personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying Windows to embed the browser, is ``the only thing that
makes sense even if OEMs suffer,'' Allchin wrote, referring to
``original equipment manufacturers,'' jargon for computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz shared that view. In a response on the same day, he wrote
that he saw ``little option'' but to fully integrate the browser in
the operating system, ``even if it means missing the OEM window'' _
the delivery time frame that would allow computer makers to install
the upgrade on machines for the 1997 year-end sales season.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows upgrade, code-named Memphis, was initially
scheduled to be released in August or September 1997. But its
arrival was delayed until June of this year, and it is called
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, Microsoft started hinting to software developers
and analysts at industry conferences that Memphis might be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never the reason given in public, but industry insiders
believed that the real reason Memphis was being delayed was to
totally integrate the browser and help Microsoft in its
life-and-death battle with Netscape,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford, N.Y.
``This e-mail does seem to be proof of what Microsoft's intentions
were back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Memphis was delayed even more than Microsoft had thought in
early 1997, partly as a result of Microsoft's $425 million purchase
in April 1997 of Web TV Networks, an Internet-via-television
service. Afterward, Microsoft also decided to include Web TV
software in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer is fully embedded in Windows 98, but the
company released a stand-alone version of its browser, Internet
Explorer 4.0, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has also said that it became company
policy after a meeting in April 1994 to ``make a big bet on the
Internet.'' Though few concrete plans were made that day, Microsoft
says, there was agreement that Windows should have built-in access
to the Internet, which eventually became its browser strategy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting occurred a couple of days after Netscape was
founded, and suggests, Microsoft says, that its main intention in
the browser battle was to improve its operating system _ not to
crush Netscape, as the Justice Department contends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an e-mail written on June 10, 1994, Steven Sinofsky, a
Microsoft executive who helped organize the April meeting, portrays
a company ambivalent about the Internet and not yet planning a
browser of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit,'' Sinofsky writes, ``that the thought of
`Internet evangelism' is a little like evangelizing water to
Noah.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes the Microsoft message for Windows 95 as ``all the
plumbing you need to connect to the Internet,'' mostly software
protocols for communicating on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sinofsky wrote, ``We do not currently plan on any other
client software, especially something like Mosaic.'' Mosaic was the
name of the browser developed by the programmers at the University
of Illinois, most of whom went on to help found Netscape. Even so,
Sinofsky added that Microsoft was ``investigating possibilities.''

 Cisco Profits Surge 35% In 1st Quarter  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Profits at Cisco Systems Inc. soared 35 percent in the first
fiscal quarter as the No. 1 computer-networking company continued
its aggressive push into the telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco beat Wall Street's estimates and earned $559 million (34
cents per share) on revenues of $2.59 billion in the first quarter,
compared to $415.7 million (26 cents) on revenues of $1.87 billion
from the year before. Analysts had expected Cisco to report
earnings of 33 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose company has been helped by a shift among major
telecommunications companies who are looking for new ways to handle
the increase of data traffic on their networks.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies have been choosing Cisco over rival companies,
such as 3Com Corp., for products that link computers and route and
manage data traffic efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the growth, Cisco Chief Executive Officer John
Chambers said the company plans to expand its workforce and add
between 1,100 and 1,300 new employees in the second quarter. About
500 of those will be workers it absorbs when it completes three
acquisitions that should close by January.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said most of the workers will be engineers, as well as
distribution and sales employees. The growth is not unusual for
Cisco, which added 1,350 employees last quarter. It has about
16,000 workers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter, Cisco took a one-time $41 million charge
for its $56 million purchase of American Internet Corp., a
developer of high-performance Internet infrastructure software.
After charges, the company earned $518 million (31 cents per share)
compared with $337 million (21 cents) on a diluted basis a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, the company said it will
take a second-quarter charge of 12 cents to 21 cents a share for
three acquisitions it expects to close during the quarter, which
ends in January.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Cisco continues to fare well, even as it faces an
aggressive challenge from competitors like Lucent Technologies Inc.
and Northern Telecom, which are moving into the networking
business.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the No. 1 provider of networking equipment and
sells mainly to large businesses that want to link computers to
data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said growth was strong in the service provider
business. He said the first-quarter results demonstrate just how
important the Internet has become to the business world.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the Internet is being accepted as a key
economic driver that will level the playing field for businesses,
countries, and individuals in the Internet Economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco reported its earnings after the market closed. Its stock
ended the day at $65.56, up $2.19. In after-hours trading, the
stock hit $66.50.

 High-Tech Shop Class  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Alice Lee was a first-year medical school student at Stanford
University until recently. Now she shops for Beanie Babies on the
Internet.
<P>
   It's her job. But it's a little hard to explain to her parents
and friends because until six months ago, such a job didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of business on the Internet has spawned whole new
kinds of work on the Web _ Web masters, designers, site producers,
site reviewers, hosts and even professional surfers.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Web shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten hours a day, five days a week, a small group of
twentysomethings works at folding-table desks inside the Santa
Clara headquarters of mySimon Inc. The seven-month-old startup
makes a search engine for online comparison shopping that relies on
``intelligent agents'' _ software that finds and retrieves specific
information on the Internet and delivers it to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Web shoppers are SPIs, or Simon Product Intelligence
operatives. Their mission: training the agent software to shop.
Although the 15 SPIs appear to be aimlessly surfing, each is
actually doing research into particular product categories and
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   By shopping at  &LR; www.beanienation.com  &LR; the way a Beanie Baby
collector might, they teach the agent how and where to search, what
to look for and what information to bring back. Data that the SPIs
enter is used to program mySimon software to work for a real
shopper, quickly scanning dozens of online merchants to produce a
list of where to buy the sought-after item.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than medical school,'' said Lee, 28, who is taking
time off from Stanford. &UR;  &LR; She's also shopped for pasta and pasta
sauces, spices, soups, computer monitors, perfumes and colognes,
teddy bears, garden tools, fitness equipment and ``almost
everything golf'' _ apparel, bags, gifts and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do play a little golf. But I didn't know there was so much
for golf you could buy on the Web,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The end product is  &LR; www.mySimon.com &LR; , where users can shop for
just about anything sold online, including digital cameras, dahlia
bulbs, gourmet coffee and faux-fur bikini underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which officially launched on October 26, has data on
some 10 million products carried by more than 800 merchants. In its
first week, the site generated more than five hits every minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like to shop,'' said Pius Lee (no relation to
Alice), who quit a Wall Street job to become a mySimon shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of learning the ins and outs of international finance,
Lee spent the past a few weeks exploring the intricacies of
Halloween masks.
</P>
<P>
   He now knows that it's possible to find a severed head cut from
the right or the left, a head in a jar, a skinned head, a
mechanical turning head, a head cut with a cleaver, a ``mind
blown'' head, a head that's been pierced with a bullet, and a
pinhead.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 24, hasn't told his parents about his job. ``I don't think
they'd understand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although online comparison shopping has become a crowded field,
analysts say mySimon has good technology and a unique marketing
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The &UR;  &LR; mySimon site differs from other online
comparison-shopping services because merchants do not pay to be
listed. Instead, they pay only when a transaction is made, usually
2 percent to 5 percent of the sales price.
</P>
<P>
   Because mySimon doesn't ask merchants for money up front, it can
add them more quickly than some of the other comparison-shopping
sites. Currently, the company said it has nearly three times more
merchants than its competitors, including Excite, Jango and
Junglee, which was recently acquired by Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   It's only after mySimon has generated sales for a merchant that
its marketers try to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prove what they can do with actions, not words,'' said
Julia Pickar, analyst at Zona Research. ``They say, `Look at all
the traffic we're giving you. If you want to keep that traffic,
you've got to pony up the fee.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ho Anh Le, one of mySimon's newest SPIs, just finished his
master's degree in Japanese literature at Stanford. After working
part-time all summer, he had to find a way to pay the rent, so he
joined mySimon in late September.
</P>
<P>
   Le, 25, didn't always want to be a Web shopper, but he wanted to
work with computers and he was lured by the energy of a startup.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other SPIs earn $30,000 to $35,000 a year _ not much
by Silicon Valley standards. They also get stock options, but few
seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really understand stock options,'' said Le. ``I just
want to pay off my college loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Dzintars Avots, one of the two original SPIs, was studying
computer science at Stanford before he took time off &UR;  &LR; to join
mySimon. He's since moved up in the company to do more technical
work.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the SPIs need to be familiar with HTML, the job is
largely a matter of Web-surfing skills and an ability to think
analytically, said Dennis Yang, the company's chief SPI.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As they visit each site and search for different products,
the SPIs use a software tool to pull information and some HTML code
from the site and copy it to an online form that looks like a
spreadsheet. Software written by company co-founder Yeogirl Yun
then automatically converts the data they enter into code that
makes mySimon's search engine work.
</P>
<P>
   That gives mySimon another advantage, said Pickar, the Zona
analyst. Instead of hiring high-priced engineers to build its site,
mySimon can hire bright, relatively inexpensive non-techies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to find good, high-level programmers,''
said Lynn Gately, the company's creative director. ``It's not as
difficult to find young, energetic people who love the Internet.''

 Microsoft Accuser Keeps Low Profile  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The most devastating accusations against Microsoft in the Justice
Department's antitrust case have come from an unlikely source.
<P>
   Avadis ``Avie'' Tevanian, Apple's senior vice president of
software engineering and Steve Jobs' right-hand tech man, was
heavily recruited by Bill Gates &AMP; Co. more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The low-profile engineer has spent the past decade designing
operating system software for Jobs at Apple Computer and for Job's
previous company, Next Computer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tevanian, 37, is a high-tech whiz whose expertise in creating
user-friendly system software is obscured by his understated
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny that someone can be so prominent yet invisible at
the same time,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor and publisher of
Softletter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Given his usual reticence, Tevanian's recent comments against
Microsoft could carry significant weight in the government's
landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a high-profile Microsoft baiter, which could give him
more credibility in court,'' said Joe Sims, an antitrust attorney
in Washington, D.C. ``But ultimately, his evidence depends on its
plausibility and how he performs under Microsoft's
cross-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl England, publisher of MacAddict magazine in Brisbane,
described Tevanian as ``cordial, yet tight-lipped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Jobs values secrecy, and that's probably why Avie has
worked for him this long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian's testimony could strain the topsy-turvy relationship
between Apple and Microsoft. The two companies, once bitter foes,
have been uneasy allies since Microsoft invested $150 million in
Apple stock in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple spokesman said it is ``not appropriate'' for Tevanian
or any other company executive to talk at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating his written testimony that was released last Friday,
Tevanian yesterday said the software giant attempted to
``sabotage'' Apple's popular multimedia software, QuickTime, and
strong-armed the computer-maker into featuring Microsoft's Internet
Explorer as the main Web browser on all Macintosh models.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian said Microsoft threatened to stop updating Mac Office _
a popular software suite combining Excel, Word and other programs _
if Apple did not promote Internet Explorer as its primary browser
instead of Netscape's Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest
bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm
to Apple immediately,'' Microsoft executive Ben Waldman wrote in a
June 27, 1997, e-mail to Gates. ``I also believe that Apple is
taking this threat pretty seriously,'' the e-mail continued.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian earned a master's degree and a doctorate in computer
science from Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, where he was a
principal designer of the Mach operating system. Next based its
operating system, NextStep, on Mach.
</P>
<P>
   One of his professors there was Rick Rashid, now Microsoft's
vice president of research.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tried to recruit Tevanian while he was still in school
with huge amounts of money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the native of Portland, Maine, joined Next as an
engineer in January 1988 and quickly moved up the ranks, eventually
becoming head of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Apple eventually acquired his expertise in December 1996, when
it bought Next for $400 million. He and fellow Next executives
Jobs, Mitch Mandich and Jon Rubinstein make up the core management
team now running Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian chooses his words carefully. At a party in January at
the Macworld trade show, the ever-discreet Tevanian told a reporter
the challenges of working with Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be difficult and rewarding,'' Tevanian said. ``He
expects a lot, but he also gives a lot.''

 Drop in IPOs Will Hurt Investment Bankers' Bonuses  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The drought in initial public offerings could put the squeeze on
the year-end bonuses paid to investment bankers, said John Wilson,
a banking recruiter for Korn/Ferry International in San Francisco.
<P>
   ``In investment banking, you get a fairly low base salary and a
large bonus,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, investment bankers at the vice presidential level
earn a modest $75,000 to $100,000. That could easily swell to
between $300,000 and $600,000 in total pay in a good bonus year.
</P>
<P>
   Directors, the next level up, earn $100,000 to $125,000 in base
salary but can net $500,000 to $900,000 after banking their
bonuses. Managing directors earn $200,000 in base pay but can clear
up to $3 million when the year-end pot is sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, if you don't get your bonus, you don't get
paid,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, when IPOs were being priced at the rate of
36 a month, the bonus pools were swelled by the income that
investment banks earned by taking companies public. But in
September and October, when just 11 deals went the distance, the
IPO spigot has been nearly dry, dashing hopes that 1998 could
surpass 1997's record payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wilson said, barring a pre-Christmas IPO rebound,
investment bankers anticipating a rich treat may find coal in their
stockings instead.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL IPO HOPEFULS: Two San Francisco firms, MarketWatch.Com and
Xoom Inc., are betting that Wall Street will get over its recent
risk-aversion and start betting on Internet plays again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last few weeks, Internet deals have been sucking the
mop,'' said Marc Strausberg, chief executive of the Edgar-Online
financial reporting service in Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet stocks like Yahoo heading through the roof
again _ Yahoo gained $9.25 to close at a new high of $151.50
yesterday _ Strausberg thinks the clogged-up IPO pipeline might
start flowing again.
</P>
<P>
   He said MarketWatch, a financial news site backed by CBS, has
the ``pedigree'' to reassure Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But Xoom may be the real bellwether of investor sentiment. Xoom
is an online community that attracts members with free home pages.
It plans to make money by understanding their special interests and
selling them goods accordingly. It is growing, but losing money. In
other words, it's a typical Net IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taulli, an analyst with IPO Monitor, said if Wall Street
buys Xoom, it means the Net is back in favor again.
</P>
<P>
   Bears Stearns, which is underwriting Xoom, won't price the stock
this week, IPO watchers say. No one can be sure it will fly, but at
least the deal is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   NET ELECTION WINNER: On Tuesday, I wrote about an experimental
poll by the Harris organization that tried to predict a number of
election races based on e-mail surveys filled out by Internet
users. That is radically different than standard polls, which ask
questions by phone.
</P>
<P>
   David Clemm, president of Harris, based in Rochester, N.Y., said
the Internet survey was about 95 percent correct. Of the 22 races
Harris predicted using its novel e-mail survey, it picked the
winners in 21 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed in Georgia's governor race,'' Clemm said. ``Two
other telephone-based surveys also got it wrong, if that's any
consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, the Harris data will get a thorough review by
political scientists at the University of Rochester. They'll be
trying to discern whether science or luck enabled the Internet poll
to score as well as it did.
</P>
<P>
   Harris plans to apply what it learns from this year's Internet
poll to its commercial market research. Although political polls
get all the headlines, they provide only seasonal work. Between
races, pollsters earn their keep by asking consumers whether
they've used this shampoo or what they think of that new
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this commercial realm that Harris thinks the Internet
will prove its real superiority over the phone as a polling
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what labored descriptions we have to go
through to ask consumers what they might think of a certain ad,''
said George Terhanian, who ran the Internet poll for Harris.
Ultimately, he'd like to e-mail subjects pictures or video clips of
ads, for instance, and ask them to e-mail back answers to the
survey.

COMMENTARY: NO THIRD TERM!  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of their midterm triumph, the permanent
campaigners in the White House must be thinking: Will nobody rid us
of this troublesome 22d Amendment? Why should superpopular Bill
Clinton be denied the chance to run for a third term?
</P>
<P>
   That was some shellacking the GOP took this week. Let us count
the lessons:
</P>
<P>
   1. Not all politics is local. This was an election nationalized
by the Impeachment Issue, no matter what exit pollsters report.
Despite handwringing predictions of rampant apathy and turnoff,
midterm turnout was 38 percent of the voting-age public. That is as
high as the controversial Agnew-driven campaign of 1970.
</P>
<P>
   There is no blinking away the fact that this was a referendum on
Clinton conduct. This year, core voters of both parties as well as
swing voters were motivated by the fear or hope of removing the
president. The difference in most close races that Democrats won
was sympathy for Clinton. Which means:
</P>
<P>
   2. The majority of Americans who care enough to vote do not
believe that lying under oath about sexual matters _ by itself _
justifies removing this president from office. The minority can
grumble about how the Clinton example undermines the judicial
system, or argue that good times should not justify bad acts, but
the majority rules. Which means:
</P>
<P>
   3. If the president is to be called to account, Congress and the
independent counsel must come up with significant new evidence of a
pattern of abuse of power. The unwritten rule at Justice is that no
indictments should be brought before an election, a custom that Ken
Starr followed. If he has other cases or criminal information that
will reveal abuse of power or tampering with witnesses, this month
is the time to indict. If the Supreme Court thinks that government
lawyers cannot act as personal attorneys, this is the time to force
Bruce Lindsey to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will proceed in an orderly way,
breaking down previous stonewalling, but it must present new
evidence of wrongdoing beyond Monica. (A Clinton-appointed judge
has in effect OK'd Clinton fund raising from Chinese intelligence
sources, and Clinton Justice is happy not to appeal his egregious
ruling. That travesty bears a close Judiciary look.
</P>
<P>
   4. The religious right would be wise to let economic
conservatives take the GOP wheel. The statehouse victories of the
Bush Boys in Texas and Florida and George Pataki in New York
suggest that tax cuts and attention to local schools butter more
political parsnips than an aggressive assertion of traditional
values.
</P>
<P>
   Swing voters are evidently not troubled by swingers. There's a
respected place for moralists and religionists in the Republican
vehicle; their principled resistance to the corrupting gambling
epidemic will, I hope, shame GOP fat cats greedy for casino bucks.
But if races in 2000 are to be won, social conservatives cannot be
in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   5. The flip side of women voters' condoning Clinton's conduct
with a subordinated tut-tut is the practical end of sexual
harassment law as we know it. Paradoxically, nobody will have done
more than Bill Clinton for the macho predator, or will ruin more
cases for trial lawyers out to blackmail corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   6. Idealism lives. The Democratic victory that did my heart good
was the squeaker won by Sen. Russell Feingold in Wisconsin. That
new Don Quixote demonstrated how a campaign finance reformer could
win by running against soft money and practicing what he preached.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's example gave new life to fund-raising reform, which
should be handled both retrospectively though investigation of the
Asian connection and prospectively through legislation next year.
His Republican partner on this issue, Sen. John McCain _ with his
blowout victory in Arizona _ now becomes the dark horse to
challenge front-runner Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 7. The pendulum of politics swings faster than ever.
Remember how Clinton soared in '93, collapsed in '94, came back in
'96, crashed this summer, came back this fall? Do you really think
that pattern will fail to repeat next spring?
</P>
<P>
   Hence, loathed Melancholy; cheer up, droopy right-wingers.
Re-group around new leaders, challenge the president to veto your
tax cuts, and watch your heads _ here comes that pendulum back
again.

PLAN TO CURTAIL SWEATSHOPS REJECTED BY UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than two years of debate, a group of human rights
organizations and apparel manufacturers, including Nike, Reebok and
Liz Claiborne, has reached an agreement intended to curtail
sweatshops by setting up a code of conduct and a monitoring system
for overseas factories used by American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The group that reached the agreement hopes it will reassure
American consumers that the apparel they buy is not made in
sweatshops, but the nation's leading apparel union rejected the
agreement Wednesday as not going far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group said they would seek to carry out the
agreement even though the apparel union rejected it. But several
members said they feared that American consumers would feel little
reassurance that apparel produced under the agreement's guidelines
was not made in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees
criticized the accord for not requiring overseas factories to pay
workers enough to meet their basic needs and for allowing American
companies to use apparel factories in countries, including China,
that repress unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement's not very good,'' said Mark Levinson, director
of research at the needletrades union. ``How can you talk about
eliminating sweatshops without making a commitment to pay a living
wage? And the agreement allows companies to produce in countries
that systematically deny worker rights, and it allows them to do
that without requiring them to say anything to protect rights in
those countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the union's rejection, members of the group insisted
that the accord was a giant step forward in combating sweatshops.
The four companies and five nonprofit groups that reached the
agreement say they hope dozens more companies will sign on and
comply with the agreement's requirements to insure that apparel is
made under satisfactory working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is convinced this agreement lays the
foundation to eliminate sweatshop labor, here and abroad,'' said
Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. ``It is workable for business and
creates a credible system that will let consumers know the garments
they buy are not produced by exploited workers. We remain committed
to working with all interested parties to insure its future
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact grows out of a presidential task force, the White House
Apparel Industry Partnership, that was set up in 1996 after
embarrassing revelations that apparel produced under the Kathie Lee
Gifford name was being made in sweatshops in New York and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   After the task force's 18 members remained stalemated for
months, nine of the group's more centrist members began negotiating
among themselves and finished thrashing out an agreement on Monday.
This group presented the agreement to the other members Monday
night in the hope that they would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly important,'' said Roberta Karp, general
counsel of Liz Claiborne and co-chairwoman of the task force.
``It's the foundation to move forward to make a real difference in
working conditions around the world. It requires monitoring by
independent monitors as well as public reporting for the first time
ever. It's simply unparalleled.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Wednesday, officials with the apparel union said
they would no longer participate in the presidential task force if
other members moved forward with the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot continue to participate in this effort on the basis
of this agreement,'' said Alan Howard, assistant to the president
of the needletrades union. ``This has been offered to us on a take
it or leave it basis and we can't take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that participate hope that by complying with the code
of conduct and monitoring system, they will be able to boast _
perhaps through advertisements or by tags on their apparel _ that
their products are sweatshop-free.
</P>
<P>
   The nine task force members that reached the new agreement are
Liz Claiborne, Nike, Reebok, Phillips Van Heusen, Business for
Social Responsibility, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, the
National Consumers League, the International Labor Rights Fund and
the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Four other corporate task force members, L.L. Bean, Patagonia,
Nicole Miller and Kathie Lee Gifford, have accepted the new
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is only the beginning,'' President Clinton
said. ``We know that sweatshop labor will not vanish overnight.
While this agreement is a historic step, we must measure our
progress by how we change and improve the lives and livelihoods of
apparel workers here in the United States and around the world.
That is why I urge more companies to join this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Several corporate members said that if the task force accepts
the stricter requirements sought by union leaders, that would make
it harder to persuade more companies to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, factories used by American companies could
not use forced labor and could not require employees to work more
than 60 hours each week. In addition, the agreement prohibits
factories from employing children younger than 15, although
employment of 14-year-olds would be allowed when the country of
manufacture allows employment at that age.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also requires employers to pay the minimum wage
required by local law or the prevailing industry wage, whichever is
higher. Labor unions have repeatedly complained that in countries
like Indonesia and Vietnam, both the minimum wage and prevailing
wage are too low to support a family.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, a new entity, the Fair Labor Association,
would be set up to oversee compliance. The new association would
certify which monitors could examine factories, and it could expel
companies that do not comply with the code. Many of the monitors
would be accounting firms, but the accord urges all monitors to
work with nongovernmental groups, like human rights groups, to get
an accurate picture of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for companies to monitor all their factories
themselves, but in addition requires outside monitors to examine 30
percent of a company's factories in the three years after a company
agrees to comply with the code of conduct. In subsequent years,
about 10 percent of a company's factories would be inspected
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the needletrades union said it was insufficient
for only one-tenth of a company's factories to be monitored each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monitoring is badly flawed,'' Howard said. ``We don't
think it's very independent monitoring and the companies pick their
monitors and the factories to be monitored so there won't be
surprise inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's biggest criticism is the accord's failure to require
that companies pay a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups that backed the agreement said they
persuaded the companies to agree to a Department of Labor study on
the minimum and prevailing wages in relevant countries and how
those wages compare with the amount needed to meet workers' basic
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us on the nongovernment organization side are
continuing to fight for higher wages in this industry,'' said
Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for

forward. Remember, this a first step and we have a lot of work to
do to make this work.''

COMMENTARY: THE LANDSCAPE SHIFTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some unsolicited advice for the Republican Party: Give up on the
politics of meanness. It's killing you.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Democrats: Forget about running away from blacks and
Hispanics. You hide from those constituencies at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   And for politicians from both parties: The voters want you to
conduct yourselves with a little dignity. So stop the name-calling
and the lying and the frat-boy behavior. Grow up.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Clinton era is fast approaching, and the public is in
the mood for straight arrows. So the likes of Al D'Amato and Carol
Moseley-Braun are being shown the door, and quieter types _ Charles
Schumer in New York, for one, and the aptly named Gray Davis in
California _ are receiving warm welcomes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Newt Gingrich doesn't get it. He's been all over
television since Tuesday night trying somehow to blame his party's
poor showing on the media's obsession with the Lewinsky scandal.
Never mind that the speaker himself is the driving force behind the
effort to impeach the president, or that he was the one who
authorized the GOP's desperate last-minute advertising blitz
designed to capitalize on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing has backfired. Public sentiment has been clear
from the beginning: Do not impeach the president. But Gingrich
suffers from the handicap of being tone-deaf while battling against
a president with perfect political pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that impeachment will not happen,'' Schumer said
Wednesday. ``My sense is that while Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott
would not admit it publicly because they have the extreme right
looking over their shoulder, they are both astute politicians and
they realize they made a mistake, and they are going to find a
graceful way to come to a denouement.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a deal. The irony is that Gingrich, having
miscalculated so badly, now has to worry about being bounced from
his post as speaker by angry Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats, when the going got tough they started
looking for the minorities. It wasn't too long ago that an awful
lot of Democratic politicians were trying to shake off what they
saw as the stigma of the party's association with blacks and
Hispanics, especially blacks. They acted as if soccer moms cast the
only votes that counted.
</P>
<P>
   How successful was this strategy? Well, the next thing you knew
both houses of Congress and most of the nation's governorships were
in the hands of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton's troubles threatened to make matters worse,
black and Hispanic voters started looking a lot more attractive.
Suddenly they were being courted again.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Poll, summed up the matter
nicely: ``When Democrats get their clocks cleaned, it's because
they're not getting the turnout in urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   It's early, but we may be at the start of a significant
political advance. The Democrats, less liberal than a few years
ago, are regrouping. They are talking again about unifying
disparate constituencies around issues that resonate widely _
education, jobs, Social Security, health care. A stronger economy,
which tends to ease the hostility between groups, makes that kind
of goal easier to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American doesn't like divisiveness,'' said
Schumer. ``And they are tired of this idea where people on each
side of the aisle yell at each other all day long and nothing gets
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Schumer said: ``Now, as we enter the
21st century and face ever-increasing global competition,
competition that can make or break America, we cannot afford
division, whether it's between race, sexual orientation, geographic
region or ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, on a roll for awhile, is threatened by all
of those divisions and nobody sees a way out. The mindless
intolerance of the far right is a plague that serves as a perpetual
check on the power of the party's more progressive forces, which
are the forces with the widest appeal. The most successful
Republicans are the big state governors who have escaped the
right-wing plague, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   But in Congress Gingrich and Lott have been unable to get their
act together. Which has been a godsend for the Democrats.
</P>

CONE AND THE YANKEES DEAL WITH A DEADLINE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second time in the last week, David Cone and
the Yankees have extended the pitcher's deadline for deciding about
a $5.5 million contract option, agreeing Wednesday to push the
deadline back until midnight next Wednesday. It had been switched
to midnight Wednesday, but both sides have been negotiating
amicably and agreed to continue talks.
</P>
<P>
   Cone could have accepted the $5.5 million or declined it and
become a free agent, but he has reiterated to friends that he
prefers to remain with the Yankees. The 36-year-old right-hander
and the Yankees appear to have differences over the length of a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   While Cone apparently wants the Yankees to guarantee two years
for a total salary of about $16 million, the Yankees are more
inclined to give him a raise to $7 million for one season because
they wonder how long his surgically repaired right shoulder will
last. Cone won 20 games for the Yankees this season and he knows it
is possible some team, perhaps Los Angeles, would sign him to a
lucrative three-year deal on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have openly discussed several different concepts,'' said
Steve Fehr, Cone's agent, who would not reveal specifics. ``We're
open to a lot of different options. We are not stuck on any
particular terms.''
</P>
<P>
   While extending the original Oct. 28 deadline by another week,
Cone will also become a provisional free agent. He will file for
free agency Thursday, but will not function as a free agent until
he accepts or declines his option with the Yanks. That protects his
ability to be a free agent in case he eventually declines the
option and does not sign with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr said that George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal
owner, first suggested extending the deadline a second time when he
met with Cone on Saturday in Orlando, Fla. Fehr and General Manager
Brian Cashman decided Wednesday to take advantage of another seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't do any harm,'' said Fehr. ``It might do some good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman added, ``With the lines of communication open, I am
happy that we have agreed to extend the deadline and continue our
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has repeatedly expressed his desire to stay with the
Yankees. Lynn Cone, the pitcher's wife, said that David was out
with his father, Ed, Wednesday night and could not be reached for
comment. Fehr refused to analyze the decision on another deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to characterize it,'' said Fehr. ``We're
obviously continuing to talk. I'm always leery about saying we're
closer. I don't want to use an adjective that will look silly 24
hours or 72 hours after I've said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fehr declined to discuss details of their negotiations, but Cone
was believed to be seeking a two-year contract for $16 million
while the Yankees apparently were willing to raise his 1999 salary
to $7 million but not give him an extra year. Cone's current deal
with the Yankees also includes a $5.5 million option for 2000 if he
pitches 192 /13 innings in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has been around long enough to know that he could find
interest in his services as a free agent. Even though he will turn
36 years old in January, Cone could receive attractive offers
because the demand is great for good starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   It's very likely that as a free agent, Cone could command a more
lucrative contract than the one he has sought from the Yankees. He
would take less to stay in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are one team that baseball people have said would
try to sign Cone if he were available. The Dodgers seek pitching
help and already have begun pursuit of Randy Johnson, who is a free
agent. Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' new general manager, and Davey
Johnson, their new manager, visited Johnson in Arizona Tuesday. The
Yankees also have expressed interest in Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of another team said earlier in the week he did not
think the Yankees had a chance to sign Johnson, primarily because
he wanted to play close to his home in the Phoenix area. But one of
the pitcher's agents, Alan Nero, said the Yankees remain one of six
teams on Johnson's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put the Yankees on the list considering what they
did this year and their tradition,'' Nero said. Not to mention the
contracts they are willing to give star players.

GORE FRIEND CHARGED IN FUND-RAISING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (af)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury returned a 42-count indictment
Wednesday against a prominent Tennessee real estate developer
accusing him of defrauding the government through an illegal scheme
to funnel $80,000 in donations to President Clinton's 1996
re-election and other political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The federal election law charges were brought against Franklin
Haney, a politically influential Chattanooga Democrat and friend of
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Gore said in a statement, ``The vice president
recognizes the serious nature of the charges and regrets that
Franklin and his family face these difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accused Haney of spending his own money to repay
a number of contributors for their donations from 1992 to 1996 to
the Clinton for President Committee, the Clinton-Gore 1996
re-election campaign, and campaign committees supporting James
Sasser, a Tennessee Democratic candidate who is now ambassador to
China.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Haney said he was confident he would be found
not guilty of the charges. A spokesman for Haney said, ``Frankly,
we believe the charges will be dismissed because as this case moves
through the upper courts the government's case will be rejected as
overreaching and unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement appeared to refer to court rulings against the
Justice Department in two other cases brought in recent months by
campaign finance prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a federal judge threw out charges that Maria Hsia,
a Democratic fund-raiser, had made false statements on campaign
documents. Twenty-five of the counts against Haney accuse him of
making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said that Haney and unnamed and uncharged
co-conspirators filled and sent to the committee ``donor cards''
that listed the names of the conduit contributors rather than
Haney's name. Campaign aides said Wednesday that Haney told
campaign officials that he was responsible for helping raise the
contributions, but they said he did not disclose any illegality.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law forbids anyone from making a campaign contribution
in another person's name and requires political committees to
disclose the identities of all contributors who donate more than
$200 to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment made no mention of a controversial Washington
real estate project in which Haney was involved as an investor with
Peter Knight, a lawyer and a former aide to Gore. The project, the
Portals office complex, became the subject of rancorous hearings in
the House this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that on the day in 1996 when the General
Services Administration signed a lease on the office building,
Knight's law firm sent Haney a bill for $1 million. Republicans
questioned whether the payment was a possibly illegal contingency
fee. Haney and Knight both denied any wrongdoing,
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said that Haney was the 14th person to be
charged as a result of investigations by the Justice Department
task force, which for two years has been looking into allegations
of illegal campaign fund raising stemming from the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep pressing on,'' Attorney General Janet Reno
said in a statement. She has been under heavy pressure from
Republicans to refer the campaign finance investigation to an
independent counsel, but has so far refused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reno is conducting preliminary investigations into
whether Clinton violated campaign spending laws, whether Gore lied
about telephone fund-raising calls from the White House and whether
Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff, committed perjury
before a Senate committee investigating fund-raising issues.

U.S. ENLISTS RUSSIAN CUSTOMS AGENTS TO SPOT NUCLEAR SMUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent nuclear weapons and materials from being
smuggled out of Russia, the United States announced plans on
Wednesday to train Russian customs agents in identifying and
arresting smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War is over, but the weapons are still around,'' said
Rick Galbraith, a policy coordinator at the U.S. Customs Service in
Washington. ``The Russians were really good at keeping track of
their nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economic collapse of Russia has made its cache of
weapons and materials more vulnerable to smugglers ``who know
people who know people who haven't been paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans include training Russian customs agents at the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, the U.S. Energy Department's
``nuclear reservation'' in Pasco, Wash. Thirty Russian agents are
scheduled to spend two weeks there before the end of this year,
learning how to detect nuclear materials and track smugglers. All
expenses, including travel, will be covered by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to train other Russian agents at subsequent
sessions at the Washington reservation. The United States also
plans to give the Russian customs service three X-ray detection
vans for use at its borders. The vans, which cost a total of
$750,000, can detect nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make their customs people aware of what to look
for,'' said Bonnie Brigman, the manager of the Customs Service's
30-month-old radiation detection program. ``We'll be using actual
radioactive sources so they can see the way the detection equipment
responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say they have not yet worked out the costs of
the program. But the benefit of controlling nuclear materials and
weapons of mass destruction in order to keep them from terrorists
or unfriendly countries is incalculable, Galbraith said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting of the minds,'' he said, referring to the
cooperative agreement between the two countries, which stems from
the September meeting of President Clinton and President Boris
Yeltsin in Moscow. ``But we have better financing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real question is ``are we doing enough?'' said Michael
O'Hanlon, a foreign-policy expert and senior fellow at the
Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. Though he praised the
cooperative customs-services plan, it is, he said, too little, too
late. ``We should be protecting nuclear materials at their point of
origin,'' he said. ``We shouldn't wait until they reach the
borders. We know from drug trafficking that border inspections are
not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States should be considering ``much more radical''
plans to control weapons of mass destruction and keep impoverished
Russian employees _ from scientists to customs inspectors _ from
being tempted to sell them. If necessary, he said, the United
States should itself pay Russian employees in return for
safeguarding its nuclear materials.

U.S. CHARGES BIN LADEN IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new lede, adding countries where bombings occurred)  (htv) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a
238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin
Laden with conspiring to bomb U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
in August and with committing acts of terrorism against Americans
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials immediately announced that they were
offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to
the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged
Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief
military commander.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist movement that
rules that country. Atef's whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also unsealed an earlier indictment, issued in June,
that included similar but less detailed charges against bin Laden.
That indictment was returned before the embassy bombings and was
the result of a two-year investigation into his activities in
Somalia and Saudi Arabia, as well as reports that he had
connections to a circle of Islamic militants in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused
bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the
present, in which he was said to be working in concert with
governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist
groups, to build weapons and attack American military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment gives few details of bin Laden's alleged
involvement in the embassy attacks. The indictment does not, for
example, specify whether prosecutors have evidence that bin Laden
gave direct orders to those who carried out the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the document indicates why the original indictment
was kept secret for months, but the secret charges were returned
about the time that American officials were plotting a possible
raid into Afghanistan to arrest bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said, ``It's very
common to have sealed indictments when you're trying to apprehend
those who are indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's
operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq
to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin
Laden's agreeing not to work against that country.
</P>
<P>
   No details were given about whether the alleged deal with Iraq
led to the development of actual weapons for bin Laden's group,
which is called Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that bin Laden's group had used
private relief groups ``as conduits for transmitting funds'' for Al
Qaeda. The groups were not identified.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said bin Laden's group had conducted internal
investigations of its members and their associates, trying to
detect who might be acting as informants, and had killed those who
had been suspected of collaborating with ``enemies of the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The government indicated earlier that its knowledge of bin
Laden's activities stemmed in part from the cooperation of one such
informant, who it said Wednesday had worked for bin Laden,
transporting weapons and explosives, helping to buy land for his
training camps and assisting in running his finances.
</P>
<P>
   While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the
government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the
months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an
indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the
embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said bin Laden was charged with ``plotting and
carrying out the most heinous acts of international terrorism and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the more than 250 people killed in the embassy attacks
and the more than 1,000 wounded, she added, ``In a greater sense,
all of the citizens of the world are also victims whenever and
wherever the cruel and cowardly acts of international terrorism
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of bin Laden is continuing, said Ms. White and
Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in New York, whose
agents have fanned out around the world to look into the embassy
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigative strategy is clear,'' Schiliro said. ``We
will identify, locate and prosecute all those responsible, right up
the line, from those who constructed and delivered the bombs to
those who paid for them and ordered it done.''

COHR SAYS FORMER EXECUTIVE CRITICIZED FIRM ANONYMOUSLY ON INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Medical equipment specialist Cohr Inc. on Tuesday
accused a former executive who now runs a competing firm of being
behind a series of anonymous, defamatory comments made about the
company on an Internet message board.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the company based in the suburban Los
Angeles community of Chatsworth said former Chief Operating Officer
Sandy Morford was linked to a series of postings on a board
dedicated to the firm and operated by Yahoo!, an Internet portal.
The messages falsely identified their author as a current executive
at Cohr, said spokeswoman Amy Metz.
</P>
<P>
   Morford said Tuesday that he was innocent of the activities,
though he acknowledged messages were posted that claimed to be from
his online account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently somebody out there has absconded with my e-mail
address,'' Morford said, adding that the address is printed on his
business card.
</P>
<P>
   In several of the postings in question, the anonymous writer
describes Cohr's stock as worthless and levels personal attacks
against current Cohr employees. The messages, posted in an
investment portion of the Yahoo! site, also discourage readers from
investing in Cohr.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, Cohr said that based on information
supplied by Yahoo!, the messages began the day Morford opened his
online account in August and continued for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Morford was fired in June after 19 years with the company when
Cohr's board of directors brought on new management following an
audit that found sales and earnings had been improperly inflated
for several quarters. The firm's share price plummeted at the time,
falling from roughly $12 a share to under $5, prompting several
investor class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Morford now is president of San Dimas-based Genesis Technology
Partners, which competes with Cohr for hospital equipment
maintenance contracts. ``But I don't need to disparage or remark
badly about Cohr'' to successfully compete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohr Chief Executive Ray List said his company is weighing its
legal options. Analysts say any defamation lawsuit would rely on
Cohr being able to prove that Morford authored the postings and
that he intended to inflict harm on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term for defaming someone on the Internet is flaming . . .
and there's no reason (postings) can't form the basis for a
lawsuit,'' said Matthew Spitzer, director of the University of
Southern California's Center for Communications Law and Policy.
Online messages are ``treated pretty much like any other
communications medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also said that if the author intended to influence
Cohr's share price through false information, the person likely
would be in violation of federal securities fraud as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cohr shares closed Tuesday at $3.0625, down 6.25 cents.

STERN CRITICIZES PROMINENT AGENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day that represented more bitterness and less
hope for an agreement, talks between the National Basketball
Association and the players union broke off after less than two
hours of negotiations Wednesday, with Commissioner David Stern
accusing prominent agents of sabotaging any chance of ending the
labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, though, is apparently ready to lift a moratorium on
dialogue between players and team officials. He is about to approve
a plan in which a representative from each of the league's 29 teams
would be able to discuss labor proposals with players.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's two-pronged offensive _ criticizing the
agents and seeming open-minded at the same time _ was seen by the
union as a strategy to influence the thinking of the majority of
middle-class players and to encourage them into pressuring the
union to sign a deal with the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players association,
dismissed the commissioner's comments as an attempt to portray a
dispute within the union, thus avoiding the economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner has continuously tried to drive a wedge
through the players and repeatedly he has failed,'' Hunter said in
a prepared statement. ``He attempted to pit the superstars against
the minimum-salary players and he has tried to buy off the current
veterans at the expense of younger and future players. Now he wants
to split the players, the agents and the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``As David Stern is well aware, despite his current ruse,
Patrick Ewing, the negotiating committee and myself have been in
charge of these negotiations since Day 1 and that will continue to
be the case. When the owners show some willingness to engage in
compromise rather than concession bargaining, the negotiating
committee _ not the agents _ we'll be glad to recommend the deal to
our players.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hunter said on Monday that he felt the season would begin
in January, it appeared to be a voice of pessimism. Now that's
beginning to sound like a hopeful time for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose the season it will be a disaster for our players, a
disaster for our owners and a disaster for everyone associated with
the game _ period,'' Stern said. ``That's a lesson that's
independent from any other league's experience. We think our teams
will, over some very extensive period of time, rebound. But their
losses will not be recouped for a substantial period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of the season beginning in early December is
fading with each verbal grenade.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides held their shortest bargaining session since the
lockout began on July 1, meeting for one and a half hours. Naming
David Falk and Arn Tellem, who combined represent more than 70 of
the league's 400-plus players, Stern said he is convinced that
agents of superstars have helped put a wrench in a possible
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe with good reason that the agents of players who
would be most affected by the high-end limitation have begun a
campaign to defeat any fair deal,'' Stern said in a conference
call. ``And their view is that no matter how good the deal may be
for 400 players, it won't be allowed to fly if the top 30 can't
have the ability to receive unlimited amounts. And we're concerned
that this entire arrangement and deal is going to be held hostage
by that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, whose 39 clients include Ewing, Michael Jordan, Alonzo
Mourning, Juwan Howard, Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, did not
take the accusation personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect and fondness for David Stern, but as an
extremely savvy and experienced negotiator he's trying to create
division in the ranks by saying that individual agents are
undermining the union,'' he said. ``In 1995 it was a different
story. But today the situation is 180 degrees different. I haven't
seen the union this stable and united in 10 years. Billy Hunter has
done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk refused to divulge details of his conversations with
Hunter, but said: ``Clearly and unequivocally, we're advising our
clients on a daily basis. That's not a secret. That's our job. If
we sat back and watched, we wouldn't be doing our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem said: ``His statements are ludicrous and without any
factual basis. What he's trying to do in desperation is find
convenient scapegoats, get the media to avoid looking at what the
real problem is _ their refusal to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   A union official, speaking on condition on anonymity, admitted
that Falk and other agents are concerned with the mechanics of the
proposed escrow system, which several agents are referring to as a
hard salary cap that would severely limit the earning potential of
high-salaried players.
</P>
<P>
   The players have proposed setting aside 10 percent of salaries
for a specified group of players at the beginning of the season.
That money would go into an escrow account. If leaguewide spending
exceeded an agreed-upon threshold, then the amount in excess of the
threshold would be returned to teams.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has proposed an open-ended system, or what one union
official called a ``limitless'' system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stern's decision to let team officials speak with
players regarding proposals seemed to be a sign that his patience
with getting a deal done was eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably at some point very soon authorize our teams to
talk to their players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have prohibited them in the past because we didn't want
there to be any misunderstanding of our proposals. But we are going
to send a communication to our teams and tell them that as long as
they designate one person, and that person understands the
proposal, that they will be able to talk to players who call and
ask questions. But it is important that this not be viewed as
either undermining the union or disparaging our players because
that is the last thing that we're interested in doing here.''

MICROSOFT DEFENDS TACTICS IN 1997 TALKS WITH APPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also MICROSOFT-BROWSER)  
(lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. argued in court Wednesday that it
had every right to tell Apple Computer last year that it would stop
producing word processors and other software for Macintosh
computers unless Apple adopted Microsoft's Internet browser as the
default choice on all its computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose Microsoft simply decides not to offer a product,''
said Theodore Edelman, a Microsoft lawyer. ``Do you have a problem
with that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied Avadis Tevanian, Jr., the Apple senior vice
president who was being cross-examined Wednesday in the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft. ``I have a problem
with them doing it when they are using it as a threat to get us to
do something we didn't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his direct, written testimony, made public on Friday,
Tevanian contended that Microsoft had threatened to stop producing
a new Macintosh version of Microsoft Office unless Apple reversed
its position and favored Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer,
over Navigator, the market-leading browser of Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Several e-mail messages written by Microsoft executives disclose
that the company intended to use the threat as ``a club,'' as one
message put it, to force Apple into line. Microsoft Office is so
dominant _ it has more than 90 percent of the market for business
applications suites _ that Apple executives worried that their
company would be crippled if their customers could not buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Apple gave in and made Microsoft's Internet Explorer
the default browser and agreed not to promote Navigator, which had
been the default browser on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian disclosed in court Wednesday that at Microsoft's
insistence, the Netscape browser is not even installed on Macintosh
computers when an owner first loads a new computer with software
from the installation CD-ROM _ unless the new owner chooses a
custom installation option. Hardly anyone does that, Tevanian said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's agreement to make Internet Explorer its preferred
browser was part of the deal in which Microsoft agreed to produce
its Office suite for Macintosh customers, invested $150 million in
Apple and settled several longstanding patent disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, a partner in the Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell law firm, argued
that however Tevanian chose to describe Microsoft's bargaining
tactics, the company had every right to decide which products to
develop _ and which to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Among other attempts to impeach Tevanian's testimony, Edelman
also suggested that Apple brought a threat of its own to the
negotiations last year, saying that it would file a $1.2 billion
lawsuit contending that Microsoft had infringed on Apple patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you personally tell Microsoft that if no deal was
reached, Apple would sue Microsoft for more than $1 billion?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Tevanian said, Apple had told Microsoft that it owed Apple
$1.2 billion in royalties but had not said anything about filing
suit.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft did with a previous witness, from America Online,
Edelman tried to show that a user could easily install Netscape's
browser on a Macintosh computer, even if the computer came with
Internet Explorer as the default. On video monitors in the
courtroom, Edelman showed seven sequential photographs of the
Macintosh screens a user would have to navigate to change the
default browser.
</P>
<P>
   As he did that, Tevanian found himself in the position of having
to criticize his own company's product to support his testimony. He
told the lawyer that the process was not really as simple as he was
making it seem. The menus were counterintuitive, Tevanian said; it
would be easy to get confused.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Edelman finished, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the
U.S. District Court judge who is hearing the case, remarked, ``It
certainly doesn't tell me how to do it.''

MITCH'S SURVIVORS FACE HUGE TASK OF REBUILDING LIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA LEONA, Nicaragua _ The lucky ones _ the people who lived
through the nightmare rains and the surging floodwaters of Mitch _
now face the huge task of rebuilding lives that were already
precarious before the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   With much of northern Nicaragua still awash in water, mud and
despair, people in this village on Wednesday turned to scraping mud
from their homes, salvaging what crops they could, seeing what
could be saved of belongings accumulated through years of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough now,'' said Ramona Castellon, a homemaker and
community leader in La Leona, a sodden village not far from where
at least 1,300 people _ and perhaps many more _ died when the storm
caused a mudslide last weekend. ``But I think the worst is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthquakes, wars, volcanoes and floods,'' Castellon said.
``We've never had it easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch didn't kill any of La Leona's 500 men, women and children.
But it didn't do them any other favors.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge swelled the normally shallow river that flows past La
Leona, sending a filthy, roiling wall of water through the village
just after midnight last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Castellon and other villagers had only a few minutes to slip
into clothes and run for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us it would only be a tropical storm,'' Noel
Castellon, Ramona's 16-year-old nephew, said of the warning that
was broadcast on local radio before the storm hit. ``We've had a
lot of those, so we weren't afraid. No one was expecting so much
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people made it to safety in neighboring villages farther
from the river. Others scrambled onto roofs. Castellon and her
family clambered up a small rise of land, where they waited three
days for the waters to subside.
</P>
<P>
   When the villagers returned, they found sodden houses, ruined
clothing and food and dead livestock. One of the two wells that
provide La Leona with drinking water was flooded by the river,
which, like most streams in this part of the world, is used as a
sewer by villages upstream.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical clinic, the medicines, syringes and instruments
used by the doctor and nurses who come three times a week lie
buried in mud. The one-room schoolhouse was wrecked, the textbooks
ruined, the floor caked with a thick layer of ooze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like classes are finished for this year,'' said
Xiomara Chevez, a mother of three young children, as she washed
mud-laden clothes in a small yard near the school. ``Everything is
contaminated. The water is filthy. It's hard to see how we're going
to recover from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have warned that outbreaks of cholera, dengue
fever and lung and intestinal infections could occur in the wake of
the storm. Faced with their contaminated well and the standing
pools of water where malarial mosquitoes could breed, Castellon and
other villagers are bracing for that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting an outbreak of diarrhea, Castellon and other village
women dug through the mud covering the health clinic's floor to
retrieve precious packets of U.N-supplied serum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of children with lung infections, and there is
nothing to give them,'' Castellon said. ``But at least we saved
these packets. That was all we could save, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people from the village spent Wednesday sitting on the
river bank, watching a steady stream of vehicles ford the
still-swollen river, as construction crews worked frantically to
erect a temporary bridge where the old one had stood.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people climbed down from passenger buses that could
not ford the river, slipped and sloshed through the mud and across
a destroyed dam in front of La Leona. They then boarded buses on
the other bank.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and trucks carrying food, medicine and other supplies sent
by government ministries and nonprofit agencies rumbled north from
Managua along the main highway, only to be stopped by the
washed-out bridge at La Leona.
</P>
<P>
   A huge crowd gathered on the river bank, cheering as each car
made it through the river and up the muddy bank, jeering at those
who got stuck in the water.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramona Castellon didn't take part in the fun. She stood at a
small wash basin near the health clinic, sorting the rehydration
formulas, biting her lip and shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing but sand where the crops were,'' she said.
``What are we going to harvest? What are we going to eat?
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to live?'' &QL;

HONDURAN SPECULATORS ADD TO THE MISERY OF MITCH 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Besides burying loved ones and
rebuilding their homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, Central
Americans are learning that more mundane tasks _ like filling up
the gas tank or buying a pound of rice _ can also be painful.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, one of the worst to hit the region this century,
washed away whole towns, roads, bridges, airports and telephone
lines. Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua were especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane is thought to have killed as many as 7,000
Hondurans while in Nicaragua more than 1450 people died. Another
1,850 people are missing, most from villages buried by a wall of
mud and debris when a lake in a dormant volcano near the northern
town of Chinandega overflowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch turned Tegucigalpa, the mountainous Honduran capital, into
a virtual island and a free-for-all for unscrupulous middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies of beans, rice, sugar and tortilla flour, the staples
of the Honduran diet, are running out.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged customers accuse wholesalers of hoarding and say
shopkeepers are illegally jacking up their prices. In response, the
Honduran government declared a 10-day price freeze and has
threatened to jail speculators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see shortages. There are no grains, not even
salt,'' said Carmen de Coello, 63, as she stood in line of 50
people to buy sugar at a Tegucigalpa supermarket. ``I was at four
other stores today and I couldn't find sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch wiped out at least 70 percent of Honduras'
agriculture, according to government estimates. That includes the
vital banana crop, the nation's number-one export.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers had already weathered supply problems and price hikes
due to a severe drought brought on by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper crops were nearly ready for harvest as the Hurricane
Mitch approached.
</P>
<P>
   During the drought, ``prices went way up,'' said Sixto Gomez, a
member of the National Farmers Union. ``We thought we were
recovering, but after the hurricane, it's much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The harvest is basically destroyed,'' said Prosecutor General
Edmundo Orellana during a press conference Wednesday. ``There will
have to be massive imports.''
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, prices for grains and vegetables have jumped 300
percent, according to local newspapers. Authorities have arrested
more than 100 people, but the price gouging continues in far-flung
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases of hoarding by warehouse owners, we will surround
them, confiscate their products, and sell them to the public at the
established prices,'' Orellana warned.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, the biggest problems are shelter and
accessibility, rescue officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Several villages on the isolated northeastern coast bordering
Honduras remain surrounded by flood waters, their residents taking
refuge on the scant high ground or sturdy buildings available.
</P>
<P>
   Leonora Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Red Cross,
swept a hand across a map and ticked off the names in the north
where most of Mitch's wrath was felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chinandega, Madriz, Esteli, Jinotega _ there are problems
everywhere,'' she said. ``So many homes were just wiped out,''
Rivera said, adding that there is also a shortage of drinking
water, food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Chavez, a technical expert with the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance who toured the afflicted areas by air
Wednesday, cited the lack of accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 42 bridges down,'' said Chavez said. ``And the major
roads are destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   With many roads in the north still impassable, most relief
supplies arrived by air Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua's few functioning military helicopters were grounded
by bad weather for much of the morning but later managed to fly 10
missions, carrying food and medicine to stranded communities. Three
U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters flew seven missions.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. jet brought bottled water, blankets and relief supplies
to Managua in the afternoon. Another jetload of aid is expected
Thursday, a U.S. Embassy official said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Tegucigalpa filling stations have run out because tanker
trucks from refineries on the north coast can't get through.
</P>
<P>
   Gas and other supplies will be airlifted to Tegucigalpa but for
now, most the north coast airports remain closed. A few secondary
airstrips have opened but they can handle only small cargo planes.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments have pledged to send aid, including $2
million from the United States. More than 500 U.S. troops based in
Honduras are distributing food and water and flying helicopter
search-and-rescue missions, said Marti Estell, a spokeswoman at the
U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch ravaged most of the nation's 298 municipalities
and knocked out 93 bridges, many of which were put up following
Hurricane Fifi, which devastated Honduras in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost the work of the past three decades in terms of
infrastructure,'' said economist Efrain Diaz. ``It's a huge
setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch also washed away outlying shantytowns and barrios along
the Choluteca River that runs through Tegucigalpa. In Orellana's
office, an advisory lists 11 capital neighborhoods that were
``erased from the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Such destruction is why most observers here believe the
estimates of between 5,000 and 7,000 people dead and that another
11,000 are missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the final number will turn out to be more rather than
less,'' Estell said. ``There is no need to inflate the numbers. It
is going to be in the thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Marta Bonilla, an Interior Ministry official, said mayors and
other municipal officials are counting the dead and missing and
feeding the figures to a data bank in Tegucigalpa where the
information is matched against census figures.
</P>
<P>
   She said Hondurans were warned that Mitch was on the way but
that most people refused to evacuate their homes. Even though
Hurricane Fifi killed thousands in 1974, Bonilla said that many
Hondurans refused to believe that their lives were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the government sounded the alarm, people didn't have
the least idea of what a force-five hurricane could do,'' she said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SILENCE OF THE NETS' SWEATSHOP  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In his blue-and-white warm-up suit and
sneakers, John Calipari resembled the Nets' basketball coach he
will be once the National Basketball Association's labor dispute
ends. But Wednesday, the more he talked, the more he sounded like a
real-estate salesman showing off a shiny new $2 million home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the new locker room with the lounge area over there,''
Calipari said. ``Here's the showers, eight-foot showers.''
</P>
<P>
   He strolled through the trainer's room to what resembled a
miniature Olympic swimming pool, eight feet deep at one end.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that hole there, that's where the water will be gushing
out so they can swim or walk against resistance; there's the
Jacuzzi and back there is the sauna,'' Calipari said before opening
a door to what resembled a small lecture hall with two big screens.
``This is where we'll go over game plans, where they'll watch
films.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the scene, the Nets' coach smiled. ``All this,'' he
said, ``for just 12 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Photos of those 12 guys on the Nets' roster adorn the wall of
the main corridor in the adjoining club offices. But those 12 guys
have literally been locked out from even seeing their swanky new
sweatshop, much less seeing the words on the chalkboard near the
main practice court.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``early,'' ``quick,'' ``post'' and ``set'' as well as
``bob'' and ``sob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for baseline out of bounds and sideline out of
bounds,'' the coach explained. ``My staff and I went over all this
stuff the other day because we wanted to figure out how much of it
we'll have time to put in once this thing ends.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many snails in the negotiation meetings, ``this thing''
is not about to end soon. For the season even to start on Christmas
Day with a nationally televised Knicks-Bulls game, this thing would
need to be settled by Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of John Calipari's enthusiasm, the Nets' new complex
is spookily silent. There are no players shooting, or lifting
weights, or just hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a visitors' locker room too,'' Calipari said. ``We
want each of the other NBA teams to practice here once. That way,
every player in the league will see all this and know that this
organization is committed to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a player to instruct, Calipari, like every NBA coach
these days, is a lost soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walking through all this keeps me going,'' he said. ``And
oh, here's our kitchen. You always worry if single guys eat
properly. We're going to have a dietitian to give them a good
breakfast or a good lunch if they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the season had started on time, the Nets would have opened
Tuesday night in Toronto and returned to the Meadowlands last night
against Cleveland before playing in Indiana tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Calipari will go to North Carolina Thursday to scout
college players in practices over the weekend at the University of
North Carolina, Duke and North Carolina State for future reference
in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been out West to see Utah, UCLA and Las Vegas,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari has also visited the Giants and the Jets at practice to
observe the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Fassel is much tougher than what the perception of him
is,'' he said. ``Bill Parcells is much more positive than what the
perception of him is. Parcells is amazing. He sees every player on
every play on both sides of the ball. You know who's like that in
basketball? Larry Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   On orders from the commissioner's office, an NBA coach is not
allowed to talk to any NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for normal civility,'' Calipari said. ``When I ran into
Jayson Williams by accident at a charity event, I told him, `I'll
get fined $5 million if I talk to you, but I'm glad to see you.' He
laughed and said, `I'm turning you in.' I also saw Keith Van Horn's
wife and kids at a carnival. I just said hello. It was
uncomfortable for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Nets' coach, the new complex is a comfortable escape
from the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll walk through it before I go home,'' Calipari said. ``I'll
go in the weight room and put on tapes of the last few minutes of
our close games. Did we take the right shot? Did I have the right
players on the court? What did the other team do to us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even during a lockout, a coach is always coaching.

LOS ANGELES BUSINESS TAXES IN NATION'S TOP 10, SURVEY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Confirming what locals have long suspected, a new
study finds that businesses in the city of Los Angeles are among
the most heavily taxed in the nation, but get off lighter than
their colleagues in places like Chicago, New York and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted by Berwyn, Penn.-based Vertex Inc., ranked
the nation's 27 largest cities based on the combined federal, state
and local taxes for a fictitious business generating $15 million in
revenue annually.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the dubious distinction of being No. 1, Philadelphia
topped the list for the second time in a row, with total annual
taxes of $1.39 million, while Atlanta was the lowest at $1.11
million.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, meanwhile took the No. 10 spot with $1.23 million
in taxes. That's actually $2,500 less than the last time the survey
was conducted in 1993, making Los Angeles one of just nine cities
to see their business tax burdens drop. The reduction also pushed
Los Angeles down the list from its 1993 rank of No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's certainly relatively unusual that taxes actually go
down,'' said John Sappey, who helped compile the data for Vertex.
``In general, governments are being asked to do more, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   Vertex produces tax calculation software for large corporations.
For the periodic survey, it compiled data on income, sales,
property, payroll, telecommunications, franchise, and license and
occupation taxes for a hypothetical service company in each of the
27 cities. The firm was defined as employing 125 people and
generating $1.5 million in profit on $15 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, as in most cities, the two categories accounting
for the largest tax burden were income and payroll, though at No.
16 in each category the city was not particularly high. Sales tax,
however, was the seventh highest in the country and Los Angeles'
business tax, or license and occupation tax, was the second
highest, behind only Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   John Rooney, director of the Valley Economic Development Center,
based in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, said city officials
should take heed of the report's findings, particularly the
business tax ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of small companies and start-ups it's one of their
biggest concerns and is driving their location decisions,'' Rooney
said. ``Many companies opt to locate just outside the city because
of that tax.''

IT'S TIME FOR THOSE NAUGHTY TORIES TO SNIGGER AT A SEX SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For most of its 18 months in office, Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Labor government has managed to avoid the sex scandals
that plagued the previous Conservative governments, whose members
seemed almost comically prone to ill-conceived extramarital
affairs, three-in-a-bed romps and kinky escapades with
tabloid-friendly prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed a week ago, when Ron Davies, the Cabinet
minister who deals with Wales, arrived at Blair's office with a
strange tale of being mugged and robbed at gunpoint by a gang of
strangers after an evening walk across Clapham Common, a notorious
spot for people seeking drugs or gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who is married and has a daughter, handed in his
resignation at once, but his account of what happened _ or rather,
his failure to fill in all of the details _ raised a frenzy of
speculation in the newspapers, starved as they are for
sex-and-politics stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleaze Is Baa-a-a-ck!'' The Sun announced cheerfully,
illustrating its headline with a picture of a sheep. Several
newspapers tracked down Davies' first wife, who revealed that the
couple regularly went ``for months'' without making love.
</P>
<P>
   And, caught up in a competitive frenzy, the newspapers printed
more and more details about what might or might not have happened
to Davies that night, saying that he was looking for sex; that he
was looking for drugs; that his car, which was stolen by the gang,
contained his confidential Cabinet papers; and that he reported the
incident only because he was being blackmailed.
</P>
<P>
   This Monday, while not offering any new details or discussing
his sexuality, Davies denounced the news media for ``reporting as
fact a stream of rubbish.'' In an unusual personal statement in the
House of Commons, he also said: ``We are what we are. We are all
different, the product of both our genes and our experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers repeatedly published an unflattering picture of
Davies dressed as a Druid. And in an effort to defend Davies, his
brother, John, announced that the two had been regularly beaten by
their father when they were growing up with a specially designed
leather strap. ``It was as physically violent and brutal as you
could imagine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for the government? Probably not very
much. Under the Tories, ministers involved in sex scandals were
typically left to twist in the wind until the political damage
built up and the prime minister was forced, finally, to demand
their resignations.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened in this case: Blair has acted decisively in
accepting (or forcing) Davies' resignation, and in persuading the
former minister not to run for the post of leader of the new Welsh
Assembly, a job for which he had been considered the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the story has refused to go away, partly because of a
strange turn last week, when Matthew Parris, an openly gay
columnist for The Times of London, announced on Newsnight, a
late-night current affairs program on the BBC, that the government
was full of homosexuals. In fact, he said, there were two in the
Cabinet, the first being Chris Smith, the Arts Minister, who is
openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Parris said, is Peter Mandelson, the Trade Secretary.
Mandelson, who is single and has never discussed his sexuality in
public, has long been a focus of anti-government opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson refused to comment, even as the papers had a feeding
frenzy over whether or not he was gay, whether or not it mattered,
and what he should do about it.

   CHELLES, France _ Thousands of the 2.3 million high-school
students in France plan to resume protests against poor study
conditions with a demonstration in Paris on Thursday. But at the
Lycee Gaston Bachelard in this Paris suburb, students are torn
about how hard they should keep pushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some promises on paper,'' said Abdenbi Benammar, 20,
a student leader, referring to promised remedies for shortages of
teachers and shortcomings in the curriculum made by the ministry of
education after last month's national protests. ``But until we
actually see changes made we should keep up the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Devannes, a classmate, disagreed. ``We achieved a lot of
things,'' she said. ``We got six teachers' assistants who'll be
here in January, and if we continue the strike too long, we'll
start losing support.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions like this are going on in schools all over the
country after a two-week October vacation that followed some of the
biggest school protests since 1995. Then it was university students
who were on strike. They wanted better classrooms and study
conditions, more teachers, smaller classes and curriculums designed
to help them compete for jobs in an economy where many graduates
find no jobs waiting for them when they get out of school.
</P>
<P>
   In France these days, with unemployment at 11.7 percent,
students are now striking for the right to study harder to be
better prepared for the job market.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one of many things about French schools that might
amaze Americans. Even in troubled neighborhoods, schools have no
metal detectors at the door because guns in France are strictly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in teaching for 19 years, and I've never seen a
knife flashed in all that time, though I've worked in some pretty
tough schools,'' said Daniel Bach, principal at the Lycee
Bachelard, where 2,000 students from all racial and ethnic groups
prepare for the ``bac,'' the baccalaureate diploma that qualifies
them to study at university.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the school, a visitor might ask what there was to
strike about. In a neighborhood of single-family houses and gardens
next to a housing project, the school has big picture windows and
wide, spotlessly clean corridors in four-story buildings organized
around a central courtyard where students gather during breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The openness turns out to be one of the problems. ``Kids from
the neighborhood can come in and sell hashish and other stuff,''
Benammar said. ``We used to have draftees doing alternative service
who helped with administrative work and insured security, but the
draft ended this year and we don't have them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So one of the student demands, here as at other schools around
the country, was for more supervisory workers and better safety.
The education minister, Claude Allegre, promised to increase school
staffs with part-time students as part of the Socialist
government's national youth employment program.
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint of students here was academic schedules that
had scheduled some of them right out of lunch, a problem Bach laid
to computer foul-ups that have since been solved. He discusses
problems like these regularly with student representatives who,
like Benammar, tend to be older than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Students commonly repeat years before passing the national
examination thresholds to higher levels of education, and the
examinations, particularly for the ``bac,'' are so rigorous that
there is little stigma attached to staying back a year or more to
prepare for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strains on the system is that nowadays 60 to 65
percent of all students want to go on to university,'' Bach said.
``It used to be 30 percent. So it's no longer just an elite that
wants to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where until a decade or so ago schools were run by
a huge bureaucracy centralized in Paris, and providing education is
still seen by almost everybody as a state responsibility, students
are as apt as their parents to take to the streets to demand
solutions to their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the high-school protests in Paris turned violent
when unemployed youths joined student marches and started breaking
windows, looting stores and setting cars on fire in scenes
reminiscent of the student revolution in the Latin Quarter in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence this time was an aberration, agreed these
students, who seem more preoccupied with fitting into today's
global economy and their increasingly competitive society than with
changing it.
</P>
<P>
   When Allegre responded to last month's strikes by promising to
lighten the weekly class workload, which keeps many students on the
campus here from 8:15 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., at least some of them
thought he had missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they cut back the workload too much, we could find that we
aren't prepared when we get to university,'' Miss Devannes said.
``They could assume we know math we haven't even studied, and then
how would we cope with our courses?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What exactly the relief in the study load that Allegre promised
would mean was not clear to Muriel Navarro, a history and geography
teacher who meets regularly with student representatives more
concerned with passing tests than avoiding work.
</P>
<P>
   Remedial study programs are unknown in the state university
system, which leaves students to figure out their own deficiencies
and make up for them, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At the high-school level, according to Bach (whose ancestors
came from Germany, though he says he has not had the time to
research whether they were related to Johann Sebastian), it is up
to professors and students together to meet diploma requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Worry about that was one of the reasons students at this school
decided to strike, he said, after they got back to school in
September from summer vacation and found that they were short of
four teachers out of 170. That meant that some students were unable
to sign up for required courses in life sciences and mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had asked the district administration for a replacement for
the math teacher last June, when she asked for maternity leave,''
Bach said. ``But I didn't get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Allegre has promised to recruit 3,000 new substitute
teachers in answer to the strikers' demands, Bach thinks he will
get replacements for the ones he is missing. But he says it will be
up to them and their students to figure out how to get through the
required syllabus by the end of the year.

 &HT;    Georgia party cites unity for victory
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After surviving one of the most negative elections in
state history, Gov.-elect Roy Barnes reached out Wednesday to the
Georgians who voted for him, as well as those who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is over,'' the Democratic victor said as he made
the rounds of morning TV news shows. ``We're not Democrats or
Republicans this morning, we're Georgians.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' opponent, Republican Guy Millner, also sounded
conciliatory as he conceded his stunning 10-point defeat at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have one bit of advice to give to Mr. Barnes, because
he's a very expert politician,'' said Millner, who vowed not to run
for office again after losing three statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   While Wednesday was a day for reflection on all sides, Georgia
Democrats and Republicans were looking at Tuesday's election from
starkly different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and five other Democrats who won statewide races credited
party unity for their strong showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran as a team, and they're going to govern as a team,''
state party Chairman David Worley said Wednesday afternoon at a
Capitol press conference to introduce the winners.
</P>
<P>
   In the Georgia Legislature, Democrats halted a trend of
Republican gains that had continued unbroken since 1990. Democrats
actually gained one seat in the House, while the balance in the
Senate was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Around the South, Democrats won several key contests, and they
picked up five seats in the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, meanwhile, said that disarray in the party had hurt
Republican chances in Georgia. Although U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell
and all eight GOP representatives were re-elected, only two
Republicans _ School Superintendent Linda Schrenko and Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine _ won statewide constitutional offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours were not coordinated campaigns,'' Millner said of his
fellow Republican contenders. In the final few weeks of the
campaign, Millner had refused to appear in public with Mitch
Skandalakis, his party's nominee for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Millner and Skandalakis were so at odds that Millner distributed
a flier in Savannah telling voters they could support him in the
governor's race, while choosing Democrats in other contests.
</P>
<P>
   Millner said a Skandalakis TV commercial attacking Atlanta Mayor
Bill Campbell as an ``incompetent boob'' had spurred
African-Americans, a key Democratic constituency, to the voting
booths. Exit polls indicated that a higher proportion of registered
black voters than whites voted in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes suggested Millner's own commercials attacking affirmative
action had turned off some white voters as well as black voters.
``Racial divisiveness could lead us to economic ruin,'' Barnes
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Most pre-election polls of the governor's race showed Millner
holding a slight lead going into the final weekend. Barnes believes
voters swung to his side because of the negative nature of
Millner's campaign. Millner had several harsh commercials on TV
during the last few days, while Barnes stuck mostly to positive
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are much more informed than politicians give them
credit for,'' said Barnes. ``They'll let you know when they're
tired of something, and they're tired of negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes had urged other candidates for governor to avoid negative
advertising. He said Wednesday he had been forced to respond to
attacks by Millner because ``you can't disarm unilaterally.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Party Chairman Rusty Paul agreed that
Tuesday's results were a wake-up call to his party to quit being so
negative, and to find issues that matter more to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose because of the black vote,'' said Paul. ``We
lost because our own voters sent us a message. They just wrapped it
all up in one big package and said: `Grow up, guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   With Millner losing his second bid for governor in four years,
Democrats renewed their long-term lease on the governor's mansion.
``We're zero for the 20th century,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Republicans haven't governed Georgia since
Reconstruction makes it hard for them to find a potent issue when
times are good, said Worley, the Democratic Party chairman. ``The
problem for them is, people are happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Party unity _ and a pledge to continue the policies of popular
Democratic Gov. Zell Miller _ constituted the theme of a press
conference staged Wednesday afternoon by Barnes and the five other
Democrats who won statewide races: Mark Taylor (lieutenant
governor), Thurbert Baker (attorney general), Cathy Cox (secretary
of state), Michael Thurmond (labor commissioner) and Tommy Irvin
(agriculture commissioner).
</P>
<P>
   By appearing as a team, the officeholders hoped to convey a
sense of unity and continuity, and to remind voters of past
Democratic accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud to get out and campaign as a Georgia Democrat on
the record we've established,'' said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, endorsement by a popular figure like Miller is
difficult to translate to actual votes for other candidates. But by
embracing Miller's policies, the Democrats have claimed his legacy,
Worley said: ``We're for the same things he's for.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his TV appearances earlier in the day, Barnes had
noted that he and Miller started working together 24 years ago,
when Barnes went to the Senate and Miller was lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zell Miller and I have always been friends,'' said Barnes.
``This allows me to continue a legacy he has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough act to follow, but I look forward to trying to
fill his shoes.''

 &HT;    Rushing to aid Mitch's victims
 &HT;    By Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As U.S. and Central American governments continued
Wednesday to assess what disaster relief is needed in the wake of
Hurricane Mitch, hundreds of private relief groups were rapidly
mobilizing to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, American schools, religious groups, chambers
of commerce, hospitals, businesses and individuals have flooded
Nicaraguan and Honduran Embassy phone lines with calls offering
money and services.
</P>
<P>
   While government officials were not able to give specific
numbers of how much private aid has poured into the devastated
region, Honduran Embassy spokesman Benjamin Zapata put it ``in the
hundreds of thousands if not millions'' of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones don't stop,'' a grateful Zapata said. ``We've
received an immeasurable number of aid from these businesses and
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Central America, Hurricane Mitch has killed an estimated
9,000 people and destroyed roads leading to areas where authorities
say thousands are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relief efforts haven't been limited simply to gathering
supplies in drop boxes. Some groups have sent hundreds of
volunteers to the region, and chartered planes and ships to
directly deliver goods.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CARE currently is providing emergency assistance
to 70,000 families, about 350,000 people, in Honduras. It is
distributing 6,000 metric tons of food from CARE stocks and helping
to ensure food and shelter are provided to people forced from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, CARE is also providing shelter for about 10,000
Nicaraguans whose homes were destroyed. It is distributing food,
clothing, sheets, blankets and beds, and managing 35 shelters
spread throughout northern Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   CARE USA President Peter Bell will depart Atlanta on Friday
morning to survey the devastation in Honduras and Nicaragua,
spokesperson Cynthia Glocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta office of UNICEF, reporting on that agency's
efforts, said arrangements have been made for immediate shipment of
oral rehydration salts and $20,000 worth of medicine for those
affected in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, UNICEF is distributing food, clean water, essential
drugs and blankets. UNICEF has also sent aid to Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita Brands International, which suffered an estimated $50
million in losses from banana crops, chartered rescue boats and
other equipment to retrieve victims from the roofs of their buried
homes, said Joe Hagin, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita has also teamed up with such groups as the Red Cross,
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and others to ship
canned goods, medicine and other supplies on boats normally used to
ship exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal here was first to save lives,'' Hagin said. ``The
second goal was to re-establish some basic semblance of life by
providing food and what rudimentary shelter we could help with.''
</P>
<P>
   With a crippled economy and a crushed infrastructure, getting
goods into the devastated part of Central America has been a
challenge. Downed bridges and washed out roads have made
transporting much-needed aid expensive and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many relief agencies are requesting monetary
donations instead of food contributions. Continental, American and
Taca airlines _ all of which serve Central America _ have offered
to ship donated goods for free, Zapata said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has pledged $3.5 million in assistance, and
U.S. Agency for International Development officials said Wednesday
that number is expected to ``increase dramatically'' once the
region's needs are further assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has funneled more than $45 million to the Dominican
Republic and Haiti since the island of Hispaniola, which the two
countries share, was ravaged by Hurricane Georges in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 15 disaster relief specialists have been sent to the
region, and more emergency supplies were expected to arrive today.
</P>
<P>
   But even the care givers were in need of help. The Honduran Red
Cross continued its search operations in the countryside but was
hampered by the lack of transportation and some $2 million in flood
damage to its Tegucigalpa headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the world that, really, our country has been destroyed,''
Honduran Red Cross President Meneca de Mencia told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Cross itself is homeless,'' she said. ``And we're
still rescuing living survivors.''

MOST INVESTOR CLUBS FAILING TO MATCH MARKET PERFORMANCE, STUDY
SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It seems the Beardstown Ladies have lots of
company after all.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmotherly investment club -- which sold millions of
books based on its home-spun investment advice only to later
discover the results were calculated incorrectly -- isn't the only
group of Main Street investors that can't beat Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it turns out that six out of every 10 clubs
underperform the market significantly, according to a six-year
study by Terrance Odean and Brad Barber, finance professors at the
University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The professors looked at the net return after fees of 166
investment clubs from February 1991 to January 1997. They compared
the clubs' performance to the Vanguard Index 500, a no-load index
fund that mirrors the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which is
considered one of the best barometers of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs had an annual return of 14.1 percent compared with
17.8 percent for the market. Investment clubs also underperformed
individuals, who managed to increase their portfolios at 16.4
percent annually, in picking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That's serious news for members of the nation's 37,000
investment clubs, whose popularity has grown as the bull market
surged this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs tended to invest in the stock of small companies,
Odean said, which is in keeping with the philosophy of the National
Association of Investors Corp., an association of investment clubs.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that's a good investment: Historically, smaller
companies grow faster than larger, established companies. But in
the bull market of the '90s, it has been the large companies -- the
Disneys and General Electrics of the world -- that have grown the
fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Odean said his study isn't meant to discourage the formation of
investment clubs. People can join them for fun, education and
social activity, he said, just not for increasing wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message is that most investors should consider
putting a portion of their wealth into low-cost, low-transaction
mutual funds like index funds,'' Odean said. ``In general, they
should not trade individual securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, officials with the Madison Heights, Mich.-based NAIC
don't agree with Odean's research or his conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his personal opinion,'' said Ken Janke, chief executive
officer of NAIC. ``An index fund is mediocrity. If you take out the
fees, it can't compete with the market itself.''
</P>
<P>
   By the nonprofit group's own reckoning, 56 percent of NAIC's
investment clubs have underperformed the market since their
inception. Women-only clubs slightly outperform the NAIC's
male-only groups.
</P>
<P>
   That might not sound great, but it beats the mutual funds
industry, Janke pointed out. Industry trackers say about 80 percent
of mutual funds don't beat the market year in, year out.

ISRAEL TO PROSECUTE INFORMER IN RABIN KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli attorney general announced on Wednesday
that an informer for the Shin Bet security service who had
befriended the assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would be
charged with failing to prevent the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to press charges against the informer, Avishai
Raviv, was laden with political overtones, and it came on the
anniversary of Rabin's assassination at a peace rally in Tel Aviv
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rightist critics of Rabin's peace policies have long argued that
his killer, Yigal Amir, was goaded to action by Raviv, not by the
incendiary language of the political right in the months before the
slaying. Supporters of Rabin have accused the rightists of trying
to shirk responsibility for the charged political climate that
preceded the assassination. They suggested that the decision to
prosecute Raviv was politically motivated, and had been made under
right-wing pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein asserted that he had
acted solely on the basis of evidence about Raviv's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have become convinced that I would be untrue to myself if he
were not brought to justice,'' Rubinstein said at a news
conference. ``Although the decision was not easy, my hand would
have trembled if I had signed on to closing the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein said Raviv will be charged with failure to prevent a
crime, inciting racism and praising violent acts. He said Raviv,
who was a friend of Amir, knew of his intention to kill Rabin, but
had failed to report them. Amir shot Rabin on Nov. 4, 1995, in an
attempt to stop peace efforts. He was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Wednesday, Raviv insisted that he had not
known of Amir's intention to kill Rabin. ``Had I known, I would
have reported it,'' Raviv said.
</P>
<P>
   Raviv was active in right-wing protests against Rabin, and in
one demonstration he held up a poster showing the prime minister in
a Nazi SS uniform. He was also shown on Israeli television during a
staged swearing-in ceremony of a militant group he headed known as
Eyal.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing politicians welcomed the decision to prosecute Raviv,
calling it a courageous step toward uncovering the truth about his
activities. Leftist lawmakers condemned the move, asserting that it
would serve rightist attempts to obscure the climate of hate that
led to the assassination.

 3-Strikes Law for Drivers  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Starting Thursday, California drivers who rack up three penalty
points for bad driving in a three-year period can have their auto
insurance canceled or premiums doubled.
<P>
   Until now, drivers had to accumulate three points in a single
year before these sanctions could be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Insurance, which approved the regulatory
change at the urging of the industry and over the objection of key
legislators, said the move will result in lower premiums for the 90
percent of California drivers with good records.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates are skeptical. They point out that there's
nothing in the new state regulation that explicitly requires any
insurance company to make good-driver reductions sufficient to
offset premium increases imposed on bad drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry representatives said  &LR; Wednesday  &LR; they expect
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, elected to his second
term Tuesday, to put out a bulletin in coming months ordering the
industry to show what's happened with rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's premature to predict any reductions in rates,
though,'' said Bill Packer, spokesman for the Association of
California Insurance Companies in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Three bad things await drivers who fail the new test: They can
have their rates increased by their current insurer, they can get
canceled outright and have to find another insurer who will most
likely charge them more, or they can wind up paying up to 50
percent more for liability coverage under the state-sponsored
California Assigned Risk Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The points, set by the Department of Motor Vehicles, come with
traffic tickets and are based on the seriousness of the offense.
Most nonreckless moving violations result in one point. Alcohol
offenses generally result in two points.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are allowed to go to traffic school to remove points
from their records. But up to 10 percent of California's 23 million
drivers may garner enough points to be adversely affected by the
new rules, insurance sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy about the change, the Prop. 103 Enforcement Project said
it's considering filing a lawsuit against the insurance department.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica consumer advocacy group, formed to defend the
1988 rate reduction measure approved by voters, believes the
regulation violates a provision of Proposition 103 that says rate
hikes must be based on a ``substantial increase in the hazard
insured against.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Calabrese, analyst for the group, said the Department of
Insurance has not proven that someone who gets three points in
three years is any higher of a risk than someone who gets three
points in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This regulation is way too harsh,'' Calabrese said. ``Do we
really want more people canceled when we already have a high
uninsured motorist rate?''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dunmoyer, president of the Personal Insurance Federation, a
trade group, said the industry isn't trying to cancel customers. It
lobbied for the changes, &LR;  in part because it would save money by
doing driver record searches less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending $6 to $20 to search each insured driver's
record annually, it can do the search every three years, saving
millions of dollars in administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs a lot of money to run the bureaucracy,'' Dunmoyer
said. ``We think people who get a ticket every year aren't going to
like this change but the average driver will benefit.''

NEWS WITH A DECIDEDLY BRITISH ACCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week brings a couple of niche-news imports from Britain to
PBS. At 5:30 p.m. on weeknights on 44 stations comes ``World News
for Public Television,'' produced in Britain by the Independent
Television Network and slightly adapted to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WLIW/Channel 21 on Long Island and a few other PBS
stations are carrying bulletins from the BBC World News three times
a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC entry, the evident loser in this trans-Atlantic
competition, is not exerting itself to provide an especially
American spin. Maybe that is the Old World's comment on the United
States' obsession with Washington scandals at the expense of
international coverage.
</P>
<P>
   About half its debut program delivered a succinct report, mostly
from an Iraqi perspective, of the latest stalemate in talks on U.N.
arms inspections. Then it skipped to repercussions of the Middle
Eastern peace negotiations, with the unstartling opinion from a
correspondent that ``extremist threats should be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Flood pictures from Central America and passing reference to the
week's elections in the United States and John Glenn's space trip
faded off into a scattering of Sunday sports headlines (Finnish
car-racing champions, golf in Spain and boxing in Las Vegas)
perhaps aimed at people who have had enough of the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``World News for Public Television'' with Daljit Dhaliwal, an
anchor who has won enough fans around the world for ITN to be
certified as a cult figure, makes slightly more of an effort at
luring the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   On WNET/Channel 13, the program joins the weekly block of
early-evening news and information programs along with ``The News
Hour With Jim Lehrer'' and ``The Nightly Business Report.''
</P>
<P>
   That insures a certain amount of repetition. On Monday
afternoon, both the new program and the good old Lehrer report led
off with pretty much the same dramatic pictures of the flooding in
Central America and the latest on the squabble in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The freshest report from Britain had to do with corruption and
human rights abuses in Malaysia. The cases, with their unfamiliar
casts, were not easy to follow, but the reporter left no doubt of
his opinion by announcing that the whole affair was ``a travesty of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. interests were acknowledged in pieces on the Glenn space
journey, which was interpreted as a success of the NASA publicity
machine, and a correspondent's opinion that the United States in
this political season was ``a democracy bordering on the
dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   British reporters are evidently permitted leeway in such
matters. The half-hour returned to roots on a very English note
with Prince Philip's doing some elegant wine tasting during a trip
to Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   The program is well produced, relatively uncluttered with
promotional graphics and not committed to medical wonders. As for
Ms. Dhaliwal, she is as businesslike an anchor as anyone could ask
for. Whether U.S. fans will find enough here to add much to their
nightly news fix awaits further inspection.

 Intel PC Plan Is Simple, Problematic  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The orange, trapezoid-shaped box represented Intel Corp.'s notion
of how the next generation of personal computers can be more
attractive and easier to use.
<P>
   It was so easy, supposedly, that even I could hook it up.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged in the nifty flat-panel display monitor. I plugged in
the keyboard. I plugged the box into an outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Simple enough. Except for one thing. It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we lost our display,'' said Caroline De Bie, the
Intel press relations manager helping with the demonstration.
``This morning, we had it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Whalley, Intel's manager of PC initiatives, suggested,
``Let me try rebooting.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was not the point of the demonstration. Whalley
had just spent the previous hour in a conference room at the San
Francisco Marriott talking about how computers needed to become
more user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see PCs that don't crash or, if they do, do it in
the background somehow _ so the user is not intimidated by weird
error messages that don't mean anything,'' Whalley said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's colorful new ``concept vehicle'' is designed to be both
state-of-the-art and user-friendly _ ideas successfully exploited
by Apple with its new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, the Intel box does away with traditional
connection ports for printers and other peripherals, replacing them
with USB ports that are expected to become standard for all
computer components.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel machine also has a DVD drive, something the
inexpensive iMac lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new Intel prototypes, in odd colors and shapes,
will be on display later this month at the Comdex trade show in Las
Vegas. The machines won't be available for sale, though any
computer-maker is free to take the idea and run with it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Microsoft, which control the personal computer market
by virtue of their near-monopolies in microprocessors and operating
system software, have worked with PC-makers for years to create
simpler computers.
</P>
<P>
   If PCs become easier to use, the thinking goes, more people will
buy them _ and Intel and Microsoft will sell even more chips and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fairly significant number of people out there who
have an interest in buying a PC, and they've got the income, but
they're not buying because of this fear, uncertainty and doubt,''
Whalley said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel hopes that its new prototype will provide a blueprint for
PC companies as well as for the hundreds of smaller hardware and
software companies who want their technologies adopted as industry
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Building a futuristic PC is a new step for Intel, which
typically guides the industry toward new standards by coaxing
consensus from a group of companies that otherwise might strike out
in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have a lot of people all having an opinion about
technology, it slows down the process of getting something done,''
Whalley said. Computer-makers say they ``would like an
Intel-Microsoft coalition to tell the industry what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Intel, Microsoft and the big computer-makers
have seen to it that the new PCs remain compatible with old ones.
Often, that creates a build-up of old technology in the computer
that makes it hard to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always adding technology, and we're not taking anything
away,'' Whalley said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most PCs sold today must have two kinds of slots
inside them for modems, video accelerators and other add-ons _ one
kind for fast new components, and another kind for older cards
still on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, most new PCs come with traditional serial and parallel
ports along with USB ports, so users can hook up older peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's new PC vividly demonstrates the company's vision of a
future in which computers are simple and foolproof. But yesterday's
demonstration also showed how far the industry has to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an overnight sensation,'' Whalley said after the
monitor flunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's dead,'' said De Bie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bang it,'' Whalley suggested.

ADVERTISING: PEPSI-COLA NORTH AMERICA PLANS AN OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa., Tenn., N.C.)  (lb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a key reorganization intended to make Pepsico more focused,
the company's North American beverage operations on Wednesday
announced a restructuring of the sales and marketing divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Marineau, president and chief executive officer of
Pepsi-Cola North America, outlined the changes Wednesday in a
six-page memo to employees that repeatedly emphasized a desire to
improve connections with consumers as well as with stores that sell
Pepsi-Cola products.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to be followed shortly by a major
reorganization of Pepsi's bottling operations into a handful of
large bottlers in which Pepsico will hold an equity stake. Pepsi
announced the division of its concentrate and bottling businesses
in September, creating the Pepsi Bottling Group and naming Craig
Weatherup as the group's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to be more market- and consumer-driven than we have
been,'' Marineau said in an interview Wednesday. ``It's to improve
our consumer marketing skills and sell better than we have in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival at the company in January, Marineau has been
intent on transforming Pepsi from the United States' perennial No.
2 soft-drink player into a more dynamic, better organized company.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a champion of Pepsi One, a diet cola that contains
an artificial sweetener known as Ace-K and that is the first new
diet-cola product to hit the U.S. market in almost two decades.
Pepsi plans to spend $100 million on advertising and promotions for
Pepsi One; it began its onslaught during the World Series last
month with a string of commercials starring the actor Cuba Gooding
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau also jettisoned the ``Generation next'' ad campaign,
shortly after the abrupt departure of Pepsi's global marketing
chief, Brian Swette, who thought it up. Marineau has said he has no
desire for a new tag line for Pepsi products, and recent television
commercials have shown no particular pattern; they range from a
little girl enraged because a coffee shop she is patronizing serves
Coke and not Pepsi, to clay animation baseball players who get a
burst of energy from drinking Lipton tea.
</P>
<P>
   The sales and marketing overhaul is ``a continuation of his
putting his own stamp on the organization,'' said Jennifer Solomon,
a beverage analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes announced Wednesday was the appointment of
Robert Jordan, a former consultant who joined Pepsi three months
ago, to take charge of consumer research. The work done by that
division, the memo said, is expected to translate into ``tangible
programs, consumer-relevant new products and across-the-board
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dawn Hudson, a former executive at the Frito-Lay
snack unit who had moved to Pepsi earlier this year, was named
senior vice president for strategy and marketing. Ms. Hudson's
responsibilities will include new products as well as the
coordination of brand-marketing and corporate strategy, which has
been a weak point at Pepsi for the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi has been exploring additional ways to market salty snacks
and soft drinks together, something it began as a once-a-year
promotion eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hudson's appointment also eliminates the three-member
marketing committee Pepsi announced in the spring after Swette, who
was one of the three, resigned, Marineau said.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes include the creation of an ``innovation and
technology'' department, which Marineau described as ``dedicated to
maintaining an innovation pipeline that is filled with new
products, packaging and equipment'' and will include an existing
research and development unit based in Valhalla, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a new vice president for ``channel strategy and
occasion marketing,'' which will try to ``better understand how
consumers relate to our products'' in convenience stores,
supermarkets, vending machines and other places where people buy
Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau also announced the combining of the company's
customer-development and bottler-development teams into a single
unit, headed by Jim Nolan, a 20-year Pepsi veteran, and changes in
the way sales are handled. ``We are transforming our entire
system's in-market operation,'' Marineau said in his memo, ``to
create one powerful selling machine that is focused like a laser on
the requirements of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   All this seems designed to make Pepsi function a lot more like
its archrival, Coca-Cola Co., when it comes to streamlining and
coordinating its corporate self. Much of it appears to have been
driven by the rapid consolidation of supermarkets and other big
retailers, which are a soft-drink company's biggest customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There's more to come. One analyst expects an announcement within
the next week or so of a reconfiguration of Pepsi's bottling
operations into five Coke-style ``anchor bottlers'' around the
country. Such a move, said the analyst, Bill Pecoriello of Sanford
C. Bernstein, would set the stage for additional consolidation of
other, smaller bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   The five bottlers would include Pepsi's company-owned
operations, the recently split off Pepsi Bottling Group, he said.
The others, Pecoriello added, would be Whitman Corp.'s
Illinois-based Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers unit, which currently
handles about 12 percent of Pepsi's volume in the United States;
Honickman Affiliates, based outside Philadelphia; Delta Beverage
Group, based in Memphis, Tenn.; and Pepcom Industries, based in
Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the five would handle 76 percent of Pepsi's volume,
compared with the 88 percent that Coke's top five bottlers handle.
</P>
<P>
   Those bottlers will be sold parts of Pepsi's bottling business
to make them bigger, Pecoriello said, with the goal of having the
Pepsi Bottling Group wind up with about 50 percent of Pepsi's
volume, instead of the current 58 percent. Pepsico is expected to
take the Pepsi Bottling Group public, and many on Wall Street say
the initial public offering could take place sometime in the first
half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau refused to discuss the bottler reorganization in
detail, but it is widely known that the company is negotiating with
several big bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all this, you could have a Pepsico that looks like a
better investment,'' Pecoriello said. With low-margin bottling
businesses gone from the books, and the higher-margin concentrate
sales and the snack business remaining, Pepsi could see more
consistent earnings growth and find itself a far nimbler competitor
in the marketplace, he said.

BLAST AT KREMLIN HURTS THREE GUARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ What was evidently a car bomb exploded just outside the
Kremlin Wednesday evening, wounding three security guards and the
driver and rattling windows in Russia's traditional seat of power.
</P>
<P>
   Police cut off the car, a small Russian-made Moskvich, after it
sped past the GUM department store and across the cobblestones of
Red Square toward the Spassky Gates, which top officials use to
enter the Kremlin under its distinctive red clock tower.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities described the force of the explosion as equal to 13
pounds of TNT. The site was cordoned off by security guards, but
Russian television showed smoke wafting around the onion domes of
St. Basil's Cathedral in Red Square, just outside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who jumped out of the car before it exploded, is
being questioned in a Moscow hospital. A police official said the
driver's documents identified him as Ivan Orlov, a correspondent
for an obscure nationalist magazine called Russian Truth.
</P>
<P>
   The car reportedly carried other passengers, but they were not
identified. One of the wounded security guards was said to be in
serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, whose office is inside the Kremlin, was
away recuperating from illness.

`KNOWN BY HEART': A PREMIERE BRINGS OUT A HIDDEN BRANDO 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Any new work by Twyla Tharp for American Ballet
Theater is an event. She knows how to surprise and to reveal the
unsuspected about virtuoso classical dancers. ``Known by Heart,''
given its premiere by the company on Tuesday night at City Center,
is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-minute piece is, above all, a fabulous showcase for Ethan
Stiefel, the former New York City Ballet principal who joined
Ballet Theater two seasons ago. Ms. Tharp brings out the Marlon
Brando in him; in short, all the new hanging-loose brawn he
displays here is rooted in a bravura performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Known by Heart'' is nonetheless one of Ms. Tharp's true
classical ballets and, at its beginning, gleamingly so. But in the
last third of the piece, Ms. Tharp shoots herself in the toe shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Extraneous dancers are tossed into the contrapuntal fray, and
the final section of this three-part ballet is just plain long, not
merely repetitive like its minimalist score by Steve Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart, however, accompanies the sunlit neo-classical first
segment, danced by Angel Corella and Julie Kent. The metallic sound
of a percussion tape by Donald Knaack, once a disciple of John
Cage, hangs over the second part for Stiefel and Susan Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   A male duet for Keith Roberts and Griff Braun, often dancing in
unison, promises a relevant contrast to the first two sections. But
by the time six more dancers get involved, the glazed-eye effect
has taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Ms. Tharp did not see fit to chop off some of the
selections from Reich's ``Six Pianos,'' also heard on tape. Along
the way, she loses the thread that initially led her through a
distinctively polished choreographic maze.
</P>
<P>
   As a title, ``Known by Heart'' is up for grabs. Whatever its
private meaning (the program dedication is to the memory of Bob
Patino, an interior decorator and a friend of Ms. Tharp's), it is a
truism that dancers learn choreography by heart.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Ms. Tharp gives her cast plenty to learn on the formal
plane. Each couple has its own signature, motifs that are
recapitulated in each section and in a different context, within
the final ensemble. Devoid of an overt message, the ballet is a
pure-dance exploration of musical contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Danse Allemande'' opens the piece and unlike the
other music, it is heard live and not on tape. Actually, it is
heard in a circusy orchestration that evokes a fife and drum corps.
Ermanno Florio's brisk conducting nonetheless allows the dance form
in which Mozart wrote to come through while Ms. Tharp picks up on
the orchestration's parade-ground effect in the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Kent and Corella, dressed in white by Santo Loquasto,
enter they are granted the promise of a bright future thanks to
Jennifer Tipton's lighting, which grows intricately nuanced and
grayer throughout the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent, in a short tunic, recalls both an heiress on a tennis
court and one of George Balanchine's ballerinas. Ms. Tharp offers a
nod to Balanchine's ``Concerto Barocco'' when, as in that ballet,
Corella slides Ms. Kent, two feet together, along the floor. But
she is also slid across in a deep plie, her toe shoes skimming the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent is all luminosity and clarity, paying attention to
detail and her knee held high in frequent attitude turns. There is
the occasional flexed foot but Ms. Tharp does not mock the
classical idiom. She honors its basic steps with a poetic
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, she refrains from exploiting Corella's magnificent
technique, giving him a purer image than expected. After his solo
and Ms. Kent's brief solo, a hurdy-gurdy sound leads Ms. Tharp into
a fleeting folk dance for the couple. The partnering, never easy,
leaves Corella looking winded but still game.
</P>
<P>
   The connections between the different sections are subtle. At
one point, Ms. Kent zigzags to the ground, a movement that is
reversed later by Stiefel and given a harder edge by the other men.
</P>
<P>
   Part II takes its cue from ``Junk Music,'' in which Knaack uses
found objects for percussion. The choreography offers a
sophisticated updating of 1930s machine dances, with Stiefel, in
sleeveless shirt, and Ms. Jaffe, in a gray tunic and on toe, as
robots programmed with ballet training. He leaps in, she slides
across and in a recurring image, she hits him on the noggin.
Everything sounds and looks metallic.
</P>
<P>
   Stiefel, asked to act dizzy, is all character study: He shadow
boxes, he executes a double assemble turn, he shakes his way up
from the ground to end in ballet's fifth position, in perfect
academic form. Ms. Jaffe's solo has a similar collage structure.
</P>
<P>
   Stiefel lets loose in a muscular display after he has bumped
chest to chest with his partner. There is a stunning moment when he
remains suspended in the air, feet bent to one side, and drops
straight to the floor. When the movement is poorly executed by
other dancers, it is evident how brilliantly Ms. Tharp and Stiefel
have collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   Braun and Roberts are impressive as a space-age Tweedledee and
Tweedledum in the Reich segment, where their broad steps, circles
and spins are taken up by two replacements, Marcelo Gomes and Sean
Stewart. From then on it is downhill as the first couples enter and
exit and the stage fills up with two other pairs (Oksana
Konobeyeva, Maxim Belotserkovsky, Ekaterina Shelkanova and Giuseppe
Picone), all looking as if they had rushed into the wrong ballet.
</P>
<P>
   A word for the wonderfully integrated performance on the same
program of ``Fancy Free,'' led by the outstanding Gil Boggs, Ethan
Brown, John Gardner, Christine Dunham and Amanda McKerrow.

<P>
   Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections,
congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who
was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition
party gains in an off-year election.
</P>
<P>
   The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility of
congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results
showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45
hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the
president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it
whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes.
The Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political
year marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat
leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, amounted
to the smallest congressional majority since the
Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans
controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and
its impeachment inquiry, Rep. Henry Hyde told fellow Republicans on
the panel in a conference call Wednesday that the only witness
Republicans were likely to call would be the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr. Hyde, the chairman, told lawmakers he hoped to have
the committee vote on possible articles of impeachment by
Thanksgiving, an act that would take the issue out of his hands and
put it into Gingrich's. Committee Democrats declined comment
Wednesday until they could discuss Hyde's plan among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt
Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held
onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time
since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans
burned up the phone lines to each other, discussing whether to
mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males
running the Washington Republican Party,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said that Republicans
this year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We
need an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire
calendar year without an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut called the
election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are going to
be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party want
to see change.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton called the election results a
vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all the
results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American
people want their business, their concerns, their children, their
families, their future addressed here. That's what the message of
the election was.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first difficult questions now facing Congress is how
to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public
resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican
majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes
required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a public statement
released Wednesday, Hyde said ``The Committee continues to have a
clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and
expeditious manner. Our duty has not changed because the
constitution has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results
guaranteed that impeachment will fail. ``I think any serious effort
to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he
said. ``It is simply for Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott to decide on
an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island
Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously,
fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control of the
House with 228 seats and to find consensus among their party's
competing factions. With their numbers reduced, the Republican
leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing act to unite
a hard-core conservative faction that wants a more aggressive
social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want their party to
return to the center. The Democrats held 206 seats, and one was
held by an indepenndent.
</P>
<P>
   Any small Republican faction will now have enormous leverage.
The new arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and
moderate Republicans' forming ad hoc majorities on issues, taking
control away from Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Already seeing some of the possibilities, Rep. Peter King of
Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be
strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership
and makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said. ``It's going to
weaken the position of the strident conservatives and the
anti-northeast conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging
from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncharacteristically
uncertain Wednesday, he said he had trouble accounting for the
results.

 UNDATED: the results.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Things were happening out there that none of us fully
understand--neither party in my judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his share of the blame for his party's losses, the
Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would
recoil from the Clinton scandal as amplified in the modern media
world and how the scandal would drown out other Republican themes.
``I mean I totally underestimated the degree to which people would
just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk television and talk radio and
then the degree to which this whole scandal became just sort of
disgusting by sheer repetition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a result I think we probably underestimated the need to
really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting
taxes and saving Social Security, winning the war on drugs,
reforming education and national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted
mistakes, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message
in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that
Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt
his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of this lessons for Republicans out of this is that we
need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a
clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the
nation,'' he said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis
next year on tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two leaders spoke, their angry rank-and-file
lawmakers were making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount
challenges against the Republican leaders who have steered the
Congress since the Republican's assumed control four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican staffer said the House had become a
``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, ``The long distance
charges in Washington offices probably are going through the roof
today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that
something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington
Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well in New
York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas.'' And while Gingrich has
not gone out of his way to identify himself with the Republican
campaign's last-minute ad blitz attacking President Clinton, his
caucus knows he is responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup
attempt against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his
own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him
remains a long-shot. But with House leadership elections now set
for mid-November, Republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in
their caucus had crossed ideological lines to moderates like Shays
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got shellacked,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a
conservative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves because we had no
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were discussing possible challenges to Gingrich, his
second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey, and other members of the senior
leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run an entire new
ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee
chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent, an
Oklahoma conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the
speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly concerned.''
Republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early
December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges
against mid-level leadership figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators expressed particular pique toward the
re-election chairman, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who
poured party dollars and much of his own time into trying to defeat
the Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell
Feingold of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he
had talked to more than eight senators, and was considering whether
to challenge McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election
outcome. ``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a
very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Most incumbents coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will
not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince
Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of
Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of
Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid _ Rep. Jay
Johnson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22
Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, a
Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final
victory announcement was not expected until Friday after absentee
ballots are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the self-proclaimed ``revolutionaries'' of the Republican
class of 1994, many of the newly elected members are career
politicians who rose through the ranks of local and state
government. Three of the Democrats are the sons of former
lawmakers, Mark Udall of Colorado, son of Morris Udall who
represented Arizona; Tom Udall of New Mexico, son of the other
Udall brother, Stewart, a former congressman and secretary of the
Interior, and Charlie Gonzalez, who won the Texas seat of his
father, Henry.

SHOPPERS PREPARED TO SPEND AS MUCH OR MORE THIS SEASON, FIRM FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Financially speaking, Jeff Gutzman is in a good
mood these days, and he expects his holiday bills to reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we're doing better than last year,'' said Gutzman,
who spent part of Wednesday afternoon with his fiancee, Maria
Lujan, at the Northridge Fashion Center in the suburban Los Angeles
community of Northridge, about 25 miles northwest of downtown.
``I'll probably spend the same as last year, if not more.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutzman, who plunked down about $700 on gifts last year, is as
upbeat as most of the nation's consumers, according to a survey
released Wednesday by the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP.
</P>
<P>
   About 78 percent of consumers say they plan to spend as much or
more on holiday gifts this year as they did last year, compared
with 72 percent in the prior year's survey.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, consumers said they plan to spend an average of $814
on holiday gifts, up about 4.5 percent from last year. Los
Angeles-area shoppers said they will fork out an average of $735 --
about the same amount as last year, according to Deloitte &AMP; Touche
-- outpacing the $717 average for the Western states as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons that could explain why Los Angeles and
the West regularly fall below the national average, said Richard
Giss, a partner in the trade retail services group of Deloitte &AMP;
Touche in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Giss speculates that the Los Angeles area has a larger
proportion of recent immigrants who don't spend as much; Southern
California shoppers don't have to buy the heavy and more expensive
winter items that appeal to consumers on the East Coast; and
shoppers in California might spend more of their holiday money on
travel than their counterparts elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation; we don't have any data,'' Giss said.
``All I can say is it happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Wilcox of suburban Granada Hills is a West Coast consumer
who said she will spend less this year -- not because of any
financial difficulties, but because she laid out a whopping $5,000
last year on gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I went overboard,'' Wilcox said while shopping at
the Northridge mall.
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, finding plenty of deals, sales and promotions
that should help her keep this year's spending in check. ``I think
they have more creative things in the stores where you can spend
less,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Another study released Wednesday, the fourth annual American
Express Retail Index, also showed consumers are upbeat and
predicted that West Coast consumers will spend more than their East
Coast counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent stock market volatility, the 800 consumers
surveyed for the report said they planned to spend an average of
$1,352 on holiday gifts, entertaining, travel and related items --
an 8 percent increase from last year's $1,233.
</P>
<P>
   Spending in the 10 Western states that include California will
average about $1,522 and outpace any other region, according to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, retailers also are feeling good about the coming
season and foresee that sales will improve over last year's, which
were the strongest of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi study, retailers expect
sales at stores that have been open at least a year to rise 4.5
percent to 5 percent during the holiday season.

CULTURE NOTES: A 14TH-CENTURY CHINESE TREASURE IN BRITAIN; MANET'S
PORTRAIT OF MORISOT; REMEMBERING TED HUGHES; MYSTERY GUEST AT THE
METROPOLITAN OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 12-feet long and 11-inches high, a 14th-century Chinese
hand-scroll painting on silk of minutely observed insects and
plants, looking as fresh as the day it was finished, has been added
to the collection of the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``The Fascination of Nature,'' by Xie Chufang, was
hailed by museum officials as one of the rarest of its kind. It
will go on display from December to April, and will be shielded
from daylight for the rest of the year, to preserve the colors and
the silk.
</P>
<P>
   The work was acquired from a private collector for $629,000.
Experts said they expect it to be one of the museum's most
treasured and studied antiquities.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Increased Riches
</P>
<P>
   The great 19th-century collection of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris
has become greater. Wednesday its latest treasure went on view:
Edouard Manet's portrait of the Impressionist painter Berthe
Morisot.
</P>
<P>
   The work, ``Berthe Morisot With a Bouquet of Violets,'' has not
been seen in public for 15 years. France's Culture Ministry bought
it for $14.5 million from her heirs, who have owned it since her
death in 1894. The portrait, painted in 1872, is a study of shadow
and light that emphasizes Morisot's dark beauty and intense gaze.  &QL;

   Farewell
</P>
<P>
   Britain's poet laureate, Ted Hughes, was buried on Tuesday in
the tiny Devon village of North Tawton, where he died at his home
last week. In a eulogy, Seamus Heaney, the Nobel laureate in
literature, said his death had left ``a rent in the veil of
poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 mourners crowded St. Peter's Church to pay their
respects to Hughes, who was 68. At the request of Hughes' widow,
Carol, Heaney read the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' ``Do Not Go Gentle
Into That Good Night.'' Hughes' first wife was the American poet
Sylvia Plath, who committed suicide in 1963 after he left her for
another woman.  &QL;

   Mystery Guest
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Could it be a match made in Mozartean operatic heaven
when a surprise guest joins Bryn Terfel and other Metropolitan
Opera stars for the 23rd Richard Tucker Gala at Avery Fisher Hall
on Sunday? The stage was set for musical mischief leading to an
unannounced guest after Luciano Pavarotti, recovering from knee and
hip surgery, bowed out as master of ceremonies of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The gala raises money for awards, grants and programs that
foster the careers of American singers. Among Tucker Award winners
appearing at the gala, beginning at 5:45 p.m., are Richard Leech,
Aprile Millo, Dwayne Croft and Patricia Racette, recently announced
as the Met's replacement for Renee Fleming in ``La Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's son Barry will be master of ceremonies and Leonard
Slatkin will conduct.

SOME X'S, O'S AND Z'S: PHILLIPS JOLTS BILLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Listen to Wade Phillips long enough and he will
lull you to sleep. He has an easy voice and an easy demeanor and he
is so calm and so comfortable that it appears he is sleepwalking.
Far from it, though. Don't sleep on Phillips. Or his team.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Bills began the season 0-3 and looked like they were
cooked. Well-done. But Phillips saw more. He saw a team that lost
by 2 points at San Diego, by 6 at Miami and by 1 to St. Louis.
Three losses, 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept pressing the players on that, and that two of those
loses were on the last play of the game,'' Phillips said. ``I've
been through a lot of seasons where things started out bad and got
better. The losses made us appreciate the winning so much more. Now
we get excited about winning. We know what it takes to win and it's
fun again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun because Buffalo has beaten San Francisco, Indianapolis,
Jacksonville, Carolina and Miami in successive weeks. Three losses
and then five victories. Now the players win, Phillips says, and
they can't wait until the next one. The next one is at the Jets on
Sunday. It is for first place in the American Football Conference
East as both teams turn the corner on the season's halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   Roasted but not cooked, after all. That is the Bills now and it
is Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 51, jumped into coaching in 1969 as a college
assistant. His first head-coaching job came after that, from 1970
through 1972, at a Texas high school. He was an interim head coach
with the New Orleans Saints in 1985 and interim head coach again
for Denver one game in 1990. Things would go wrong and Phillips
would get a call.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was a defensive coordinator in Denver and in Buffalo.
He was Denver's head coach for two seasons and went 7-9 in 1995
before being dismissed. He came to Buffalo for three seasons as the
defensive coordinator and then Marv Levy retired after last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were 6-10 last year. Things went wrong and Phillips
got a call.
</P>
<P>
   There is distance now between the Phillips dismissal in Denver
and the Phillips leadership now, the Doug Flutie-mania at
quarterback and the current Bills excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of distance between me and Denver,'' Phillips
said. ``I appreciated the opportunity. I learned some things. But I
think all Denver had to do was wait a couple of years. The
foundation was being laid. It would have worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Broncos would not wait. Phillips had to go. He was seen
as lovable and wonderful but not as a leader. Not as the brightest
guy, despite even though others have long viewed him as a defensive
wiz. Denver thought it was becoming stagnant under Phillips.
Buffalo is doing the opposite. It is being resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Phillips is different in one way now. He is more
determined, more clear, more decisive. He walked into his news
conference here Wednesday morning and said: ``I know what the
question is and the answer is Doug Flutie.''
</P>
<P>
   Head on. He said that Flutie was the Bills quarterback against
the Jets and beyond. He said that there was a lot of ego involved
with keeping Rob Johnson, the previous starter back from injury
now, on the bench, but the Bills have to go with Flutie's hot hand.
He said Johnson needed to know and ``we needed to know where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I think you have to have a quarterback. A
quarterback.'' The emphasis was truly on the ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   And you have to have a true, tested leader when you are 0-3 and
the ship is rocking, full of holes and taking on water. Phillips is
a man the Bills players say they follow and respect.
</P>
<P>
   He is like Levy in that he keeps in touch, in tune with his
players. He said a few of them came and talked to him about the
Flutie/Johnson decision. And Phillips did not turn them away. After
so many years with Levy, it is difficult to imagine that the Bills,
especially the veteran Bills, could have flourished under a fiery
coach who constantly ignites fires. With a new coach, a new
quarterback, a new offense, a new defense, new assistant coaches,
really, for Buffalo this season, after nearly starting all over,
the Bills needed some patience. No wonder, with all of the changes,
their start was 0-3. No wonder they took time to coalesce. The
magical thing is it is happening now, with eight games down, with
eight to play. Everyone was about to fall asleep on the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Wade Phillips has helped jolt this team and this town wide
awake.
</P>
<P>
   Through rough times, he kept the Bills in one piece, then began
riding the hot hand of Flutie. He complemented Flutie with sound
defense and solid decisions. With leadership.
</P>
<P>
   That is what good coaches do.
</P>

 &HT;    UT defense leaves competition confused, defeated
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Cedric Woodard, the University of Texas' most
svelte defensive tackle at 6-foot-5 and 292 pounds, was talking
recently about how this new Longhorn defense, which relies so much
on stunts and blitzes, was flabbergasting so many opposing
offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive linemen, they get down in their stance, they
look up, and we're not in the same spot anymore,'' said Woodard.
``You know they're getting confused. They're confused on who to
block, which usually leaves one of us open (and unblocked).''
</P>
<P>
   They're about as confused as many of the Longhorn fans, who
don't recognize this new UT defense from the one who set school
records last year for futility. The tackles Woodard and his buddies
Casey Hampton
</P>
<P>
   and Shaun Rogers have played well all season, making tackles,
taking
</P>
<P>
   on double teams, stunting to the right places while rarely
blowing assignments. Problem was, with the rest of the unit playing
so poorly in September, nobody noticed that the interior of the
line was doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, consistent has been the buzz word at practices these
days at Denius Field, as the UT coaches start describing their
defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to give ole Coach Tolley credit,'' said UT defensive
coordinator Carl Reese of his tackles coach, Mike Tolleson. ``Those
kids have played consistently, even in the bad times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to start with Casey, he's always played well. Cedric
Woodard has been consistent and Shaun (Rogers) has been pushing him
for playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were consistent the whole time, along with Humphrey and
(Dusty) Renfro. Then the secondary caught up. Then the linebackers
caught up.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody caught up against Nebraska last Saturday in UT's 20-16
upset. It is probably no coincidence that the tackles had their
best game, statistically, of the season, with all three (Rogers
plays so much he is considered a starter) posting season highs in
tackles. Hampton had eight; Woodard had six and Rogers had four,
including a quarterback sack.
</P>
<P>
   The three all were highly touted prospects coming out of high
school. Woodard, a junior, was considered the top defensive linemen
in the state in 1996. He turned down strong overtures from Texas
A&AMP;M, Notre Dame and Florida to sign with the Longhorns. Hampton
also signed with UT last year. He had been near the top of most
recruiting boards as a junior, but most schools crossed him off the
list, thinking he likely would not qualify academically for a
scholarship. Hampton made his grades. He took a medical redshirt
last season after suffering a severe knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, a sophomore , was considered among the top 10 best
recruits in the state in 1997. He turned down Colorado and Oklahoma
and committed to Texas two months before signing day.
</P>
<P>
   They're only now living up to their high school hype.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's the scheme Reese says the tackles and ends stunt
</P>
<P>
   about one-third of the time that has turned them into monsters
</P>
<P>
   against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to use our quickness and strength to our
advantage,'' said the 6-5, 315-pound Rogers, who is the best pass
rusher among the four with three sacks and seven tackles for a
loss. ``On that sack I had against Nebraska, I came from the other
side of the line and looped around the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said: ``The attitude on the defense has changed. Coach
Reese loves to go after people. The type of coach he is, he fires
you up so much, you want to play for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Numberswise, the defense has played like a unit ranked among the
top 20 in the country. The Longhorns allowed 490.66 total yards
after playing New Mexico State, UCLA and Kansas State. Through
eight games, that number has dropped to 371.3, 68th among the 112
Division IA teams.
</P>
<P>
   Throw out the first three games, UT is averaging 299.6 total
yards, which would rank 17th in the country in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coach tells us the stats will take care of themselves,''
Woodard said. ``That we really shouldn't work at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good defense now, trying to be a great one.''

SIEMENS TO SELL BIG UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Siemens AG, the German electronics
conglomerate that has struggled for years with mediocre profits,
announced sweeping plans Wednesday to sell off businesses with
combined sales of more than $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The move marks by far the most radical, and in many ways the
most desperate, attempt by the Siemens chairman, Heinrich von
Pierer, to steer the global company back toward solid
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Siemens has come under intense criticism for
sluggishness in restructuring to improve profits. While companies
like Daimler-Benz and Veba AG have sold off or simply shut down
marginal businesses, Siemens has remained timid about big changes.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Among other things, the Munich-based giant will spin
off its loss-plagued semiconductor business, which was battered
this year by plunging prices for memory chips and which lost about
$727 million. It will also sell off businesses that make copper
cable, electronic components and locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the companies to be sold employ 60,000 out of Siemens'
total work force of 416,000. Siemens also announced that it would
set aside $2.4 billion in restructuring charges, atop $650 million
it had announced earlier this year. Among other things, the company
said it had set aside about $600 million for losses in Asia and
other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Though company executives carefully avoided the issue of
layoffs, most analysts believe the company intends to eliminate
thousands of jobs beyond the ones tied to businesses to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Munich on Wednesday, von Pierer took
issue with reports in German magazines that the company might shed
20,000 workers. But analysts said part of the big restructuring
charges would almost certainly be used on severance payments.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's disclosures capped weeks of increasingly fevered
speculation about Siemens' plans and quickly lifted the company's
stock to 114.35 marks a share, up 12.75 marks. In the United
States, the company's American depository receipts rose $6.50, to
$68.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty major step back from the old belief that you
have to have a huge, vertically integrated business,'' said Mark
Davies Jones, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``Until
now, restructuring has been piecemeal, selling off parts of
business units rather than the whole units.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Munich news conference, von Pierer said the radical
overhaul would set Siemens on a path toward higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   Though von Pierer has pushed scores of reforms since he took
over five years ago, the company continues to lag behind many of
its competitors and frustrate its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Siemens has sold off marginal businesses
in military electronics and dental equipment. It also announced
plans last spring to abandon the personal-computer business. For
years, Siemens has struggled to increase its productivity _ largely
by moving much of its manufacturing outside of Germany _ but those
efforts have been offset by increases in wages.
</P>
<P>
   None of the previous attempts at improvement came close to the
sweep of those announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single move would be spinning off its big
chip-manufacturing business into a separate publicly owned company.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company with a portfolio like Siemens' cannot allow itself
to be in a business with such cyclical variations,'' von Pierer
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the year that ended on Sept. 30, Siemens said net income
from continuing operations rose 2 percent, to 2.66 billion marks,
or $1.65 billion. Sales rose 10 percent, to 117.8 billion marks, or
$71.4 billion.

SLIPPING YOUR CHAIR INTO SOMETHING COMFORTABLE 
</HEADLINE>

   Slipcovers are like window dressing,'' Mario Buatta said.
``They're the easiest and least expensive way to celebrate the
change of seasons.'' And as the holidays approach, one newly
dressed chair can make the difference between a room's being ready
for guests or not.
</P>
<P>
   Ready-made slipcovers look different this fall, too. Like the
dressed up, more tailored furniture at last month's High Point home
furnishings market, slipcovers are more fitted than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is that some slipcovers come with back and seat pads
sewn in. More expensive, yes, but they create an instantly
upholstered piece. And unlike the duck or linen ready-made wraps of
yesteryear, there are now attractive covers in a variety of fabrics
from toiles de jouy to jewel-tone velvets. Watch, guests will rise
to the occasion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover a chair with a slipcover of cotton toiles de jouy and the
cushioned back and seat create an upholstered chair from a
straight-back dining-room model _ even a tag-sale jalopy. The
slipcover is $275 at the Monogram Shop, 11 Newtown Lane,
Easthampton, N.Y.; (516) 329-3379.
</P>
<P>
   A cotton-velvet slipcover in purple, green or navy comes in
three sizes: for a club chair, $249; love seat, $329; and a sofa,
$349. From the Pottery Barn catalog, (800) 922-5507.
</P>
<P>
   A cotton cover that ties and tucks, in red, blue, gold or beige
plaid, comes in sizes for a club chair, $172; love seat, $210; or
sofa, $234. At Maison Decor, 1100 Madison Ave. (82nd Street). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plain or fancy covers for straight-back chairs are available in
white canvas, $70, or burgundy velvet, $295. At the Monogram Shop.

MAIL BALLOTS WILL DICTATE THE OUTCOME OF CLOSE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The outcome of the hard-fought New York state
attorney general's race will not be known until, at the earliest,
after absentee ballots are counted next week, but both sides
maintained Wednesday that they were edging closer to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Out of about 4 million votes cast, the Democratic candidate,
Eliot Spitzer, was about 18,000 votes ahead of the Republican
incumbent, Dennis Vacco, with ballots from all but about one
percent of election districts counted.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Spitzer fell short of predicting
victory, but he said he was cheered by his lead over Vacco. ``I'm
optimistic about the way the race looks,'' he told reporters. ``The
numbers are very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco did not meet with reporters Wednesday. But in a statement,
his campaign spokesman, Michael Zabel, said, ``We remain confident
that, when all the ballots have been counted, Dennis Vacco will
emerge victorious, just as he did four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election in the balance, each campaign offered its own
interpretation of what the absentee ballots were likely to show.
State election officials had mailed out more than 184,000 absentee
ballots, and as of Wednesday, 132,347 of them had been returned.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Vacco took heart from the fact that fewer than
25,000 of these ballots were from New York City, which provided
Spitzer with more than 30 percent of his votes so far. They also
said that Vacco had the edge in the election districts where
ballots had not yet been tallied because of technical problems,
personnel shortages or mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Mahoney, a consultant to the Vacco campaign, said the
Republican Party had organized a huge effort to mobilize absentee
voters that had involved mailing out 2.6 million applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the people who vote by absentee ballot tend to
be more Republican than the state as a whole,'' he said. ``They
tend to be older, and there is a large military component.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Spitzer, however, said that the absentee ballots
tended to mirror the breakdown in the Election Day voting. They
said that Vacco would have to win the absentee vote by a landslide
in order to erase Spitzer's lead. Each candidate got about 48
percent of the vote at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Spitzer raised the possibility that
supporters of his opponent might try to tamper with the results. He
cited the mechanical problems in an assembly district in
southeastern Queens, made up largely of minority residents, where
voters were unable to cast votes by machine for either him or
Charles Schumer, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terribly troubled by what we saw yesterday,'' Spitzer
said. ``There was an effort to disenfranchise New York State
voters. It appears that there was an effort to disenfranchise
certain ethnicities.''
</P>
<P>
   City election officials are investigating, but have said that
they suspect negligence rather than tampering was to blame for the
machine problems.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Spitzer at his news conference, Judith Hope, the
chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, said that
the party would take steps to insure that all the votes cast were
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to the Spitzer campaign said that every voting machine
in the state would be checked _ a time-consuming process known as
recanvassing that may begin as soon as Friday. Officials will also
count the paper ballots that were issued to voters when mechanical
breakdowns occurred. If these ballots already had been tallied, the
results will be checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recanvassing the entire state and canvassing paper ballots
could be a process that takes up to two weeks,'' said state Sen.
Martin Connor, the leader of the Democratic minority, who is
helping Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the absentee votes is also expected to be a laborious
undertaking because representatives of each party will be on hand
to make sure that each ballot is valid. As long as they are
postmarked Nov. 2, the absentee ballots may still be counted as
late as Tuesday in most parts of the state. (In New York City,
where there was a delay in mailing out the ballots because of a
dispute over a proposed referendum on Yankee Stadium, they may be
counted as late as Nov. 20.)
</P>
<P>
   To prevent tampering, the ballots are being guarded by the
police and county sheriffs until they are counted. The counting
will begin on Monday in most of the state, but in New York City, it
will begin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Spitzer was asked why he thought he had done better
than the polls had predicted. On Election Night, some aides had
cited as turning points Spitzer's focus on his support of abortion
rights in the wake of the recent slaying of an obstetrician near
Buffalo and the outcry over Vacco's use of the word ``bodega'' in a
general reference to criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, however, offered a simpler explanation. ``I think what
happened was the public began to pay more attention to a
down-ballot race that frankly had not drawn much media attention or
much emotional energy,'' he said.

CIA PLAN FOR COVERT IRAQ ACTION WAS REPORTEDLY REJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late last month Congress secretly rejected a plan
by the CIA for new covert action against Iraq, congressional and
administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA sought congressional approval to restart its
long-dormant covert efforts to undermine President Saddam Hussein's
government in budget negotiations last month between congressional
leaders and the administration, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders complained that the CIA was trying to slip
in a highly sensitive program at the last minute without seeking
reviews by the House and Senate intelligence committees that
oversee the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the proposal, backed by the White House, was a
modified version of a plan that the oversight panels quietly
rejected in the spring. Congressional leaders saw the new request
as an attempt to restart the program with little or no debate on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that is the way the game is played,'' said one
congressional official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to conduct major
covert operations against Iraq since 1996, when Saddam destroyed
the two most important Iraqi programs of the CIA. In August the
army moved into Kurdish-held areas in northern Iraq and crushed the
Iraqi National Congress, a CIA-backed umbrella group for Kurds and
other anti-Saddam dissidents. The administration removed more than
5,000 Kurds and other Iraqis and let them resettle in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi National Congress virtually collapsed two months after
Saddam had executed as many as 100 army officers and other
opponents connected with the Iraqi National Accord, another
CIA-backed group that had used defectors and agents in the Iraqi
military to conduct subversive operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan circumvents the dissident groups that the agency
had once relied on, officials said. Instead the agency hopes to use
new agents in Iraq to undermine the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Republican leaders in Congress have pushed for
new measures against Iraq since then, they were dissatisfied with
the plans that the White House and CIA proposed in the spring. Some
Democrats have joined the Republicans in voicing frustration,
saying those plans were hastily conceived and were not focused on
overthrowing Saddam, which congressional officials say is their
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators are also frustrated over what they say is the
administration's willingness to turn a blind eye to the growing
evidence that Iraq is still developing weapons of mass destruction.
``There is an overall disgust with the administration's Iraq
policy,'' said one Republican Senate aide on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the administration is not serious about covert
action, some congressional leaders have supported open military
assistance to Iraqi dissidents groups. But administration officials
argue that those congressional leaders have been posturing,
proposing largely symbolic programs that have no hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Congress approved $97 million in military aid to
opposition groups like the Iraqi National Congress, a plan that
Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marine Corps, who commands U.S. forces in
the Middle East, quickly dismissed as ineffective and unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA sought funds for covert action as part of a $1.8 billion
budget increase for the intelligence community that Congress
provided last month. Despite the disagreement over the program, the
idea for the overall increase came from Speaker Newt Gingrich,
according to administration and congressional officials.

 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Alfonse D'Amato has long reigned as the
undisputed king of New York's Republican Party. He chose the party
chairman, swayed votes for local committees and county leaders,
raised money and labored to build a party machine in every corner
of the state that was effective and loyal to him.
</P>
<P>
   With D'Amato's loss in the Senate race to Rep. Charles Schumer
on Tuesday, his role as party chief falls to Gov. George Pataki,
who breezed to a second term. At the same time, some Democrats are
looking to Schumer, suddenly the state party's biggest star, to do
for their party what D'Amato did for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But history indicates that D'Amato was the exception, an
aggressive, established politician who filled an unusual power
vacuum in his party. The Democrats have not had a powerful state
party boss in decades, and the Republicans did not have one in the
1980s or most of the 1970s. People in both parties cautioned
Wednesday against expecting anyone to reprise D'Amato's role.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said Wednesday that he would work to strengthen the
state's Democratic Party, but he and other Democrats said that
Schumer would never have the sovereignty over his party that
D'Amato has exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``My top priority is to be a legislator,'' Schumer said. ``But
another goal of mine is to help rebuild the Democratic Party in the
state. I don't want to run it.'' As for the Republican Party, he
said, ``Senator D'Amato, I guess, wanted to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he did want to control the party, the Democrats are
simply a more fractious bunch than the Republicans; Schumer has the
distractions of a new job to tend to, and the state's most powerful
Democrat for the last four years, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
will not simply cede power to the new senator.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki may gain influence in state Republican politics through
D'Amato's defeat, but it is also a setback to the governor's
ambitions for national office. The senator, the governor's one-time
patron, is a prodigious fund-raiser, with a national network of
contacts and contributors that he could have put at Pataki's
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the national level, Pataki is weakened by the absence of an
ally who, however rough-cut a diamond he might be, was nonetheless
a powerful force nationally inside the Republican Party,'' said
Raymond Harding, chairman of the New York Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   Another politician who could gain by D'Amato's loss is Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who has looked for opportunities to broaden his
influence in the Republican Party but was often thwarted by the
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are of more than just intramural interest.
Well-run state and local party organizations recruit candidates,
win contested primaries, operate phone banks, register people to
vote and canvass neighborhoods. They develop cadres of active
members _ in part by winning offices that provide patronage jobs
that ensure loyalty _ who become the foot soldiers for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The state and local parties not only help put their candidates
over the top in general elections, but they also play a role in
deciding who those candidates will be. In the case of the
Republicans, the shift in leadership from D'Amato to Pataki could
mean a less conservative bent to the party organizations and,
therefore, to the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, analysts predict that there could be a move away
from candidates who oppose abortion, as the senator does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the party necessarily becomes a reflection of the
new head, Pataki, which means it becomes more moderate,'' said Jay
Severin, a Republican political consultant. ``Pataki now becomes
the guy essentially who's picking the county leaders, who's going
to muscle those local organizations when he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   But a close adviser to Pataki predicted that he would not steer
the party or referee disputes as readily as D'Amato has, leaving
the running of the party mostly to the state chairman, William
Powers, whom the senator installed eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato did not try to take the reins of the state party until
after the 1990 election, when he had been in the Senate for 10
years. In that election, the Republican candidate for governor
narrowly avoided finishing third. D'Amato picked Powers, and
together they began raising money for the party. Powers recruited
candidates and designated offices that the Republicans wanted to
win, while D'Amato refereed disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, the senator threw his support behind Pataki for
governor, lending the candidate his fund-raising apparatus and
leaning on other Republicans not to support rivals for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Benjamin, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and
Sciences at the State University at New Paltz, said D'Amato's
defeat would accelerate a transition that was already under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was already becoming the real head of the state
party,'' he said. ``It's a natural role for a governor. He has the
patronage jobs to hand out.''

   Though Giuliani has recently mended fences, he has long been on
the fringes of the Republican Party. He feuded with D'Amato in the
1980s and early 1990s, and then endorsed Pataki's Democratic
opponent, Gov. Mario Cuomo, in the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's forays into local party struggles have been largely
unsuccessful, so there are few people in local organizations with
strong loyalties to him. His most notable setbacks were in 1995,
when he backed contenders for county leader in Queens and Brooklyn
who lost to people supported by D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``With D'Amato gone, there's room for Giuliani to maneuver in
those local organizations, which would give him more of a base if
he runs for statewide office,'' said a Republican state legislator,
speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``What's interesting is,
does that put him at odds with the governor more and more?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have long been less organized and more riven by
internal disputes than the Republicans, and they have raised far
less money. Since Cuomo's defeat, Silver has largely directed the
party, but the limits of the speaker's power were exposed this
year, when he tried, to no avail, to block the nomination of Peter
Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, to run against Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are looking at Schumer as the rebirth
of our state party,'' said Steven Pigeon, the Erie County
Democratic chairman. ``He is a person who understands the need for
organizational strength, and he's the best Democratic fund-raiser
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top Democrats said that they did not foresee any serious
struggles between Schumer and Silver but that some tension was
unavoidable. They predicted that the new senator would take the
lead in choosing the next state party chairman and in raising money
for the party but would not try to take on smaller duties like
choosing upstate county chairmen or tapping candidates for local
offices.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Silver said that he would retain considerable
influence in the party. His Assembly Democrats kept an overwhelming
majority in Tuesday's elections after predictions that they would
suffer serious setbacks. And three of the party's most influential
county chairmen _ those in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx _ are
Assembly members who are close to the speaker.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT HEARS SYMINGTON APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Federal Appeals Court Judge Betty Fletcher on
Wednesday bored in on a federal prosecutor with questions that
suggested she has doubts about the dismissal of a juror in last
year's bank-fraud trial of former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher cited ``a disturbing kind of dialogue'' between juror
Mary Jane Cotey and the other jurors, who complained that she was
unable to maintain focus on their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Cotey forms the core of Symington's appeal of
the case that produced guilty verdicts on six fraud counts, his
resignation, and a 2{-year prison sentence that is being stayed
during his appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cotey was dismissed after trial Judge Roger Strand said she was
unwilling or unable to participate in the deliberations of the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher asked a federal prosecutor how willing the trial judge
should have been to believe the 11 other Symington jurors, who
complained in a closed hearing about Cotey's inability to fulfill
her duties as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   Symington's attorney argued to the appeals panel that the real
reason the jurors were frustrated was that Cotey wanted to acquit
Symington of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Strand appointed an alternate juror in her place, and the panel
ultimately found Symington guilty on charges that he had submitted
fraudulent financial statements to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do we need to credit jurors who say that she isn't
basing it (her opinion) on the evidence,'' asked Fletcher, who at
75 is the same age as Cotey. ``She could come out of the last day
of evidence in the courtroom, and she knows that it's a thin case,
and she's just not going to convict on it. Now, there is nothing
wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher then pointed out that other jurors had pressed Cotey to
explain her positions on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must she give her reasons?'' she asked. And if Cotey had
agreed with the other jurors, she asked, would the other jurors
have sought explanations?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they might have,'' George Cardona said, prompting
Fletcher to retort quickly, ``Would they be entitled to do that?''
Then Fletcher said, ``This is a very disturbing kind of dialogue
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's pointed questions provided a dramatic highlight to
the argument before the three-judge panel. Lasting just 50 minutes,
the session contrasted sharply to last year's May-September trial,
which was followed immediately by Symington's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Symington attended Wednesday's session, along with his wife,
Ann, and their oldest son, John.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Symington said that after a traffic accident last
week, in which his car was T-boned by a light truck on Camelback
Road, he felt ``fine, except for a little stiffness.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Cardona said the panel should defer to the judgment
of Strand because the judge had ``very carefully listened'' to all
12 jurors before dismissing Cotey.
</P>
<P>
   ``After assessing the credibility and sincerity of the other
jurors, he found she was either unwilling or unable,'' to
deliberate with the other jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Fitzgerald, who at 78 is the oldest of the
three-judge panel, appeared supportive of Strand's decision.
Reading from the transcript of Strand's hearing with the jurors, he
quoted one juror who said, ``Her recall isn't there, and she
doesn't even seem to understand what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A ruling in the case is expected sometime next year from the
three judges, who will now return to their home courts.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters after the session, Symington said he was
prepared for whatever decision the court reached. He said he has
had his bag packed since March, when he was scheduled to report to
a federal prison near Las Vegas. But that was before the appeals
court decided to hear his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have my bag packed, and it's tucked away,'' he said.
``If that's the hand that's dealt, that's life. Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington, who is learning to be a chef at the Scottsdale
Culinary Institute, said he was eager to get back to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lose 5 percentage points by being here today, on my term
grade,'' he said, calling the school ``merciless on excuses.'' &QL;

NO COATTAIL EFFECT IN ROWLAND'S BIG VICTORY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE ALLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, Conn. _ Despite a commanding re-election victory on
Tuesday, Gov. John Rowland may be finding that it is lonely at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   He trounced Rep. Barbara Kennelly by 28 percentage points, but
failed to sweep along any of his four fellow Republicans seeking
statewide offices, or the Republican running for U.S. Senate, or
either of the congressional candidates he had been promoting, or
enough new state Senators to give his party control of the chamber
after two years in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emperor has no coattails,'' said Matthew Miller, the
spokesman for the state Democratic Party's campaign arm, the
Campaign for Connecticut Families.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, ``the emperor'' makes few excuses. Rowland, who
was in an even chattier and more casual mood than usual Wednesday,
said he had been warning for weeks that ``all politics is local,''
and that he could not transfer his popularity to others. He gave
other major Republican candidates a hand by speaking at their
fund-raising receptions and starring in their television ads. But
he rarely hit the campaign trail with them, which his staff said
was not the most efficient way for him to help.
</P>
<P>
   Just a dozen years ago, Rowland's entire team likely would have
been elected, since Connecticut's voting machines still had a party
lever, which allowed voters to choose an entire slate
automatically. In a ballot question in 1986, voters narrowly
decided to eliminate the lever. Ironically, the drive to have it
removed was led by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the pain it caused him this week, Rowland said he
still thinks it was the right decision. ``A lever is too easy,'' he
said. ``We basically were saying to people, `You're not smart
enough to pick the candidates of your choice.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One statewide race remained undecided Wednesday night, although
Rowland said he had been told that the Republican incumbent had
lost. The state treasurer, Paul Silvester, was deadlocked at 49
percent with his Democratic challenger, Denise Nappier, who was
ahead by 1,670 votes in the unofficial tally by The Associated
Press. A spokesman for the secretary of the state's office said an
official result would be released Thursday, when a decision would
be made about a recount.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Democrat who defeated his
Republican challenger, Gary Franks, by 33 percentage points, said
he would leave it to others to judge whether it was his coattails
that pulled in so many Democrats. ``While the governor is a good
campaigner and had a strong campaign, I believe our candidates for
these other offices were better and stronger candidates'' than the
Republicans, Dodd said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist said the Campaign for Connecticut
Families made an agonizing choice that helps explain Rowland's
dearth of coattails. Through telephone calls and mailings, the
group identified many voters who planned to vote for Rowland, but
would support Democrats for the offices on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced a difficult decision: Do you turn out those voters?''
the strategist said. This can be done by phoning people just before
the election and offering them rides to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So the choice boiled down to whether to sacrifice votes for Mrs.
Kennelly to help elect other Democrats, the strategist said. In
many towns where legislative races were tight, the Democrats
decided that because Mrs. Kennelly's campaign was not competitive,
they should try to turn out the Democratic supporters of Rowland.
That decision, the strategist said, helped Ms. Nappier.
</P>
<P>
   While others huddled for post-mortems, Rowland, 41, celebrated
his victory Wednesday by heading off for vacation at a warm but
otherwise unspecified destination with his wife, Patty. Before he
left, he made what has become his traditional post-election stop at
a metal-molding plant here. Scores of delighted workers crowded
around, to get a glimpse of the governor, who was wearing
pleated-front Dockers and a forest-green, cable-knit sweater.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll of 1,459 Connecticut voters by Voter News Service
showed the breadth and depth of Rowland's victory. There was little
gender gap: he got 64 percent of men's votes and 61 percent of
women's. He won in nearly every category of voters except blacks,
liberals and Democrats _ and even 45 percent of blacks and 38
percent of Democrats voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   Voters began splitting their tickets, however, when it came to
races for the State Senate, where Republicans needed to pick up
just two seats to regain control of the chamber. Democratic leaders
in the State Senate held a news conference Wednesday to trumpet the
preservation of their 19-to-17 majority. The majority leader, Sen.
George Jepsen, needled the governor for his ever-more-moderate
position on issues. ``We are delighted Governor Rowland chose in
the last year to basically adopt the Democratic agenda,'' Jepsen
said. The Senate president pro tempore, Kevin Sullivan, added, ``I
expect he would continue to work with us, continue to follow our
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland did not take the bait, but simply said he was looking
forward to continuing to work with the Legislature's leaders. ``A
few days from now, everybody catches their breath and the campaign
fades away and we realize we've got to do a budget, and we've got a
legislative session starting up in a couple months,'' he said. ``We
put on our game gear and off we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Several defeated Republicans said they did not blame Rowland for
their loss. Nevertheless, his lack of coattails gave Democrats a
rare chance to gloat in a year when the governor has dominated the
political landscape. ``He wasn't wearing a coat,'' said Susan
Bysiewicz, a Democrat who was elected secretary of the state. ``He
was wearing a vest.''

VALLONE AND GIULIANI RESUME TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Proclaiming that ``the politicking is over and the
business of government is at hand,'' Peter Vallone returned to his
job as speaker of the city council Wednesday and met with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani for the first time since the two broke off budget
negotiations last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, a Democrat who lost the gubernatorial race to Gov.
George Pataki on Tuesday, said that he and Giuliani had spent an
hour discussing the budget and other issues that they had clashed
over this year. Although he did not divulge details, Vallone said
he was optimistic about reaching a budget compromise, four months
into the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first real constructive dialogue we've had in terms
of resolving some problems,'' Vallone said after his meeting with
Giuliani, which took place at City Hall. ``We've always been
friendly, but we haven't had this kind of a sit-down to talk about
positive ways of getting out of our difficulties without going to
court.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is $150 million for spending that the city council
approved as part of the $34 billion city budget, but that the
Giuliani administration has refused to release.
</P>
<P>
   Since last spring, Vallone had accused the mayor of withholding
the money because the speaker opposed his plan to use tax dollars
to build a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan. Giuliani countered that
the $150 million was nothing but pork-barrel spending meant to
improve Vallone's chances in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $150 million would go to nonprofit groups and pay
for social programs, including foster-care programs, expanded day
care and other child-care programs; meals delivered at home and
other programs for the elderly, and alternatives to jail. Some of
the money would also be used for weekly recycling pickups by the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have warned that the dispute might end up in court,
but Wednesday, Vallone said both sides were now determined to
prevent that scenario. Instead, he said, his aides and aides to the
mayor will fashion a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said he would meet with Giuliani at least once a week
from now on. Weekly meetings between the two had stopped when the
budget battle began in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all going to work,'' Vallone said when asked whether he
thought the $150 million would be released. ``As long as there is a
willingness on both sides to work these problems out, no matter how
difficult they are, there are ways of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, said only, ``We have
every confidence that the budget process will move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said that he and the mayor did not discuss another
contentious topic: the future of Yankee Stadium. Asked why not,
Vallone said, ``We didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that after his campaign, he was more optimistic than
ever that the Yankees would stay put in their current home in the
Bronx. During the race, Vallone had unsuccessfully called for a
referendum on whether to spend tax dollars on a new stadium in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the referendum accomplished, I believe, was ending any
real negotiations or contract-signing to move them out of the
Bronx,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the stadium issue will clearly remain a sticking point. Ms.
Roche said that Vallone never had _ and never would have _ any
control over the future of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not his decision,'' she said. ``It is not the mayor's
decision. It is the decision of the owner of the Yankees. It sounds
like he is having a hard time getting out of campaign mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who conceded to Pataki shortly after the polls closed
at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, was back in his council office by 9 a.m.
Wednesday. Sitting at his desk, he appeared tired but at peace.
Vallone said that he was still in pain from injuries he received in
a car accident while campaigning in Queens on Friday, but that he
was not planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of term limits, Vallone cannot stay in the council past
2001. Asked about his political future _ in the past, he has
mentioned running for mayor _ he allowed a weary smile, then shook
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to discuss it because I don't want to be
rear-ended again,'' he said, both referring to the accident and
hinting at the frustration he felt throughout his campaign. ``We'll
concern ourselves with that in the next millennium. Which is not
that far away.''

GINGRICH LIKELY TO SURVIVE REMOVAL ATTEMPT
</HEADLINE>
   By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like desert thunder, rumblings of an overthrow of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich are loud but may not produce much rain.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, including key Ari zona Republicans, may be
incensed with House Republican leaders for the party's unexpectedly
poor show ing in Tuesday's congressional elec tions, but they say
the odds of pulling off a coup now are worse now than they were
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But they will probably try, any way.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, House conserva tives were pushing Rep. Steve
Largent, R-Okla., the pro football Hall of Famer, as a possible
candi date against Majority Leader Rich ard Armey, R-Texas, who was
a player in last year's attempted coup. But Largent is reluctant,
those who know him say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than just conservatives are disgruntled, and other
names have begun to surface: Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the
powerful Ap propriations chairman; Rep. Christo pher Cox, R-Calif.;
and Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., have been men tioned for
leadership pots.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans of all kinds are angry for what they see as their
leaders' failure to articulate a clear message and stick to a GOP
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, head of the Christian Coalition, blasted the GOP on
Wednesday for its ``lack of an agenda,'' though he stopped short of
assigning blame to anyone in partic ular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was, there was an issues void and an issues vacuum in
Washington, D.C.,'' Tate said. Local candidates, even Democrats
running on ``pro-family'' agendas, filled that void, he said. He
released figures showing that just 54 percent of Christian
conservatives voted Republican this year. In 1994, 67 percent of
them voted Republi can. Nearly a quarter of them voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our voters aren't wind-up dolls,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   They have to be motivated to vote for candidates, and the
Republican Party didn't give them a reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tate blamed Gingrich and his hand-picked leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, another key player in last year's attempted
coup and a frequent leadership critic, said, ``They're the
leadership team. They're supposed to be the vision aries. They're
supposed to be the playmakers. I think the speaker needs to take
ownership of this debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gingrich has not done that, according to reports about
the conference call he held with mem bers Wednesday. He tried to
high light that the GOP held the House majority three times in a
row for the first time in 70 years. And he moved to cut off
attempts to replace him or any members of his team by telling
committee and subcommittee chairmen that they ought to be thankful
that Republicans retained their majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminded these people they could still lose what they
desire most,'' said one member who lis tened in.
</P>
<P>
   Angering members most were Gingrich's predictions. He told party
members early on that all they had to do was ``march in place'' and
``don't rock the boat'' and they would pick up 30 House seats, said
Salmon and other members. This week, he said the GOP would pick up
six seats. It lost five, making Gingrich wrong by 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election results should scare every Republican that wants
to be in the majority and every Republican voter who wants us to be
in the majority,'' said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., another
frequent leadership critic. ``We cannot keep doing the things we've
been doing and expect to stay in the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   But replacing Gingrich or other House leaders may be more
difficult than even it was two years ago, when a coup was spoiled
when word leaked to the speaker, one GOP analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich successfully consoli dated power after the attempt and
silenced the one critic inside his inner circle, Armey. In
addition, it's difficult to capitalize on dissatisfac tion when the
party still is in the majority. Finally, a revolution with out a
leader will go nowhere, the strategist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worse,'' said one mem ber, ``the danger we know, or the
danger we don't?'' &QL;

RECORDS PORTRAY WITNESS AS AVID ABORTION PROTESTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga., N.Y., Vt.)  (Eds: See related story ABORTION-DOCTOR) 
(af) 
 By JOHN KIFNER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material
witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to
abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester,
and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several
times in demonstrations at abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records,
studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts
of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant
protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly
abrasive protests at abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials say he is not currently a
suspect in the Slepian shooting, and there was no indication
Wednesday that he had been arrested for any violent acts. At
several abortion protests, he was charged with trespassing or
resisting arrest, according to news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   One of his arrests was in Atlanta during Operation Rescue's huge
anti-abortion protests there in 1988. While he was in an Atlanta
jail, Kopp was given the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators
contend links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion
movement, responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven
murders of abortion providers like Slepian over the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for some of the violence _ like the bombing of an
abortion clinic in Birmingham, Ala., earlier this year, in which an
off-duty policeman was killed _ has been claimed in notes signed by
a shadowy ``Army of God.''
</P>
<P>
   An underground manual issued in the name of the Army of God,
which describes methods for attacking abortion clinics, including
how to make homemade C-4 plastic explosives, begins with a tribute,
by nickname, of a clandestine band pledged to stop abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The first name under this ``Special Thanks'' section is Atomic
Dog.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta police, after searching the hundreds of arrest
records of the protesters from the summer of 1988, confirmed
Wednesday night that the date of birth and Social Security number
of the James Kopp arrested then matched those given out Wednesday
by the FBI task force in Buffalo investigating the murder of
Slepian, who was gunned down through the window if his home in
suburban Amherst on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   At the nondescript frame house in St. Albans, Vt., that the FBI
gave as Kopp's last known address, the current resident, who gave
his name only as E. Kenny, 20, a shipping clerk, remembered Kopp
well.
</P>
<P>
   He lived there for part of 1990 as the guest of Kenny's parents,
who were active in the anti-abortion movement, among a group of
protesters who tried to shut down two abortion clinics in
Burlington in stubborn demonstrations that year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice guy,'' who did chores
around the place but paid no rent to the parents. He sometimes made
wooden toys or played video games with Kenny, then a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the focus of his life was the anti-abortion movement,''
Kenny recalled. ``He was known among these people as Atomic Dog. It
wasn't like a name that he had to go to the store or something. But
if you knew anything about him, that's what you called him.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 95 people were arrested during the protests, according
to newspaper accounts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many, many arrests,'' recalled Allie Stickney, the
president of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. ``It was
very big for Vermont. There were Kryptonite locks and leaflets from
the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ. It was clearly a highly
organized blockade.''
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper accounts, Kopp was arrested outside a
clinic in Levittown, Long Island, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The protests in Atlanta in 1998 appeared to be a turning point
for a hard-core group of protesters. The Atlanta police cracked
down hard and carted hundreds of demonstrators off to an isolated
prison dormitory the called ``the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Rescue had mounted a series of blockades to close down
abortion clinics in New York and Philadelphia that spring. Atlanta
was their high point, but in the face of the tough arrest policy,
the movement faltered, split apart and stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a traumatic, life-changing experience,'' said Frederick
Clarkson, author of ``Eternal Hostility,'' a book on the
anti-abortion movement, adding that by 1993 with the shooting of
Dr. David Gunn, an abortion provider in Florida, some of those in
the Atlanta jail became the nucleus of a group signing a
``justifiable homicide'' statement that declared that the use of
force was warranted to ``defend the life of an unborn child.''

POLAK UNSEEN, NOT UNNOTICED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Offensive linemen, like officials, are at their
best when invisible. And lately, Brian Polak has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really pleased with Polak,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``He
doesn't make mistakes. He doesn't show up (on film) a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Polak, a 310-pound sophomore, has seamlessly replaced
All-American Chad Overhauser at right tackle, the most important
position because it protects quarterback Cade McNown's blind side.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility doesn't weigh on Polak as it did during
spring practice, mostly because he doesn't weigh what he did during
spring practice. He's lost 20 pounds since the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was solid in the beginning of games, but the problem was my
fourth-quarter technique and energy,'' he said. ``Now, I feel like
I've got more stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   Polak had no trouble learning the offense. A former member of
the director's honor roll, he's taking a philosophy class in
pre-Socratic thought. He studies Pythagoras and Protagoras and
evaluates statements like, ``If it doesn't exist, you can't think
it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought an art class I was taking was going to be canceled,
so I needed to find another class quick to remain eligible,'' Polak
said. ``It's not as tough as I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But ask him about the recent existence of penalties _ especially
holding calls on the offensive line _ and he has no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seem to be meshing,'' he said. ``The penalties are
killing us. You can't do much when it's third-and-20.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rough and tumble: Toledo made practices shorter and easier
last week because of a plethora of injuries. It showed: The Bruins
weren't as physical against Stanford as they had been in previous
games.
</P>
<P>
   This week, contact is loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a sense of urgency,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Zoning laws?: UCLA's cornerbacks were beaten consistently on
quick slants and crossing patterns _ what coaches call ``underneath
routes'' _ by Stanford receivers, especially Troy Walters.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were in man-to-man defense most of the game, leaving
them vulnerable to long gains when Walters found seams in middle of
the field. But the strategy might change Saturday. Don't be
surprised if UCLA plays zone in certain passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you continue to play just man-to-man, it's easier for them
to beat you,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oregon State update: The Beavers' best defensive player is a
5-11 dervish named Inoke Breckterfield. He was a second-team
all-conference end last year and has returned to create more chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of (UCLA linebacker) Brendon Ayanbadejo the way
he's all over the field,'' Toledo said. ``He looks like a guy who
plays with his hair on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting his kicks: Freshman cornerback Julius Williams has
returned kicks this week and might join Ryan Roques on the return
team at Oregon State. The move gets Williams on the field _ he has
played sparingly as the fifth cornerback _ and relieves injured
tailbacks Jermaine Lewis and DeShaun Foster of the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: If the Bruins defeat Oregon State, they'll be
8-0 for the first time since 1954, their national-championship
season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA leads the Pac-10 and is tied for fourth nationally in
turnover margin, plus-1.57.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State kicker Jose Cortez has made 14 of 20 field goals.
UCLA's Chris Sailer has made 3 of 10.

SCHUMER SHOWED STRENGTH ACROSS NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer cobbled together a surprisingly
easy victory in the Senate race by piling up a huge plurality in
New York City, keeping it competitive upstate and battling to a
near draw in the suburbs, the very heart of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's
political base.
</P>
<P>
   Although D'Amato held his home base of Long Island, he did so by
a diminished margin compared with past campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's success in those areas was based in part on gains he
made among Jewish, Hispanic and women voters that were impressive
even for a Democrat, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's support among Jewish voters slumped significantly this
year while women, influenced in part by Schumer's position in
support of abortion rights, broke heavily for the Democratic
congressman. Schumer captured 59 percent of the women's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that Schumer was helped with women
voters by Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign visits and, indirectly,
by the recent shooting of a Buffalo obstetrician that gave new
urgency to the abortion debate. Schumer's advertisements had drawn
attention to his own position in support of abortion rights, while
painting D'Amato as an anti-abortion advocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times in politics when something outside a campaign
has a direct effect,'' said Joseph Crangle, a former Erie County
Democratic chairman. ``I think the turnout here among females was a
little larger because of the shooting and it broke more favorably
for Schumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his strong showing in Erie County, Schumer avoided
getting trounced upstate, as many other Democrats before him have.
Schumer received 56 percent of the vote in Erie, even as Gov.
George Pataki won the county easily. D'Amato's last Democratic
challenger, Robert Abrams, the former attorney general, also won
Erie County in 1992, but narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Morris, Schumer's political consultant, said he did not
think there was any one region or voter bloc that had been
critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did better in the suburbs,'' he said. ``We did better
upstate. We did better in the city. It was a statewide victory. You
don't win by 10 points without it being a victory everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly, there would have been less confetti at Schumer
campaign parties if the congressman had not steamrolled D'Amato in
New York City, where Schumer captured 75 percent of the vote. It
was a margin equal to President Clinton's own impressive tally in
1996 and far surpassed the 61 percent garnered by Abrams.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turnout in the city was only average, 39 percent, but it was a
bit lighter than usual upstate, according to analysts, who said
Pataki's expected landslide might have made some upstate
Republicans stay home. ``New York City was a higher proportion of
the state vote _ 31 percent,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the
Marist College poll. ``Some years it is as low as 28 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Schumer's most impressive performance was in Westchester
County, a mercurial place where voters often ignore their own party
affiliations. Abrams lost the county by six points in 1992. Schumer
took it by eight points Tuesday, again despite a strong showing by
Pataki, who won the county handily.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's aides said they thought his positions on abortion and
gun control were attractive to the many moderate Westchester
residents. ``The county is also more diverse and more Democratic
than it used to be,'' said Howard Wolfson, the campaign's
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight years, Westchester has seen double-digit
increases in its black, Hispanic and Asian populations while the
number of registered Democrats has soared. Democrats now have a
40,000-voter edge in registrations.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nicholas Spano, the Westchester Republican chairman,
said that the Democrats' registration edge had hurt but that so did
the sense that D'Amato's incumbency had become a liability. ``The
biggest problem was the fact that Al D'Amato was there for 18 years
and people were just looking for a change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mondello, the Nassau County Republican chairman, cited
the same reason for the senator's disappointing showing on Long
Island, where he won, but not by the margins he was accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   In Nassau County, where D'Amato pulled 58 percent of the vote in
1992, his total dropped to 53 percent. In Suffolk, where pulled 59
percent last time, he got only 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer won only a slightly higher percentage of the black vote,
86 percent, than Abrams had in 1992. But he captured a higher
percentage of the Hispanic vote, 82 percent, compared with 69
percent by Abrams six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader who
helped organize efforts to spur a Hispanic vote, said there were
higher turnouts in several neighborhoods with large numbers of
Hispanic residents, like the Lower East Side, East Harlem and Hunts
Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Schumer's legislative record on a number of issues,
especially gun control,'' Ramirez said. ``Crime affects these
neighborhoods as much as any neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also must have been disappointed with his performance
with Jewish voters, a constituency with whom he has always done
well, even when running against Jewish candidates. A strong
supporter of Israel who was quick to condemn the 1991 rioting in
Crown Heights, D'Amato was involved in a well-publicized push this
year to force Swiss banks to return money to the families of
victims of the Holocaust. But the senator received only 23 percent
of the vote, an 18-point drop from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff said polling data indicated that D'Amato's support
collapsed several weeks ago when he used a vulgar Yiddish term to
refer to Schumer.

STATE, FEDERAL OFFICIALS SOFTEN STANCE AGAINST MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 and ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Tuesday's nationwide sweep of medicinal marijuana
initiatives, state and federal officials are backing away from
threats to sanction doctors who prescribe pot for sick people.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Arizona's successful reefer referendums, voters approved
medical marijuana in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado
and the District of Columbia, according to returns and poll
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that (a large portion) of the country has
endorsed medical marijuana. That's a fact they're going to have to
deal with,'' said Sam Vagenas, a former assistant secretary of
state and spokesman for The People Have Spoken, the group that
pushed the medical marijuana initiative in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   After California and Arizona voters first approved the measure
in 1996, federal authorities threatened to yank the federal
licenses of any doctors who prescribed marijuana. Janet Napolitano,
the newly elected Arizona attorney general and the former U.S.
attorney for Arizona, said late Wednesday that she opposed the
ballot initiatives but will try to follow the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the other side of that issue,'' Napolitano said as
she declared victory in the attorney general's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people of Arizona have spoken twice. I think the
people are saying, `Let's take a look at our drug policy.' I'm
going to respect the will of the people and carry it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Blanchard, a former Arizona legislator who is now legal
counsel to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, also said he
was disappointed in the votes, but his office has no intention of
going after doctors until more research and court issues are
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard's boss, drug policy director Barry McCaffrey, was the
nation's most visible opponent of medical marijuana initiatives.
McCaffrey did not make a statement Wednesday on election results.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar is not going to go out and try again to overturn
such laws, Blanchard said. The office will wait for results of a
Food and Drug Administration study expected next year and for
research from the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, a strong opponent of the Arizona medical
marijuana law, also was disappointed at the election results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think it sends the wrong signal to young people,''
Kyl said, adding that he was encouraged that the margin in favor of
medical marijuana use in Arizona was less Tuesday, at 57 percent in
favor, than it was in 1996, when 65 percent were in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl also said the results of the FDA study are vital to settling
the issue. The ballot propositions create legal chaos _ conflicts
between state and federal law _ that will be difficult to resolve,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, meanwhile, said the votes amount to a repudiation of
the nation's law enforcement-based drug policy and a reinforcement
of vot ers' desire for a health-based one. They said they will
carry their fight next to Massachusetts, Florida, Michigan and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a fluke. This is a demand by the American public
for a common-sense drug policy,'' said Bill Zimmerman, executive
director of Americans for Medical Rights, the chief proponent of
the national movement toward medical marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's Los Angeles-based group has a federal lawsuit
pending that could open up the federal government's pot farm in
Oxford, Miss., as a legal production and distribution center for
medical marijuana. Currently, patients in California and Arizona
get their marijuana through informal connections and ``pot clubs,''
which the federal government has moved to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a handful of doctors in Arizona have prescribed
marijuana, more are likely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote (Tuesday) is certainly going to be a reassurance,
because a lot of doctors are very nervous about where they stand
with respect to the law. They don't want to get into trouble,''
said Dr. Jeffrey Singer, a Phoenix surgeon and a supporter of
medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Singer is a plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in the U.S. District
Court of the District of Columbia that would prevent the federal
government from carrying out its threat to yank doctors' licenses.
A decision is expected any time. &QL;

VERMONT MAN, 44, IS SOUGHT IN SLAYING OF OBSTETRICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Vt.)  (See also ABORTION-PROTESTER) 
(af) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Federal authorities investigating the murder of
a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions have identified
a Vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month
and issued a warrant for his arrest Wednesday to bring him in for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The man was identified as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last
known address was in St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are not known,
investigators said. Investigators said Kopp's car was seen near the
Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett Slepian in the weeks before the
doctor, whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target
of harassment, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp, according to police records and abortion rights groups,
has often moved about the country in a series of protests at
abortion clinics, and has been linked to an underground manual that
describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Denise O'Donnell, the U.S. attorney for the western district of
New York, said Kopp was not considered a suspect at this time but
was believed to have information material to the case. She declined
to give details on what evidence was being sought from Kopp,
describing it only as information that is contained in a sealed
affidavit whose disclosure would compromise the ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Donnell said that federal law allowed for an arrest
warrant for a material witness when a person has information that
is important to a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kopp is found, he would be arrested, brought to Buffalo and
ordered to provide the required evidence,'' Ms. O'Donnell said.
``Then, most likely, the individual would be released.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, 52, was shot by a sniper firing from outside his home
on Oct. 23, shortly after returning from an evening service at his
synagogue. He was standing in his kitchen with his wife and one of
his four sons when the bullet crashed through a back window. He
died two hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Wednesday's announcement of the
material witness warrant was in part an attempt to underscore the
potential danger of anti-abortion violence in advance of
Remembrance Day, a Canadian holiday that falls on Nov. 11 and that
the authorities have associated with some anti-abortion crimes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Justice Department and the FBI were trying
to find ways to step up the federal response to violence at
abortion clinics in the aftermath of the Slepian killing.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon
announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the
visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local
jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative
effort focused on abortion clinic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno and senior FBI officials, including Robert Bryant, the
deputy FBI director, have met with physician and abortion rights
groups in recent days to discuss ways to enhance federal
investigative efforts and coordination with local agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities first organized an abortion clinic task
force in 1995 after the killing of a Florida doctor. The unit,
which was charged with investigating whether a national conspiracy
existed, spent nearly two years studying abortion clinic violence.
The unit disbanded without uncovering a national conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that the unit's operation did
help reduce violence at abortion clinics and that, in part, the
decision to re-establish it was prompted by Ms. Reno's desire to
send a renewed message to anti-abortion extremists that the
government would aggressively investigate these crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's murder fit the pattern of four earlier sniper attacks
on abortion doctors in Canada and western New York, dating from
1994. None of the attacks have been solved.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Tolbert, special agent in charge of the FBI in Buffalo,
said at a news conference here Wednesday that investigators had not
determined whether there is a link between the five killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility they could be linked, but certainly no
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert gave little information about the subject of the
material-witness warrant, except to say that Kopp's black 1987
Chevrolet Cavalier, with the Vermont license plate BPE216, was seen
near Slepian's home beginning several weeks before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any idea of where he is,'' Tolbert said of Kopp.
``We are looking for him every place we can, every place he might
be.''
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of Kopp taken in January 1997 has been distributed
to law enforcement agencies around the United States and Canada.
The National Abortion Federation has sent out an advisory to
clinics around the country about the search for Kopp, said Melinda
DuBois, assistant director of Womenservices, the clinic where
Slepian worked.
</P>
<P>
   She said naming Kopp a material witness in the case had not
brought relief to the nurses and other workers at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes me or anyone else at the clinic feel
differently,'' she said. ``I don't want anybody to relax and say,
`Oh God, they got the guy.' That's easy to happen. I still want
people to be very vigilant.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is the last in the Buffalo area that is performing
abortions. Slepian was one of only a handful of doctors in Buffalo
who were still willing to perform the procedure in the face of
pickets, protesters and threats.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, doctors from outside Buffalo have come to the
clinic to continue providing abortion services.

SCHUMER SETS HIS PRIORITIES FOR THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Still exultant from his victory in the bruising
Senate race, Rep. Charles Schumer said Wednesday that education,
health care and campaign-finance reform would be among his top
priorities in Washington next year, and he vowed to keep his family
in Brooklyn because he did not want to lose touch with his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of several days in which Schumer plans to
crisscross the state thanking voters, the nine-term Democratic
congressman greeted commuters near his home in Park Slope, held a
lengthy news conference in Manhattan, made a surprise appearance at
a teachers union meeting and read the Top-10 List on ``Late Show
With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking exuberant, even if his eyes were a bit bloodshot from
weariness, Schumer called his nine-percentage-point victory over
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato ``a humbling and awesome experience'' and said
he was looking forward to relaxing this weekend with his wife,
Iris, and two daughters, Alison and Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he planned to move his family to Washington, Schumer,
47, said no, partly because they love their Park Slope home and
partly because he was worried about becoming disconnected from New
Yorkers and their concerns. He said he plans to continue sharing a
Washington apartment with three other members of Congress while
commuting home on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice things, I think, I hope, I pray, about being
senator is that I can sort of keep my same lifestyle,'' he said.
``I learned a lesson a while back. The Congress members who live in
Washington lose touch with the struggles and the dreams of our
citizens far more quickly than those who live back in their
districts.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a Republican in his third term, held a brief news
conference Wednesday morning in the parking lot of the Hilton Hotel
and Towers in Manhattan, where he spent the night. The senator, 61,
said he had not made up his mind about what he plans to do once he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great honor,'' D'Amato said, ``it's been a great
privilege, it's been a great thrill to be senator from this great
state. I've tried to make a difference and I think we have
accomplished a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer began his morning with a spate of television interviews,
after which he walked Alison, who is 7, to her bus stop, trailed by
a gaggle of photographers, reporters and two New York City police
detectives serving as bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the United Federation of Teachers in lower
Manhattan, Schumer got a standing ovation from several hundred
teachers when he chided D'Amato for having attacked the teachers
union early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have taught a lesson or two to those who would kick
around teachers,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, Schumer taped a segment for Letterman's
show titled, ``Top 10 Things on Chuck Schumer's To-Do List.'' No.
8: ``Learn how to say `Pataki' without giggling.'' No. 3: ``Endorse
new Starbucks beverage line: the Chuck-accino.''
</P>
<P>
   And No. 1: ``Change my name to Chucky ``The Body'' Ventura,'' a
reference to the former professional wrestler, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, who was elected governor of Minnesota on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During a 40-minute session with reporters, Schumer was asked
whether he thought Tuesday's election, in which the Democrats
picked up several House seats, amounted to a referendum on
President Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a feeling among New Yorkers and among
Americans that there were some in Congress, particularly on the
Republican side, that would rather spend time debating the Lewinsky
affair than debating education and debating HMOs, and I think that
hurt the Republican Party,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, along with a minority of members of the House Judiciary
Committee, voted against bringing impeachment proceedings against
the president. He said Wednesday that he had not decided what he
would do if the House votes to impeach the president _ which, after
Tuesday's elections, is considered less likely to happen. An
impeachment vote in the House would send the issue to the Senate,
which would serve as the jury over the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he had six priorities for his first year in the
Senate: improving public schools and making all college tuition
deductible; bringing jobs to upstate communities; improving health
insurance; bolstering the Social Security system; expanding gun
control, and revamping the nation's campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race was the most expensive in the country
this year, with Schumer having spent $13 million and D'Amato $20
million by mid-October. Asked if he regretted the campaign's high
price tag, Schumer said: ``No. I won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I regret that the system is the way it is,'' he continued.
``The way to deal with the system is not to unilaterally disarm,
but rather to change the system so that one side doesn't have all
these big megaweapons and the other side doesn't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he spoke Wednesday morning to Gov. George Pataki
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Republicans who supported D'Amato, to
discuss state and city issues. He said he plans to meet with Pataki
in the coming week to discuss ways of strengthening the upstate
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he wished the campaign could have been more
positive in tone. But he said he thought that in the final days of
the race, voters had heard his message on education, Social
Security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to combat the cynicism of young people, and
everybody in America, is to actually pass things that make people's
lives better,'' he said. ``And that's what I'm going to do.''

INCUMBENT WINS SENATE SEAT AFTER CANDIDATES SWAP LINES ON BALLOT

   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ The Republican-turned-Democrat beat the
Democrat-turned-Republican in Suffolk County's 3rd Assembly
District.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent victor, Debra Mazzarelli, 43, a former telephone
union worker, defeated I. William Bianchi Jr., 67, a former
assemblyman who first lost to Ms. Mazzarelli four years ago when
she ran as a Republican and he as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   As if that was not bewildering enough, Bianchi, who is still a
registered Democrat, was defeated by Ms. Mazzarelli in the
Democratic primary in September.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 3rd District is predominantly Republican, many
voters apparently chose to ignore party lines, giving Ms.
Mazzarelli 15,143 votes to 11,202 votes for Bianchi, according to
unofficial returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think party line was an issue,'' Ms. Mazzarelli said
in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``Voters wanted someone they
could relate to on a personal level who was not the puppet of a
party boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mazzarelli said she switched her party affiliation to
Democrat because she believed the GOP was wrong for women and
families and wrong about health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have come full circle from the days when
George Bush talked of a kinder, gentler nation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi, who also ran on the Conservative and Independent lines,
campaigned as a supporter of health care reform and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mazzarelli's victory was a double embarrassment for John
Powell, leader of the Suffolk County Republican party, who chose
her in 1994 to challenge Bianchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Powell breathed life into her as a politician,'' said
Alan F. Eysen, a spokesman for the county GOP. ``Then personally
and politically she became a Brutus.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell responded by picking Bianchi to oppose her, saying he was
willing to overlook Bianchi's party affiliation because surveys
showed that he was the one candidate who could beat Ms. Mazzarelli.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mazzarelli, however, defied the odds _ and possible
confusion at the polls _ and took 57 percent of the vote, handing
Powell yet another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the party bosses who win campaigns, it's the
candidates and the people who support them,'' said Ms. Mazzarelli,
who stayed up until 4:30 Wednesday morning celebrating her
victory. &QL;

FOR GENTLEMEN, A STUNNING ROLL OF THE DICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (af)

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``If you're going to be a little crazy,'' Dick
Mandella said, considering the biggest gamble ever taken in the
15-year history of the Breeders' Cup, ``you might as well be real
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella, the trainer of the 6-year-old star Gentlemen, was
standing outside Barn 36 Wednesday morning, reflecting on the
tantalizing question that had just been answered by R.D. Hubbard,
the owner of Gentlemen: to enter the horse in the $4 million
Classic instead of the $1 million Mile.
</P>
<P>
   He thereby turned a powerful race into a true classic, with a
showdown against Skip Away and Silver Charm.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard's risk involved money. Because Gentlemen had never been
enrolled in the Breeders' Cup program at his birth in Argentina,
his owner would have to pay a supplemental fee of 20 percent of the
purse to enter him in any race.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, the chairman of Hollywood Park race track in Los
Angeles, decided to be ``real crazy,'' so he rolled the dice and
entered his horse in the Classic, risking a supplemental fee of
$800,000.
</P>
<P>
   To win his gamble, the horse would have to finish first, with
its prize money of $2.6 million, or second, with money of $1
million. In the Mile, he would have risked a supplemental fee of
$200,000, and he would have had to run first ($665,600) or second
($256,000) to redeem his choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people lose more money buying a yearling who never
runs,'' Mandella reasoned several hours before Hubbard's decision
was made formal in the draw for post positions. ``But we considered
the decision for a long time. It's a serious decision, and $800,000
is a lot of money. We didn't finally decide until early this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after Gentlemen turned in a snappy
half-mile workout in 46 4/5 seconds, and Hubbard said: ``Richard
and I have gone over this every day for the last two weeks and
probably changed our minds at least three times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen's fate dominated the talk all week along the
backstretch of Churchill Downs, where the final act in the drama
will be played out on Saturday in the 15th Breeders' Cup: seven
races with 85 star horses racing for purses of $12 million and the
inside track on the year's championships. And it was still the buzz
Wednesday when the horses were entered and Gentlemen was thrust
against world-class rivals like Silver Charm and Skip Away for the
biggest purse in racing, which grew to $5,120,000 with supplemental
fees added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great horse,'' Mandella said, trying to explain the
reasoning behind the high-risk decision. ``For two years, he was
unbeatable, the best in the world. Now he's 6 years old, but we
think he may be back to his old form. We felt he could run with
anybody, and he likes the distance of a mile and a quarter. And
most of all, he deserves the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen has won 13 of his 23 races and run in the money 19
times, with career earnings of $3.6 million. He has even won five
of eight starts on the grass, so he would not have been venturing
into unknown territory if he had entered the Mile.
</P>
<P>
   He has dazzled the West Coast in most of his races, but in his
last two starts he has shown his speed and durability to New York.
In the Jockey Club Gold Cup last month, he ran second to Silver
Charm but in front of Skip Away. In the Woodward in September, he
ran second to Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic drew a powerful field of 11, one of the strongest
fields in Breeders' Cup history. Silver Charm drew the No. 8 post
position and was rated the 8-5 favorite, Skip Away was next at 9-5
in the No. 6 stall and Gentlemen drew the No. 10 hole and was
quoted at 6-1 by an oddsmaker who apparently did not share
Hubbard's confidence or investment philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing part of the equation was the coupling of three
star horses for betting purposes because of common ownership
elements. They were Awesome Again and Touch Gold, trained by
Patrick Byrne, and Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old speed horse
from New York trained by Shug McGaughey. They were quoted at common
odds of 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who trains Silver Charm, voiced some pleasure that
Gentlemen had been booked into the Classic because the horse has
both the speed and stamina to keep Skip Away from controlling the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to keep Skip Away from getting an easy lead,''
Baffert said. ``He gets very brave on the lead by himself.
Coronado's Quest can't go toe-to-toe with him. Skip Away just pours
it on in his second quarter. He'll chew up a horse like Coronado's
Quest in that quarter. He's just so fast, he runs you into the
ground. The other early favorites for the Breeders' Cup were Cat
Thief, Mountain Range and Tactical Cat, three of the five colts
entered in the Juvenile by D.Wayne Lukas; Silverbulletday in the
Juvenile Fillies; Affirmed Success in the Sprint; the English horse
Labeeb in the Mile; Banshee Breeze in the Distaff, and Royal Anthem
in the Turf.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion is about seduction, although it may sound
crass to come out and say it. Dressing to be sexually seductive is
obvious, but that is not the issue. The point is that fashion
exists to seduce customers into buying something.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing is another matter entirely. Clothing is what children
need as they grow, what women and men need for work and leisure.
Fashion is the icing, the nonessentials, the garments that are
coveted because they are irresistible. And that's what a designer,
as opposed to a manufacturer, exists to provide.
</P>
<P>
   An artist like van Gogh painted to satisfy an inner drive, but
fashion does not inhabit such an exalted plane. The glamour and
hype are there to accomplish a practical end. When designers forget
that and simply churn out basics, or make the opposite mistake of
getting caught up in some far-fetched, unrealistic dream, women
will not succumb to their blandishments. The designers who remember
what their mandate really is are the ones who last.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren knows this in his bones. He has always excelled at
tempting women to share his vision. Fashion people talk about
aspirational clothes _ a wardrobe that embodies a way of life that
a customer craves _ and Lauren all but invented the concept.
</P>
<P>
   When he started designing for women in the early 1970s, during
the hippie era, he evoked an elegant time of style-setters like the
duchess of Windsor, Fred Astaire and Katharine Hepburn. Women
responded, and he now heads a fashion empire.
</P>
<P>
   But time moves on, and so does Lauren. In his collection for
spring 1999, shown Wednesday morning, he infused his particular
brand of luxury into such casual styles of the moment as cargo
pants and anoraks.
</P>
<P>
   How do you get a woman to buy high-priced cargo pants when she
can find them at a surplus store for $20? Make them in silk faille
in luscious colors like sky blue and pink. That's what Lauren did,
turning ``function into fashion,'' as he said in his program notes.
</P>
<P>
   He also showed cropped sweaters with hip-huggers, and he paired
oversize pullovers and cardigans in silk and linen with long loose
dresses and wide soft pants. He topped a long floral silk dress
with a bronze shantung flight jacket and made a jumpsuit in pink
faille.
</P>
<P>
   There were variations on parachute pants in olive-green silk, on
the flight jacket in sage-green suede, and on the utilitarian
poncho in silk poplin and knitted cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   But Lauren didn't forget his more classic customer, offering her
shapely little tailored jackets, bias-cut skirts and narrow cuffed
pants _ all in neutral beiges _ as well as flowing off-white
organza dresses for evening.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael Kors has always been a sportswear kind of guy, and this
time he went for active sports like sailing and camping, basing his
collection on anoraks and windbreakers, shown with hand-knit
sweaters, short-sleeved shirts, shorts, slim skirts and trousers.
He used bold colors like orange, yellow, green and cinnabar, as
well as neutral khakis and beiges.
</P>
<P>
   His anoraks came in cotton sailcloth or silk taffeta, and were
shown not just conventionally over shorts or trousers but also over
pailletted skirts. Kors, who once tended to put his customers into
flamboyant gold leather, now uses shine and sparkle more
discreetly. He paired a sequined skirt with a heather gray cashmere
undershirt or a black cotton shirt, and made a totally sequined
shift in a dark tortoise-shell pattern.
</P>
<P>
   His collection was on the same wavelength as Lauren's, but not
as broad in scope. He played the same few notes over and over. Kors
does tend to have very focused collections, which is not a bad
thing, but the one he showed last month in Paris for Celine had
more variation and more pizazz than this one. Designers who do more
than one collection a season often devote more energy to one, which
is a pity but perhaps inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett also designs two women's collections, one for
Byblos in Italy and one under his own label, as well as menswear.
The signature line he showed here on Tuesday night was _ surprise!
_ based on military-surplus styles like cargo pants and fatigues,
made of silk poplin, canvas and tulle.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with basic styles, he added personal touches like wired
hemlines so that the garments could be twisted into different
shapes, and he put tabs on pants legs or skirt hems so that they
could be shortened on a whim. Straps under shirts and jackets could
be adjusted to hold them open.
</P>
<P>
   All of this sounds clever, but it frequently ends up merely
gimmicky, as when a single tab is used to shorten one spot on a
skirt. When tabs all around a skirt are used to shorten it, the
effect is thick and ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Adding those tabs under shirts and tacking a pouf of netting
inside the hem of a coat seemed like unfortunate borrowings from
some of Helmut Lang's innovations. Bartlett would do better to do
away with the extraneous details and not to be afraid to show his
clothing as is. It looked fine that way.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, Kors and Bartlett all mined the same military-surplus
lode this season, with Lauren striking gold, Kors silver and
Bartlett brass.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers have mapped out their own courses for appealing
to a woman's love of fashion. Oscar de la Renta offers femininity
and beauty. For spring he used never-fail colors like pink, sea
foam, banana, ivory and sky blue for pared-down daytime styles.
</P>
<P>
   There were chemises, double-faced wool coats and jackets with
welt seaming and abbreviated sailor collars, and A-line skirts with
scalloped hems. (Scallops, which started with Comme des Garcons in
Paris, have crossed the Atlantic to land in such disparate
collections as those of Marc Jacobs, Zang Toi and de la Renta. Is
it a fashion conspiracy?)
</P>
<P>
   As the collection segued into evening, de la Renta added
decorative elements like openwork broderie anglaise and floral
beading. He showed slender beaded columns; off-the-shoulder
embroidered gauze blouses, and full-skirted ball gowns in pastel
striped taffeta, ivory silk shantung and navy tulle with crystal
beading. The woman who wears his clothes may not need another
evening dress, but she is sure to be tempted to add one more to her
already full closet.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee's clothes are deceptive at first viewing. They look like
the essence of simplicity but are far from simplistic. They are
filled with hidden triangles, crescents and rectangles, punctuated
by dots, bars and vertical lines. You have to look closely to find
these shapes, because they are formed by the construction of the
seams, not by an overlay of a different fabric or color.
</P>
<P>
   A yoke around a curved neckline forms a flattering crescent. A
triangle formed by seams on the front of a shift holds invisible
pockets. Cutting fabric against the grain or reversing it may yield
a crenelated effect. Or rectangular flags are attached to a skirt
to flutter and add an element of controlled fullness. These flag
dresses were quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Like a dancer whose effortless leaps give no hint of the years
of practice that went into achieving them, Yeohlee makes her
painstakingly wrought clothes look effortless. Their appeal to a
women is intellectual as well as emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Daryl Kerrigan, a k a Daryl K, who designs for hip
young women who live in T-shirts, hip-huggers and leather. She
offered more versions of these styles for spring in frayed-edge
fabrics, unbleached denim and zebra patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerrigan has a reputation for being on top of the downtown
trends, so the fact that she showed a graffiti-patterned T-shirt
and had break dancers perform at her show sent signals, to the
tuned-in members of her audience, of a return to '80s hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Robinson's spring collection was a disappointment. It
was filled with nice but quite ordinary-looking sportswear that
lacked a distinctive signature. There were cropped sweaters and
quilted-gauze skirts, gingham shirts and distressed leather jacket.
But nothing that shouted, ``Buy me!''

MYOPIC EXPERTS SEEK ACCURACY IN HINDSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For weeks, the opinion polls showed that the race was
tantalizingly close, a suspenseful stalemate that would be decided
only when the final batch of votes was counted. But in the end,
Rep. Charles Schumer defeated Sen. Alfonse D'Amato by a wider
margin than expected, causing pollsters on Wednesday to examine why
their assessments were off.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Schumer won by nine
percentage points. He had 2,384,815 votes, or 54 percent, to
1,961,476, or 45 percent, for D'Amato. The majority of polls in the
final few weeks of the race said Schumer was leading by only a few
percentage points, at most.
</P>
<P>
   Some pollsters said Schumer appeared to have gained strongly
over the weekend, after most polls were conducted. Others said they
may have overestimated the Republican turnout because they were
basing their predictions on the last midterm election in 1994, when
the party did well. And many said they could have done a better job
anticipating that undecided voters would generally swing to the
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters adjust the results of their surveys in an effort to
ensure that the group of people interviewed has the same
composition as the people they believe will vote on Election Day.
But if their predictions are wrong _ because one campaign does a
better job getting its partisans to the polls or even because the
weather is bad _ then the results will be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't measure who is going to make a surge for
get-out-the-vote,'' said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion, whose last poll showed Schumer
leading by four percentage points. ``You are shooting at a moving
target. If the Republicans had spent $30 million on the
get-out-the-vote effort, you can take the polls and put them in the
shredder.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the Senate contest. The polls also failed to
predict what would happen in the race for attorney general, which
is still undecided. The Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, had
margins larger than 10 percentage points in some polls, but he is
slightly trailing the Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, in the
actual tally.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schumer, Spitzer may have garnered a lot of supporters in
the final days after many polling firms had stopped surveying the
race.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, most polls did in fact give the edge to
Schumer. But the lead was so slight _ typically just a few
percentage points _ that the pollsters were careful in how they
interpreted it. Generally, the lead was within what is known as the
margin of sampling error, a figure that is used to qualify the
accuracy of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So if Schumer had 46 percent to 42 percent for D'Amato, and the
margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points,
that could mean that he did not lead at all. It could also mean
that he was even farther ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But the pollsters may have played down the Schumer lead when
they publicized the polls, because they knew that D'Amato had
demonstrated a knack in the past for waging fierce fights in the
final days that pushed him over the finish line. In 1992, D'Amato
trailed the Democrat, Robert Abrams, for most of the election
before winning by one percentage point.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the final polls in the race, by Quinnipiac College, came
closest to predicting the outcome, showing Schumer ahead by eight
percentage points. Its pollsters credited the survey's accuracy to
the fact that they were able to detect the late movement of
undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   One polling firm that had D'Amato roughly even with Schumer in
the final days was Zogby International. Its last poll, which
included surveys from last Friday through Sunday, had both men with
41 percent. The firm's owner, John Zogby, said Wednesday that he
had fallen victim to his belief that the turnout would be higher
upstate, where Republicans dominate, and lower in New York City, a
Democratic stronghold.

AN UPSET IS TRACED, IN PART, TO A PARTISAN SONG
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ In the end, the upset in New Jersey's 12th
Congressional District Tuesday may have come down to a piece of
doggerel, sung on the floor of the House of Representatives by
Michael Pappas, the district's conservative Republican incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the recording of Pappas, a freshman, singing the praises
_ literally _ of independent counsel Kenneth Starr that the
Democratic candidate, Rush Holt, used in a campaign advertisement
that was broadcast over and over in the final weeks of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Holt campaign said that using Pappas' words and music
against him at least partly turned the race into a referendum on
Starr as well as on Pappas' incumbency. If so, then Starr also lost
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holt survived a glitch in vote counting that at one point gave
his opponent about 9,000 Democratic votes to become the first
Democrat to be elected from the district in modern memory. The
final, unofficial count was 91,572 for Holt to 86,448 for Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   The win by Holt, a Princeton physicist who has never held
elected office, also tipped the balance of power in New Jersey's
13-member congressional delegation, giving the Democrats a one-seat
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats and Republicans gave a great deal of credit for
the outcome of the race to the voters' negative reviews of Pappas'
singing debut in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had something potent, we knew it was cutting and we
knew right away we were going to use it,'' Brad Lawrence, one of
Holt's consultants, said of the moment he heard Pappas'
performance. ``We just had to decide how.''
</P>
<P>
   What they had was the tape of Pappas' appearance on the House
floor days after Starr's explosive report on President Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. In a moment of unmistakable
political euphoria, when many Republicans believed that Starr had
assured Clinton's impeachment, Pappas lifted his tenor voice to
sing, to the tune of ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'':
</P>
<P>
   Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr,
</P>
<P>
   Now we see how brave you are.
</P>
<P>
   We could not see which way to go
</P>
<P>
   If you did not lead us so,
</P>
<P>
   Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr
</P>
<P>
   Now we see how brave you are.
</P>
<P>
   In the Holt campaign spots, a female voice-over underscored the
anti-Starr message. As Pappas sang in the background, the narrator
said, ``Congress and Pappas spent millions and millions on partisan
investigations, while voting against what really matters,'' and
later: ``Congressman Pappas: Out of tune. Out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lighthearted, humorous way of calling attention to a
serious question,'' Sean Spicer, Pappas' spokesman, said Wednesday.
``So it was taken out of context, and it meant that Holt never had
to run an issues-driven campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Spicer added that the congressman would have no comment on the
campaign's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats agreed that there were other
factors that helped Holt win. His forces engineered a strong
turnout, and he raised about $750,000, almost as much as the
incumbent Republican. And he benefited from Pappas' conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before the election, former Gov. Tom
Kean _ still a popular figure in the state who represents the more
genteel and moderate Republicanism of the current governor,
Christie Whitman _ commented that Pappas ``has not had a very good
first term, and has been extreme on a number of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holt campaign also put that sound bite on the air, but it
was the ``Little Starr'' ad that allowed Holt to make a name for
himself, said Roger Bodman, a prominent Republican strategist and
consultant in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting through the clutter is very difficult in a campaign,''
he said, ``and Brad Lawrence really did that for Holt with that
spot.''

NEW YORK'S LIBERAL PARTY HOLDS ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``He lives for another four years to terrorize the
political world,'' Raymond Harding, the leader of the Liberal
Party, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The terror in question was himself.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, things had looked dicey for Harding's candidate for
governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross, after her husband withdrew the
several million dollars he had pledged to her campaign. That meant
things also looked dicey for his party, which under state election
rules needed 50,000 votes to keep its spot on state ballots for the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
   But with 98 percent of election districts reporting, the New
York State Board of Elections' unofficial tallies Wednesday showed
the Liberal Party's candidate with 75,870 votes, safely above the
threshold to assure the party a place on all state ballots for the
next four years. ``It makes me happy,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler and
the candidate of the Reform Party, shocked the political
establishment on Tuesday when he defeated the two major-party
candidates in the governor's race. Ventura won with slightly more
than a third of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   None of the minor-party candidates for governor in New York
approached that kind of performance, but collectively they
demonstrated that a large number of voters are looking for
alternatives to the major parties. According to unofficial and
incomplete results, the 10 minor parties that ran candidates for
governor tallied a total of 918,344 votes. By comparison, the
Democratic Party, with Peter Vallone as its candidate, had 1.4
million votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, noted that minor parties tended to provide
margins of victory to major-party candidates when turnout was high
and races were close. But, he said, the parties had still shown
their power to help or spoil the chances of such candidates this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, for example, he estimated that 40 percent of
the victory margin of Charles Schumer, the Democratic Party
candidate, came from votes he also drew on the Independence Party
line.
</P>
<P>
   And in the race for attorney general, the more than 60,000 votes
for Catherine Abate on the Independence Party line constituted what
would have been a comfortable margin of victory for either the
Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, or the Republican incumbent,
Dennis Vacco. The tally is still so close for Vacco and Spitzer
that the Board of Elections has said that it cannot declare a
winner until the remaining absentee ballots are counted next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party was clearly the major player among the
minors this year. Bankrolled by some $15 million from its candidate
for governor _ Thomas Golisano, a Rochester businessman _ the party
pulled in 343,979 votes, according to the board's unofficial
tallies. (That works out to about $44 per vote. In his first run
for governor in 1994, Golisano spent $6.6 million for 217,000
votes, or about $30 per vote. The Democrats, by comparison, spent
about $4 per vote this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The steep price may be worth it for Golisano: If the pattern
holds when all the votes are tallied, his Independence Party will
finish ahead of the Conservative Party, which so far has 304,354
votes, according to the board. That means the Independence Party
will get the third line _ Line C, which the Conservative Party had
this time _ on the ballot in all elections for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The position on the ballot is important because some voters do
not bother to look over the entire list of candidates and parties
before making their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot lines are assigned according to vote totals in the
governor's race. One of the side effects of Gov. George Pataki's
sizable victory is that the Republicans will have Line A, the top
line, on the ballot for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Laureen Oliver, the Independence Party's co-founder and its
candidate for lieutenant governor, said the improvement in ballot
position would make it easier to raise money for the party, even
without Golisano's millions. ``I think we have a very bright
future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party was next, followed by the Right to Life Party,
which, with 55,642 votes, ensured its place on forthcoming ballots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several parties _ Marijuana Reform, Unity, and Socialist Workers
_ finished out of the running. Two others were on tenterhooks.
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of districts reporting and absentee ballots yet
to be counted, the Green Party drew 48,251 votes for its candidate
for governor, the 88-year-old Al Lewis _ better known as ``Grandpa
Munster.'' The Working Families Party, a new party formed mostly by
labor unions, also had Vallone, the Democrat, as its candidate, but
he drew only 45,218 votes on that line.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said that
when absentee ballots are counted next week, he expected the Green
Party to secure the 50,000 votes, and the Working Families Party to
fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' Lewis said. ``It's like an expansion team in
baseball _ we're in the major leagues.''

 &HT;    Bush all the buzz in Washington, on TV
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the nation's Capitol and on its cable TV,
Bush is the buzz.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his landmark landslide, Gov. George W. Bush is
the talk of the land and the subject of, if possible, increased
speculation about a 2000 race for president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is sticking to his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the truth every day I was asked, which was every day
during the course of the campaign: I don't know whether I'm going
to run for president or not,'' he said Wednesday at a morning-after
news conference that attracted an international press corps
probably not all that interested in Bush's call for an end on the
state sales tax on diapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a job to do in Texas and I intend to do it,'' said
Bush, who spent part of the day talking legislation with
legislators. ``I will make decisions in the future later on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political buzz machine, spinning in high gear on the
seemingly endless lineup of TV talk shows, does not wait for the
future. Though Bush has said he will make no presidential race
decision until around March, his name is being tossed around as if
he is in the race.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, herself once on the long list
of potential GOP presidential contenders, said Bush is now on
something of a one-man list, a perch not free of peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're this far out in front, even the tiniest little
slip, insignificant as it may be, is going to look very
significant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans hankering for a White House win, Bush's moderate
message sounds like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Bush and brother Jeb,
elected Florida's governor on Tuesday, may have hit on a great new
tone for the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have these two sons win two of the biggest states'
governorships, and to do it by appealing across the board to
everybody _ women, minorities, Hispanics, African Americans -- you
know, that thrills me to death and I think we've got to do that
more of that in the Republican party,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who positioned himself as a ``compassionate
conservative,'' said Wednesday he hopes he has hit on a new message
for his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that Republicans sometimes tend to
do is say what we are against,'' he said. ``I like to say what I'm
for. I like to lay out what is positive about my agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed Texans, and I showed people who pay attention to
politicians, that one can adhere to the conservative philosophy and
implement policies that are compassionate for our fellow Texans,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it, it sold well. Bush collected 68.6 percent
of the vote in trouncing Democrat Garry Mauro. He carried all but
15 of the state's 254 counties. The Bush list included heavily
Hispanic, traditionally Democratic counties such as Cameron and
Hidalgo in South Texas, and El Paso _ a county his campaign turned
into a political lab.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to run strong in an identifiably Hispanic area,
Bush made repeated trips and spent heavily on advertising in El
Paso, a city used to being ignored in high-profile races.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, final numbers from an exit poll showed Bush carrying
49 percent of the Hispanic vote, an unprecedented figure for a
Texas Republican and 21 points better than a similar poll showed he
did in 1994. Bush also won 31 percent of the Democratic vote and 27
percent of the black vote. Though far from majorities, both
showings were solid for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who spent Wednesday
talking about missed opportunities to increase congressional
strength, Bush was a bright spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush's achievement in Texas is historic,
particularly with Hispanic voters. The Bush family is moving in the
right direction,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush of Texas said his success with Hispanics was due to nothing
more mysterious than making sure his overall message was delivered
in Hispanic communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't read, you can't realize the Texas dream,'' he
said. ``And I understand that, and so do thousands of Hispanic
parents who heard me say, loud and clear, English plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes efforts to mandate English as the official
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``English only sends the message to us, not you,'' he said.
``English plus says we want you to learn to read and write in
English because it will free your children, plus we respect your
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Camarillo, executive director of the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project in San Antonio, said Bush's moderate
policies, his refusal to engage in immigrant-bashing, and the
special attention he gave to Hispanics paid off. Her group's exit
poll showed Bush picked up 37 percent of the Hispanic vote, up from
25 percent in their poll in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Polinard, a political science professor at the University
of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, said Bush has opened a door for
his party. The growing Hispanic population will decide elections in
Texas before long, Polinard said, and ``the key to (Republicans)
remaining in power is clearly this Bush model.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overtures to Hispanics extends to his support of San
Antonio as the site for the Republican National Convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will show America that Hispanics and Anglos can coexist
side by side in the 10th largest city in the United States and do a
good job,'' he said.

 &HT;    Texas voters speak loudly
 &HT;    By staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although Republicans swept statewide offices in
Texas Tuesday, nationally Democrats wrote history by holding their
ground in Congress, a rarity not seen in midterm elections since
1934.
</P>
<P>
   Even in GOP-dominated Texas, every Democratic incumbent who ran
won re-election to Congress. Tuesday's vote mocked Republican
boasts of an election that would give them a veto-proof Senate and
substantial gains in the House.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to resist the notion that the congressional election
was a repudiation of the GOP leadership's attacks on President
Clinton. Two weeks before the general election, the GOP spent
millions of dollars airing anti-Clinton ads in selected television
markets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But voters were obviously sick of personal attacks on Clinton,
highly negative campaigning and radically partisan politics. Most
observers see the history-defying election as a backlash against
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's determined effort to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since the balance of power in the Senate and House didn't
effectively change in this week's voting, the issue of impeaching
the president becomes politically questionable. Although most
voters in exit polls said they didn't cast ballots as a referendum
on impeachment, the GOP disappointment should create an entirely
different atmosphere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are Clinton persecutors Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York
and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina and back are Democratic
senators Barbara Boxer of California and Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin. Also, a huge percentage of voters in exit polls approved
of Clinton's job performance and said they did not want him
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic victories came despite the party's being outspent
by as much as $100 million by the GOP. The entire force of the
election should give pause to Republicans rushing toward
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are squeamish about the way Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr went about his investigation of Clinton and still
pursues peripheral characters in his four-year,
$40-million-and-counting jihad. Americans like the president's job
performance, and they don't like the way Starr came up with his
grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP looks to the party's sweep of statewide offices in
Texas it might learn something. From Gov. Bush down to the bottom
of the ticket, there isn't a wild-eyed radical to be found. Bush
calls his brand of Republicanism ``compassionate conservatism,''
and Republicans in Washington ought to take note.
</P>
<P>
   America's majority-wins electoral system has the wonderful
benefit of forcing candidates toward the center, where most people
dwell politically. And that was the clear message from voters this
week.

 &HT;    Questions everywhere for new Texas legislature
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr. and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate's Republican leadership said
Wednesday that Lt. Gov.-elect Rick Perry's legislative role won't
differ from that of his predecessors, despite earlier hints of
changes in Senate rules to reduce the powers of the state's No. 2
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Texas House leaders of both parties also predicted little change
in the status quo in that chamber, despite a Republican gain of
three seats that narrowed the Democratic majority to 79-71.
Lawmakers from both bodies said they expect the spirit of
bipartisanship that has characterized recent legislative sessions
to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a history of working in a bipartisan fashion in the
state of Texas, and we'll continue to, whether we have a Democratic
majority or a Republican majority,'' said Rep. Kent Grusendorf,
R-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans did differ on the import of the GOP's
House gains, however. Republicans said Tuesday's election was the
continuation of an inexorable drive toward a GOP majority in both
houses of the Legislature. Democrats pointed to the Republicans'
loss of a Senate seat and their failure to grab the House in a year
when Republican Gov. George W. Bush led a GOP sweep of statewide
offices.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Senate Republican Caucus on Wednesday,
caucus leader Florence Shapiro of Plano said neither Bush nor Perry
had pushed the group to maintain current rules, under which the
lieutenant governor appoints committee leaders and members. The
lieutenant governor also determines the committees that consider
proposed laws and which bills will be considered by the full
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is evident that this group today has decided that there is
not going to be any change in power. Period,'' Shapiro said. ``We
felt that in this particular set of circumstances, given who the
new lieutenant governor is and given that fact that this power has
been handed over to him that we were not going to be an obstacle in
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who said she hopes to be assigned as head of a
committee, also said she's uncertain if she will run again to lead
the Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, the first Republican lieutenant governor since
Reconstruction,said partisan differences will recede as the
campaign season gives way to the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention always has been to work with all of the senators.
The partisan label behind their names becomes very secondary or
even tertiary as we go into a session. It's about dealing with the
issues that are facing Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center, echoed that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election results confirm that most Texans approve of the
way their local House members have represented them and the way the
House has conducted its business with bipartisan cooperation,''
Laney said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But some aspects of the House election results were open to
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans gained only three of the eight seats they needed to
win control of the Texas House for the first time since the 1870s,
despite pouring record amounts of cash into close races during the
last month of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the 30-day period ending Oct. 26, GOP loyalists and
political action committees contributed more than $2 million to
candidates in 16 key districts. In contrast, Democratic candidates
in those districts raised a total of $850,000 during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won three of the targeted races, narrowly defeating
Democratic incumbent Charles Finnell in District 68 and winning
open seats vacated by Democrats in District 4, held by the retiring
Keith Oakley, and District 13, held by the late Dan Kubiak.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, who headed the GOP effort to take
the House and who has been positioning himself to become House
speaker, said it's only a matter of time before Republicans make it
over the hump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to chip away at it,'' Craddick said of the
Democratic House majority. ``The state is obviously turning
Republican, and eventually that's what will happen in the Texas
House, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on election night, word circulated that Craddick, the
senior Republican in the House, anticipated a GOP gain of eight
seats and would soon announce his candidacy for speaker. But the
rumored press conference never materialized, and Craddick described
the talk as ``totally ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Grusendorf noted that several House races were decided by less
than 1,000 votes. In District 46, which includes Hays County,
Democratic incumbent Alec Rhodes edged Republican Rick Green by
only 20 votes. Election officials said it remained unclear whether
Green would ask for a recount.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all it was a watershed year for Republicans _
basically, the Republicans have taken over the state of Texas,''
said Grusendorf. ``I think we'll definitely take it next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, not surprisingly, had a different take on the GOP's
gain of three seats. Rep. Sherri Greenberg, D-Austin, said House
races usually turn on local issues, rather than partisan
differences. She also noted that Republicans failed to win the
eight seats despite Bush's enormous popularity, a GOP sweep of
statewide offices and record campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when the stars are going to be aligned like that
again,'' Greenberg said.

 &HT;    Testimony about Scaggs' private life focus of proceedings
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Roger Scaggs' private life took center stage in
court Wednesday, as witnesses in his murder trial testified about
his extramarital affair with a co-worker and his supposed coldness
toward his wife in the months before her violent death.
</P>
<P>
   After Scaggs' wife, Penny, was found bludgeoned and stabbed in
the couple's Southwest Austin home on March 6, 1996, witnesses said
they saw Roger Scaggs around town with Vanessa Ferguson, who worked
with Scaggs at the data-processing company where he was president.
Prosecutors said Ferguson was his mistress before Penny Scaggs was
killed and the main reason he wanted to escape his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson has been missing for more than six months. Prosecutors
have said they believe she's in hiding and have issued a warrant
for her apprehension if she turns up.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of a tanning salon and beauty parlor said Wednesday
that they saw the couple together in the months after Penny Scaggs'
death.
</P>
<P>
   While getting a manicure and acrylic wrap at the Tips &AMP; Toes
salon in October 1996, Roger Scaggs told employees his previous
wife was so ``anal'' she even ironed his underwear, nail technician
Sue Bowen testified. ``I said, 'That's why she's the previous
wife,''' Bowen said, prompting gasps from the audience. ``We
thought she was an ex-wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Miles, a former manager at Tanco Tanning Center on
Anderson Lane in Austin, said Scaggs and Ferguson came in several
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs' attorneys objected to several parts of Miles' testimony,
saying it was irrelevant and prejudicial, and the jury was sent out
of the courtroom. While the jurors were gone, Miles testified that
Scaggs asked her in October 1996 whether she wanted to go to
California with him. She declined, and when Scaggs returned to
Austin, he told her that he had taken Ferguson on the trip and that
they had both attended a swingers' convention in the lobby of a
hotel, Miles testified.
</P>
<P>
   Miles said Scaggs also suggested she try topless dancing, saying
it was a lucrative and safe profession.
</P>
<P>
   Though the jury wasn't present, Miles' testimony rattled several
friends and acquaintances of the Scaggses, who have been described
as a loving, church-going couple. Many in the audience closed their
eyes or winced.
</P>
<P>
   The Scaggses' relationship also became part of the afternoon's
testimony. Prosecutor Bryan Case Jr. told District Judge Jon Wisser
while the jury was out of the courtroom that the state believes
Scaggs' ``extremely strong sexual proclivities'' led him to find a
mistress when Penny Scaggs couldn't satisfy him. Ultimately, Case
said, Roger Scaggs killed his wife to get rid of her altogether.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend testified she took Penny Scaggs' Creative
Counterparts course twice. Risa Pardue said she liked most of the
class, which taught wives to love their husbands unconditionally
and obey their ultimate authority. But the lesson on sex made her
cringe, she said, because it encouraged wives to make themselves
available for their husbands and act enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it sound perfunctory,'' Pardue said, ``like sex was
about being dutiful as opposed to a passionate, spur-of-the-moment
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before she died, Penny Scaggs attended a women's
religious retreat and bought videotapes on enhancing marital sex,
Pardue said. That surprised Pardue, but she said others pointed out
that Scaggs might have purchased them for her Creative Counterparts
class.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Scaggs' younger sister, Sharon Fox of Frisco, Texas,
testified under questioning from defense attorney Roy Minton that
her sister was prone to bladder infections whenever she had sexual
intercourse. She had taken low-grade antibiotics for several years
to prevent the infections, but a change in her prescription in
October 1995 led to a severe infection that turned into pneumonia,
Fox said, reading from medical records Minton provided.
</P>
<P>
   While she was sick, Penny Scaggs asked Fox to come and take care
of her. Roger Scaggs left on a business trip that weekend,
returning later that week after his wife was hospitalized. Fox said
Roger Scaggs told his wife he didn't want her to come home until
she was well enough to look after him and the house. She stayed
with her sisters until she was well.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Minton asked Fox whether her sister
simply wanted more affection, which he said all men could do a
better job of providing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not more _ some,'' Fox said, visibly agitated. During the week
she spent with her sister, ``I did not observe the emotion, the
expression, the gentleness, the consideration expected from a man
that genuinely loved his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Minton also asked whether Fox ever suspected the Scaggs' adopted
daughter, Sarah, of the murder. Fox said she told police she hoped
neither Roger nor Sarah Scaggs was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   After testimony ended for the day, Sarah Scaggs, who has sat
beside her aunts during the trial, said she knew of Fox's
suspicions before, but it was difficult hearing it in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think they think I could have done that to my
mom,'' she said tearfully. ``I loved her very much.''

ALL KIDDING ASIDE, GENTLEMEN'S A GO FOR CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Before assembled media at a Churchill Downs
barn yesterday morning, R.D. Hubbard asked for a coin to flip.
</P>
<P>
   If the coin came up heads, Gentlemen would be entered in the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic, said Hubbard, majority owner of the
6-year-old racehorse. Tails, and he would run, instead, on grass in
the $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard handed the borrowed coin to his trainer, Richard
Mandella, who tossed it and let it drop into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tails!'' Hubbard exclaimed. ``We're running in the Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was all a comedy act. And perhaps the funniest
part was Hollywood Park chief executive officer and millionaire
Hubbard, who with his partners will pay a record $800,000
supplemental fee to race Gentlemen in Saturday's Classic, didn't
have a coin in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Workouts, rules changes and future stud fees all factored into
the decision to choose the Classic over the Mile, Hubbard said. But
in the end, it came down to the romance of running Gentlemen in
what might be one of history's greatest races.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went in the Mile, we would have always wondered,''
Hubbard said. ``So we're going against Skip Away and Silver Charm
and the others. This horse deserves it. It's the world's richest
purse and we might as well go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the inclusion of Gentlemen, the 10-horse field entered
yesterday for the mile-and-a-quarter Classic swells the total purse
to $5,120,000, making it the most lucrative race ever. The winner's
share will be $2,662,400.
</P>
<P>
   Fields also were set yesterday for the six other Breeders' Cup
races Saturday _ the $2 million Turf, $2 million Distaff, the Mile,
$1 million Sprint, $1 million Juvenile and $1 million Juvenile
Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile, Sprint, Mile and Turf have maximum 14-horse
lineups. The smallest field will be in the Distaff, for which eight
were entered.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm is the 8-5 program favorite in the Classic. Skip
Away, who won the same race last year at Hollywood Park, is next at
9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, trainer of Silver Charm, believes his horse will be
favored because local fans remember his victory at Churchill Downs
in the 1997 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm is kind of a home-crowd horse,'' Baffert said.
``In New York, Skip Away probably would be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much difference. These two horses have done so
much for racing. It's what everybody has been waiting for, two big,
gray horses hooking up. It's the race of the year, maybe the race
of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Next at 9-2 in the Classic odds is a three-horse wagering entry
comprising Awesome Again, Touch Gold and Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen will start at 6-1 odds. Others entered were Swain
(10-1), Victory Gallop (15-1), Arch (15-1) and Running Stag (50-1).
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen was dominating last year, outrunning Skip Away in the
Pimlico Special when both horses were at their best. But he missed
the 1997 Classic because of a throat problem, and hasn't been the
same since, with only a one-for-six record.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, whose ownership partners in Gentlemen include Robert
Folsom of Dallas, has been debating with Mandella the merits of the
Classic and Mile. Mandella has said he doesn't think Gentlemen has
been good enough this year to warrant the huge supplemental
payment, but he relented yesterday after Gentlemen's half-mile
workout in a swift 46 4-5 seconds on dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been changing our minds two or three times a day,''
Hubbard said. ``We've had a rivalry \Rwith Skip Away\S going for a
little more than a year. We've beat him twice, and he's beat us
twice. So, it's our intention to try him one more time. I feel
they're the two best horses in the country, and on Saturday we'll
find out who's best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classic will be Gentlemen's final race before being sent to
stud, Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the swan song for Skip Away, who, by finishing
third or better, would become the first horse to exceed $10 million
in earnings. Another victory would put his lifetime bankroll at
$12,278,760.
</P>
<P>
   A rules change last year by the Breeders' Cup encouraged
supplemental nominations by adding about 90 percent of supplemental
fees to the purse, thus giving gambling owners a chance to get some
of their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sonny and Carolyn Hine paid a then-record $480,000
supplemental fee to run Skip Away in the Classic. They received the
normal winners' share of $2,080,000 plus another $208,000 because
of the rule change.
</P>
<P>
   The total Classic purse is even larger this year. In addition to
Gentlemen's $800,000 supplement, another $480,000 supplement is
being paid to enter Silver Charm by his owners, Robert and Beverly
Lewis of Newport Beach, Calif.

JET AND BIRDS ABOVE RESULT IN SCARE BELOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A flock of birds flew into an engine of a
United Parcel Service Boeing 747 airliner early yesterday morning,
damaging engine parts and causing debris to fall to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And of all the places on which to land, debris struck the roof
of Barn 36 at Churchill Downs. That barn is housing 19 horses,
including Breeders' Cup entrants Skip Away, Chief Bearhart and
Gentlemen, three of the world's most valuable thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   No people or horses were injured. Pilots shut down the damaged
engine of the UPS aircraft, which returned on its three good
engines to make an emergency landing at Louisville International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it affected him very much,'' trainer Sonny Hine
said of Skip Away. ``They say parts of the plane hit the barn and
it was loud. He's got everything coming at him from the ground and
now the sky.''
Taking a gamble
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision to supplement Gentlemen into the Classic
at a cost of $800,000, trainer Richard Mandella seemed more
concerned about spending the money than did majority owner R.D.
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money,'' Mandella explained. ``It's a terrible
thing to handle if he doesn't run well. I'm just worried that if he
doesn't make all the money back, \RHubbard\S will take it out of my
pay next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella said few owners would consider such a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are going good, he's a pain in the rear,''
Mandella said of Hubbard. ``But when things get tough, he's there
for you. In important situations, he's all man.''
Time change
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie has changed the post time of its
live quarter horse card to 5 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prairie racetrack moved the post back 1 1/2 hours in
hopes of capitalizing on the anticipated big crowd for the
Breeders' Cup simulcast. The Breeders' Cup races are scheduled to
conclude at 4:05 p.m.
Royal Anthem rebounds
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Breeders' Cup horses clocked workouts yesterday, and
among the most important was Royal Anthem's half-mile breeze in 50
3/5 seconds on dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Anthem, the 3-1 program favorite for the Turf, was lame in
his left fore on Monday. The problem was corrected Tuesday when his
regular shoes were pulled off and replaced with glue-ons, which
have no nails.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the workout, English trainer Henry Cecil is
confident the 3-year-old colt's problem is behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything serious with him,'' Cecil said. ``He
enjoyed himself.''
Lukas' favorite?
</P>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas is running five youngsters in the
Juvenile, and would never be so politically incorrect as to name
his pick of the litter.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines, however, he sounds most enamored of
Cat Thief, part of Overbrook Farm's three-horse entry favored at
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse is an alley fighter,'' Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas loved Cat Thief's victory at nearby Keeneland in the
Lane's End Breeders' Futurity last month, in which the colt
aggressively forced his way through a narrow gap between horses in
the upper stretch and won a photo-finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually ran better after he got bumped,'' Lukas said. ``Of
all the horses, he's probably the most rugged.''
Keeping Quest calm
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest's temperamental fits this winter in Florida
earned him a bad-boy reputation. His behavior has been calm since,
but now he faces his first airplane trip.
</P>
<P>
   Entered yesterday in the Classic, he will be flown from New York
to Louisville late tonight on a FedEx plane, accompanied by
stablemates Emanating (Juvenile Fillies) and Furlough (Sprint).
</P>
<P>
   He won't stake his career on it, but trainer Shug McGaughey
predicts Coronado's Quest's debut flight will uncover no new
phobias.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not, anyway,'' McGaughey said. ``He's matured quite a
bit.''

AIKMAN SAYS SHOULDER FEELS FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. AND KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Two days after playing for the first time in
five games because of a fractured collarbone, Cowboys quarterback
Troy Aikman said his body is sore, but his left shoulder feels
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably feels better than what I expected,'' said Aikman,
who said he is still using a bone stimulator on a daily basis to
help heal the break near his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he wasn't as rusty on the field as he expected. He
admitted that he appeared uncomfortable at times against the
Eagles, but said that had more to do with the way the Philadelphia
Eagles were playing defense than the effects of the layoff. The
Cowboys won Monday night's game, 34-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to go through a period of awkwardness,'' Aikman
said. ``That has not been the case. I felt good in practice. I felt
good in the game. I started to feel more comfortable as the game
progressed.''
Lett healthy, impressive
</P>
<P>
   After being hobbled by a training-camp knee injury for the first
seven games, defensive tackle Leon Lett was at full strength in
Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   An unleashed Lett stood above all others in the 34-0 blasting of
the Eagles with four tackles and a season-high five quarterback
pressures. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who said he couldn't get Lett
off the field in the waning moments of the blowout, was still
raving yesterday about his defensive tackle's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we take him for granted to a certain degree,'' Gailey
said. ``That's a big man with a lot of quickness. I know he feels a
lot better than he did at the start of the season. I hope there's a
lot left. That would be something.''
Giants can't afford to lose
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants coach Jim Fassel realizes that a loss against
the Cowboys on Sunday at Texas Stadium would all but eliminate his
club from contention in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose, we'd be too far behind to even dream about,''
repeating as NFC East champs, Fassel said. ``We wouldn't be
mathematically eliminated. But Dallas is too good. We've got our
backs too far up against the wall right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would be 5-0 in the division with a victory Sunday,
and the Giants would be 2-3. Three division games remain for both
clubs after this weekend. Should both teams end up with the same
record, the Cowboys would have all of the tiebreaker advantages on
the Giants based on their head-to-head sweep.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Erik Williams is doubtful for Sunday's game against the
Giants with a sprained left foot. He did not practice yesterday.
Gailey said a final decision won't be made until later in the week.
Reserve lineman Tony Hutson will start at right tackle if Williams
can't go.
</P>
<P>
   Center Clay Shiver, listed as questionable for the Giants game
with a sprained right knee, participated in limited practice. He
said he feels better and expects to play Sunday. Former Canadian
Football League standout Mike Kiselak is the backup center.
</P>
<P>
   Deep snapper Dale Hellestrae, suffering from a sprained right
knee, did not practice and is questionable for the Giants game. He
is expected to practice later in the week. A decision on his
playing status might not come until just before the game. Kiselak
is also Hellestrae's backup.

ARIZONA VOTERS OPT FOR RADICAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Arizona politics have been all but
synonymous with political corruption. On Tuesday, according to
supporters of Proposition 200, voters changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona threw out its creaking campaign finance system and opted
for a revolutionary measure that would have the public rather than
lobbyists and special interests pay for state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hailed the vote nationally as proof that, despite
gridlock over the issue in Congress, the public favors radical
campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Proposition 200, along with measures that open
primaries to independent voters and raise legislative salaries to
$24,000, the political landscape changed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This changes everything,'' said Bob Grossfeld, a local
political consultant, who joined other politicos this morning in
poring over the details of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to make it very difficult for either political
extreme to get control of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, executive director of the Washington D.C-based
Public Campaign, said the Arizona vote, coupled with the passage of
a similar measure in Massachusetts, proves campaign reform can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``While reform is stuck between a rock and a hard place in
Washington, states are taking the lead, enacting sweeping
changes,'' Miller exulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Congress, not campaign finance reformers, that are
out of touch with voters,'' Miller said. ``Politicians should heed
the message: People are not happy with the status quo, and when
given a clear choice, they will support dramatic changes in the
campaign finance system.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it will work: The law provides public funds to
candidates who agree to abide by strict limits on campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative candidates who raise 200 contributions of $5 each
from registered voters in their districts would forgo major
fund-raising efforts and instead qualify for up to $25,000 in
public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for statewide offices would have to raise $5 each
from larger numbers of voters to receive even more taxpayer money.
Those candidates who did not participate in the system would face a
20 per cent reduction in the state's already-tight campaign
contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say it will level the playing field, supplying
unknown candidates _ almost always challengers _ with the money to
run a respectable race. That will increase competition and
encourage more candidates to run, they say, giving voters more
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona legislative races are notoriously uncompetitive.
One-third of incumbents faced no opposition this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people now who maybe have community credentials but
not necessarily financial connections who will be able to run,''
said Dennis Burke, executive director of Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Schneider, a Democrat who lost Tuesday to two GOP
incumbents in District 16, said the measure would have helped her
campaign. She ran a strong race, despite a huge disadvantage in
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are against two incumbents and trying to raise money,
you run into roadblocks,'' Schneider said. ``There's a tremendous
backlash to the people who give to challengers.''
</P>
<P>
   But more changes are needed, Grossfeld argues, before voters get
consistently competitive races. The missing piece? Taking the power
of redistricting out of the hands of legislators. That's the only
way to truly level the playing field, Grossfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one redistricting plan will likely be on the 2000
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Proposition 200 is a prescription for disaster. They
argue it will only further empower special interests by encouraging
hundreds of independent expenditure cam paigns.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists or groups can spend money independently of candidates,
a practice that is common today. Grossfeld suggested lobbyists
would simply find new ways to spend the money they spend now.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher? Spending is capped for candidates who participate
in the system. That makes it hard to respond to the independent
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to give so much power to special interests, because
independent expenditures are going to control the process,'' said
Rep. Sue Gerard, R-north-central Phoenix. ``They're going to
control this place. We're going to have more nut cases than we have
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Kevin DeMenna agreed. He predicted the measure would
fail just as past attempts to keep lobbyists out of the process
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the First Amendment is intact, we (lobbyists) will
find a way. It's a bump in the road,'' DeMenna said. ``Proposition
200 is one of the most poorly written, ill-conceived ideas to ever
come along.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charlie Stevens, another powerful lobbyist, supported
Proposition 200. He said he would rather pay the $100 annual
lobbyist fee, which will in part fund the finance system, than
serve on 10 or 15 campaign committees and be hit up for money from
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the measure will fight the perception that
lobbyists and big business dominate the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   National leaders will likely take Proposition 200 to other
states, particularly since the reform bill offered by Sen. John
McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., went nowhere in the last
session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold's victory Tuesday after a tough race further encouraged
campaign reformers. He limited his own campaign spending in
accordance with his bill despite facing a well-financed opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Kaia Lenhart, the political director for Arizonans for Clean
Elections, says the message couldn't be clearer in Arizona and
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a conservative Western state, people are ready to
embrace comprehensive campaign finance reform,'' Lenhart said. ``It
also clearly sends a message to Washington that citizens will vote
for measures that are much more sweeping than are currently being
debated inside the beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizonans are sick and tired of political scandal and
corruption and the role money plays in politics.''

SEC WOULD MAKE JERRY SPRINGER PROUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the college football season heads into the final
stretch, it means it's time to revisit our country's most
dysfunctional conference.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we're talking about the high-strung, feisty and even
bad-tempered Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   When you combine one-horse towns, rabid fans,
state-of-the-art-facilities and an unrivaled desire to win at all
costs, you get some of the most colorful/embarrassing behavior
around.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily negative, mind you. Otherwise, y'all would
be stuck pondering the blandness of the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Check out last weekend's escapades.
</P>
<P>
   Florida quarterback Doug Johnson was cussing out Georgia on the
sidelines in the final seconds of the Gators' 38-7 victory in
Jacksonville. It wasn't a problem, until Johnson found out the
touching moment was caught by CBS cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate. I guess it happens in situations like
that,'' Johnson said sheepishly, after realizing he was exposed on
video.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to think Georgia was a noble victim in this scenario,
but...
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were too busy pulling their own stunts. They had
professional wrestler and ex-Georgia football player Bill Goldberg
deliver an impassioned pregame pep talk. What? Ric Flair was
unavailable?
</P>
<P>
   The speech had far less impact than one of Goldberg's
spear-and-jackhammer moves.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Jim Donnan? He cursed at Phillip Fulmer after
Tennessee scored a touchdown with five minutes left last year. So
everyone eagerly awaited to hear his views on Steve Spurrier's
apparent running up of the score, mainly because Spurrier despises
every other coach in the league _ and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulldogs coach meekly tucked his tail between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with him running up the score,''
Donnan said. ``There's no animosity here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, it didn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Said Spurrier, living up to his reputation for surliness, ``I
don't care what their coach thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the Pac-10 were this much fun.
</P>
<P>
   __ Embarrassing-Lee poor prediction: Speaking of people who have
lost it, ESPN analyst Lee Corso predicted Saturday morning that
Nebraska's Black Shirt defense would knock Texas tailback Ricky
Williams out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams only solidified his front-runner position in the
Heisman Trophy chase and gained 150 yards against the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Lee I'm OK, healthy, that they didn't knock me out of the
game,'' Williams said on ESPN radio afterward. ``I think I might
have knocked them out.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tell it like it is: It was a night of mixed emotions for Jim
McMahon at the San Diego State-BYU game.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, BYU saluted its former All-American quarterback for
his induction into the National Football Foundation's College
Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine except McMahon isn't even a Hall of Fame member at
BYU, where he was considered by many as little more than a
non-Mormon renegade in a four-year career that closed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   While watching BYU's 13-0 victory over San Diego State from the
sideline, McMahon showed he hasn't lost his edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recognize the team, they run so much. We didn't run
this much in the whole season. When did we turn into Oklahoma?,''
McMahon said. ``It's kind of boring to watch, I think''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars rushed the ball 48 times and threw 17 passes in a
236-yard night against the Aztecs.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon did allow that he was ``honored'' as a Cougar to be
selected to the College Hall of Fame, but he had one zinger left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look out there,'' he said, ``they've got linebackers wearing
my number (9). I was hoping they would retire it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who wants a recount?: The Omaha (Neb.) World Herald polled
1,018 Nebraskans last week, asking whether they supported
Cornhuskers coach Frank Solich. Result: 82 percent were behind him.
The poll, however, was taken before Texas defeated Nebraska 20-16,
snapping the Huskers' home winning streak at 47.
</P>
<P>
   __ These are experts?: Rutgers coach Terry Shea was reminded
earlier this week Sports Illustrated picked the Scarlet Knights No.
112 among the 112 Division I-A teams in a preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, now 4-4 after beating Temple last week, was 0-11 a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sports Illustrated were so sharp, why can't they pick the
No. 1 team every year, and they consistently don't,'' Shea said.
``So, what makes them think they can pick the last team?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready and waiting: Successors are already being mentioned for
embattled Oklahoma coach John Blake. They include Ole Miss coach
Tommy Tuberville, ex-Auburn coach Terry Bowden, Northwestern coach
Gary Barnett, Texas Christian coach Dennis Franchione and former
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz. &QL; 
SCOTT WOLF'S TOP 10
</P>
<P>
   __ 1. Ohio State (8-0): Now Buckeyes admit they were irked over
initial BCS rankings.
</P>
<P>
   __ 2. Tennessee (7-0): Power rating takes weekend off against
Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   __ 3. Kansas State (8-0): Neuheisel says K-State as good as any
team in nation, including alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   __ 4. UCLA (7-0): Gee, look. Rest of country finally caught up
with our ranking of Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   __ 5. Florida State (8-1): On neutral field, oddsmakers would
favor 'Noles over any team.
</P>
<P>
   __ 6. Florida (7-1): Rout Georgia, and hurl insults from
sidelines in closing minutes. Nice.
</P>
<P>
   __ 7. Wisconsin (8-0): Little indignation from this unbeaten
team about poll status.
</P>
<P>
   __ 8. Texas A&AMP;M (8-1): Did we already mention this is not
stellar year to be in top 10?
</P>
<P>
   __ 9. Penn State (6-1): Welcome to top 10. Have fun on trip to
Ann Arbor. See you next week?
</P>
<P>
   __ 10. Syracuse (5-2): Major bowl hopes could be sabotaged by
sulking West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   __ Five more to watch: 11. Virginia (7-1); 12. Notre Dame (6-1);
13. Arizona (8-1); 14. Tulane (7-0); 15. Michigan (6-2).
</P>
<P>
   THE LIST: Texas became the first unranked team to win at
Nebraska since Missouri won there in 1978. The victory ended
Nebraska's winning streak at home at 47. Since 1980, here are the
teams that have won in Lincoln:
</P>
<P>
   1980 No. 16 Florida State 18-14
</P>
<P>
   1980 No. 9 Oklahoma 21-17
</P>
<P>
   1981 No. 3 Penn State 30-24
</P>
<P>
   1984 No. 4 Oklahoma 17-7
</P>
<P>
   1985 No. 17 Florida State 17-13
</P>
<P>
   1986 No. 3 Oklahoma 20-17
</P>
<P>
   1987 No. 2 Oklahoma 17-7
</P>
<P>
   1990 No. 9 Colorado 27-12
</P>
<P>
   1991 No. 4 Washington 36-21
</P>
<P>
   SAY WHAT?: ``We've lost two in a row. I'm grouchy. I'm out of my
comfort zone. I don't like talking to you. I don't like talking to
my wife, let alone the team, if that's what you want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia coach Don Nehlen, asked if he's comfortable with
the Mountaineers' recent performance.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BUY: No. 12 Virginia (7-1) at No. 6 Florida State (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   This is the roughest rivalry in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Virginia tagged the Seminoles with their first ACC defeat in 1995,
and lost 31-24 at FSU two years ago _ the Seminoles' smallest home
margin of victory since joining the league in 1992. Unfortunately
for the Cavs, none of this matters, because Florida State is
probably the best team in the country today.

</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference between Denver (no. 1) and Minnesota (2), and a much
smaller difference between Oakland (3) and San Francisco (4).

   ELN-ASSESS (Undated) _ News analysis: The presidential campaign
of 2000 begins, like it or not. The millennial election will be
fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines, if not

ailing Democrats. By R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   ELN-DEMOCRATS (Undated) _ Politicians and strategists in both

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

have begun to demand that he open the monetary spigot to speed up
economic growth and create jobs. By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic has been sent to NYT graphic clients.)

<P>
   ELN-BANKING (Washington) _ The defeat of Alfonse D'Amato means
that Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican with a combative streak,
is expected to become the next chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, a prospect that is sending shivers through many on Wall
Street and in the financial services industry. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-BROWSER (Washington) _ Microsoft Corp. was so
threatened by Netscape Communications Corp.'s domination of
Internet software that in early 1997 its senior executives wanted
to delay an upgrade of Microsoft's Windows operating system _ the
engine that fuels computer and software sales _ to give the company
an edge in the browser battle, according to internal Microsoft
documents released this week by the government. By Steve Lohr.

<P>
   CHINA-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ With a Chinese company set to
default on a foreign bond payment for the first time since

looming credit crunch could weaken China's immunity to the
financial turmoil that has already hit most of its Asian neighbors.
By Joseph Kahn.

divisions. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   (Scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET.)
</P>
<P>
   DEFLATION-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ The experts who have been
dwelling on the imminence of deflation can point to no data showing
that prices are generally falling. Nor can they point to evidence
that across-the-board price cutting is likely to break out in the
future. Most important, deflation has not reached the all-important
sinews of labor markets. By Michael M. Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CULTURE (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GONE-WITH-THE-WIND (Undated) _ For several years St. Martin's
Press and the trustees who control the rights ``to protect and
exploit'' the imperishable ``Gone With the Wind'' have been
hungering for a chance to do a second sequel to the novel. That's
been no secret, but the stunning coup they believed they were going
to pull off is to enlist the talented best-selling novelist Pat
Conroy, who very much wants to write the book. By Martin Arnold.

hour's drive north of New York. He bought the house on the spot,
and lived there until he died in 1990. Now, thanks to an unusual

Copland's estate, and Cortlandt, a town of 38,000 in upper
Westchester County, other composers will be able to live and work

   Britain: Support for Marriage
</P>
<P>
   LONDON: Saying it hoped to provoke ``a great national debate''
about the family's role in Britain, the government introduced
proposals to encourage marriage and bolster family life. They
include making prenuptial agreements about property legally
binding; ending ``quickie'' weddings by introducing a 15-day
waiting period between registering and getting married, and
improving mediation services for couples having difficulties. The
Conservative Party said the proposals would introduce ``an
unprecedented level of intrusion into family life.''

   The United Nations says it has received $197 million from the
United States toward the arrears that Washington owes the
organization. The payment will insure that the United States does
not lose its vote in the General Assembly on Jan. 1. It will also
reduce the U.N. operating deficit to around $50 million from $247
million, but it will not dent the overall American debt very much:
That will still stand at $1.28 billion at the beginning of the new

   Canada: Tension With Israel Rises
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic tensions between Canada and Israel have resurfaced
with a televised news report charging that Israeli agents are still
using Canadian passports for covert operations. After Israeli
agents were caught in Jordan in September 1997 using Canadian
documents in a failed attempt to kill a militant Palestinian,
Israel promised to end the practice. But Leslie Lewis, a Canadian
who also holds Israeli citizenship, told Canada's CTV News that
Israeli agents asked for his passport as recently as February.
Canadian and Israeli officials deny the allegation.

MCCARTHY, ROOKIE NO MORE, IS RE-ELECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Winning an election as a Democrat is never
easy in Mineola, the front yard of the Nassau County Republican
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn McCarthy pulled it off smashingly two years ago, beating
Rep. Daniel Frisa, a Republican, by 16 percentage points. She was a
political phenomenon, crusading for gun control after her husband
was killed in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shootings.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, however, despite a glowing television movie,
broadcast in May, about her transformation from housewife and nurse
to congresswoman, the spotlight had largely shifted away from Rep.
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rallied around Gregory Becker, an eight-term state
Assemblyman who proved to be a tireless candidate. And Ms.
McCarthy, no longer a blank slate, had a record to defend,
including a vote against a ban on late-term abortions that had
infuriated opponents of abortion rights in her district.
</P>
<P>
   In New York's only closely fought House race Tuesday, Ms.
McCarthy, 54, held off Becker by a slim margin, 53 percent to 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy, who spent Wednesday morning calling four dozen
supporters, doing two loads of wash and vacuuming the house she
shares with her brother, said that Becker, 44, had been a ``much
more credible candidate'' than Frisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was everywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker was aggressive, poking at Ms. McCarthy's celebrity status
by dubbing her a ``media star'' and deriding her in television
advertisements as too liberal for her district.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy, meanwhile, trumpeted her efforts to require
child-proof trigger locks on handguns, to improve the recruitment
and training of teachers, and her success at obtaining $7 million
to upgrade the water supply in Hempstead Village.
</P>
<P>
   One issue on which Becker did not attack Ms. McCarthy was her
vote in the House in favor of beginning an inquiry on the
impeachment of President Clinton. Ms. McCarthy, who remains a
registered Republican, was New York's lone Democratic
representative to vote for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sabbeth, the Democratic county chairman, said that many
voters had called to protest, but that a recorded message from the
president in support of Ms. McCarthy, played in automated phone
calls to every registered Democrat in her district, appeared to
have reassured the doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, whose mother was hospitalized for an aneurysm Sunday,
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mondello, the Nassau Republican leader, praised Becker
for taking on Ms. McCarthy in what he said was always a long shot,
and for which Becker had to relinquish his Assembly seat after 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Mondello said Becker's attacks on Ms. McCarthy may have hurt
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to hear more about the issues, about records and
qualifications, and a little bit less name-calling,'' Mondello
said. ``It completely obliterated all of the important things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabbeth said the Democrats had misjudged the challenge to Ms.
McCarthy. ``There was a lot taken for granted,'' he said. ``Last
time, we were busing union members in from all over. It was
door-to-door combat. This time, she was never considered in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, campaign workers and money went to other
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment to Carolyn McCarthy is that she will never win
by such a close margin, ever again,'' Sabbeth said.

ROOKIE LUE GETS IN WORK WHERE HE CAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rookie point guard Tyronn Lue's NBA debut looked
promising Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   A few points, some nifty passing, aggressive on the fast break.
All in all, a good start on the day of the Los Angeles Lakers' 1998
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that opener, against the Minnesota Timberwolves, was
canceled, along with 10 other games on night two of the season that
isn't. As the NBA lockout went through its 127th day _ with labor
talks breaking down after only two hours _ Lue watched the start of
his Lakers career get pushed back again.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of displaying his talents for the Forum faithful
Wednesday night, Lue had to ply his skills in the old men's gym at
UCLA _ dishing to Brent Barry and Tracy Murray instead of Eddie
Jones and Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Lue displayed the quickness and passing skills that prompted the
Lakers to acquire him from Denver in a draft-night trade for Nick
Van Exel. But Lue, working out daily at UCLA, clearly is missing
the benefits of a coaching staff and a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need all the help I can get. The lockout really hurt me,
being a rookie,'' Lue said after 90 minutes of pickup games with a
handful of other unemployed players. ``Coming in, I (expected to
be) learning some things from Eddie Jones and (Derek) Fisher, coach
Del (Harris), just trying to fit in and learn my role. So the
lockout really hurts, because I don't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   And things only got worse Wednesday morning. While Lue was
getting impromptu lessons on the pick-and-roll from former Clipper
Barry, the NBA and players union were holding fruitless
negotiations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the shortest since the lockout began July 1, and
afterward, commissioner David Stern blamed agents _ specifically
David Falk and L.A.-based Arn Tellem _ for holding up the process
to protect superstar salaries.
</P>
<P>
   No further talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Lue, expected to back up Fisher, is trying make the best use of
the down time. He worked out at home in Missouri for a while and
later joined friend Chauncey Billups of the Toronto Raptors in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago he decided the best place to learn was here, so he
moved to Culver City and started playing at UCLA. It's paid off in
the form of tutoring from Fisher, as well as veterans like Barry,
Pooh Richardson and Darrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all try to help me and try to teach me all they can,
because the lockout's going on, and I ain't getting no help from
anyone else,'' he said. ``I know I need a lot of work, so I'm
working as hard as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an NBA paycheck, Lue's living off a bank line of credit
and an endorsement deal with Converse.
</P>
<P>
   When and if the lockout is settled, he'll be among the first to
get a rookie contract of four to five years instead of the current
three-year deal. That's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be better for me to sign a long-term, because
I would love to have a chance to play for the Lakers for five years
anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he'd just settle for a chance to step out on the Forum
floor in his new purple-and-gold jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe the feeling that I have, but I'm anxious to
do it,'' he said of his eventual debut. ``I'm like in awe until I
actually play that first game.... But I just can't really imagine
myself being out there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the current state of NBA affairs, he's not alone in that
sentiment.

VOTER TURNOUT HITS 24-YEAR LOW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Voter turnout in Los Angeles County plummeted to
its lowest level in at least 24 years and political analysts said
Wednesday that one reason is turned-off Republican voters stayed
home.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout Tuesday was 47.6 percent of 3.8 million registered
voters, down more than 10 points from the 1994 gubernatorial
election, and more than 30 points since 1966, according to the
county Registrar-Recorder's Office. In eight gubernatorial
elections since then, voter turnout never dipped below 55 percent,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   No official breakdown of turnout by party affiliation was
available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts from both major political parties said
their research showed Republicans were uninspired by lackluster
campaigns by gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren and U.S. Senate
contender Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento political analyst Tony Quinn said statistical models
based on partisan turnout at previous elections suggest that
Republicans largely sat this one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans didn't vote,'' said Quinn, who has worked for the
Republican Party. ``They were turned off by negative campaign ads
of Boxer and Davis, and the fact that Lungren and Fong didn't
answer them adequately. That just killed the Republican turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Party campaign adviser Bob Mulholland said
the Democratic Party brought out its own faithful and planted
enough doubts about Republican candidates to keep the Grand Old
Party's supporters at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic turnout was very, very high,'' he said. ``I
think the meanness of Dan Lungren demoralized and reduced
Republican turnout. He looked mean on TV and he had extreme
positions on education, assault weapons, choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Steinberg, a Republican political strategist, said
Lungren, like Fong, did not inspire enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think he really connected with the electorate,''
Steinberg said. ``There was no theme. He alluded to Ronald Reagan
but the fact was that Republican voters did not see him as another
Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   And Davis didn't compel negative votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't feel threatened by Gray Davis,'' Steinberg said.
``He was not seen as a far-left radical. Davis seemed to project
moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Madrid, political director of the California Republican
Party, acknowledged that the state campaigns failed to articulate a
compelling message, but suggested that instead of staying home,
some Republican voters switched sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of voter turnout, you're seeing Republican voters
turning out in higher numbers than Democrats,'' Madrid said. ``The
problem was they weren't voting for Republican candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among voters interviewed at San Fernando Valley polling
places, most said they turned out to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans have gotten away with murder and it's
time we took over,'' said Martha Goldberg, 81, a resident of the
Jewish Homes for the Aging in the suburban Los Angeles community of
Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, like other Democratic voters, defied pundits'
predictions that the Clinton sex scandal would kill the party's
turnout this year. To the contrary, Democratic voters said, the
pending impeachment hearings prodded them to show support for their
party.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Humphries, 29, of Winnetka in the suburban San Fernando
Valley said she turned out to vote on several propositions, ``and
also to get the Democrats back in power so we can keep our
president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Quinn and Madrid said Clinton's troubles had a net neutral
effect, Steinberg said the pending impeachment hearings might have
backfired on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple of months I've been in e-mail predicting to many
of my colleagues that the so-called Republican bump in turnout
because of the Clinton factor would never materialize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, Democrats did not turn out to be demoralized, but
instead were motivated against the Republicans.''

ALFRED BINGHAM, 93, DIES; ONCE-RADICAL INTELLECTUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a well-born, well-heeled radical who
made a broken field run through 20th century intellectual history,
coming of age as a rock-ribbed Republican in the 1920s, veering
left in the 1930s as a leader of the quest for an American-style
collectivism, then returning to the capitalist fold in the 1940s as
a straight-ticket Democrat, died on Monday at his home in Clinton,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He was 93, and as an author and founder of the journal Common
Sense had written extensively about once burning social, political
and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of 60 years, the often fervid debates among
leftist intellectuals of the 1930s can seem quaint. But then it is
easy to forget what a shattering impact the Depression had on the
credibility of capitalism and how attractive the promise of
socialism could seem in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the forces of ferment of the 1930s, it would be hard to
imagine a less likely radical than Bingham. A Mayflower descendant
whose grandfather and great-grandfathers, both named Hiram Bingham,
were prominent Protestant missionaries in the Pacific, he was the
son of Hiram Bingham III, an explorer and historian who discovered
the Incan ruins at Machu Picchu in Peru, taught Latin American
history at Yale, then entered Connecticut Republican politics with
such a flourish that within one 24-hour period in 1925 he served as
lieutenant governor and governor and began an eight-year stint as
an ultra conservative U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   For all the missionary zeal and adventurism he inherited from
his father, Bingham did even better by his mother, Alfreda
Mitchell, a granddaughter of Charles Tiffany, the founder of the
Fifth Avenue store, whose wealth, as Bingham documented in a
privately published 1995 book, helped seed generations of Bingham
enterprises, including the political career of his younger brother
Jonathan, who was a longtime Democratic representative from the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, who was born in New Haven, Conn., as the second of
seven sons and grew up in an imposing house on Prospect Avenue,
attended Groton, then Yale and its law school, where what he once
described as his smug Republicanism began to unravel. Fired with a
democratic zeal by two of his law professors, Felix Frankfurter and
William Douglas, Bingham shelved his law degree and worked briefly
at a series of menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, financed by his Tiffany grandmother, he set off on a
two-year world tour, using family connections to gain interviews
with Mussolini, Gandhi and other world leaders and paying a visit
to the Soviet Union, where he was impressed by the apparent success
of the first Five Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the United States in 1932, Bingham plunged almost
immediately into radical politics. Settling in New York, he founded
Common Sense, a militant journal whose slogan, ``production for use
not for profit,'' underscored its stated belief that ``the
capitalist system cannot be saved and is not worth saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, who saw the journal becoming the organ of a militant
new third party, advocated a cooperative, planned and classless
society that, with appropriate taxation, nationalization of banks
and the like, would, he insisted, assure an average American family
an annual income of $5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If his stance seems quixotic, hewas in good company. The
magazine's contributors included James Agee, Upton Sinclair, John
Dos Passos, John Dewey, Theodore Dreiser, Edmund Wilson, and the
governors of Wisconsin, Philip La Follette, and Minnesota, Floyd
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the man who discovered Machu Picchu was hardly a
rolltop desk liberal. In one celebrated incident early in 1934, he
was bodily ejected from the Waldorf-Astoria's elegant Empire Room
after trying to give a speech to diners in support of striking
waiters and kitchen workers. Later that year, defying an edict by
Mayor Frank Hague that there be no peaceful demonstrations in
Jersey City, N.J., he was arrested while picketing in support of
striking furniture workers there. His swift conviction was later
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For Bingham, who served as an officer of the Farmer-Labor
Political Federation and the American Civil Liberties Union and
turned out three books, it was a heady decade, but with the
outbreak of World War II he reconciled himself to the two-party
system. Repairing to the Bingham family's ancestral home in Salem,
Conn., he reinvented himself as a New Deal Democrat and rode the
Roosevelt coattails to victory in 1940 for what turned out to be a
single term in the State Senate.
</P>
<P>
   After writing three more books and serving in the Army in World
War II, he became a lawyer in Connecticut, but continued his
interest in politics. Among other things, he helped to found the
state chapter of Americans for Democratic Action in 1947, made a
failed bid for Congress in 1952 and held a series of offices in
Salem, including probate judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, at the age of 81, the radical old war horse was stirred
anew when a son, Stephen, a young lawyer, was accused of smuggling
a pistol used in a fatal, failed prison break, to a San Quentin
inmate, George Jackson. After 11 years as a fugitive, the younger
Bingham turned himself in and was acquitted at trial, but not
before his father had spent what was described as the bulk of his
fortune on legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his first wife, Sylvia Knox, in 1981, he
married Katherine Stryker Dunn. He began spending much of his time
at her home in Clinton while continuing his writing, including a
1989 biography of his father.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife and son, who now lives in San Rafael,
Calif., Bingham is survived by a daughter, Alfreda Shapere of
Salem; two other sons, Christopher of St. Paul, Minn. and Douglas
of Edmonton, Alberta, and five granchildren.

ALEKSANDR BOGATYREV, A DIRECTOR AND FORMER STAR OF BOLSHOI BALLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aleksandr Bogatyrev, a former star of the Bolshoi Ballet who was
its acting artistic director until this spring, died in Moscow on
Oct. 11. He was 49 and lived in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, friends in New York said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatyrev won the admiration of U.S. ballet fans in the 1970s
and '80s with a noble classical image that differed from the more
heroic one typically projected by the Bolshoi's male dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the Bolshoi Ballet
school in 1968 and joined the company in 1969. The same year he won
a bronze medal at the first International Ballet Competition in
Moscow. In 1976, he was awarded first prize at the International
Ballet Competition in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatyrev appeared as Siegfried in ``Swan Lake'' for the first
time in 1971. When this ballet and other classics, including
``Raymonda'' were later restaged in new versions by Yuri
Grigorovich, the troupe's artistic director, Bogatyrev danced the
principal male role. He was in the original cast of Grigorovich's
rechoreographed ``Romeo and Juliet'' (1979) and retired as a
performer in the Bolshoi in 1989 to continue teaching at Gitis, the
government arts institute.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, he partnered the major Bolshoi ballerinas,
Maya Plisetskaya, Yekaterina Maksimova, Natalya Bessmertnova and
Ludmila Semenyaka.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatyrev made his U.S. debut in 1975 with the Bolshoi. He also
performed in Boston at the 1988 Russian Festival of Music and
Dance, where he danced in ``The Sea Gull,'' choreographed by Ms.
Plisetskaya. In 1989, he toured the country with a group headed by
Vladimir Vasiliev and Ms. Maksimova.
</P>
<P>
   Vasiliev, currently director of the entire Bolshoi theater,
named Bogatyrev acting artistic director of the ballet troupe
two-and-a-half years ago but officially appointed a younger dancer,
Aleksei Fadeyechev, as artistic director last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bogatyrev is survived by his wife, Galina, a former dancer in
the Bolshoi, and a son, Vladimir.

U.S. INDICTMENT: `DETONATED AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BOMB-INDICT) 
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the indictment returned Wednesday in
a U.S. District Court in New York against the Saudi exile, Osama
bin-Laden:
</P>
<P>
   At all relevant times from, in or about 1989 until the date of
the filing of this indictment, an international terrorist group
existed which was dedicated to opposing non-Islamic governments
with force and violence. This organization grew out of the
``mekhtab al khidemat'' (the ``Services Office'') organization
which had maintained offices in various parts of the world,
including Afghanistan, Pakistan (particularly in Peshawar) and the
United States, particularly at the Alkifah Refugee Center in
Brooklyn, N.Y. The group was founded by defendants Osama bin Laden
and Muhammad Atef, a.k.a ``Abu Hafs al-Masry,'' together with ``Abu
Ubaidah al-Banshiri'' and others. From in or about 1989 until the
present, the group called itself ``Al Qaeda''' (``the Base''). From
1989 until in or about 1991, the group (hereafter referred to as
``Al Qaeda'') was headquartered in Afghanistan and Peshawar,
Pakistan. In or about 1991, the leadership of Al Qaeda, including
its ``emir'' (or prince) defendant Osama bin Laden, relocated to
Sudan. Al Qaeda was headquartered in the Sudan from approximately
1991 until approximately 1996 but still maintained offices in
various parts of the world. In 1996, defendants Osama bin Laden and
Muhammad Atef and other members of Al Qaeda relocated to
Afghanistan. At all relevant times, Al Qaeda was led by its emir,
defendant Osama bin Laden. Members of Al Qaeda pledged an oath of
allegiance (called a ``bayat'') to defendant Osama bin Laden and Al
Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   Al Qaeda opposed the United States for several reasons. First,
the United States was regarded as an `infidel'' because it was not
governed in a manner consistent with the group's extremist
interpretation of Islam. Second, the United States was viewed as
providing essential support for other ``infidel'' governments and
institutions, particularly the governments of Saudi Arabia and
Egypt, the nation of Israel and the United Nations organization,
which were regarded as enemies of the group. Third, Al Qaeda
opposed the involvement of the United States armed forces in the
[Persian) gulf war in 1991 and in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia
in 1992 and 1993, which were viewed by Al Qaeda as pretextual
preparations for an American occupation of Islamic countries. In
particular, Al Qaeda opposes the continued presence of American
military forces in Saudi Arabia (and elsewhere on the Saudi Arabian
peninsula) following the gulf war. Fourth, Al Qaeda opposed the
United States Government because of the arrest, conviction and
imprisonment of persons belonging to Al Qaeda or its affiliated
terrorist groups or with whom it worked, including Sheik Omar Abdel
Rahman.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal goals of Al Qaeda was to drive the United
States armed forces out of Saudi Arabia (and elsewhere on the Saudi
Arabian peninsula) and Somalia by violence. Members of Al Qaeda
issued fatwahs (rulings of Islamic law) indicating that such
attacks were both proper and necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Al Qaeda functioned both on its own and through some of the
terrorist organizations that operated under its umbrella,
including: the Al Jihad group based in Egypt, led by, among others,
Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, named as a co-conspirator but not as a
defendant herein; the Islamic Group (also known as ``El Gamaa
Islamia'' or simply ``Gamaa't''), led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman
and later by Ahmed Refai Taha, a.k.a. ``Abu Yasser al-Masri,''
named as co-conspirators but not as defendants herein; and a number
of jihad groups ... Osama bin Laden, the defendant, and Al Qaeda
also forged alliances with the National Islamic Front in the Sudan
and with representatives of the Government of Iran, and its
associated terrorist group Hezbollah, for the purpose of working
together against their perceived common enemies in the West,
particularly the United States ...
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3 and 4, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, persons who had
been trained by Al Qaeda (and by trainers trained by Al Qaeda)
participated in an attack on United States military personnel
serving in Somalia as part of Operation Restore Hope, which
resulted in the killing of 18 United States Army personnel ...
</P>
<P>
   On at least two occasions in the period from, in or about 1992
until in or about 1995, members of Al Qaeda transported weapons and
explosives from Khartoum in the Sudan to the coastal city of Port
Sudan for transshipment to the Saudi Arabian peninsula ...
</P>
<P>
   At various times from at least as early as 1993, Osama bin
Laden, the defendant, and others known and unknown, made efforts to
obtain the components of nuclear weapons ...
</P>
<P>
   At various times from at least as early as 1993, Osama bin
Laden, the defendant, and others know and unknown, made efforts to
obtain the components of chemical weapons ...
</P>
<P>
   On or about Aug. 7, 1998, in Nairobi, Kenya, and outside the
jurisdiction of any particular state of district, Osama bin Laden
... and others known and unknown ... together with other members of
Al Qaeda ... detonated an explosive device that damaged and
destroyed the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and as a
result of such conduct directly and proximately caused the deaths
of at least 213 persons ...
</P>
<P>
   On or about Aug. 7, 1998, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and
outside the jurisdiction of any particular state of district, Osama
bin Laden ... and others known and unknown ... together with other
members of Al Qaeda ... detonated an explosive device that damaged
and destroyed the United States Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
and as a result of such conduct directly and proximately caused the
deaths of at least 11 persons.

A NEW LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR INTRODUCES HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Mary Donohue, the lieutenant governor-elect,
campaigned in each of New York's 62 counties during the last six
months, she seemed unfazed by her own relative anonymity, not to
mention that of the office she sought.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before an audience of about 100 high school students
in Westchester County a week before the election, Ms. Donohue
didn't miss a beat when an elderly man raised his hand and asked
quite plainly, ``What is a lieutenant governor?''
</P>
<P>
   She patiently explained: ``The lieutenant governor has to
represent the governor wherever she goes. My goal as lieutenant
governor would be to work with the governor to implement his
policies across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gov. George Pataki's loud and embarrassing feud with the
departing lieutenant governor, Betsy McCaughey Ross, Ms. Donohue's
vision of being a team player seemed a prerequisite for being
chosen as a running mate. But her sex was also considered
fundamental, since after dumping Ms. McCaughey Ross, Pataki seemed
determined to replace her with another woman. (Ms. McCaughey Ross
ran against the governor on Tuesday, finishing fourth.)
</P>
<P>
   Although there were five women running for statewide office at
the beginning of this political season, Ms. Donohue, 51, will be
the only one to take office in January. She will assume the only
statewide post to have been held by a woman, but she and her two
female predecessors got there by running with a man.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Donohue, who was the first woman in Rensselaer County to
be elected district attorney in 1992 and to the state Supreme Court
in 1996, downplayed the importance of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always run on my credentials and I will match my
background against anyone else's,'' Ms. Donohue said, deliberately
steering clear of any comparisons with Ms. McCaughey Ross. ``I made
history as a female district attorney, and when I ran for the
Supreme Court, but as far as my experience as a female candidate,
I'm a candidate first and the female part doesn't figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is quick to say that among the sensibilities she will
bring to her new job are those of a working mother, in addition to
those of a former educator and a former law-enforcement official.
She has two children: Sara, 19, and Justin, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donohue, a New York state native, describes herself as ``a
late bloomer in terms of going into public service.'' She entered
law school when she was 33, after teaching in elementary and junior
high schools in Rensselaer and Albany County school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, she worked in the U.S. attorney's office in
Albany and on the staff of Joseph Bruno, the state Senate majority
leader. She then went into private law practice for a few years
before joining the Rensselaer County district attorney's office.
She was elected district attorney in 1992 and won a seat on the
state Supreme Court in 1996. She boasts of a 98 percent
felony-conviction rate as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   After turning to politics, Ms. Donohue quickly developed close
ties to the Republican Party through William Powers, the chairman
of the state party, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato _ ties that proved to
be career-enhancing. When she ran for the state Supreme Court in
1996, hers was one of a handful of state races that D'Amato
supported with money from the national Republican Senate Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no shortage of women running for statewide
office in recent years, the only two women who have won were Mary
Anne Krupsak, Gov. Hugh Carey's first lieutenant governor, and Ms.
McCaughey Ross. Both Ms. Krupsak and Ms. McCaughey Ross drew
attention because they wound up alienated from their bosses and
ultimately ran against them.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor has no official duties aside from
presiding over the state Senate, a largely ceremonial role, and
waiting for the opportunity to replace the governor if the governor
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lieutenant governor serves as a servant of the governor
and isn't entitled to anything except a gavel and a paycheck,''
said Norman Adler, a political consultant who has worked on the
campaigns of Democrats and Republicans. ``So it's been up to the
governor to decide: Do I use this running mate for some greater
good or do I just ignore this person once I'm in office?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The job has varied in the hands of recent lieutenant governors.
Malcolm Wilson was a confidant to Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and
replaced him when he resigned to become vice president. Mario Cuomo
traveled the state as Carey's lieutenant and parlayed that exposure
into his own successful bid for governor. But Ms. Krupsak and Ms.
McCaughey Ross clearly never became integral to their
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donohue seemed undaunted by the track record of her female
predecessors and said she anticipated a smooth relationship with
the governor because she fundamentally agrees with his
philosophies. She is a fiscal conservative who supports the death
penalty and favors abortion rights. She has said she opposes
Medicaid financing of abortions, but now quickly adds that she
``agrees with the way the governor dealt with the issue'' when he
included money in the state budget for Medicaid-financed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with Ms. McCaughey Ross' outspoken stance against
the Pataki administration, Ms. Donohue said that while she would
have no qualms disagreeing with the governor in private, publicly
she would always be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there; I've been an executive,'' she said. ``When I
was district attorney, I always welcomed input from the people who
worked for me, but I had to know that they would be comfortable
representing my philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined, however, to discuss what specific duties she might
take on as lieutenant governor, saying, ``That's a discussion for
the governor and me to have, and our discussions should be
private.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donohue also declined to seriously entertain the possibility
that she would be governor if Pataki were to run for national
office in 2000, as some of his aides have hinted. ``My commitment
is to doing the lieutenant governor's job in the most effective
way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krupsak, who lost her bid for governor in 1978 and has
retired to the state's Finger Lakes region, said she was heartened
to see that state politics had progressed since 1974, when, she
said, Democratic Party officials tried desperately to persuade her
not to run for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea what negotiations went on back then,'' said
Ms. Krupsak, who is now 66. ``The party offered me the nomination
for any other state office, because they were afraid I would pull
the ticket down because I was a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But the election results proved otherwise. ``So now,'' she said,
``you have candidates actually looking for women to help balance
the ticket.''

CSUN PRESIDENT PICKS UP THE PIECES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the wake of their leadership's forced
resignations, members of the Cal State Northridge athletic
department feel uncertain and vulnerable. University president
Blenda Wilson is doing her best to reassure them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried in every way I could (to tell the coaches) that we had
committed to a course, and the personal problems of one person in
our community do not derail us from that course,'' Wilson said on
Wednesday. ``I asked them, in fact, that they, too, need to make
sure the remainder of the community, internal and external,
understand they're committed to going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Paul Bubb and his top assistant, senior
associate athletic director Judy Brame, resigned under pressure
Tuesday, a week after women's basketball coach Michael Abraham was
arrested on federal drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   An internal CSUN investigation found both Bubb and Brame knew of
student suspicions nearly two years ago that Abraham might be using
drugs. Neither informed senior university officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have to be reconfirmed about our direction, and
selfishly, about our little world,'' football coach Ron Ponciano
said. ``What are we going to do in our sports, and is the
commitment still going to be there? And I assume it is. We need
confirmation about the progress (of the department) and about our
goals ... because my main link is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is expected to announce later in the week an interim
athletic director. Sources said men's basketball coach Bobby
Braswell is the leading candidate. The CSUN coaches, at the
suggestion of Wilson, voted in favor of endorsing Braswell as the
interim candidate at a department meeting Wednesday morning. Wilson
said she is considering candidates from inside and outside of the
athletic department. Those sources also said Brame, 58, will remain
a consultant for the athletic department through the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In whatever ways we can, we need to be reassuring,'' Wilson
said. ``We're going to try to keep close to the coaches and their
staffs because it's a blow to their internal unity. But there was
not a question, in my mind, of continuing the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson named second-year assistant Frozena Jerro the acting
women's basketball coach after the players voted for that to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in knowing they have the confidence in me to get this
done, it made me feel good,'' said Jerro, who began her coaching
career at the University of Houston in 1993. ``Things still haven't
settled down for me, but it's getting better. The kids are
confident we're going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said a national search will take place for a new coach,
but it was too early to say if the interim coach would be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro was the team's top assistant under Abraham, who was
charged by the FBI with conspiracy to distribute and possession
with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine. Abraham is
on paid administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said a national search to find a new athletic director
will begin as soon as a job description is outlined and a search
committee formed. She said she doesn't expect a new athletic
director to be in place until June.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, department business will be handled by the interim
AD in conjunction with Ron Kopita, the vice president of student
affairs. A number of head-coaching contracts expire on Jan. 1 and
June 1 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need reassurance, too,'' baseball coach Mike Batesole said.
``I'm not sure what's going on. We've been talking about my
contract since June. I've got a contract in my hand, but there's
some clauses I have questions about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got their individual stuff ... but we have to
focus on the department as a whole and the individual later.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignations take effect on Friday. Bubb, 41, is leaving the
university, for which he has worked since 1990. Brame, a tenured
professor, has been reassigned to an academic post in the
kinesiology department.

   Lee P. Gagliardi, a senior judge of the Federal District Court
for the Southern District of New York who presided over the
historic trial of two former Nixon Cabinet members, John Mitchell
and Maurice Stans, on criminal-conspiracy charges in 1974, died on
Friday at his home in Manchester, Vt. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Marian.
</P>
<P>
   The trial ended with the acquittal of both defendants on all
charges. It was the first trial of former Cabinet officials since
the Teapot Dome scandal in the 1920s, and it was the first time in
the country's history that two former Cabinet officials were tried
together.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had been attorney general, while Stans was secretary of
commerce. The two had also had been leaders of Nixon's 1972
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gagliardi (pronounced Gal-YAR-dee), a native of Larchmont, N.Y.,
became a senior judge in 1983. A Nixon nominee, he became a judge
in Federal District Court for New York's Southern District in
January 1972. He had spent relatively little time on the bench when
he presided over the 48-day trial. But before becoming a judge he
was a trial lawyer in New York for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   He got the Mitchell-Stans trial assignment when his name was
picked at random in 1973. The defendants were charged with
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury. The government
contended that they had tried to impede a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation of Robert Vesco, a financier, in return
for a secret contribution of $200,000 in cash that Vesco made to
Nixon's 1972 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell-Stans trial was the first trial of defendants who
had been high-ranking Nixon administration officials who had at
least a tenuous link with the Watergate scandal. The verdict
temporarily heartened the White House, where Nixon was the target
of a House impeachment inquiry _ arising from Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1975 Mitchell was found guilty of conspiracy, obstruction
of justice and perjury and served 19 months behind bars. And in the
same year Stans pleaded guilty to five charges of violating
campaign-finance laws and was fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming a senior judge, Gagliardi sat regularly in courts
in New York and in Vermont and Florida. He continued that judicial
work until until early this year.
</P>
<P>
   He was born and raised in Larchmont and graduated from Williams
College. After serving as a Navy officer, mostly on a destroyer in
the Atlantic, in World War II, he received a law degree in 1947
from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to spend 7 years as trial lawyer for the New York
Central Railroad and 16 years as the chief trial counsel in his
father's law firm. It came to be called Clark, Gagliardi &AMP; Miller
and is based in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife of 55 years, the former Marian Hope Selden, he
is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Tobin of Delmar, N.Y.; and
three sisters, Diana Collins of Carmel, N.Y., and Gloria Gagliardi
and Mary Ann Dugan, both of Fairfield, Conn., and four
grandchildren.

LENORE ZOLA, 91, ADVOCATE FOR ELDERLY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lenore Cahn Zola, whose aid to a relative she did not
know indirectly helped document the horrors of the Holocaust and
who became an advocate for the elderly and sick, died on Nov. 1 at
St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime member of Manhattan Community Board No. 2, she is
best known for the rescue of the Village Nursing Home, the only
home for the aged in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, state and city officials sought to close the 328-bed
home because of overcrowding, poor maintenance and other problems.
Mrs. Zola helped gather neighborhood petitions to stop the closing
and started a $275,000 fund-raising drive to take over and improve
the home. It is now a nonprofit center with 200 beds, a bigger
staff and a renovated building. ``Her philosophy was an involved
community is the best protection against abuse of the elderly,''
said Ann Wyatt, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zola and her first husband, Edmond Cahn, were also
instrumental in securing a scarce exit visa from Nazi Germany in
1937 for Albert Rosenberg, an 18-year-old second cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, now 81, recalled: ``My mother was desperate. The
doors were closing for those of us who were Jewish. She knew only
that some of her cousins had left Germany for York, Pa., and so she
wrote to the mayor of that town, who somehow found Lenore.'' The
couple agreed to provide a home for Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, while in Army intelligence, Captain Rosenberg led the
preparation of a 140-page report based on hundreds of interviews of
prisoners at Buchenwald, a Nazi concentration camp liberated by the
Allies. Known as the Buchenwald Report, it is considered an
important piece of contemporary documentation of the Holocaust. In
1997, it was published in paperback by Westview Press and its
manuscript was donated to the Holocaust Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zola was born Lenore Lebach in Manhattan on April 26, 1907.
After attending Barnard College for one year, she married Cahn, a
lawyer and later a constitutional law professor at New York
University, who died in 1964. In 1978, she married Albert Zola, a
dentist, who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, Edgar Cahn of Washington, and a
daughter, Mary Cahn Schwartz of Chevy Chase, Md., three
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

<P>
   Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections,
congressional Republicans tore into one another Wednesday over who
was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition
party gains in an off-year election.
</P>
<P>
   The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility of
congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results
showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45
hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the
president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it
whittled the Republican lead in the House down to 12 votes. The
Democratic victories were even more remarkable in a political year
marked by the months-long scandal over President Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat
leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, amounted
to the smallest congressional majority since the
Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans
controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   With attention now shifting to the House Judiciary Committee and
its impeachment inquiry, the committee chairman, Henry Hyde, told
fellow Republicans on the panel in a conference call Wednesday that
the only witness Republicans were likely to call would be
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. There were reports Wednesday
night that Hyde might call another witness, an expert on the
meaning of testifying under oath to help the committee in deciding
whether Clinton committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told lawmakers he hoped to have the committee vote on
possible articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving, an act that would
take the issue out of his hands and put it into Gingrich's.
Committee Democrats declined comment Wednesday until they could
discuss Hyde's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt
Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held
onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time
since the election of 1932. But furious rank and file Republicans
burned up the phone lines to each other, discussing whether to
mount leadership challenges in both chambers in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males
running the Washington Republican Party,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, a conservative from Florida. He said Republicans this
year had been left without any accomplishments to run on. ``We need
an agenda first of all,'' he said. ``We went an entire calendar
year without an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate from Connecticut called the
election a devastating loss and said simply, ``There are going to
be major changes in our leadership. All segments of our party want
to see change.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton called the election results a
vindication of his party's policies. ``If you look at all the
results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous. The American
people want their business, their concerns, their children, their
families, their future addressed here. That's what the message of
the election was.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first difficult questions now facing Congress is how
to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public
resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican
majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes
required for impeachment cannot be assembled. In a statement
released Wednesday, Hyde said: ``The committee continues to have a
clear constitutional duty to complete its work in a fair and
expeditious manner. Our duty has not changed because the
Constitution has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the election results
guaranteed that impeachment would fail. ``I think any serious
effort to remove President Clinton from office is effectively
over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island
Republican, said, ``The inquiry should be wrapped up expeditiously,
fairly and it ought to be resolved in the immediate future.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Republicans struggled to keep control of the
House with a 228-206 majority and to find consensus among their
party's competing factions. With their newly reduced numbers, the
Republican leadership will need to carry out a tortuous balancing
act to unite a hard-core conservative faction wanting a more
aggressive social agenda with a bloc of moderates who want to
return to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Any small GOP faction will now have enormous leverage. The new
arithmetic of the House may even lead to Democrats' and moderate
Republicans' forming majorities on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Already seeing some of the possibilities, Rep. Peter King of
Long Island, N.Y., said northeastern Republicans would be
strengthened. ``It gives us much more leverage with the leadership
and makes it easier to protect New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Gingrich had foreseen election gains ranging
from 10 seats to more than 40. Seeming uncertain Wednesday, he said
he had trouble accounting for the results.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Two steps forward and one step back are often a natural part of the
bargaining process.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association have
apparently ignored the part about forward progress in their
negotiations as they attempt to hammer out a new
collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of backward steps occurred Wednesday,
when the owners and the players' union broke off talks _ or shouts,
if some reports are correct _ after only two hours and retired
until perhaps Friday, when the union may pitch its latest proposal
to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just sitting around the table, I guess both of us
somewhat stymied, not knowing which way to move next,'' said union
director Billy Hunter. ``We just thought it might be better to go
back to our respective offices and look at where we were. If we
think it's appropriate, we will talk about getting together on
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, more than four months into the lockout that has caused the
NBA to cancel regular-season games for the first time, the two
sides were confused as to ``which way to move next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot longer than we thought it would take
to make this deal,'' said NBA commissioner David Stern. ``There may
not be a deal here to be had.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody surprised at this turn of events hasn't been paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing apparently moving forward is the lockout, which
was imposed July 1 because league owners felt they were shelling
out too much for player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue remains the percentage of basketball-related
income that will be divided between the owners and the union. The
players want 60 percent of the revenue, and the owners, who claim
they gave out 57 percent last season, are offering a 50-50 split.
Neither side is budging, regardless of how long it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've found out is that the longer it takes now, the
longer it's going to take to get this NBA off the ground again,''
said San Antonio's Avery Johnson. ``Maybe if we had gotten a deal
done Oct. 15, it probably would have taken two or three weeks (to
get the season up and running). But now, it might take five weeks
just to get everything going, and that's just unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, describing himself as ``more pessimistic than ever''
concerning negotiations, hinted Wednesday that union leadership,
spurred by high-profile agents like David Falk and Arn Tellem, may
be keeping from its membership the details of the league's
bargaining proposal, a proposal owners feel may benefit between
``80 and 90 percent'' of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Falk represents union president Patrick Ewing, vice presidents
Juwan Howard, Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning, and Michael
Jordan, a group that is among the league's salary elite. It was
Falk who announced earlier this week, ``I've got the power to
combat whatever starvation tactics the league employs,'' a comment
that irked Stern and the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, with good reason, that the agents for players who
would be most affected by the high-end limitations have begun a
campaign to defeat any fair deal,'' Stern said. ``Their view is
that no matter how good the deal may be for 400 players, it won't
be allowed to fly if the top 30 can't have the ability to receive
unlimited amounts (of money).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that this entire arrangement and deal will be
held hostage by that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk was amused by the attention being paid to his comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered they think I'm running the union, but clearly
what David Stern is trying to do is tactically divide us _ the
agents from the players, the high-salaried players from the middle
class,'' Falk said. ``This should be a wake-up call to the union to
stay unified and not let them divide us.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley said it was the inflexibility of the owners, not
big-time agents and players, that was the key factor in delaying
any kind of agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners have never been fair (in the current
negotiations),'' Barkley said. ``Just look at the negative offer
they made to us. It is the same deal, three times. The only thing
that got us close to a discussion was the proposal we came up with
(a luxury tax on superstar salaries). They (the owners) never came
up with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up with the same deal three times, (saying) take it
or leave it. They're caught between a rock and a hard place. They
felt like we (the union) would fold, but we haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern disagrees, and in what he called an effort to get the
details of the owners' proposal out to the union rank and file, he
announced a change in lockout policy, saying the league will soon
authorize teams to respond to players who contact them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point with the season basically or potentially
hanging in the balance, we are going to notify our teams (to)
designate one person (who) understands the proposal (who) will be
able to talk to players who call and ask questions,'' Stern said.
``But it is important that this not be viewed as either undermining
the union or disparaging our players, because that is the last
thing that we're interested in doing here. We want a strong union
to make this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's aborted bargaining session ensured that yet another
week will be knocked off the schedule, meaning the season is
inching ever closer to being wiped out entirely, even though Stern
would not set an absolute date as to when the season would be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to answer that with precision right now,'' Stern
said. ``I told the owners at the (Board of Governors) meeting last
week that I was prepared to hold that decision and bring it back to
them as to when we could no longer play a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have my own views, but the more I thought about it, I
think that has to be a group decision. Obviously, there's a date,
and there may even be a difference of opinion among the owners on
that. I'll share my view with them at that time. I've decided that
(setting a cancellation date) sounds too much like a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose the season, it will be a disaster for the players,
a disaster for the owners and a disaster for everyone associated
with the game _ period.''
</P>
<P>
   Players around the league were not surprised by Wednesday's
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a bad day,'' said Denver's Nick Van Exel. ``A real
bad one, man. Both sides can't come up with an agreement, because
we're not even close. Looking at the statements, no one wants to
budge.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not, and Hakeem Olajuwon finds such a stance
confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see that in this situation, everybody loses,'' Olajuwon
said. ``I think the sooner both parties realize that we need to
come back, then they would sit down and compromise. That's how it
is going to be anyway, so before it gets any worse, both parties,
players and owners, need to sit down and compromise and make it
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this (the uncertainty concerning the season)
is scary, because we're not the first (league) to do that. I would
think that we would be smart enough to learn from other people's
mistakes _ from baseball, from football. Evidently, though, we're
not.''

 UNDATED: the results.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Things were happening out there that none of us fully
understand--neither party in my judgment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking his share of the blame for his party's losses, the
Georgia Republican said he had misjudged how the public would
recoil from the Clinton scandal and how the scandal would drown out
other Republican themes. ``I mean I totally underestimated the
degree to which people would just get sick of 24-hour-a day talk
television and talk radio and then the degree to which this whole
scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer repetition,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a result I think we probably underestimated the need to
really aggressively push a much stronger message about cutting
taxes and saving Social Security, winning the war on drugs,
reforming education and national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted
mistakes, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message
in the final 96 hours of the campaign. He also conceded that
Congress' final scramble to pass a $500 billion budget bill hurt
his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of this lessons for Republicans out of this is that we
need to listen more carefully to the people and we need to have a
clear understanding and concise message that we do apply across the
nation,'' he said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lott and Gingrich said Republicans would put an emphasis on
tax-cutting and shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the two leaders spoke, angry rank-and-file lawmakers
were making phone calls trying to assess whether to mount
challenges against the Republican leaders who have steered the
Congress since the Republican's assumed control four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican staffer said the House had become a
``tinderbox'' of intrigue. Scarborough said, ``The long distance
charges in Washington offices probably are going through the roof
today. Everybody's calling everybody. Everybody recognizes that
something's terribly wrong with the direction of Washington
Republicans when Republican governors are doing so well in New
York, Massachusetts, Florida and Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has faced down an uprising before, foiling a coup
attempt against him by disgruntled conservatives and some of his
own leadership team in the summer of 1997. Any move to remove him
remains a long shot. But with House leadership elections now set
for mid-November, Republicans said this time the dissatisfaction in
their caucus had crossed ideological lines to moderates like Shays
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got shellacked,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, a
conservative from Utah. ``We beat ourselves because we had no
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were discussing possible challenges to Gingrich, his
second-in-command, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, and other members of
the senior leadership team. Some were envisioning trying to run an
entire new ticket headed by Rep. Bob Livingston, the Appropriations
Committee chairman from Louisiana and including Rep. Steve Largent,
an Oklahoma conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Tuesday's election results could cost him the
speakership, Gingrich said, ``I'm not particularly concerned.''
Republicans close to him said they expected the anger to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where leadership races take place in early
December, some Republicans were talking of mounting challenges
against mid-level leadership figures.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators expressed particular pique toward the
re-election chairman, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who poured
party dollars and much of his own time into trying to defeat the
Democratic champion of campaign finance overhaul, Russell Feingold
of Wisconsin. Feingold won in a close race.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on Wednesday approached Sen. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska to see if he would replace McConnell. Hagel confirmed he
had talked to more than eight senators, and was considering whether
to challenge McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel lambasted the Republican leadership for the election
outcome. ``This is a big loss for us,'' he said. ``We squandered a
very historic opportunity last night. To just break even is a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Most incumbents coasted to victory Tuesday night. But some will
not be returning. Five House Republicans were defeated: Vince
Snowbarger of Kansas, Bill Redmond of New Mexico, Jon Fox of
Pennsylvania, Mike Pappas of New Jersey, and Rick White of
Washington. One Democrat also lost his re-election bid _ Rep. Jay
Johnson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The new House members include 17 Republicans and at least 22
Democrats. David Wu, a Democrat was leading Molly Bordonaro, a
Republican in the race for one House seat in Oregon, but the final
victory announcement was not expected until Friday after absentee
ballots are counted.

   NEW YORK _ The Tree grows in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   For six decades, it has been the profoundly unknown, but
increasingly majestic, ornament of a small house on four acres of
land, buffeted by strong winds, covered with snow and garlanded in
ice.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it was trussed up by workers. Next week, it will
be felled and transported to the Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport, where Mayor Michael White will bid it farewell,
accompanied by the 100-member Kent State Marching Band.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after it is flown to New York on the world's largest cargo
plane, the 74-foot-tall, 7-ton Norway spruce will meet its fate as
the 66th Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tree is the first to originate in America's
heartland and the first to be flown to New York. Its location had
been a closely held secret until the requisite hoopla could be
generated. Now the Christmas countdown has started earlier than
ever, immediately after Election Day and fully three weeks before
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland? ``Actually, it's in a suburb of Cleveland,'' said
David Murbach, who hunted for the Tree for some three months as
manager of the gardens division at Rockefeller Center for Tishman
Speyer Properties, its owner. ``Last winter's ice storm forced us
to look rather far afield, and this was the most complex search
we've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the four-day freeze that began last Jan. 7, one
of the worst ice storms in New York state history. The disaster
destroyed two statuesque upstate trees that had been auditioning
for Rockefeller Center glory. Other contenders had their
ice-sheathed limbs sheared off, marring the symmetrical perfection
demanded of a tree that is annually witnessed by 13.5 million
holiday visitors.
</P>
<P>
   First George Steinbrenner III. Now the Tree. So what is it with
Cleveland then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, we always believe that the very best things are grown
here, and we're always happy to be able to help out New York,''
said White, the Cleveland mayor, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spruce destined to become America's most publicized
Christmas tree has been growing for the last 60 years on a former
farm in Richfield, Ohio, 16 miles from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our Christmas tree in 1938 or 1939,'' said Ethel
Szitar, 81, who, with her husband, Adolph, 80, owns the property
and the Tree, which stands before their one-story ranch house. ``I
remember that it was 4 feet high. We took the root ball outside and
planted it. I've watched it grow ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow their tree to become the Tree ``was a
matter of necessity,'' said Mrs. Szitar, a retired secretary for
the United Church of Christ in Richfield. ``The tree was getting
old and if the wind blew the wrong way, well, there goes our house.
We couldn't even think of the expense of cutting it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Center will pay for the Tree's removal and plant a
new Norway spruce in front of the Szitars' house. Mrs. Szitar and
her son, Richard, her daughter, Marianne Boylan, and three
grandchildren will be flown to New York for the tree-lighting
festivities. Adolph Szitar, a former carpenter who suffers from
Parkinson's disease, is not expected to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Szitars' tree will be flown to New York on an Antonov AN-124
(so designated because it has a 124-foot-long cargo hold). The
airlift was necessary because ``the spruce would be desiccated and
could be damaged by such a long drive,'' Murbach said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's a logistical nightmare to drive a 20-foot-wide
load on interstate highways at 25 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   After the tree is trucked from Kennedy International Airport to
Rockefeller Center next Thursday morning, it will be festooned with
26,000 lights linked by five miles of wire, and then lighted in a
ceremony on Dec. 2 (which, for the first time, will be televised
live nationally on NBC).
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the entire operation? Tishman Speyer's senior
managing director, Geoffrey Wharton, declined to reveal it. To do
so, he said, ``would be antithetical to the holiday spirit.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although a few white spruces and balsams have been mounted at
Rockefeller Center through the years, 90 percent of the holiday
trees have been Norway spruces, whose branches are full enough to
be festive and pliable enough to withstand being trussed for
travel. The trees, which usually grow about a foot per year, have
been as tall as 90 feet at the center (the minimum height
requirement is 65 feet).
</P>
<P>
   Murbach, who said he has looked at ``hundreds of thousands of
spruces'' during 15 years of arboreal questing, has become a bit of
a demographer and historical sociologist. Norway spruces aren't
found in forests _ since they are not native to the United States _
but rather on estates and near suburban and rural developments.
Often they were planted by European immigrants ``who wanted to be
reminded of home when they moved here earlier in the century,''
Murbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a suitable tree would have been identified
previously as a Rockefeller Center gonnabe, but the ice storm's
damage to potential candidates made this year's tree a
spur-of-the-moment find.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EVER since he was a small boy in a crumbling section of Chicago,
all Lou Rymkus thought about was football. Back in the 1930s, Lou
went to see all those stirring movies that starred Pat O'Brien, the
ones that usually ended with the alma mater booming in the
background and the theater audience sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he lived his dream. He played at Notre Dame, the
Shrine, where his coach, the distinguished Frank Leahy, always
called him Louis. He went on to a splendid career in the pros, as a
tackle who played both ways. He broke in with Washington, in the
heyday of Sammy Baugh. He had his best years with the Cleveland
Browns, where Paul Brown thought Big Lou all but invented the art
of pass blocking, keeping the wolves away from Otto Graham.
</P>
<P>
   He really wasn't cut out to do anything else except coach. For
one brief, shining moment he made it. He was hired by Bud Adams to
create the Houston Oilers and his team won the American Football
League's first championship. Lou was coach of the year and to
commemorate the honor he ordered a couple thousand drinking glasses
engraved with his likeness. He gave them to friends. He didn't
order nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired after five games the next season. Some said he
tried too hard to prove how tough he was and turned the players
against him. Some said he simply talked himself out of a job. No
one ever got up earlier, worked harder or talked football longer or
louder than Lou Rymkus.
</P>
<P>
   He embarked on an odyssey that led him to three teams as an
assistant coach, including the Oilers, to two scouting jobs, to a
semipro league and, once, to a high school in the tall pine and red
clay country of Louisiana. It was the kind of rural pea patch where
coaching careers begin, but rarely end.
</P>
<P>
   Lou taught three history classes, ran the summer rec program and
earned $9,200 a year. The team didn't win a game his only season.
The talent was thin because the boys who were big enough to play
had to go home to work on the farm. An enormous amount of pride had
to be gulped down, but Lou did it because this was all he ever
wanted to do _ coach football.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many cornball stories like it anymore, and the
other day the clock ran out on this one. Rymkus died of a massive
stroke and was buried Wednesday, two days short of his 79th
birthday. With him went another reminder of pro football's golden
days, and another big chunk of local color.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed him a few years ago in his apartment. It was like
walking through a museum. On his bookshelves were the collected
works of such renowned authors as Leahy, Vince Lombardi, Bear
Bryant and the former Chicago mayor, Richard Daley. There was a
well worn volume called ``We Remember Rockne.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an eye-catching photo on the wall that showed Rymkus,
then a howling, rawboned tackle with the Browns, leaving Soldier
Field with a police escort. He had been penalized three times
against the Bears that day for unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   Only Rymkus among the veterans paid attention to the Cleveland
rookies. After practice, he would invite five or six of them to a
bar where the owner gave away cigars to the players. ``As soon as
we got the cigars,'' recalled one of the rookies, a chap named Don
Shula, ``Lou would take them away from us and move to another
table.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough side of him was not an act; as a coach, he often
threatened to whip his players, and few doubted that he could. But
he had a goofy, sentimental streak, too. Once, in Houston, he
paused to tell the squad, ``If I'm ever standing at midfield and
have a heart attack, don't let me die there. Drag my body into the
end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   He was drinking in a hotel bar in Boston one night, before the
Oilers were to meet the Patriots, when the bartender announced the
last call. Lou reached out, grabbed him by the front of his shirt
and yanked him halfway across the counter. ``It can't be closing
time,'' he said, through clenched teeth, ``because I'm still
drinking.'' That night, the curfew was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960 Oilers were a cuddly band of rookies and rejects.
George Blanda, Wahoo McDaniel and Willard Dewveall were the best
known of the players who had served in the NFL. Then there were
candidates from schools not known as football factories: Dave Smith
from Ripon College, Al Jamison from Colgate, and Bill Groman, from
Heidelberg, which sounded like a good German beer. Billy Cannon,
the Heisman Trophy winner from LSU, was the only marquee name. But
Rymkus saved his affection for a couple of other Cajuns, Charley
Tolar and Charlie Hennigan, who made it the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   His pep talks were sometimes strange, but enduring. He once
exhorted his players ``to be like the Great Northern Buffalo, whose
coat is shaggy and whose muscles are strong. The Great Northern
Buffalo sticks his head into the wind and braves the cold, not like
the puny Southern Buffalo, who turns his back to the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Oilers had a clue what he was talking about, but Lou
loved the imagery. He swiped the speech from Leahy, who lectured
his 1941 team when the Irish grumbled about practicing in a
blizzard. That may have been the missing element, since it rarely
snows in Houston in August. But Notre Dame went on to an unbeaten
season in ``41, and Rymkus would be a fan of the Great Northern
Buffalo all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Lou himself more closely resembled a great elk, with his
prominent nose and a chin that seemed designed to shovel cement.
</P>
<P>
   Fate wasn't kind to Lou Rymkus, who had that one championship
season and then never another chance. One wasn't nearly enough, but
he clung to the memories. As one of Notre Dame's fighting
Lithuanians, Lou didn't mind sounding maudlin when he lost his
friend. So this toast is for him:
</P>
<P>
   Touchdowns in the sky, old-timer.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT is as if we are caught in the middle of a lost Seinfeld episode,
holding the remote control in one hand, the TV guide in the other,
with our emotions twisting in frustration like George after a dip
in chilling beach waters.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinkage!
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports in America have diminished to embarrassing
levels, particularly in Houston. It has become a terrifying dearth
of high-level entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a show about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are diversions everywhere and quick-hit weekend
interests. Sure, we like Kim Helton at Houston. We like the job Ken
Hatfield is doing at Rice. The Aeros are fun to watch. High school
football rules, as always. And thank the gods that Texas and Texas
A&AMP;M are marching toward a Thanksgiving-weekend showdown that truly
will mean something.
</P>
<P>
   But we are a big city with big demands and big hopes. We are
accustomed to the big leagues. We settle in after hard days at work
and want to enjoy our NFL Monday nights, our Astros playoff runs
and our championship-caliber Rockets teams.
</P>
<P>
   But today, we have nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We are stuck in the middle of yet another week during which, no
matter where we turn, everything we see is like Puddy in Elaine's
hands _ we know there's something better out there, but this is all
we've got.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's disastrous day of NBA negotiating only further
illustrated the spiraling ride we are on.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners and player representatives got together in hopes of
finding a way to compromise and get these supreme athletes back to
doing what they do best _ shooting jumpers. Instead, they fired
verbal darts and broke away. They left us searching for something
to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   There we were, like we've been for weeks now, flipping through
the channels and then flipping some more. We traveled deep into the
depths of our cable and DirecTV channels searching for something
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   We found someone on the Golf Channel talking about Nike Tour
greats, which no matter how many times he said it _ Nike Tour
greats _ never stopped sounding like a contradiction. We flipped
deeper down the dial.
</P>
<P>
   We found a highlight show of the European professional soccer
leagues, featuring some slick-haired team called Lazio. It held our
attention. Briefly.
</P>
<P>
   We flipped again and found some scraggly snowboarder who looked
like the last person we would want our daughters to date. He
flipped through giant culverts, slid everywhere, hoisted his
sagging pants smack in the middle of a run and then lifted a fat
trophy and said, ``Cool, man.'' No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   We switched over to Bill Dance reeling in another 9-pound
lunker, but then we angrily moved on when Dance had the nerve to
say, ``nice fish'' and toss it back into the pond. We'd give our
favorite crank bait for the chance to catch just one of those
babies. This guy's throwing it back like Patrick Ewing did the
latest multibillion dollar offer from the owners.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on again, to a 1970s rerun of the ``World's Strongest
Man'' competition. But then, we flipped away when a thick-haired
Brent Musburger went into a passionate call of the ``girl lift''
portion of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Where have our professional sports gone?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is bad. The NHL for many is foreign. When will the NBA
lockout end, the NFL grow some teeth and Astros spring training
begin?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was supposed to be the start of the Rockets' season of
redemption, a year that might not have promised another
championship but certainly would have had intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   With Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley leading the way, Rudy T
pushing the buttons and young and new talents injecting dynamism
into the plot, it was all supposed to start Wednesday. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke off bitterly; the lockout continued. And so, too,
did the show about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We sat there, frustrated. We wondered why David Duval could be
the PGA's leading money-winner with roughly $2.6 million in the
bank this year, but NBA players making an average of $2.6 million
say they can't survive.
</P>
<P>
   We stormed out the door and headed for our favorite sports bar,
where the beer's always cold, the Chex mix is always spicy and the
big screens never lie. Still, there was nothing to quench the
thirst.
</P>
<P>
   On one screen there was a Miss Fitness America pageant, on
another a talk show about Venus Williams and the Paris Open, on
another a teasing replay of a past NBA opener.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was the cruelest blow of all. The late-night sports
news show told us there was no end in sight for the NBA lockout.
All we could do was walk away from it all, go home and maybe even
catch up on some reading.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what did we do with that coffee-table book about coffee
tables?

GLENN NIELSON, 95, BUILDER OF OIL AND ASPHALT BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glenn E. Nielson, who built a petroleum and asphalt empire from
a single leased oilfield and a closed oil refinery it served in
Cody, Wyo., died on Oct. 19 at his home in Cody, according to
Margaret Ruth Bullock, his daughter. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson found partners to help him buy what was then called the
Park Refinery Co. in 1938, a year after its owner had asked him to
try to find a buyer. He then cajoled friends and local financiers
into giving him enough cash to run the operation. By 1952, he had
transformed it into the Husky Oil Co., a publicly traded company
with production in Canada and seven states and refineries churning
out gasoline and asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson went on to gain the nickname Asphalt for his tireless
efforts to expand use of the paving material in the United States
and Canada and a leading spokesman for regional oil companies in
the industry's trade organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he gained broader recognition as chairman of the
Business-Industry Political Action Committee, a business lobbying
group set up in 1963 to counter the influence of the Committee on
Political Education, then the political action arm of organized
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Husky had become Canada's largest producer of heavy oil from the
huge crude deposits in Saskatchewan and Alberta by 1977, when it
became the target of a bitter takeover battle pitting the
Occidental Petroleum Co. against Petro-Canada, which was owned by
the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   A third company, the Alberta Gas Trunk Line Company, finally
gained control in 1979 when Nielson sold his family's 20 percent
stake for more than $100 million. Nielson then retired to
concentrate on ranching and a range of philanthropic and Mormon
activities that maintained his place as one of Wyoming's most
prominent citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson was born on May 26, 1903, in Aetna, Alberta, the son of
James and Margaret Nielson, and grew up in Cardston, a Mormon
farming center in Alberta 15 miles north of the Montana border.
Nielson graduated from Raymond Agricultural College in Alberta in
1921 and then worked on his father's ranch before going on Mormon
missions in England and California from 1924 to 1927.
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed heavily to become a wheat farmer and rancher in 1929
but returned to school when prices plunged, working as a janitor
while completing a bachelor's degree in agriculture and economics
at the University of Alberta. After moving to Montana in 1935, he
worked as a ranch hand, truck driver, power-line rigger and oil
salesman before investing in the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson married Olive Wood in Cardston in 1928. In addition to
Mrs. Bullock, of Cody, he is survived by his wife; two other
daughters, Joanne Livingston of Atherton, Calif., and Anne Marie
Hales of Cheyenne, Wyo.; two sons, Glenn W. and James E. Nielson,
both of Cody, 35 grandchildren and 68 great-grandchildren. &QL;

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The day of decision has arrived for Moises Alou, who must tell the
Astros today whether he wants to remain with the club or would
prefer to be traded.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight at 11 CST is the deadline for the All-Star left fielder
to decide if he wants to exercise his option to demand a trade. If
he does, the Astros are likely to grant the request.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have been trying to reach an agreement on an
enhanced contract for Alou, who is due to be paid $5 million a year
for year of the next three season.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker still
believed there was a chance the 32-year-old outfielder would ask to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to find a way to resolve this,'' Hunsicker
said. ``We've been talking, and we'll continue to talk and try to
work through it. Right now, it's hard to say what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers avoided a similar situation with Jeff Shaw by
restructuring the reliever's contract on Wednesday so that Shaw
will remain with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Alou, who hit .312 with 38 home runs and 124 RBIs in 1998, and
Shaw gained the right to demand a trade because they were traded in
the first year of a multiyear contract. No player who has requested
such a trade has actually been dealt.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros choose to trade Alou, there probably won't be a
shortage of interested teams. The Giants, Braves, Mets and Red Sox
are looking for outfielders, and each would seem to be financially
able to absorb Alou's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Alou's contract contains a limited no-trade clause, meaning he
could designate six teams to which he would not accept a trade if
he follows through with the demand. If the Astros are unable to
trade Alou by March 15, 1999 _ an unlikely scenario _ he would
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   He also could request a trade now but drop the request at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation the Giants plan to inquire about Alou
and Derek Bell, who also is under contract. Alou attended Canada
College in the Bay Area and presumably would accept a trade to the
Giants, who expressed some interest in him last season before the
Astros acquired him from the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Today also is the last day the Astros will have exclusive
negotiating rights with their free agents _ Randy Johnson, Sean
Berry, Tim Bogar and Mike Magnante. The club already has told
Magnante it will not make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   There were no new developments regarding Johnson or Bogar, but
negotiations are under way between Hunsicker and Rick Thurman, the
agent for Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman said he didn't expect anything to happen over the next
two days, but Berry is holding out hope an agreement can be reached
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know something as soon as possible,'' Berry said
while packing for the trip back to his offseason home in Southern
California. ``There's no question I'd like to finish my career
here. I'm leaning toward staying, but we'll have to see where it
goes from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson continues to entertain suitors at his
Phoenix-area home. The Astros, Diamondbacks and Rangers already
have visited him, and the Dodgers, Angels and Yankees could get
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Astros are the only team with an offer on the table,
but that surely will change after today, when other teams
officially can make their monetary proposals to the Big Unit.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
LOUISVILLE _ Skip Away has dominated America's thoroughbred racing
scene this year. But he's the second choice in the morning line for
Saturday's Breeders' Cup Classic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Battaglia, track handicapper for Churchill Downs, made
Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner, an 8-5 favorite, with
Skip Away 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to make them co-favorites,'' Battaglia said, ``but
I'm giving Silver Charm the slight edge.''
</P>
<P>
   In this week's National Thoroughbred Racing Association poll of
racing media, Skip Away was named No. 1 on 20 ballots with Silver
Charm drawing three votes. No other horse received first-place
mention.
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Away has raced here only once, and it was the worst
performance of his career: 12th in the 1996 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about being picked to lose, Skip Away's
trainer Sonny Hine said, ``I was a little surprised, but it doesn't
bother me. We'll be Horse of the Year when it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine added: ``If he handles the track, I have no concern. I
sometimes think he doesn't like the track.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hine also pointed out circumstances at the Derby that had
nothing to do with the horse not liking the course. ``Skippy
stopped eating three days before the race,'' he said. ``We were
here too long, and he became uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine also suspected his horse was disturbed by a severe
thunderstorm the night before the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's post-position draw at the Galt House hotel, Skip
Away came out with No. 6 in the 10-horse field. ``I'm very pleased
with the post,'' Hine said.
</P>
<P>
   He is happy that Silver Charm and the speedy Gentlemen are both
outside, at Nos. 8 and 10, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   With a relatively small field, post position for the 1\-mile
race is not expected to be a major factor. But an inside start
minimizes the chance of a horse being pushed wide on the first
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm's trainer, Bob Baffert, said, ``I think we got a
bad hole. Skip Away's gotta go to the front. Gentlemen probably
will try to lay off. He likes to run up close, but from the
10-hole, he will have to make a move. There will be a lot of
jockeying going into the first turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen was pre-entered for both the Classic and the Breeders'
Cup Mile. On Wednesday morning his owner, R.D. Hubbard, announced
he was going for the longer race with the bigger prize _ a purse of
$5.12 million that makes the Classic the richest horse race ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Gentlemen in there to make sure there's an honest
pace,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Hine said, ``I think he hopes Gentlemen will run with me and try
to kill me off.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened at the Jockey Gold Cup in New York last month,
when Gentlemen dueled Skip Away, tiring out both horses and setting
up a win by 34-1 long shot Wagon Limit.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mandella, trainer of Gentlemen, said, ``The last time, we
worried too much about beating Skip Away. We won the battle and
lost the war. My horse was running with blinkers for the first
time; he's had time to get used to them, and maybe we can stalk.
There should be plenty of pace, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   A torrid pace could help the stretch-running Victory Gallop, the
Belmont champion who drew the No. 1 post for Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, owned by Jack, J.R. and Art Preston of The
Woodlands, has had a two-month layoff recovering from throat
surgery, and his odds were listed at 15-1. ``I think Victory Gallop
will be picking up some pieces late,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Many horsemen are saying this is the deepest field in the
15-year history of the Breeders' Cup. Mandella said, ``I don't know
when so many horses have come into a race like this in such good
form.''

B.J. DWYER, NEW JERSEY CONGRESSMAN, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard James Dwyer, a former representative from New Jersey,
died Saturday in Edison, N.J., at the John F. Kennedy Medical
Center, which he had served as a trustee. He was 77 and, a longtime
Edison resident, had lived in Metuchen, N.J., for the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer, a Democrat, spent six terms in the House of
Representatives, from 1981 until his retirement in 1993. He rarely
spoke from the floor but was known as a legislative tactician whose
work behind the scenes on the powerful Appropriations Committee
substantially benefited his state and its institutions, like
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer relinquished his position as Senate majority leader in
Trenton to move up to the House. His experience in the state
legislature as chairman of its Joint Appropriations Committee
gained him a place on the same panel in Washington, a rare
distinction for a congressional freshman. He remained at
Appropriations until he left Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he was the New Jersey campaign chairman for Jimmy
Carter's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer is survived by a daughter, Pamela Stockton of Harrison,
N.Y.; a sister, Bernice Dwyer of Edison, and two grandchildren. His
wife, Lilyan Sudzina Dwyer, died in 1993.

STARGAZING, AS IT WERE, ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As usual, the people walking up Broadway stared
suspiciously at Tom McIntyre and his ``Sidewalk Astronomy'' sign.
They knew the basic street hustles _ fake Rolexes, bogus cashmere,
counterfeit videos, stolen books, rigged monte games _ and they had
heard the old stories about guys selling a bridge. But selling the
sky?
</P>
<P>
   ``The rings of Saturn!'' McIntyre called out. ``Jupiter and four
of its moons! The moon is the closest it'll be all year. Take a
look! You won't believe this drop-dead gorgeous moon!''
</P>
<P>
   No, they wouldn't believe it, not even after they saw it through
McIntyre's telescope. Laura Fisher, an antiques dealer on her way
home from a reception and dinner, stopped to take a peek through
the eyepiece of the 3{-inch cylinder. She was standing under a
street light on the corner of 65th and Broadway, looking at a moon
magnified 50 times high above the Empire Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy cow!'' she said. ``My God! You're making this up. Do you
have some kind of white disc hidden inside here?''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre did not feel insulted. ``They always think I've got a
slide hidden in the back,'' he said. ``One woman wouldn't believe
it was a real telescope until I pointed it across the street at the
`Don't Walk' sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fisher was convinced after perusing the Sea of Tranquillity
and Jupiter's moons. She put a dollar into the envelope marked
``Donations'' and stood on the corner smiling, which is what just
about everyone does after using McIntyre's telescope. ``It's
absolutely enchanting,'' she said. ``This is what makes New York
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy, of course, has traditionally not been one of New
York's strengths. Manhattan is probably the worst place in the
world for it. Stargazing is problematic in any place with bright
lights, but it becomes especially difficult when the stars are
situated behind tall buildings, which is why New Yorkers with
telescopes are generally suspected of using them to look at their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But there a few high-minded owners of telescopes. McIntyre, who
is 61 years old and spends days working as a building construction
manager, picked up astronomy as the leader of his sons' Boy Scout
troop in Eastchester. After getting divorced and moving to the
Upper East Side, he looked up and saw a show waiting to be
marketed. He settled this summer at 65th and Broadway because the
corner has two crucial features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above Lincoln Center, you've got a wonderful expanse of open
sky right in the path of the ecliptic,'' he said, referring to the
route traversed by the moon and the planets. ``And there's a
tremendous amount of street traffic at night. I love letting people
look 800 million miles into space from the sidewalks of New York.
As Albert Einstein and Carl Sagan said, those of us with knowledge
of science should share with those who don't have a clue. If I get
a few bucks for it, that's fine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. McIntyre goes out whenever the skies are clear and
interesting, and this has been a busy week. On Tuesday evening, the
moon was at its closest point of the year to Earth _
``Perihelion!'' as proclaimed on one of McIntyre's signs, along
with ``One Night Only'' and ``Don't Miss It!''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre provided maps to help locate the sights, like the sea
where Neil Armstrong landed, and he kept his students busy with
quizzes. As they were oohing at Saturn's rings _ which were
variously deemed ``cute'' and ``so cool'' _ he demanded to know the
distance to the planet, and hummed the theme song of ``Jeopardy''
until they came up with a guess better than ``really far.''
</P>
<P>
   He attracted a motley crowd, from young street people to elderly
patrons on the way from the Metropolitan Opera. At one point a
composer, two tax lawyers, a student, a consultant and a man who
described himself simply as homeless were all trying to figure out
how long it took Saturn's light to travel the 800 million miles to
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless man, the only one who knew the speed of light
(186,000 miles per second), came closest to the right answer: about
an hour and 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed that this gave them a new perspective on their
lives and their city. ``It makes the problems of the day seem kind
of trivial,'' one of the tax lawyers said. Meanwhile, the passing
pedestrians were staring more suspiciously than ever. Why were
these New Yorkers all standing around smiling?
